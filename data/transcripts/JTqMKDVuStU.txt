[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   We come this evening in our consideration of this great epistle to the Romans to the
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:17.720]   twelfth verse in the fifth chapter, where we meet with the word "querefor," or, if
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.360]   you prefer it, "therefore."
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:31.840]   Now this is the beginning of a new section, or at any rate we can safely call it the beginning
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.920]   of a new subsection.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.040]   I hold the view that the section rarely began at the first verse in the fifth chapter, as
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.640]   we've been seeing together.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:53.200]   But the apostle rounded off what he was anxious to say at the end of verse eleven, what we
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.040]   were considering last week.
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:04.680]   Here now he takes up a fresh aspect and he introduces it with the word "querefor."
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.920]   But as I hope to show you this evening, it is a very important point of transition.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.400]   And therefore you will find probably this evening that we shall spend most of our time
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.040]   in considering this word "querefor."
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.360]   Indeed we are bound to do so.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.600]   Let me make it quite plain and clear before we go any further that I shall probably have
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.520]   to ask you and to call upon you to do a good deal of thinking.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.480]   The text that's in my mind at the moment is "gird up the loins of your mind," because
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:51.460]   we have a necessity to spend our time tonight with what I would call the mechanics of interpretation.
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.960]   Now we've got to do that because without doing that we shall not be able to appreciate as
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.720]   we ought the real riches of this section, which we are going to consider.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:11.560]   The section starts here at verse twelve and goes on to the end of the chapter, verse twenty-one.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.240]   Now for a number of Friday evenings we've been reveling and enjoying ourselves in the
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.400]   section ending at verse eleven.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.280]   At least I'm speaking for myself and I feel sure I'm speaking for most of you.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.640]   That kind of thing is sure enjoyment.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.560]   Now you can't always have that.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.600]   Try to have enjoyment, but in order to have true enjoyment you must have some substance.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.520]   You can't live on enjoyment.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.660]   You can't really have a living and a functioning body without a skeleton.
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.680]   So you must start with a skeleton.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.880]   You can't put up a building without having a scaffolding first.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.280]   The scaffolding is absolutely essential.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.440]   You can't live on sweets.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.120]   You've got to have solid food as well.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.840]   Now then, all this is by way of introduction to the consideration, as I say, of this word
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.840]   "wherefore."
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.320]   In other words, we are immediately up against this great question.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.800]   What does the "wherefore" really do?
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.440]   What's the apostle saying here?
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.200]   Why does he say it?
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.920]   And why does he start saying it with the word "wherefore," which, as I say, can also be
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.480]   taken, if you like, as "therefore."
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:42.480]   Now this has been a problem that has perplexed not only the ordinary readers of the Bible,
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.440]   but those who have set up as commentators on this great epistle to the Romans.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:56.480]   And there's been a good deal of disagreement and a good deal of argument and of disputation.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.080]   Well somebody may say to me, "Does it matter?
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.880]   Why not get on with it?
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.840]   Why not go on to what he actually says?
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.560]   Why bother to notice the connection?"
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:12.120]   Well, I think I'll be able to show you that the connection is really most important.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.360]   You don't really understand these great epistles unless you understand the way the mind of
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:22.600]   the apostle works, and why he says a thing where he says it and when he says it, and
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.440]   not at some other point.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.440]   In any case, it's surely unintelligent to meet a word like this "wherefore" and just
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.440]   live over it.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.880]   When a man says "wherefore," he's got a reason for doing so.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.920]   He wouldn't have used the word otherwise.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:43.280]   And it's really insulting to the author whom we are reading if we don't ask questions.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.880]   Now let me make this point in passing.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.220]   Let me give this little bit of instruction with regard to a method of reading the Bible.
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:59.400]   If you really want to enjoy your reading and studying of the Bible, always ask it questions.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:05.480]   And so when a man like this comes to you and says "wherefore," you say to him, "Well,
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.880]   why do you say 'wherefore'?
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.880]   What's your purpose?
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.880]   What's your object?
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.880]   What's your reason here?"
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:18.120]   Now then, it's just there, you see, that we've had these differing views.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.600]   Some say that the apostle, from this twelfth verse to the end of the chapter, is just giving
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.160]   us a kind of epilogue to what he's already been saying.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.640]   He's been outlining this great doctrine of his, of justification by faith only, since
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.200]   the twenty-first verse of the third chapter, Romans 3, 21.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.280]   You remember it, where he began by saying "but now," and then brought in his mighty
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.280]   doctrine.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.960]   They say, "Well, he stated it all.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.720]   He stated the doctrine to the end of chapter four, and then in chapter five, verses one
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.120]   to eleven, he's been drawing deductions out of it.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.360]   And now, he just sort of, in an epilogue, sums it all up."
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.360]   It's nothing, they say, but a kind of epilogue to what has gone before.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:11.040]   Well, I mention these views for you to see how people have attempted to interpret the
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.040]   "wherefore."
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.840]   I'll show you that, in my opinion at any rate, that is a completely inadequate explanation
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.840]   of the "wherefore."
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.520]   Others say, "No, it isn't that.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:34.280]   It's really that he just introduces this subject about Adam, and our relationship to
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:40.360]   Adam and a sort of comparison between Adam and the Lord Jesus Christ, just because it
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.200]   occurred to him as being a matter of interest, so he puts it in, as it were, as a kind of
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:52.440]   parenthesis between his doctrine of justification, which ends in chapter five, verse eleven,
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.840]   and his doctrine of sanctification, which starts in the first verse of chapter six.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:04.800]   So they say this is a sort of parenthesis, which is quite unimportant in itself, and
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:12.280]   here they say that the "wherefore" is really just a word of transition.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:18.080]   Not in and of itself, no real connection with what went before or with what's going to follow,
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:24.640]   but just something which he puts in at that particular point in his letter, an unimportant
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.760]   parenthesis.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.040]   Then another view, which I must mention by name because I've no doubt that many of you
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:39.040]   use the Scofield Bible so-called, and you will find that the Scofield Bible says that
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:45.680]   this is the meaning of the "wherefore," that it refers back to the third chapter, verses
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:54.880]   nineteen to twenty-three, and is to be regarded as a continuation of the discussion on the
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:01.640]   universality of sin, which we have in chapter three, verses nineteen to twenty-three, and
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:10.360]   which, notice the word, was interrupted by the passage on justification and its results.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.760]   That's what the Scofield Bible suggests is happening here, that the apostle was describing
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:20.320]   the universality of sin in, he'd been doing it in chapters two and three, and here he
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:27.120]   states it in chapter three, nineteen to twenty-three, but then they say he interrupted that by bringing
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.040]   in the doctrine of justification, here he goes back to it and takes it up and shows
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.800]   the universality of sin again.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:41.480]   They say that in addition to that, and they've got a big heading here, that the apostle starts
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:48.680]   his doctrine of sanctification at this point, that here begins the doctrine of sanctification,
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:54.200]   which goes on until the eighth chapter, the thirteenth verse, and their heading is "in
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:59.520]   dwelling sin and the gospel remedy."
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.400]   Well now, it seems to me that that is a thoroughly bad analysis.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:08.640]   Sorry to have to say it, but it seems to me that it's got to be said.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:17.040]   To start with, it doesn't seem to realize the significance of Romans 3, 21, the "but
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.320]   now."
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:23.440]   What they call the interruption about justification doesn't start at verse twenty-four, it starts
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:29.600]   at verse twenty-one, and far from being a kind of interruption, everything that he'd
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.160]   been saying was leading up to that.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.520]   He's shown the universality of sin in the second half of chapter one, chapter two, and
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.480]   chapter three, up to the end of verse twenty.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.240]   Now he brings in his glorious gospel.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.080]   There's no interruption.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.720]   And a returning to a theme, that isn't what's happening here at all.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:55.000]   So that seems to me to do a grave injustice to the third chapter, and the fourth, and
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:02.440]   the first part of the fifth, and completely misses the point here, because here the apostle
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:07.680]   is not suddenly introducing a doctrine of sanctification.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:13.880]   He is, as I'm hoping to show you, doing something which is very different indeed.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:21.480]   You see the danger of having your classifications, and of separating justification and sanctification,
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:28.240]   and having it all in that mechanical way, and imposing it upon the actual letter as
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.240]   written by the apostle.
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.880]   That, therefore, you see, that exposition, doesn't really explain this wherefore at
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.140]   all.
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.600]   It leaves the wherefore in mid-air.
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:44.760]   It's just an unimportant word of conjunction, which has no real relevance or meaning.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.280]   The only other view I want to mention is that of the great Charles Hodge, to whom I've
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.360]   already referred.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:11:00.480]   He says that this is introduced here as an illustration of the doctrine of justification,
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.920]   and he seems to confine it to that.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:08.120]   Now I'm prepared to agree that it is an illustration of the doctrine of justification,
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:15.400]   but I protest strongly and fervently at the suggestion that it doesn't go beyond that.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:20.680]   I think it goes greatly beyond that, to something which is glorious.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.800]   Charles Hodge, in his commentary, of course, brings in this other matter, but he doesn't
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.800]   seem to see that this is the meaning of the wherefore.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.440]   That is why exactly the apostle used his wherefore.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:38.400]   You mustn't confine it to justification, because it goes well beyond it.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.400]   Very well.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:44.280]   Let us now then ask the question, what is this therefore?
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:51.640]   What was it that made the apostle introduce this whole section here about Adam, and this
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:12:00.240]   comparison between Adam and the Lord Jesus Christ, and our relationship to the two?
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.640]   Why did he do it, and why did he do it at this particular point?
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.720]   Now those are the questions to ask.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.560]   Imagine yourself saying that to the apostle.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:14.440]   You suddenly come across this wherefore, and you read this section, and now you go back
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:20.080]   to him and say, "Now, why, Paul, do you suddenly do this?
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.120]   What's your reason for doing it?
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:27.840]   And why do you do it here, at this particular point?
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:34.000]   Has this section any relevance to the whole argument of the epistle to the Romans?
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.760]   And if it has, what is it?
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:45.480]   Does this section follow naturally from what he's just been saying, or is it an entirely
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.480]   new departure?"
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.440]   Those are the questions.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.920]   Has this an intimate connection with what has gone before, or is he really taking up
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.640]   an entirely new subject, a new departure?
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.920]   And one final question.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:11.080]   If this does follow on from what he's been saying before, does it follow on in a general
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:19.440]   way from the whole argument of what has gone before, or has it some immediate connection
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.480]   with what he's just been saying?
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.840]   Now, those both, you see, are possibilities.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:29.440]   You can say that the apostle here, having finished his great exposition of justification
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:36.360]   by faith and its consequences, draws now some big result from it.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:43.720]   Or you can say, "Well, yes, he may have done that, but hasn't he also got some closer connection
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:50.080]   with what he's been saying in the immediate past, towards the end of these first eleven
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.040]   verses of the fifth chapter?"
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:14:02.280]   Well now, for me to be positive, I'm suggesting that he does both of those things.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:08.880]   That in these verses, from verse twelve to verse twenty-one in the fifth chapter, he
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:17.000]   has got an immediate connection with the immediate past, and at the same time, he has a connection
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.320]   with the whole of what he's been saying from the sixteenth verse in the first chapter.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:28.440]   Now then, let me try and put this to you.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:36.640]   The wherefore, in other words, must be given its due weight.
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:43.480]   This apostle Paul, as we've had occasion for seeing now many, many times, had a most logical
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.680]   mind.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:51.200]   He generally moves from step to step and stage to stage.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:57.640]   There is always a skeleton, a scheme, a definite structure about all his letters.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.960]   The apostle Paul, if you like, didn't write letters like some of us tend to do.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.360]   We think of something to say and we say it.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.560]   And then we say, "Now is there anything else I can say?"
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.840]   And we put that in.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.680]   Paul didn't write letters like that.
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.560]   That's not his method at all.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.200]   The man had a most logical mind.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.200]   It was a clear mind.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:25.920]   He's always developing a big case, and he goes on from step to step and stage to stage.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:32.260]   Often, as we'll see here in this very section, he seems to fly off at a tangent because something
[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.680]   draws him out, but he always comes back.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:42.040]   And he goes on steadily with his argument and marshals his evidence and unfolds his
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.580]   great case.
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:49.680]   He doesn't just throw things out at random without any connection between them.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:53.480]   I do trust I'm making this point plain.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:57.040]   You know, preachers differ in that respect too.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:03.320]   There are some preachers who may be very good preachers and who may be very helpful preachers,
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:08.200]   but it's extremely difficult to see a line in what they say.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:13.200]   They make a number of remarks, all of which are excellent and very profitable, but you
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:18.200]   don't always see where they got them from or why they said them at that particular point.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:23.040]   It may be that they were primarily poets and they thought in pictures.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.040]   You can't follow them.
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.880]   You can't see the scheme and the order and the arrangement.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.000]   Other preachers are logical.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   They have an introduction.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.040]   It introduces point one, that leads to point two, and that leads to point three, then conclusion.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:40.720]   Now, the apostle certainly belongs to the second class and the second order.
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.360]   Now then, let me show you what I believe he was doing here.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.000]   "Wherefore," he says.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.880]   Well, now why does he say it?
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:56.000]   Well, I'm suggesting that the key is to be found in one little word at the end of verse
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.080]   10.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:03.240]   I did just direct attention to this when we were considering the tenth verse.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.920]   I told you then that I would make use of it later on.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.320]   I'm now doing so.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.240]   Let me read to you verse 10 again.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:18.160]   "For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:30.640]   being reconciled, we shall be saved," I'm reading this authorized version, "by his life."
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:39.160]   Now the word is the word "by," and it shouldn't have been translated as "by."
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:48.000]   It should have been translated like this, "Much more being reconciled, we shall be saved
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.400]   in his life."
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.160]   That was the word the apostle actually used.
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.520]   The Greek word means "in."
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.320]   It doesn't mean "by."
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.280]   What means "by" is a different word.
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:04.960]   He used that different word in the ninth verse, where he says, "We shall be saved from wrath
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.680]   through him," or "by him."
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:16.760]   Here it should read, "Much more being reconciled, we shall be saved in his life."
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:22.600]   Now the revised version, "margin," translates it like this.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:27.200]   It puts in the margin, "in his life."
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:35.480]   Arthur S. Way, who has a very good translation of these epistles, he translates it also as
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.000]   "in his life."
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.040]   J. M. Darby, in his excellent translation of the Bible, actually puts it like this,
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:48.600]   "in," and then in brackets, "the power of his life."
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.600]   And it's quite right.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.960]   That's exactly what it means.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:57.560]   The word "in," you see, means "in the sphere of," or "in the realm of," or "in connection
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.960]   with his life."
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:04.520]   J. B. Phillips, whose translation is very popular, but in my opinion isn't really a
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:10.760]   translation but more a paraphrase and often an interpretation, with which I find myself
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.160]   often in disagreement.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:18.760]   Here, however, I find it's quite suggestive, but that again it's more than a translation.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.400]   He puts it like this.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:28.400]   He says, "Being reconciled, we may be perfectly certain of our salvation through his living
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.400]   in us."
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:35.400]   Now, I don't think it means that for a moment, but it does mean our being in him.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:40.400]   But yet, in a way, he's got the right kind of idea, that there is this intimate connection
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.280]   between Christ and ourselves.
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:48.000]   We're not merely being saved by his life, we are being saved in his life.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.680]   Now then, let me see how I use that in order to show the meaning of the "wherefore."
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:59.320]   You see, there in the tenth verse, the apostle is saying this—he's already hinted at it
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:06.320]   in the ninth—that we are not merely forgiven in Christ.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.880]   That the work of the Lord Jesus Christ on our behalf doesn't merely procure our pardon
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:16.920]   and our forgiveness, it goes much beyond that.
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.040]   We are in Christ.
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.520]   That's God's way of saving us.
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:27.000]   It isn't merely something external, that Christ—it is that, of course, primarily.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.880]   It is his righteousness imputed to us, but he says more than that.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:37.200]   This reconciliation not only leads to the forgiveness of sins and the declaration that
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:43.280]   we are forgiven and that God regards us as righteous, it goes beyond that.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.120]   It puts us into Christ.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.440]   We shall be saved in his life.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:55.040]   If by his death he's been enabled to deliver us from the wrath of God and the punishment
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:02.000]   of our sins, why, being linked to him by his life, he's going to save us from everything?
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.200]   Wasn't that the argument of verse ten?
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.640]   Let me read it again to you.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:12.320]   If when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:16.440]   being reconciled, we shall be saved in his life.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.160]   Don't you see the converse?
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.640]   We've worked it out together.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:25.600]   This life he is now living, and we are in him, therefore nothing can ever separate us
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.600]   from him.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:31.480]   That's the whole of the argument, the finality of our salvation.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:38.160]   Now then, I would therefore suggest that verse twelve comes in in this way.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:44.920]   We are now in the life of Christ.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:53.360]   "Indeed," says the apostle, and this is my understanding of the wherefore, "Indeed, we
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:22:04.140]   are in the same relationship to Christ now as we were before our salvation to Adam."
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:08.060]   You see, therefore, the connection and where the wherefore comes in.
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:12.560]   You see, he's used this expression of our being in Christ.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:16.200]   Very well, he seems to say, this is the position.
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.200]   This is the thing I want to put to you now.
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:26.600]   We are indeed as secure and as safe as this, that we are in Christ as formerly we were
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:30.660]   in Adam.
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:38.240]   He had already emphasized there in verse ten, this our relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:43.360]   in order to show the certainty and the finality of our salvation.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.640]   He's still doing that.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.720]   We'll see as we work out these verses how that's the thing he really wants to say the
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:50.720]   whole time.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.920]   Much more, he keeps on saying, we are absolutely safe.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.600]   We are in this life of Christ.
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.500]   We are going to reign in life.
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:58.680]   Nothing can ever stop it.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:04.200]   Yes, that's what he still wants to say.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:14.400]   But this comparison to our relationship to Adam also helps to bring out that truth and
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:20.960]   at the same time helps to illustrate, as Charles Odd says very rightly, the truth about our
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:28.660]   justification by faith and the imputation of Christ's righteousness to us.
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:35.720]   In other words, I am bold enough to suggest and to assert, and at this point I do find
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:43.920]   myself in the most hearty agreement with a great modern Swedish Lutheran theologian called
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.360]   Nigrin.
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:51.040]   I agree absolutely that what we are looking at now from verse twelve to the end of this
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:56.480]   chapter is the very heart and center of the epistle to the Romans.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:01.520]   Alas, I differ in detail here and there with Nigrin, but as to this point I am with him
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.240]   a hundred percent.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:08.440]   This is, if you like, the very heart of the whole epistle in this way.
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.760]   Let me divide it up for you.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:19.720]   First of all, it is a kind of summary or summing up of all that has gone before.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:23.560]   He simply states it all here in a new way.
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:28.840]   But it is not only that; it is not only a summary of all that has gone before, it is
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:34.600]   the beginning of most of what he is yet going to say, right away through to the end of chapter
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.240]   eight.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:41.600]   It is, therefore, a most important section of the whole epistle.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.600]   Let me show you.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.640]   Take this first thing first.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:51.560]   It is a summary, I say, of everything that he has been saying.
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:59.280]   I believe it goes right back to the first chapter, verses 16, 17, and 18.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.280]   You remember.
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:05.720]   There the apostle tells these Romans what he is really going to write about.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:10.000]   He has been telling them before that, how he is longing to see them, how he longs to
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.720]   be with them, that he has got a good deal to tell them.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.560]   He has never met them yet.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.040]   He is just writing a letter to them.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.040]   He has heard about them.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.280]   He is hoping to come.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:22.640]   But he says, "Until I come, let me tell you what my message really is."
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.640]   And here it is.
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:31.800]   "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:37.200]   to every one that believeth, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:41.520]   For herein is the righteousness from God revealed from faith to faith.
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.840]   As it is written, 'The just shall live by faith.'
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:53.360]   For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:57.240]   of men that hold down the truth in unrighteousness."
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.800]   That is the original statement.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.720]   Then you see, we have been following him.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:06.880]   He has proved that the wrath of God is upon the Gentiles and upon the Jews.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.880]   It is upon everybody.
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:14.000]   But he says, "Thank God I have got this new message, which is that God has done something
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.480]   new in Jesus Christ to deliver us from under that wrath and give us this new righteousness."
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:26.920]   And you remember, he has worked it out in all that we have been considering hitherto.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.960]   And having done so, he now, you see, puts it like this.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:39.080]   "Yes," he seems to say, "I have been showing you how the whole world was under the wrath
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.080]   of God.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:46.800]   But how is it that the whole world is under the wrath of God?
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.600]   What has happened to mankind that it should be in that terrible condition?
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:27:00.280]   Why should mankind be suffering under the wrath of God in the way that we have seen?"
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:07.360]   And his answer is this, "It is all because of what happened in Adam."
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:11.560]   And that is what he is going to tell us about in this section.
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.840]   So you see, he is taking up the great theme.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:20.320]   The great theme is this, "Mankind fallen under the wrath of God.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.600]   Jesus Christ coming to save and to lift us up."
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:28.440]   But very well, someone may ask, "Why has the whole of mankind fallen and down there
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.440]   in sin and under the wrath of God?"
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:37.320]   And the answer is, "It is because of Adam and what happened in Adam and our relationship
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.320]   to Adam.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:47.920]   In Adam we are all lost, but in Christ we are redeemed."
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:51.920]   Very well then, that is the thing that he goes on here to talk about, and therefore
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:57.080]   he was very justified in saying, "Wherefore."
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.680]   Very well, let us put it like this.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:08.880]   There is his main idea, but I think he has got a kind of subsidiary idea.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:17.880]   People found it very difficult, as they still do, to believe in this doctrine of the imputing
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:21.040]   of the righteousness of Christ to us.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:27.640]   People still stumble, as they did then, about this doctrine of justification by faith only.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:31.320]   You see, we all will keep on thinking that we have got to save ourselves and that if
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:36.200]   we live a good life, that we will make ourselves Christians, that we will build up our righteousness.
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.840]   That is all wrong.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:38.840]   No, no.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:43.400]   We receive as a free gift the righteousness of God in Jesus Christ.
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.220]   Now the Jews found it very difficult to accept that.
[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:47.840]   So did the Gentiles.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.360]   People still do, as I say.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:58.200]   Now the apostle says, "Listen, why do you stumble at this question of a righteousness
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:03.680]   of Jesus Christ being put to our account, being imputed to us?
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:11.840]   Can't you see," he says, "that this whole idea of imputation was already involved in
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.920]   our relationship to Adam?
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:21.320]   It has been the condition of the whole of the human race from the very fall of Adam
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.120]   until now."
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:32.280]   In other words, he says, "God has always dealt with mankind through a head and a representative."
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:38.360]   The whole story of the human race is just this.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:46.440]   What happened to us in Adam, what happens to us in Christ.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.840]   That is the whole story of the human race.
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:53.520]   Now I often put it like this from this pulpit.
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:58.440]   I invite people to consider the state of the world tonight.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.920]   We know what it is, don't we?
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.680]   Read your newspapers.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:09.880]   There you will read about armaments, atomic bombs, preparation for war.
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.880]   What is going to happen?
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.040]   Will there be a third world war?
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:21.680]   Then all the misery of the moral breakdown, thieving, robbery, murders, divorce, separation,
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:28.000]   fornication, all these things, all the modern mess that the whole world is in.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.760]   It is about time we ask this question.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.440]   Why is it like that?
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.240]   Why is the world as it is?
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.640]   And it has always been like that.
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.240]   The history books tell us it has always been like that.
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.800]   The world is no different from what it has always been.
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.920]   Well, why is the world like this?
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.080]   By here Paul is answering the question.
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.160]   It all, he says, results from Adam.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:57.300]   It is all tied up and linked up with what Adam did and our relationship to Adam.
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.920]   So it is tremendously important.
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:01.640]   There is one half of the story of mankind.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.960]   But here is the Christian church.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.000]   Here are Christian people.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.960]   Here are people who are different.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:11.960]   Something has happened to them.
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.320]   They have been born again.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.280]   They seem to be new creatures.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.240]   They have found a new joy and happiness.
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:22.560]   They know God as their Father and they are being delivered from the tyranny of sin.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:23.640]   What has happened to these?
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:28.280]   The answer is, it is Christ and their relationship to Christ.
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:31.160]   That is the whole history of humanity.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.560]   It is the whole history of redemption.
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:37.080]   Our relationship to Adam, our relationship to Christ.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:41.160]   Here Paul puts it in one great paragraph.
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:46.080]   That is the way in which he summarizes all he has been saying.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.320]   He has taken us through it in great detail, but now he puts it in this new way.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.200]   He had not mentioned Adam before.
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:57.200]   He is simply proving that the whole of the Gentiles were down in sin and under the wrath
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.520]   of God and likewise the Jews.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.880]   But he had not told us so far how they ever got there.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:06.880]   Now he tells us it was their relationship to Adam that did it.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.720]   Then he has been describing positively this glorious salvation.
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.960]   And he has told us that it is through the blood of Christ and the death of Christ.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:16.000]   But here he says, it is more than that.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   We are in him.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.600]   It is our relationship to Christ.
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:25.080]   So you see, it is directly continuing both in general and in particular what he has been
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.440]   saying before.
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:33.400]   But secondly, I said that it is not merely a summary of the past, but that it goes beyond
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.880]   that.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:42.320]   And that through this little word "in," in the life of Christ in verse 10, he introduces
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:50.800]   us to this marvelous, wonderful doctrine of our union with Christ and our relationship
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.800]   to him.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:53.800]   And what he says is this.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.280]   It is a very wonderful way of putting it.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:06.560]   He says, you know, our old relationship to Adam is a very wonderful picture of our new
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:07.920]   relationship to Christ.
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:12.680]   Indeed, he puts it in a phrase in verse 14 absolutely perfectly.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.080]   Have you ever noticed it?
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:18.480]   Nevertheless, he says, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:27.160]   sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who, Adam, is the figure of him that was to
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.160]   come.
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:32.720]   Adam, he says, is a wonderful figure of Christ.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.840]   Adam is a marvelous type of Christ.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:39.080]   Understand Adam and in a sense you will begin to understand Christ.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:45.560]   The relationship of mankind to Adam is a picture of the relationship of the redeemed to the
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.480]   Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.560]   Adam is a figure of Christ.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:55.200]   Indeed, in writing to the Corinthians in his first epistle in chapter 15, he actually uses
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.560]   these terms.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:01.160]   He says, Christ is the last Adam.
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:04.180]   That is 1 Corinthians 15, verse 45.
[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:11.440]   He calls him the last Adam and then in verse 47 he calls him the second man.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:15.280]   Adam was the first man, Christ is the second man.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:19.760]   Adam was the first Adam, Christ is the last Adam.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:23.880]   Only two great heads to the human race, Adam and Christ.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.640]   There will never be another.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:29.640]   And we are every one of us either in Adam or else we are in Christ.
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:32.680]   Now that is how he brings it in, you see.
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:41.520]   The Lord Jesus Christ, he would have us understand, is the head of a new humanity.
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.440]   There is a new race of men.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:51.680]   He is the firstborn, as he says later on in chapter 8, of many brethren.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:55.400]   Indeed, Christ has introduced a new age.
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:35:00.640]   He has introduced a new kingdom, a new order altogether.
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:07.760]   What he wants us to see is this, that as Christians we are not merely forgiven, we have become
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:11.920]   members of the family of God.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:17.400]   We are in Christ and because we are in Christ we are in God as it were.
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.240]   We are members of the household of God.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:25.480]   God is our Father in a new sense and we are his children.
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:30.960]   Not only are we forgiven, we are delivered from the realm of sin and of death and of
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:37.520]   wrath and of punishment and we are in the new realm of righteousness and joy and peace
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:45.720]   and life everlasting which never can be destroyed and from which nothing can ever separate us.
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:52.600]   We are no longer under the reign of sin, we are going to reign in life ourselves.
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.520]   That is what he wants us to see.
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:57.120]   And here he is beginning to introduce us to all this.
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:01.240]   He has already suggested it in verse 10 by that little word "in".
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.800]   We shall be saved in his life.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:08.480]   He is now going to tell us something of what it means to be in the life of Christ.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:13.840]   We were in the life of Adam before, we are in the life of Christ now.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:19.800]   And you and I, if we are to rejoice in these things, if we are to joy in God as he has
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:24.720]   been saying in verse 11, we must understand this.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:32.440]   It is the man, the woman who really knows what it means to be in Christ who really rejoices.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:43.240]   Not only forgiven, not merely forgiven, but in this new realm, a part of this new humanity,
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:49.200]   an heir of God and a joint heir with Christ.
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:56.640]   Very well then, my friends, I suggest to you that we are going to look at what is undoubtedly
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:02.760]   the most important section in a sense of the whole of this mighty epistle.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:07.520]   Indeed I am bold to say this, if we do not understand this, well, we have not been understanding
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:12.080]   fully what we have been doing and we certainly will not understand what we are going to do.
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:16.600]   Shall I end tonight therefore by putting it like this.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:23.680]   What then are the subjects that are dealt with in this great section?
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:31.640]   You see, here they are, just ten verses, verse 12 to verse 21.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:32.640]   What are the subjects?
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.640]   Here they are.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:40.360]   First, the doctrine of original sin.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:48.280]   Had you realized that this is the classical passage in the whole Bible on the doctrine
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:51.180]   of original sin?
[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:55.360]   This is the very hub of it, the center, the locus classicus.
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:38:03.360]   It is the most important passage in the whole scripture on the doctrine of original sin.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:05.760]   What a section it is.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:08.920]   But wait a minute, that is not the only thing.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:19.320]   Secondly, it is the most important passage with regard to the historicity of the first
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:23.240]   three chapters of the book of Genesis.
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:26.120]   You see, there are so many Christian people today who say, "Oh, it does not matter whether
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:30.240]   you believe Genesis 1, 2, or 3 or not, believe in evolution if you like, it does not make
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.120]   any difference to my salvation."
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:35.000]   Does it not?
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:43.680]   This section insists upon our accepting the story in Genesis as literal, actual fact and
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:44.680]   history.
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:48.160]   That is what this means.
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.080]   It is history.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:54.960]   You do not understand the need of salvation unless that is history, which is described
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:59.120]   there, what happened in Adam and our relationship to Adam.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:03.400]   So it is the most important section.
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:08.520]   And it is only those who have always realized that, who have not allowed the so-called scientists
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:14.160]   to stampede them into accepting evolution.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:23.560]   Thirdly, it is the most important section with respect to what is known as the covenant
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.040]   theology.
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:32.600]   What that means is this, that God always deals with men through a covenant, through an agreement,
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:34.600]   through a document if you like.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:39.760]   He makes an agreement, a covenant, the great thing that is taught in the epistle to the
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.760]   Hebrews.
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:44.720]   Now here is a very vital section on covenant theology.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:49.840]   For as I have already hinted to you, what it says is this, that God always deals with
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:54.800]   men through a covenant and he always has somebody to represent men in the covenant.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:59.360]   Adam was the first representative, Christ is the second.
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:02.360]   Covenant theology, the most important subject.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:12.440]   And fourthly and lastly, it is for the reasons I have just been giving, a paragraph, a section
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:22.160]   which is absolutely vital to a true understanding of the doctrine of our redemption.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:26.460]   Now he has already been putting that in detail in terms of propitiation and so on.
[00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:35.400]   What you get here is the doctrine of redemption stated in broad terms and with regard to its
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.820]   ultimate aspects.
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:44.920]   This is one of the biggest, widest sweeps as it were, that you will find anywhere in
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:49.640]   the writings of this apostle or in any other writings in the whole of the scripture.
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:57.660]   The apostle here seems to stand back and takes a grand view or a great sweep of the whole
[00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:01.500]   position with regard to our redemption.
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:08.020]   There we were in Adam, here we are in Christ.
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:13.540]   And because we are in Christ, we are in him forever and forever.
[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:16.860]   We are safe, we are secure.
[00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:22.580]   Nothing can ever separate us, as he will tell us at the end of it all, at the end of chapter
[00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:30.180]   8, from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:37.980]   Well, I told you at the beginning that it was going to be a strenuous evening, but I
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:41.820]   do trust that I have been able to make it plain and clear to you.
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:46.420]   It is no use jumping into the details here unless you have got the background in your
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:54.820]   mind, unless you see exactly what he is doing and why he does it at this particular point.
[00:41:54.820 --> 00:42:00.220]   I do trust that I have been able to make that plain and clear to you.
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:07.100]   Shall I just test you by leaving you with a question?
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:15.820]   Do you realize, had you realized, that you are in Christ?
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:20.700]   Had you realized the meaning of that term, how often one meets it in the New Testament?
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:23.740]   In Christ.
[00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:26.820]   Had you realized what it means?
[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:33.540]   Had you understood clearly before why you are a sinner, why I am a sinner, why everybody
[00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:34.540]   is a sinner?
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:37.620]   Are you clear about it?
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:40.860]   That is what we find explained here.
[00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:46.100]   But the thing I would like to leave is this positive and glorious aspect.
[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:51.780]   Do you really see what redemption, what salvation really means?
[00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:57.300]   Do you see that the forgiveness of sins is merely the first step?
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:04.420]   And that the really glorious thing is this, that we are in Christ.
[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:08.980]   Old things have passed away; behold, old things have become new.
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:19.060]   We are members of a new race of people, the people of God, people who shall be his people
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:32.700]   forever and forever, the glorious, grand security of it all, because we are in Christ.
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:36.580]   Being a Christian is not to be forgiven today and then sin and fall out of it tomorrow and
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:37.580]   in and out.
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:38.580]   No, no.
[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:42.700]   You are either in Adam or else you are in Christ.
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:50.060]   And if you are in Christ, you have an eternal security.
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:55.940]   Very well, God grant that we may meet together next Friday and in the coming weeks to watch
[00:43:55.940 --> 00:44:03.420]   the apostle and to follow him and to go with him as he works all this out for us in detail
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:07.460]   in these tremendous ten verses.
[00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:09.460]   Let us pray.
[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:22.860]   O Lord, our God, we stand in amazement as we look at and consider this wondrous thing
[00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:25.900]   that thou hast done in the Son of thy love.
[00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:29.820]   O God, we begin to see its greatness.
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:34.940]   We begin to understand why thou didst ever send him from heaven into this world and why
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:39.820]   he came so readily and why he went to the death and the cross.
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:46.180]   O God, forgive us that our thinking about salvation and redemption has often been so
[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:47.180]   small.
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:57.820]   O help us, we pray thee, to see this large vision, this glorious purpose that thou hast
[00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:01.900]   in Christ even for us.
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:07.580]   O God, receive our humble worship and our prayers.
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:13.540]   Grant us, we pray thee, more and more the illumination of thy Holy Spirit that we may
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:20.460]   understand these things and truly grasp them and enter into them and be possessed of them
[00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:26.500]   that we may be filled with a sense of wonder, love and of praise.
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:33.820]   And now, O God, dismiss us with thy blessing and follow us on our several ways.
[00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:39.380]   Grant that we may be such people that those who know us and who meet with us shall feel
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:44.980]   that we are indeed different, that there is that about us which they cannot understand
[00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:50.020]   because we are in Christ and are members of the new race.
[00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:55.020]   Grant that as the result of seeing that they may be awakened and may begin to long for
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:58.300]   it and to seek and to search for it.
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:04.980]   And then grant in thine infinite grace that they may find it, may be found of it and may
[00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:12.460]   with us begin to rejoice in it and to praise thy name forever and forever.
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:20.540]   And now may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship
[00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:28.660]   and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night and evermore.
[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:30.580]   Amen.
