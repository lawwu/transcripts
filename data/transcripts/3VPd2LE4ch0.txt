[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.360]   - Yeah, we have one more question.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.080]   It's from a student and he has a question
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.680]   about starting for a highly competitive exam.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.640]   - All right, let's do it.
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.060]   - Hello Carl, Shubham here from India.
[00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.960]   Firstly, thank you so much for your podcast and books.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.080]   Your books have profoundly influenced my academic career
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.560]   and life in general.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.620]   As a student preparing for civil services examination,
[00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.040]   one of the highly competitive examination held in India,
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.280]   the only way I think to stand out
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.080]   is to putting extra number of deep work hours
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.320]   in the preparation.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.100]   Any tips for that and in general about cracking
[00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.880]   and highly competitive examinations?
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.080]   Thank you.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.380]   - Yeah, I used to deal with these questions a lot
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.560]   when I was doing primarily student focused advice
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.760]   back in my early days.
[00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.280]   The big high level point that applies
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.700]   to any high stakes examination
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.480]   and really sort of any high stakes grading situation
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.900]   is to make sure that your approach to preparing
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.780]   is what actually matters and not what you want to matter.
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.100]   It's the most common trap that happens here
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.260]   is that people write a story in their head
[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.040]   of what they want preparation for this exam to be.
[00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.100]   And it matches something that's typically
[00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.140]   it's some sort of activity that it's hard enough
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.240]   to feel fulfilling, but not so hard
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.420]   that it's really gonna cramp their life or be too hard.
[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.860]   Or they just like the idea of it
[00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.420]   and they just throw hours at it
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.180]   and they just want that to be what matters.
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.680]   And often what really matters for doing well for the exam
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.980]   might be completely different
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.460]   and actually require a lot less time
[00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.100]   once you know what it is.
[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.160]   So you gotta figure out what really matters
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.420]   for passing the India civil service entrance exam.
[00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.420]   And the way you figure that out
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.380]   is you talk to people who have done it.
[00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.940]   Know about it from direct experience.
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.260]   You say, what mattered?
[00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.180]   What was the prep you did that really was useful
[00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.180]   and what was the waste of time?
[00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.840]   And you talk to five people like this.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.860]   And if it's a big enough exam,
[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.420]   there might be books on it, you read the books too.
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.780]   You figure out what really matters.
[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.180]   And then you get a realistic picture of this is what I
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.480]   the activities I actually need to do,
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.700]   the activities I actually need to do
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.740]   to prepare for this exam.
[00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.780]   And then you find the time for it.
[00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.260]   Okay, well, how much is that gonna take?
[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.780]   And so how early do I have to start?
[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.700]   Then where do I wanna put that on my calendar?
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.940]   You should autopilot schedule it.
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.500]   Let me get that all on my calendar in advance,
[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.100]   the same times on the same days.
[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.100]   And then you just execute
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.400]   and you're executing the stuff that matters.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.860]   If you're really working backwards
[00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.900]   from focusing on what people know from experience
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.740]   makes a difference,
[00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.300]   it's probably less time than you think.
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.740]   For God's sakes, it's much less time
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.620]   if you come at this with the mindset of just,
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.340]   this is a morality setup.
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.100]   Like the more sacrifice I do, the more I'll be rewarded.
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.420]   So let me just make sure I'm miserable
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.540]   and doing lots of hours.
[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.300]   Your hours are only interesting to me
[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.140]   as a secondary side effect of you figuring out
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.620]   what prep matters and you scheduling it.
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.180]   And that'll take whatever it takes.
[00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.420]   Hours are not a planning tool.
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.740]   Trying to hit another hours is not a planning tool.
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.420]   Trying to hit a certain level of misery
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.820]   or so you feel like you're at least trying hard
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.660]   means nothing.
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.620]   All I care about is are you doing
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.460]   the actual concrete activities you have evidence work?
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.420]   Did you give yourself enough time to get those all done?
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.020]   Do those things when you've done them, you're done.
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.820]   If you don't, you're not, that's it.
[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.420]   A real differentiating factor
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.540]   when it comes to high stake test,
[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.500]   the people who figure that out
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.420]   and the people who want it to be some sort of
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.420]   more morality play about sacrifice and sweat.
[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.460]   That's not the way it works.
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.580]   Here's an example from my own days in college.
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.260]   So I went to an Ivy League school here in the US
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.900]   and had a lot of friends go to Harvard Law School
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.900]   after college, right?
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.660]   Which by the way, side note, naive public school kid I was
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.740]   going to this Ivy League school was completely surprised
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.820]   that most of the people I know
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.500]   went to Harvard Law School, right?
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.540]   Because in my mind, I didn't have this mindset of like,
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.100]   these are the professional tracks that are allowed.
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.700]   Of course, this is why you went to this school
[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.700]   so that you can then go to Harvard
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.900]   and then get a law firm job.
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.700]   Like I just thought everyone was gonna be professors
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.940]   and journalists and start nonprofits and cool companies.
[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.300]   And no, they all went to Harvard Law School, right?
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.380]   Because I was from a naive public school background, right?
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.820]   So I didn't realize like, oh, these are all pathways.
[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.180]   You become a doctor or a lawyer
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.260]   or a management consultant or finance
[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.820]   and you go through these schools and whatever.
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.860]   So you look at that from the outside, you're like, man,
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.580]   how did all these kids get into Harvard Law School?
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.380]   And depending on your orientation
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.780]   on the optimist pessimist scale about human nature,
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.780]   you think it's one of two things.
[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.340]   Either they must all just be brilliant.
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.180]   Man, I'll never be like that.
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.020]   Look at these smart kids.
[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.380]   They all can just go into Harvard Law School.
[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.540]   Or you say, yeah, it's all just like,
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.980]   what school you went to and look at that pipeline.
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.420]   You just for free, you get to go to Harvard Law
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.340]   if you go to an Ivy League school.
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.980]   And so it's just perpetuating,
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.140]   sort of entrenched privilege.
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.580]   But there's a third element here that I noticed up front,
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.660]   which was they systematically figured out
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.420]   what is needed to accomplish this goal.
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.660]   And they looked up, there's these matrices
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.180]   you could look up first of all, that shows you
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.980]   with your current GPA, what LSAT score would you need
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.100]   to have a high percentage of being accepted
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.940]   into Harvard Law School?
[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:23.780]   And they all looked at this
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.580]   and they all looked at their current GPAs and said, great,
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.940]   I have to get this LSAT score.
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.500]   So they're specific.
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.940]   And they figured out by talking to people
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.380]   who had gone before and gotten good scores on the LSAT,
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.380]   what really matters.
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.460]   And it was practice.
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.020]   A lot of it was practice, real tests under real conditions.
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.580]   You would learn some techniques and do real tests
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.420]   under real conditions.
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.380]   And so they organized a club internally
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.780]   where they would just do these tests, real LSATs
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.660]   under real conditions again and again and again
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.740]   until their scores hit exactly this number
[00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.180]   that the statistics told them would give them
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.700]   a good chance of being accepted.
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.780]   And then they were done.
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.020]   And then they went and took the LSAT
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.060]   and they got that score and they got into Harvard.
[00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.580]   The reason why I tell the story is to show
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.260]   what they were doing there is what often happens
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.060]   when you see people who do very well
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.380]   in high stakes testing is they figured out
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.540]   what do I really need to do and how do you actually do it?
[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.700]   And they put aside the time.
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.500]   And these students, my memory is they spent
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.980]   like a whole quarter working on this.
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.300]   They're like, okay, we're probably gonna end up
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.300]   having to dedicate, I'm trying to add this up in my head,
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.380]   100 hours of work on this to get our LSAT scores
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.220]   where they are.
[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.140]   So we got started early and we do this every Friday
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.700]   or whatever, every Thursday morning and let's just go.
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.460]   So I just use it as an example of this is the key
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.460]   to anything high stakes is get the ground truth evidence
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.940]   what really matters here and confront that
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.060]   for better or for worse.
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.460]   This is what I would actually have to do
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.980]   to prepare for this.
[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.060]   And then try to find time to do it, build your schedule,
[00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.180]   start early to fit it in.
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.100]   So, and then either do the work or you don't,
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.260]   but do not invent your own story
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.540]   for what you think should matter.
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.660]   Do not just retreat to storylines about
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.780]   there's nothing I can do because I'm not brilliant.
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.860]   So I'll just never get a good score.
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.660]   Nah, it's work.
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.020]   Like how do I get to where I need to get?
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.580]   So figure out the real solution, do the real work.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.340]   It's not very exciting, but that's, honestly,
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.620]   that's how the world turns with most of these,
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.980]   most of these types of high stakes exams anyways.
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
