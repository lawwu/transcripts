[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.580]   Welcome back to Ask the Compound, where today we're going to be talking about hyperinflation
[00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.700]   and the end of the U.S. dollar as you know it. Sorry, I'm still stuck in anti-Ben mode
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.540]   there. I just can't do it, Duncan. I'm a Glass-Cephal guy.
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.380]   Today's show is sponsored by our friends at YCharts. YCharts provides basically all of
[00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.860]   the charts we do for this show, for my blog, stuff I post on the internet, on Twitter,
[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.680]   stuff we use on Animal Spirits, what are your thoughts, all that stuff. They just posted
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:47.140]   a timely new chart, the top 23 charts of 2023. Michael and I actually did a webinar with
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.520]   YCharts last week where we talked about some of these charts. Pretty fun. We'll have a
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.460]   link in the show notes. We'll have a link on YouTube. It's pretty good. And if you go
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.980]   to YCharts, you haven't signed up yet, you sign up and say, "Ask the Compound sent me,"
[00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.060]   straight from Duncan, they'll give you 20% off of your initial subscription if you sign
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.140]   up. Just because of me. It's a screamin' deal. That's the opposite of inflation. We're a
[00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.780]   deflationary podcast. Not just disinflation, deflationary. It's true. Putting money back
[00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.100]   in your pockets. Thanks to YCharts. They're probably the longest running sponsor that
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.180]   the Compound has had, period. The very first sponsor we ever had on Animal Spirits. Yeah.
[00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.780]   That's true. Let's do a question. Good questions today. A wide range of topics. I think we're
[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.960]   now past the point where we're just getting topics zoned in on one specific topic. They're
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.620]   all over the place now, which I think is good. Yeah. I mean, I'm seeing... I was looking through...
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.180]   We'll talk about it later, but yeah. I'm seeing a lot more crash calls in the last couple
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.540]   of days, which I guess that makes a little more sense. I guess you move your crash call
[00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.820]   up when the market starts soaring, right? Because then you can call even a 5% pullback
[00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.120]   a crash. But yeah. Interesting stuff happening. Thanks to everyone in live chat for mentioning
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.980]   my haircut. I get a haircut and I go home and no one even notices. So, at least the
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:15.540]   people on YouTube... We don't notice because it always looks good. Thank you. All right.
[00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.540]   But wait, before the end of the show, can we pull up the picture of you with the haircut
[00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:29.500]   from... What's the guy's name? The country singer. Nicole Kidman's husband. John's going
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.660]   to pull it up before the end of the show. I'm drawing a blank on this. Emo Duncan. Is
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.140]   it Keith Urban? Keith Urban. Yes. You have a Keith Urban haircut from when you were like
[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.700]   a teenager. Oh, you're talking about when I was a freshman in college. Yeah, yeah. Okay.
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.120]   Yeah, yeah. Yes. By the end of the show, we got to find out. We'll see what John can do.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.620]   Next question. Okay. Up first today, we have a question from Andrew. My father-in-law recently
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.660]   came into a decent size inheritance and is trying to decide what to do with it. He doesn't
[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.620]   know a lot about finance and can be stubborn. So, giving him suggestions mostly falls on
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.540]   deaf ears. Recently, he told us that he found someone at a local financial firm who gave
[00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.260]   him an idea on what to do with the funds. I asked a few questions and he said the guy
[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.820]   couldn't email the details. I told him I thought that sounded suspect. Now, he wants me to
[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.020]   come along to this meeting with this person. I'm above average with personal finance, but
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.700]   I don't know how to really get a sense of whether this is a good idea or not. Can you
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.900]   share some questions you'd ask in this meeting? I'd like to help him avoid making a decision
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.340]   that he regrets down the road. This is a good question. I like this. Yeah, it is. I'm going
[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.980]   to give the advisor the benefit of the doubt that hopefully the reason they can't share
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.360]   is for compliance reasons, but unfortunately, people who come into a decent size amount
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.460]   of money have a target on their back, and I'm sure that's probably what happened here.
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.900]   I think investment decisions with family are always tricky, especially when you're talking
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.940]   about the in-laws, but I think there are certainly questions you could ask this advisor about
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.260]   the specific investment, whatever it is, to do your due diligence process, but I think
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.660]   first, you should go into that meeting and think about questions the advisor is asking
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.140]   your father-in-law. The questions they should be asking him are what are your goals with
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.140]   this money? What is your appetite for risk? How much risk are you willing to take? How
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.860]   much risk do you need to take? What's your time horizon? What are your current financial
[00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.940]   circumstances? What does the rest of your portfolio look like? What's your experience
[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.500]   like in the markets and investments? Have you ever done this stuff before? How have
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.980]   you reacted to losses and gains in the past? What are your expectations for returns on
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.300]   investments? Because there's a million different investments that could be good under the right
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.300]   circumstances for the right investor. That doesn't mean they're necessarily right for
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.500]   this person. You're not just going into investing thinking, "I'm going to earn 9.5%, and if
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.740]   I do that, I'm going to be happy." Real people aren't like hedge funds, right? So, it's impossible
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.420]   to make an investment recommendation to someone without understanding their goals and their
[00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.300]   circumstances and their emotional makeup. So, a doctor doesn't come into the office
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.340]   and say, "Here, here's your prescription. Go fill it. Now, let's check out and see what's
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.300]   wrong with you." That's how a lot of people who sell financial products work. So, you
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.860]   always have to diagnose before you prescribe. So, I would just go in there making sure that
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.540]   this person at this financial firm is asking the right questions of your father-in-law.
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:07.260]   If they're not asking those questions, that's when the red flags go up for me. So, I just
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.740]   think it's a good opportunity to understand that. That's when you say, "All right, hold
[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.780]   on a second. You're trying to push this product on us without understanding where my father-in-law
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.780]   is coming from. What do you want us to do with the money in the first place?" Those
[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.580]   are the red flags that would be to me. Is the first meeting too early to ask about
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.980]   how they get their alpha and how they outperform? Risk-adjusted returns typically don't come
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.860]   up in the first meeting. But that's the difference between someone who's trying to sell you a
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.060]   product and someone who's trying to offer you financial advice. Most financial advice
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:41.220]   back in the day, call it, I don't know, pre this century, it was people selling products.
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:47.340]   Stuff was made to be sold and people just kind of pitched stuff. It was a pitch, right?
[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.580]   That's why a lot of financial advisors were called producers back in the day because they
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:56.040]   were producing commissions and making money. I don't know if this financial advisor is
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.260]   doing this, but that's kind of stuff I'd be looking out for. Do they have your father-in-law's
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.540]   best interests at heart, or are they just trying to push a product at them?
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.340]   This is the time that you would find out about fees and all that kind of stuff, right? That's
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.060]   all stuff that would be a first meeting. Yeah, but again, the first meeting is just
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.700]   the feeling out process. Is there a good fit here? And then we can talk about specifics
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.660]   and details. That's the thing, is you don't want to go in saying, "This thing is going
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.580]   to give you 7% and it's going to cost this much." That stuff is for down the line.
[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.380]   Before you even ever get to the details, you want to make sure there's a good fit and this
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:34.060]   person is looking out for you in the first place. When they give you financial advice,
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.420]   they're thinking about your goals and needs as opposed to, "I'm going to sell someone
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.180]   this product." It seems like a dangerous recurring theme
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.780]   I've heard over the years, though, is people who are like, "Oh, but they're such a nice
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:49.500]   person," or, "I like them a lot." How do you try to block that out? Because it's in our
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.740]   nature to like people who are nice to us, right?
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.740]   This is something Josh always says. Whether this is right or wrong, people work with people
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.140]   that they genuinely like or respect, right? It's not always the smartest person. Sometimes
[00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:06.760]   it is, but most of the time it's someone that, yeah, is endearing to you or shows some empathy
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.200]   or whatever it is, and it's not always the person that's specifically right for you.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.500]   People do have a hard time sometimes turning someone down and saying no. I think it's okay
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.780]   to take your time here and make your father-in-law realize that they don't have to rush into
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.300]   anything. There's no hurry with this stuff. Get it right the first time so you don't make
[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.780]   a mistake.
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:31.140]   Yeah, it seems like kind of a potentially lose-lose situation for the son-in-law, right?
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.580]   Yeah, because if they talk him out of it, it is a good investment. It makes him money.
[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.500]   Then you look like a jerk for talking him out of it. That's the kind of stuff I would
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.940]   tell your father-in-law to look for is, is this person actually offering advice or are
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.660]   they just trying to pitch you a product?
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:44.660]   Yeah.
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.060]   There's a big difference.
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.220]   Good advice.
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.220]   Next one.
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:57.480]   Up next, we have a question from Durga. "I know that owning a home is not for everyone.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.700]   I particularly appreciate your point about maintenance and upkeep after visiting a fairly
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:07.160]   recently constructed home that within about 15 years needs a lot of repairs. If I've decided
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:12.180]   that I'm a renter forever, do I think about investing in REITs to get more exposure in
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:17.020]   real estate? If yes, what do you think would be the pros and cons, and what percentage
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.920]   should it be? I'm a target date fund investor in my retirement and brokerage accounts."
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.120]   And just for everyone, like all the young people that are new here, maybe just explain
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.300]   what a REIT is real quick too.
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:32.740]   Real Estate Investment Trust, and it's typically a fund that invests in commercial real estate.
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.140]   There could be a little bit of residential in there, but mostly it's commercial. And
[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:40.020]   because of the way they're structured, 90% of the money has to be paid out. So it's a
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:44.580]   high income fund. So it better to be put into some sort of retirement strategy because it's
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.140]   going to be paying out a lot of income.
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.700]   If you own a target date fund, you probably already have some REITs in there. You're probably
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.900]   pretty well set. Even if you own a total stock market index fund like VTI, or a total world
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:00.900]   fund like VT, REITs make up 3% of the total. So you already have some exposure to REITs.
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:07.140]   So, John, show up the first chart here. But I don't necessarily think you need REITs to
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:12.340]   offset owning housing. So this is the Vanguard Real Estate ETF versus the total stock market
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:18.220]   index fund for the US. You can see the performance from, I don't know, the early to mid 2000s,
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:22.420]   when this fund first came out. Pretty much through COVID, we're pretty similar. The stock
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.540]   market has outperformed since then. John, show the next one. This is correlation. I'm
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:31.380]   doing some portfolio management stuff here. There is some diversification benefit here.
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.940]   But most of the time, these things are going up and down together. And it's 0.66, almost
[00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:40.780]   0.7 correlation. That means there's a strong correlation. It's not like one to one. So
[00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:45.020]   there are some diversification benefits from year to year. You can do a chart off, John.
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:50.620]   So, in 2020, REITs were down 5% when the S&P was up almost 20%. The next year, REITs rallied
[00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:56.540]   more than 40% when the S&P was up 28%. 2014, REITs rose more than 30% while the S&P was
[00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:02.340]   up a little more than 13%. And in 2013, REITs were up just 2% when the S&P gained 32%. So,
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:06.780]   there are years where you could use REITs for rebalancing purposes. So, from a diversification
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.740]   portfolio management perspective, sure, I could see REITs adding some value. I wouldn't
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:14.900]   necessarily compare those benefits to owning a home, though. REITs are, again, mostly commercial
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.900]   real estate, not much residential. They're more diversified, so that's nice. And there's
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.100]   some leverage involved in these commercial real estate transactions, but not nearly as
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.140]   much as most homeowners take out when they take out a loan. And one of the biggest benefits
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:30.260]   of owning a home is that fixed rate mortgage. It's an inflation hedge, right? REITs are
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.740]   also more of a liquid market. So, there's pros and cons to that. The pros are, it allows
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.940]   you to rebalance and trade more often if you need to get the money in or money out. But,
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.780]   John, let's throw up the drought on chart. This is the drought on chart for the Vanguard
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:46.860]   REIT fund I was talking about. In the housing bust from 2006 to 2012, the U.S. housing market
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:54.460]   fell something like 26% or 27%. In 2008, REITs fell 73% at the bottom of the ... way worse
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:11:00.500]   than the stock market. During the COVID crash, REITs fell 30%. At their worst point last
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:06.500]   year, they were down 35%, I think, 30%. So, the housing market is not nearly as volatile
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:12.000]   as REITs. REITs act like the stock market in terms of risk. So, I like where this person's
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.140]   head is at. They're trying to think about diversification and all these things. But
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:21.220]   I think if you take the savings from renting and not having to do down payment and not
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:25.440]   having all the ancillary costs like property taxes and upkeep and maintenance and insurance
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.780]   and throw those into a more diversified portfolio, that makes sense. So, do you need REITs? I
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:33.920]   don't think so. If you have a target date fund, if you want to have REITs to be more
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:38.300]   diversified, sure. But I don't see REITs as a stand-in for owning a house. I think that's
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.580]   two completely different assets. Yeah, the thing that confused me when I first
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.520]   got into the market, I probably did what a lot of people do and I would just sort stocks
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.580]   by dividend and just started buying a bunch of those.
[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:54.340]   You were dogs with the Dow guy. And they were like ... Well, these were mortgage real estate
[00:11:54.340 --> 00:12:00.440]   trusts or whatever. Oh, yeah. So, Annali, they have 15% dividends
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.940]   or something, right? Right. Yeah, yeah. That was one of the first
[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.200]   ones I bought. So, they have to pay out the majority of their
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.420]   income in dividends. I actually wrote a chapter in my first book, Wealth of Common Sense,
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:15.480]   about this showing that these stocks had 15% dividends and people were just throwing ... Couldn't
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.500]   believe it because rates were at 0%. But on a total return basis, a lot of these stocks
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.260]   did absolutely nothing because the price went down. So, that's why the total return thing
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:27.500]   matters more than the income. But, yeah. I don't necessarily see REITs as a stand-in
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:31.580]   for the housing market. I think it's different assets. If you want them for diversification
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.540]   purposes and portfolio management, that's fine. I don't think they are a stand-in for
[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.500]   housing. It seems like there's not a good one, really,
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.860]   because you've talked about how you bought Zillow and during a roaring housing market,
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.660]   it really hasn't outperformed it. Even the home builder stocks, you could think
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:51.660]   that those are a stand-in. They've been offsides from where the housing prices are. Housing
[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:57.380]   is just a very unique financial asset, unlike anything else. I think as long as you're diversifying
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:01.980]   into a portfolio of financial assets, I think that's probably fine.
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.900]   All right. Next question. Another housing question next.
[00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:12.580]   Yep. Okay. Up next, we have a question from Octavia. Every personal finance blogger ...
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:16.140]   A lot of good names today. Yeah. I'm liking this. We've got some diversification
[00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:20.940]   of names. Every personal finance blogger says not to prepay a low-interest mortgage, but
[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:25.220]   what if you're carrying PMI, which is mortgage insurance, right?
[00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:26.940]   Private mortgage insurance. Yep. I'll explain it.
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:33.100]   I have two of 30 years with a 2.6% mortgage with a low down payment in the home. Should
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:37.700]   I at least try to pay down enough extra principal to pay off the PMI and then resume the monthly
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.660]   payments? If not, what would your advice be? I think Octavia was saying they're two years
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:45.500]   into the loan of 30 years. Good question, and one that's likely relevant to a lot of
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:49.300]   home buyers right now, because I think a lot of people are putting down less than 20% because
[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.140]   housing prices are so high and mortgage rates are so high, they want to save some of that
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:57.820]   savings. So PMI essentially protects the lenders from borrowers who are looking for a larger
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:02.820]   loan relative to equity. So if you put less than 20% down, you put 10% or 5% down, it's
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:07.260]   a little riskier because they're letting you borrow more money. It's typically a requirement
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:12.180]   for those loans that don't have the loan to value of 80%. So most lenders require you
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:17.780]   to pay PMI once a month, and it's an escrow account. And if you have PMI, usually they
[00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.700]   make you put your property taxes in there as well. So you're going to be paying per
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:25.740]   month your property taxes, your mortgage payment, and your PMI, sometimes your house insurance
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:30.380]   too. And the amount you pay is usually determined by the size of the loan or your credit score.
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:35.660]   It's a percentage of the loan, kind of depends, something like 1% around there. For most borrowers,
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:41.980]   we're probably talking 100, 150, 200 bucks a month for PMI. So it's not nothing. Compared
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:46.620]   to mortgage payments today, it's smaller, but it's not nothing. The good news is for
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.260]   home borrowers in the past few years, home appreciation could help. So let's say you
[00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:56.300]   bought a house for 400K with 10% down two years ago and took out a $360,000 loan, and
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:01.980]   the house is up 20% since then. Just on a price appreciation alone, the house is worth
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:07.060]   480K. Even if we don't assume how much ever you paid down in principle over the last couple
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:11.700]   of years, you have 25% equity now that the house went up 20%. So you're pretty close
[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.900]   to there. The problem is a lot of lenders have rules in place to how to get out of PMI,
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.860]   and they can be kind of stringent. I had one a few years ago where I'm pretty sure they
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.660]   low-balled the appraisal because they didn't want me to get PMI off. We ended up selling
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:28.340]   the house anyway, but I was pretty mad about it. That's a racket I can talk about for another
[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.860]   time, the home appraisal industry. I feel like Zillow could do it way better than most
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:36.740]   home appraisers do, but I digress. So the first step would be talk to your lender and
[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.700]   figure out ... A lot of them will have you have to have the loan for two years. That's
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.780]   typically a requirement before you can do it. So this person does, so I think they should
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:47.740]   be okay. Then you go to them, and they have to do some sort of appraisal to figure out
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:51.500]   if you have that 20% equity yet. If you don't, then they can let you know at least, "Here's
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:55.140]   how much you'd have to put down to get to that point." But I would talk to them before
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:16:00.420]   thinking about gathering the money and figuring out what the terms of it are. So go through
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:04.500]   that process first. If you're lucky, price appreciation for the past few years could
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:08.660]   save you a couple thousand bucks a year and not have any money out of your pocket. I would
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:12.540]   talk to your lender first before going through this, but it makes sense to me where then
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:16.340]   you can do the cost-benefit of, "Okay, I've got to put an extra $10,000 down to get this
[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:20.940]   PMI off, but each year I'm going to save $2,500 or whatever, so the payback period is five
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.020]   years or four years or whatever."
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:27.720]   Can you make PMI make sense to me? It just seems like something that is just another
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.940]   barrier keeping younger people from being able to buy a house.
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:34.980]   It does sound like a little bit of a racket, but the idea is if you're not putting as much
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.940]   money down, if you're putting 5% down in your house versus 20, it doesn't take much for
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:44.740]   the house price to go down. If you're forced to sell for whatever reason, then your loan
[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:49.500]   is underwater. I don't know when exactly PMI was instituted, but I'm sure it came into
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:53.860]   effect in 2008 on a lot of these houses that went underwater and short sales and that sort
[00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:54.860]   of thing.
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:59.580]   It does seem like a racket, and there are ways around it. My very first loan, I put
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:03.980]   5% down on my first house, and they gave me essentially a home equity line of credit,
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:08.460]   so I didn't have to do the PMI. It was like, "We're going to give you 80% of the loan
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:13.220]   as a regular mortgage and 20% as a home equity line of credit." We did end up paying it
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:17.860]   down a little faster because the rate fluctuated a little more, but it does kind of seem like
[00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:23.700]   a racket, considering you have the house as collateral already, but that's the way it
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:24.700]   works.
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.840]   I'm just trying to make it seem less bad in my head. Maybe it protects taxpayers from
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:33.060]   having to bail out a private company that would end up in trouble because of defaulting?
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:37.260]   I don't know. It sounds like more of a racket from the banks than anything. I'm sure there's
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.980]   some regulations involved, but it does kind of sound like a racket. Again, they make it
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:47.140]   hard to get it off of there. It does seem like a banking thing, but yeah.
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.820]   I don't like it, but I'm a millennial. We'll never be able to buy a house anyway, so it's
[00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.700]   okay. I don't have to worry about these things.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:56.020]   This is true. If I don't buy a house, I'm never paying PMI.
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:57.020]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.580]   You can put that PMI money into REITs.
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:02.180]   It's my life hack. Duncan's best way to avoid PMI. Don't buy a house.
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.140]   Don't buy a house. All right. Next question.
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:08.860]   Up next, we have a question from Tom. I saw the Dave Ramsey video about 8% withdrawal
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:13.500]   rates and agree it's a bit far-fetched after reading Nick's piece on the actual numbers.
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.660]   That's Nick Majulie. I get the sequence of return stuff, but Nick and Dave are using
[00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:22.980]   100% stock portfolios. I'm closer to 60/40. Do the numbers change at all if you use a
[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:28.900]   more diversified portfolio? I was hoping for 5% or so when I retire in a few years.
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:33.460]   Good question. We actually get a lot of retirement withdrawal questions from people who are
[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:36.500]   approaching retirement. Why don't we bring Nick in here?
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.460]   You mentioned Nick Majulie, and we can make him appear.
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:46.940]   Of dollars and data. So Dave Ramsey said, "I can earn 12% on my stock portfolio or something,
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:54.260]   4% for inflation. I can take out 8%," which seemed high to pretty much everyone. You poked
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:58.100]   some holes into this, but this person's saying, "Okay, I kind of get that because the stock
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.860]   market, you don't want to be selling when the stock market is down because that can
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:04.820]   really hurt you, especially if you get a crash early on in your career. But what about a
[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.580]   more diversified portfolio?" You actually wrote a blog post about this, so why don't
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.780]   you share some of your numbers? Yeah. Today, I actually released something
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.780]   in some of the charts I think that John will show will really illustrate this. But basically,
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:21.980]   if you're using a 60/40 portfolio, the probability if you can do it with a 5% withdrawal rate
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:27.580]   that you'll survive the 30 years is about 84%. So, it's not 100%. It's not safe withdrawal
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:31.700]   based on the safe withdrawal definition. And this is using every 30-year period going
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:38.820]   back to 1926, from 1926 to 2022, an annual rebalance on a 60/40. A 5% withdrawal rate
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:42.980]   is still a little risky. Obviously, 84% chance means you'll probably make it, but there's
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:48.380]   still a 16% chance that you'd run out a little bit sooner. So, keep that in mind.
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:53.580]   I think if one of the heat maps, I have a heat map here and it shows the withdrawal
[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:57.540]   rate and the percentage of stocks in the stock bond portfolio, U.S. stock bond, and you can
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:01.020]   see that. Give us a chart on here, John.
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:04.580]   You can see that. So, this one's just showing that's just over 30-year periods. That just
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.860]   shows the withdrawal rate and then the survival percentage.
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.220]   I think it's important to tell people how the withdrawal stuff works, because it's not
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:15.580]   like you're just taking 5% of your portfolio every year. So, why don't you explain that?
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.620]   You said it at the beginning. How it's supposed to work is like, let's say you have a million
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:25.340]   dollar portfolio. If you're using a 4% withdrawal rate, or let's say 5%, you would take $50,000
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.940]   in your first year, and then every year you adjust that for inflation. So, if inflation
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:33.980]   was 10%, next year you would take 55,000, right? And then if the next year inflation
[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:38.460]   was 10% again, then you would take, whatever, 55,000 plus 10 more percent on it.
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:43.140]   Because most people don't want to see their spending each year fluctuate with the markets.
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:47.340]   It's great when the market is up, like this year when the markets are up, 60/40 is up
[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:51.140]   like 12% or something. That feels great, but last year when it was 60/40, it was down 15%
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:55.540]   or 16%. Most people don't want to cut back. So, they want it to be more regular and steady,
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:56.540]   like a paycheck.
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:00.980]   Yeah, exactly. So, I mean, the main thing, it's like, "Why can't I just take 4% a year?"
[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.940]   Well, you could just look at your portfolio value and do 4% a year, but the problem is
[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:07.020]   it's going to jump around depending on what's going on with your portfolio. If your portfolio
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.020]   drops by 50%.
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:11.940]   So, here in this chart, you look at different withdrawal rates at different levels of stocks.
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:18.460]   So, you did a 50/50, 60/40, 70/30, all the way up and did a heat map. So, what's the
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.460]   sweet spot here?
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:24.740]   Yeah. So, I mean, obviously 4% is the safe rate for across every portfolio, but you can
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:30.620]   see if you have a 60/40, you can go to 4.5%. There's still a pretty good chance, a 94%
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.960]   chance that you would make it through to the end. So, that's just the thing to keep in
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:39.260]   mind is your withdrawal rate, as you said at the beginning, in reality, people are going
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:43.380]   to do different things. You can be flexible. You can change it at some point. If the market
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:47.760]   comes down badly, you can move things around. In my blog posts, I talk about different strategies.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.900]   You can use guardrails, flexible spending, etc. Or what most people do, if you actually
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:55.780]   look at the data, most people don't even use withdrawal rates at all. They just live off
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:59.720]   their interest, right? Whatever their investments earn them, they just live off that. They never
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:03.100]   touch the principal. That's actually how most retirees work.
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:06.460]   The withdrawal strategies are interesting for people like us in finance to debate, but
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:11.060]   most people don't actually use them. Their spending fluctuates. A lot of people, we'll
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:14.780]   talk about it in the next question, I got some data, their spending peaks in their 50s
[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:19.140]   and it goes down from there for most people. So, it's not a steady state for most people.
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:23.180]   And you're right, you can be flexible. If there's a really bad year and you feel nervous,
[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:26.640]   then you can always pull back your spending. And when it's a good year, you can spend more
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:31.180]   or you can bank some and save it. So, I also think that a 60/40 portfolio gives you some
[00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:36.260]   flexibility to, I'm going to rebalance intelligently and when the stock market is down, I'm taking
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:40.280]   from bonds. When the stock market is up, I'm taking from stocks. So, I think there's ways
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:45.140]   to think about it in a more flexible way that can actually make your money go a little further
[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:49.460]   than it does just in a backtest like this. Yeah, I agree. And so, I think the backtests
[00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:54.300]   are very rigid, but hey, that's what the numbers say. So, I'm not saying 5% is impossible,
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.180]   but you may have to cut in some years to get to 5%. Just realize that.
[00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:01.940]   And the point of this too is that original 4% rule, I want to talk about it for the next
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:06.140]   question a little bit, because we've got another one like this, but that is your worst-case
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:13.260]   scenario. The biggest risk for a retiree is, "I don't want to run out of money." In a decent-case
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:17.940]   scenario or best-case scenario, you could end up with way more money. So, I have some
[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:20.860]   stats in the next one. So, why don't we go to the next post, because this is, I think,
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.540]   kind of similar. Okay. Yeah, Viking River cruises are not cheap.
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:31.660]   Nice commercials though, right? Yeah, they do. I mean, yeah, they look awesome. Okay,
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:35.140]   last but not least, we have a question from Greg. "Ben, in your recent blog post, you
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:39.700]   said $1 million of investable wealth makes you rich. I would like to provide a counter-argument
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:44.300]   to that. When you retire, $1 million basically gives you $40,000 a year to live off of, assuming
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:49.300]   the 4% rule of thumb is a reasonable starting point to think about retirement income. So,
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:53.620]   is $40,000 a year really rich? I would argue that it's middle class at best, probably lower
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:57.420]   middle class. I would argue that if your wealth is buying you a retirement, then it takes
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:01.700]   at least $3 or $4 million to be rich or upper middle class. What are your thoughts?"
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:06.140]   So I wrote this blog post last week called $5 million is nothing, which was a play from
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:11.420]   Succession where cousin Greg said he's going to inherit $5 million and Connor said $5 million
[00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:16.340]   is nothing. It's like too much money to work, but it's not enough to be rich. And there's
[00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:20.040]   all these surveys that show that these millionaire people with millions of dollars or a million
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.780]   dollar investment portfolio don't feel rich and they think they're middle class or upper
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:28.580]   middle class. And in fact, I heard from half a dozen people who said, "Your post is describing
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:34.500]   me to a T. I have a million dollars or $3 to $4 million and I don't feel rich." So it
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:38.180]   was interesting. I wanted to run the numbers on this and Nick, I know you have too. Credit
[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:43.180]   Suisse puts out this global wealth report every year and it shows how many people are
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:47.700]   millionaires around the globe. So John, throw this up. First of all, this is where the distribution
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:51.180]   of millionaires comes in. I think this might be why people in the U.S. think it's more
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:57.060]   common than it is. 40% of all millionaires, almost 39% reside in the U.S. There are more
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:01.380]   millionaires in the U.S. than there are in China, Japan, Great Britain, France, Germany,
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:05.340]   Canada, Australia, and Italy combined. So there's a lot more wealth concentrated here.
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:10.260]   Obviously, the bigger population than everyone but China there. But out of the 8.1 billion
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:16.220]   people in the world, I think Credit Suisse says there's 62 million millionaires. So it's
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:23.100]   like less than 1%. If you have more than $5 million, you're in the top 0.1% globally.
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:26.940]   I don't know how else to say you are very, very wealthy compared to the rest of the human
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:33.180]   beings alive. And Nick, I think you have some data on how this fits in the U.S. too. Where
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:38.180]   does being a millionaire put you in the U.S.? Yeah, so John, can you show the chart of the
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.740]   median net worth? I think this is just good. So this shows median net worth by age and
[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:45.740]   so you can see like, you know, none of these people are necessarily millionaires. So that's
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:50.100]   like the middle of the pack. But a million dollars actually using this survey of consumer
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:56.540]   finances data from 2022 puts you in the top 20% on net worth basis. And just having a
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:00.820]   million dollars in financial assets would put you in the top 10%. Remember, net worth
[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:04.140]   includes home equity and things which are not as liquid. But if we just said, okay,
[00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:08.740]   who has a million dollars in financial assets, like that puts you in the top 10% of Americans.
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:13.900]   So American households, right? So let's think about this. So just liquid portfolio of assets
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:18.860]   besides your house, a million bucks, there's top 10%. Yeah. And so maybe is the top 10%
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:22.220]   rich to you? I mean, and I also think like this question, like, oh, 40K a year, that's
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:25.020]   like a middle class income. Well, let's think about a couple other things. You're going
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.540]   to get social security most likely, right? This person probably works. That's what I
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:31.580]   was going to ask about. Let's add 20K to that. Now you're at 60K. A lot of these people with
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.860]   a million dollar portfolio, they've probably paid off their house. So they don't really
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:39.340]   have a payment outside of taxes. Right? So it's like they have 60K a year in just spending
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:43.980]   money. That's 5K a month. Right. And just spend like your credit card bill. Like that
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.260]   is not a quote, middle-class lifestyle. That's easily an upper middle class. I mean, depending
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:52.100]   on what you're doing, but yeah. And if you were, if you got your million dollars by saving,
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:55.020]   let's say you were one of these diligent savers, like a lot of the DIY people that listen to
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:27:00.780]   us, they might save 20 to 30% of their income. The rule of thumb is usually you'll have to
[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:04.780]   recreate 70 to 80% of your income in retirement. If you save 20 to 30%, you're already there
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:09.180]   right? Then you take the mortgage out, social security. And I think what a lot of people
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:13.460]   forget it's hard for people to wrap their minds around this is in the past people's
[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:17.700]   retirement plan was they literally died, right? If you have enough money, so you have control
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:21.800]   of your time and freedom and don't have to work, then I think you're wealthy, regardless
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.580]   of if that's a million dollars or a hundred thousand dollars, right? If you just have
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:29.300]   the ability to sustain your lifestyle. The other thing about this 4% rule that we talked
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:32.380]   about, you you've mentioned this before. And I think I looked at it, the Michael Kitsis
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:36.180]   strategy, he did this study on the 60/40 going back to 1870, I'm guessing he used the Shiller
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:43.020]   data. And he said that in two thirds of all scenarios for the 4% rule, again, the 4% rule
[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:48.260]   is just kind of the baseline so you don't run out of money. In two thirds of the strategies,
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:52.620]   you're likely to end up with more money than you started with. And you're more likely to
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:57.820]   quintuple your starting wealth than you are to finish with less than your starting principal.
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:02.260]   So people think about the 4% rule as like, I don't know if I can sustain it. Most likely
[00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:05.980]   if you retire with a million dollars, you're going to have more money by the time you're
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:12.780]   dead because you're not in, that's the other thing. You don't spend a lot of it. So the
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:19.020]   problem is, if you have money and the facts do not ever trump your feelings. So if you
[00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:22.460]   don't feel wealthy, unfortunately, there's not a lot you can do. If you still worry about
[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:29.260]   money, you're not really wealthy. But I think by any definition of the term, yes, you are
[00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:32.260]   wealthy by all sorts of comparisons.
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:37.460]   Location matters so much in this too, right? If you're paying $4,000 for a one-bedroom
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:42.140]   apartment in Brooklyn, then yeah, that probably doesn't sound like a ton of money. But if
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:48.020]   you live in the mountains of North Carolina, that's probably going to feel like a ton of
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.020]   money for you.
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.020]   But a lot of it, again, is lifestyle.
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.020]   Unless Asheville. Asheville's expensive.
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:54.620]   Good live music there, though, right?
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:55.620]   Right, yeah.
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:29:00.420]   I think, again, I don't think seeing these numbers is going to help make anyone feel
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:05.780]   any wealthier because I don't think facts really change people's feelings a lot. But
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:10.180]   I think a lot of it does come down to your lifestyle. There's people who don't have nearly
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:14.180]   as much money who have control over the people they see and the stuff that they do. So I
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:20.780]   think that's the biggest thing is what is your lifestyle? That's part of it.
[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:27.180]   The millionaire stats from Credit Suisse really surprised me. It's a tiny, tiny, tiny drop
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.420]   in the bucket of people that have that much money.
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:34.620]   I mean, yeah, even looking at the U.S. stats, top 20%, top 10%, no matter how you cut it.
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.860]   You're definitely upper-middle class. I don't know, what do you define as rich? Is the top
[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:42.540]   10% rich? That's debatable. Obviously, globally, it's rich, but it may not be rich in the U.S.
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:44.300]   It's up to kind of how you define rich.
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:49.180]   And I did have one guy come to me and said, "You know what? I have a few million bucks,
[00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:54.660]   but what's rich to me is driving a Porsche, and I'm never gonna be able to drive a Porsche."
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:59.940]   And so we sent him, "What's the service, Duncan? We can rent a Tura or something?"
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:00.940]   Yeah, a Tura.
[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:06.020]   I told him, "Rent a Porsche for a week and see if it makes you feel any better." And
[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:11.740]   it probably won't, but I don't know. I think you do have to find little ways of making
[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:16.820]   yourself feel wealthy, if that's the occasional first-class ticket on a plane or something.
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:21.660]   I think it's okay to treat yourself and give yourself places that are going to make you
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:26.340]   happier and make you feel like you're a little wealthy if you have that much money, 'cause
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:27.980]   it's a lot of money. It is.
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:32.380]   Yeah. I think a GT40 would make me feel pretty happy to be driving around.
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.380]   What's a GT40?
[00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:39.940]   It's a Ford GT40. You watch Ford versus Ferrari. It's the actual consumer production version
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:40.940]   of that.
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:41.940]   Okay. Good movie.
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:42.940]   Yeah.
[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:49.020]   All right. Go check out Nick's blog of Dollars & Data. He has a great post today on the 60/40
[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:50.020]   withdrawal strategies.
[00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:54.220]   Yep. It's out today. It just came out. I did it just for this episode.
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:56.660]   What do you got, Duncan?
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:03.060]   Before we get out of here, I wanted to tell people, the holidays are here and approaching.
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:08.380]   If you're looking for a good gift to get someone in your life who is starting out in investing
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:13.780]   or a kid that you want to learn about investing, I have the book for you. It's from our very
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:18.060]   own Ben Carlson. This is a great book. We've talked about it before, but those of you that
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.580]   are new here, this is a great book.
[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:21.020]   Plugging, Duncan. Thanks for the plug, Duncan.
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:26.180]   Yeah. I was just thinking, a lot of people want to ... They get the Oculus or Meta glasses
[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:30.980]   or whatever, and they're like, "I want to get something that's actually nutritious for
[00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:31.980]   my kids, too."
[00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:33.700]   Give Nick's book a plug, too. Just keep buying.
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.380]   Just keep buying, too. Sorry, I don't have that graphic ready.
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.780]   It worked again, Nick. Two years of a bear market and it worked again. We're back to
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:38.780]   all-time highs.
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:45.220]   It worked again. All the doubters, sorry. Sorry. I'll see you guys in the next drawdown.
[00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:49.020]   Thanks to everyone in the live chat, as always. Remember, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com. If
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:54.620]   you want to send us a question, send us a question. Oh, there's Keith Urban. See, someone
[00:31:54.620 --> 00:32:01.420]   sent me this picture, and I did not know it was Duncan. Wait, when is that? College?
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:06.380]   2005. That's my freshman year of college, Myrtle Beach, outside of the House of Blues,
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:07.380]   about to go see String Cheese.
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:11.540]   See, you guys both have -- Nick has a long-haired picture, too, and he was like an AC/DC guy.
[00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:12.540]   Yeah, his is real.
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:15.780]   That will not be showed today, but maybe the next time I'm live.
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:19.340]   I'm the only one here without a long-haired picture. Thanks to everyone for watching,
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:20.340]   as always, and we'll see you next time.
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:21.340]   Thank you, guys.
[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:21.340]   Thanks, everyone.
