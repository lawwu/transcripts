[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   [Silence]
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.480]   How does caffeine work to make us feel more alert?
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.320]   And does the timing in which we ingest caffeine
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.540]   play an important role in whether or not
[00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.840]   it works for us or against us?
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.720]   So maybe we just start with, how does caffeine work?
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.320]   Why is it that when I drink mate or coffee,
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.380]   which are my preferred sources of caffeine,
[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.140]   do I feel a mental and physical lift?
[00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.260]   - Yeah, so I'm going to suggest counter to what
[00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.700]   most people would think, drink coffee.
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.940]   - Or mate, is mate okay also?
[00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:37.780]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.280]   - Whatever form you enjoy.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.880]   - We'll come on to sort of why I suggest that,
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.980]   but when it comes to coffee, I would say
[00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.680]   the dose and the timing makes the poison.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.480]   So let's start with how caffeine works.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.700]   Caffeine is in a class of drugs that we call
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.840]   the psychoactive stimulants.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.340]   So it works through a variety of mechanisms.
[00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.780]   One is a dopamine mechanism, dopamine we often think of
[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.680]   as a reward chemical, but dopamine is also very much
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.580]   an alerting neurochemical as well.
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.240]   And caffeine has some role, it seems to play,
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.840]   in increasing dopamine, but its principle mode of action,
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.760]   we believe, in terms of making me more alert
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.480]   and keeping me awake throughout the day,
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.040]   is on the effects of adenosine.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.680]   And to explain what adenosine is,
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.680]   from the moment that you and I woke up this morning,
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.840]   this chemical adenosine has been building up in our brain.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.560]   And the longer that we're awake,
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.000]   the more of that adenosine accumulates.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.740]   - Where is this adenosine coming from
[00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.880]   and where is it accumulating?
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.560]   - Yeah, so the adenosine here that we're talking about
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.220]   that is creating the sleep pressure
[00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.560]   is a central brain phenomenon.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.880]   And it comes from the neurons themselves combusting energy.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.600]   And as they're combusting energy,
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.600]   one of the offshoots of that is this chemical adenosine.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.880]   And so as we're awake throughout the day
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.960]   and our brain is metabolically very active,
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.440]   it's accumulating and building up this adenosine.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.600]   Now, the more adenosine that we have,
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.800]   the sleepier that we will feel.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.300]   So it really is like a sleep pressure is what we call it.
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.520]   Now, it's not a mechanical pressure, don't worry.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.600]   Your head's not going to explode.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.080]   It's a chemical pressure.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.400]   And it's this weight of sleepiness
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.160]   that we feel gradually growing as we get into the evening.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.840]   - May I just interrupt you again to just ask,
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.640]   do we know what the circuit mechanism is for that?
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.280]   I mean, not to go too far down the rabbit hole,
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.280]   but for the aficionados and for myself,
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.920]   we have brain mechanisms like locus coeruleus
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.720]   that release things, brain areas,
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.240]   locus coeruleus just being a brain area, of course,
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.840]   that release things that proactively create wakefulness.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.560]   So are those neurons shutting down
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.600]   as a consequence of having too much adenosine
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.200]   or are there areas of the brain that promote sleepiness
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.800]   that are then coming activated?
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.360]   Because you can imagine both things working in parallel,
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.760]   one or the other would accomplish the same end point.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.920]   - Yeah, and it's both.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.880]   And so there are two main receptors for adenosine,
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.400]   the A1 receptor and the A2 receptor,
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.840]   and they have different modes of activating brain cells
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.400]   or inactivating or decreasing the likelihood of firing.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.280]   And adenosine works in this beautiful, elegant way
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.280]   where it will inhibit and shut down
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.080]   the wake-promoting areas of the brain,
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.160]   whilst also increasing and dialing up the volume
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.800]   on sleep-activating, sleep-promoting regions.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.640]   - Biology is so beautiful.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.080]   - Oh, it's fantastic. - It's always a push-pull.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.520]   So this is another example where as I am awake longer,
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.040]   adenosine is released in the brain
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.600]   and my wakefulness areas are being actively shut down
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.120]   by that adenosine and my sleepiness brain areas,
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.400]   so to speak, are being promoted to be more active.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.240]   Is that correct?
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.360]   - That's right, and it's a very progressive process.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.840]   It's not like a step function where,
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.320]   and sometimes that happens occasionally,
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.960]   but it's usually because you've been sort of driving through
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.800]   and, as we'll come on to, have caffeine in the system,
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.680]   and then all of a sudden you just hit a wall
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.000]   and it just, you know, engulfs you
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   and you go from a zero to the one of sleepiness
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.400]   within a short period of time.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.160]   Caffeine comes into play here
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.680]   because caffeine comes into your system
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.960]   and it latches onto those welcome sites of adenosine,
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.360]   the adenosine receptors.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.360]   But what it doesn't do is latch onto them and activate them
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.200]   because if it was doing that,
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.440]   then it would, you know, in lots of ways,
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.240]   it would dial up more sort of sleepiness.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.840]   It does the opposite.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.160]   The way that caffeine works is that it comes in,
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.280]   competes with quite sharp elbows with adenosine,
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.200]   competitively forces them out of the way,
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.720]   hijacks that receptor by latching onto it,
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.480]   but then just essentially blocks it.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.360]   It doesn't inactivate the receptor.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.880]   It doesn't activate the receptor.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.560]   It functionally inactivates it in the sense
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.520]   that it takes it out of the game for adenosine.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.000]   So it's like someone, you know, coming into a room
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.120]   and you're just about to sit down on the chair
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.920]   and caffeine comes in and just pulls out the chair
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.680]   and you're like, well, now I've got nowhere to sit.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.840]   And caffeine just keeps pulling out the chairs
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.060]   from adenosine and adenosine,
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.120]   even though it's at the same concentration in your brain,
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.040]   your brain doesn't know that you've been awake for,
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.260]   you know, 10 hours, 16 hours at that point
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.660]   when you've downed a cup of coffee,
[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.680]   because all of that adenosine that's still there
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.760]   can't communicate to the brain
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.200]   that you've been awake for 16 hours because-
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.960]   - But the adenosine is still in brain circulation.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.800]   - Correct.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.560]   - So the real question is what happens
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.880]   when caffeine is dislodged from the adenosine receptor?
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.240]   - Unfortunate things happen.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.320]   And that's what we call the caffeine crash,
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.320]   which is caffeine has a half-life and it's metabolized.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.360]   - Do you recall what the half-life is?
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.000]   - Yeah, the half-life is somewhere between five to six hours
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.760]   and the quarter-life therefore is somewhere
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.800]   between 10 to 12 hours.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.880]   It's variable.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.440]   Different people have different durations of its action,
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.940]   but for the average adult, five to six hours.
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.400]   That variation, we understand, it's down to a liver enzyme
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.800]   or a set of liver enzymes of the class
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.920]   that we call the cytochrome P450 enzymes.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.720]   And there are, I think last I delved into the data,
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.440]   which was pretty recently, there are two gene variants
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.920]   that will dictate the enzymatic speed
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.620]   with which the liver breaks down caffeine.
[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.060]   And that's why you can have some people
[00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.440]   who are very sensitive to caffeine
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.040]   and other people who say, you know,
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.600]   I'm just, it doesn't affect me really that much at all.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.120]   - These are the people that have a double espresso
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.760]   after a 9 p.m. dinner and can sleep just fine.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.600]   - Well, and we'll come on to--
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.520]   - Or at least subjectively, they think they're sleeping.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.360]   - Subjectively, yeah.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.440]   And we should speak about that, that assumptive danger too.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.920]   So then the caffeine is in the system
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.740]   and after some time period,
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.040]   it will be inactive in the system.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.280]   So let's say that, you know,
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.280]   I've been awake for 12 hours now and it's, you know, 8 p.m.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.960]   and I'm feeling a bit tired, but I want to push through
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.600]   and I want to keep working for another couple of hours.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.200]   So I have a cup of coffee.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.280]   All of a sudden I was feeling tired,
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.400]   but I don't feel like I've been awake for 12 hours anymore
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.500]   because with the caffeine in the system,
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:47.200]   maybe only half of that adenosine is being communicated
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.080]   through the receptor to my brain.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.700]   100% of the adenosine is still there.
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.000]   Only half of it is allowed to communicate to my brain.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.320]   So now I think, oh, I haven't been awake for 12 hours,
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.960]   I've just been awake for six hours, I feel great.
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.600]   Then after a few hours,
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.720]   and the caffeine is starting to come out of my system,
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.840]   not only am I hit with the same levels of adenosine
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.560]   that I had before I'd had the cup of coffee
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.920]   several hours ago,
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.000]   it's that plus all of the adenosine that's been building up
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.320]   during the time that the caffeine has been in my system.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.240]   - So sort of an avalanche of adenosine.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.560]   - It is a tsunami wave, yeah, and that's the caffeine crash.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.960]   - And it's interesting because the caffeine crash
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.000]   at two o'clock in the afternoon when you have work to do
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.520]   is a terrible thing, but what about the person,
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.800]   maybe this person is me in my 20s,
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.480]   who says, I'm going to drink caffeine all day long,
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:43.120]   and then I want the crash because at nine or 10 p.m.,
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.400]   if I stop drinking caffeine at say 6 p.m. and I crash,
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.880]   then I crash into a slumber, a deep night of sleep.
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.260]   Is that sleep really as deep as I think it is?
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.320]   Because given the half-life of caffeine
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.080]   that you mentioned a few moments ago,
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.580]   I have to imagine that having some of that caffeine
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.200]   circulating in my system might disrupt the depth of sleep
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.840]   or somehow the architecture of sleep in a way
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.480]   that even if I get eight or who knows,
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.080]   even 10 hours of sleep,
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.560]   it might not be as restorative as I would like it to be.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.660]   - Yeah, and that is the danger,
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.840]   just sort of those people that you described who say,
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.420]   and a lot of them will speak with me too,
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.080]   say, look, I can have two espressos with dinner
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.480]   and I fall asleep fine and I stay asleep,
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.840]   because usually those are the two phenotypes
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.080]   that we typically see with too much caffeine.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.720]   I just can't fall asleep as easily as I want to,
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.160]   or I fall asleep, but I just can't stay asleep.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.800]   And caffeine can do both of those things quite potently.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.160]   - How late in the day do you think is,
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.280]   assuming somebody, translate this, folks,
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.680]   if you go to bed earlier or later,
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.320]   you have to shift the hours accordingly,
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.580]   but given somebody who typically gets into bed
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:56.100]   around 10, 10, 30 and falls asleep around 11, 11, 30,
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:01.280]   when would you recommend they halt caffeine intake?
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.240]   And these are not strict prescriptives,
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.480]   but I think people do benefit
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.060]   from having some fairly clear guidelines
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.580]   of what might work for them.
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:13.640]   Would you say cut off caffeine by what time of the day?
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.440]   - I would usually say, take your typical bedtime
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.320]   and count back sort of somewhere between 10 to eight hours
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.960]   is probably getting a little bit close,
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.840]   but take back sort of 10 hours or eight hours of time.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.780]   That's the time when you should really stop,
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.700]   you know, using caffeine is the suggestion.
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.380]   And the reason is because for those people
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.600]   who even just keep drinking up until,
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.040]   you know, into the evening,
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.140]   you're right that they can fall asleep fine,
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.180]   maybe they stay asleep,
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:45.260]   but the depth of their deep sleep is not as deep anymore.
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.620]   And so there are two consequences.
[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.020]   The first is that for me,
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.780]   and it can be up to by 30%,
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.300]   and for me to drop your deep sleep by 30%,
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.060]   I'd have to age you by between 10 to 12 years,
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.980]   or you can just do it every night to yourself
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.180]   with a couple of espressos.
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:06.100]   The second is that you then wake up the next morning
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.340]   and you think, well, I didn't have problems falling asleep
[00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.980]   and I didn't have problems staying asleep,
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.460]   but I don't feel particularly restored by my sleep.
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.300]   So now I'm reaching for three or four cups of coffee
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.440]   the next morning rather than just two or three cups
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.280]   of coffee.
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.900]   And so goes this dependency cycle
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.500]   that you then need your uppers to wake you up
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.620]   in the morning.
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.660]   And then sometimes people will use alcohol in the evening
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.940]   to bring them down because they're overly caffeinated.
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.780]   And alcohol, and we can speak about that too,
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.940]   also has very deleterious impacts on your sleep as well.
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.780]   (upbeat music)
