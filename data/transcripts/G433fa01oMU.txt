[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400]   The following is a conversation with Vincent Recaniello,
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.120]   professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.840]   Vincent is one of the best educators in biology
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.960]   and in general that I've ever had the pleasure
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.360]   of speaking with.
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.680]   I highly recommend you check out his
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.040]   This Week in Virology podcast
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.520]   and watch his introductory lectures on YouTube.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.920]   In particular, the playlist I recommend
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.720]   is called Virology Lectures 2021.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.040]   To support this podcast,
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.720]   please check out the sponsors in the description.
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.400]   As a side note, please allow me to say a few words
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.320]   about the COVID vaccines.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.000]   Some people are scared of a virus hurting
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.280]   or killing somebody they love.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.720]   Some are scared of their government betraying them,
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.520]   their leaders blinded by power and greed.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.160]   I have both of these fears.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.160]   And two, I'm afraid, as FDR said, of fear itself.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.320]   Fear manifests as anger and anger leads to division
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.400]   in the hands of charismatic leaders
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.800]   who then manufacture "truth" in quotes
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.360]   that maximize controversy and a sense of imminent crisis
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.320]   that only they can save us from.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.120]   And though I'm sometimes mocked for this,
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.720]   I still believe that love, compassion, empathy
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.640]   is the way out from this vicious downward spiral
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.480]   of division.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.320]   I personally took the vaccine
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.480]   based on my understanding of the data,
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.600]   deciding that for me,
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.800]   the risk of negative effects from COVID short-term
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.160]   and long-term are far worse than the negative effects
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.680]   from the mRNA vaccine.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.520]   I read, I thought, I decided, for me.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.280]   But I never have and never will talk down to people
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.160]   who don't take the vaccine.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.520]   I'm humble enough to know just how little I know,
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.280]   how wrong I have been and will be
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.040]   on many of my beliefs and ideas.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.000]   I think dogmatic certainty and division
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.600]   is more destructive in the long-term than any virus.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.400]   The solution for me, personally, like I said,
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.520]   is to choose empathy and compassion
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.240]   towards all fellow human beings,
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.600]   no matter who they voted for.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.280]   I hope you do the same.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.720]   Read, think, and try to imagine
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.920]   that what you currently think is the truth
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.840]   may be totally wrong.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.840]   This mindset is one that opens you to discovery,
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.600]   innovation, and wisdom.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.120]   I hope my conversation with Vincent Racaniello
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.080]   is a useful resource for just this kind of exploration.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.000]   He doesn't talk down to people,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.480]   and he's the most knowledgeable virologist
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.160]   I've ever spoken to.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.040]   He has no political agenda,
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.280]   no desire to mock those who disagree with him.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.080]   He just loves biology
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.360]   and explaining the fundamental mechanisms
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.120]   of how biological systems work.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.800]   That's a great person to listen to
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.080]   and learn from with an open mind.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.960]   I hope you join me in doing so,
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.200]   and no matter what,
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.840]   try to put more love out there in the world.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.600]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.080]   and here is my conversation with Vincent Racaniello.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.560]   You mentioned in one of your lectures on virology
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.960]   that there are more viruses in a liter of coastal seawater
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.680]   than people on Earth.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.640]   In the Nature article titled "Microbiology by Numbers,"
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.680]   it says there are 10 to the 31 viruses on Earth.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.440]   Also, it says that the rate of viral infection in the ocean
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.280]   stands at 10 to the 23 infections per second,
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.560]   and these infections remove 20 to 40%
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.240]   of all bacterial cells each day.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.880]   There's a war going on.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.320]   What do you make of these numbers?
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.440]   Why are there so many viruses?
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.640]   - So the numbers you're quoting,
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.960]   they're in my first virology lecture, right?
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.760]   'Cause people don't know these numbers,
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.600]   and they get, whoa, they get wowed by them,
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.200]   so I love to give them.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.800]   - By the way, sorry to interrupt,
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.720]   but as I was saying offline,
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.360]   you have one of the best introductory lectures on virology
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.760]   that I've ever seen, introductory lectures period,
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.920]   so I highly recommend people find you on YouTube
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.520]   and watch it if you're curious at all about viruses.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.000]   Yeah, there's a lot of times throughout watching it,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.560]   I felt like, whoa.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.320]   - Yeah, that's my goal is to,
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.840]   and it's what my students tell me.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.240]   One student once said, "Every day after every lecture,
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.940]   "I could go home and tell my roommate something
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.880]   "she didn't know and blew her away."
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.160]   So the number of viruses is really an amazing number.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.040]   So that number, 10 to the 31,
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.840]   is actually just the bacterial viruses in the ocean.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.480]   So there are viruses that infect everything on the planet,
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.440]   including bacteria.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.760]   There are a lot of bacteria in the ocean,
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.400]   and so 10 to the 31 is from basically
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.240]   particle counts of seawater all over the world.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.600]   So there are more viruses than 10 to the 31,
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.960]   but just in the ocean, and that number is so big.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.360]   First of all, the mass exceeds that of elephants
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.060]   on the planet by a thousandfold.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.960]   And if you lined up those viruses end to end,
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.840]   they would go 200 million light years into space.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.240]   It's so big a number.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.100]   It's amazing.
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.660]   And then, yes, 10 to the 20-some infections per second
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.340]   of these viruses killing bacteria
[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.800]   and releasing all this organic matter,
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.600]   and that's part of this,
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.320]   what we call the biogeochemical pump,
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.780]   cycling of material in the ocean.
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.720]   The bacteria die, they start to sink,
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.480]   and then they get metabolized and converted
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.280]   to compounds that are needed.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.040]   A lot of it gets released as carbon dioxide and so forth.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.920]   So these are actually really important cycles
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.600]   that are catalyzed by the virus.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.440]   - Well, it's so wild that nature has developed
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.760]   a mechanism for mass murder of bacteria.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.940]   - That's one way to look at it,
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.920]   but it's just what happened, right?
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:03.760]   - It's interesting.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.480]   I mean, I wonder what the evolutionary advantage
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.920]   of such fast cycling of life is.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.480]   Is it just an accident of evolution
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.280]   that viruses are so numerous,
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.920]   or is it a feature, not a bug?
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.440]   - So the fast is, it's not all fast.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.760]   Not all viruses are fast.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.840]   Some are 20 minutes per cycle.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.860]   Some take weeks per cycle.
[00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.680]   But that's just per second.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.680]   There's so many viruses in the ocean
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.940]   that that's what you get per second,
[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.360]   no matter how fast the cycle is.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.840]   But I look at it this way.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.060]   Viruses were probably the first organic entities
[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.240]   to evolve on the planet.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.840]   Long ago, billion years ago,
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.520]   just as the Earth cooled and organic molecules
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.900]   began to form, I think these self,
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.460]   we call them self-replicators.
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.040]   They're just short things that today would look like RNA,
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.840]   which is the basis of many viruses, right?
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.880]   They evolved and they were able to replicate.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.280]   Of course, they were just naked molecules.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.600]   They had no protection.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.160]   And it was just RNA-based.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.400]   And that's tough because RNA is pretty fragile in the world,
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.560]   and it probably didn't get very big as a consequence.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.240]   But then proteins evolved,
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.160]   and I'm skipping like hundreds of millions
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.200]   of years of evolution.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.400]   Proteins evolved maybe without a cell,
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.100]   maybe with a cell.
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.920]   But then to make a cell,
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.440]   there probably were some RNA-based cells early on,
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.920]   but they were pretty simple.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.480]   But the cells that we know of today,
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.080]   even bacteria and single-celled eukaryotes,
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.400]   they have very long DNA genomes.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.000]   And you need a lot of DNA to make a complicated cell.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   And so we think at some point, the RNA became DNA.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.160]   And probably one of the earliest enzymes that arose
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.540]   is the enzyme that could copy that RNA into DNA,
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.120]   which we now know today as reverse transcriptase,
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.640]   which my former boss, David Baltimore
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.220]   and Howard Temin co-discovered.
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:19.220]   And that enzyme arose and copied RNA to DNA,
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.140]   and then you could build big cells with,
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.980]   'cause DNA can be millions and millions
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.100]   of bases in length.
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:30.100]   And RNA, the longest RNA we know of is 40,000 bases,
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.940]   not much bigger than the SARS-CoV-2.
[00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.240]   - What would you say is the magic moment along that line?
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.960]   I saw it was one or two billion,
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:44.960]   maybe three billion years it took to go from bacteria
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.280]   to the complex organism.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.480]   It seems like Earth had a very long time,
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.880]   but not a very long time without life,
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.800]   and then a very long time with very primitive life.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.000]   Maybe I'm discriminating, calling bacteria primitive life.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.240]   - Yeah, people would object to you doing that for sure.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.820]   - But it seems like complex organisms,
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.080]   when it starts becoming something like,
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.340]   I don't know what's a good, not animal-like,
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.900]   but more complexity than just like a single cell.
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.060]   What do you think is the magic there?
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.020]   What's the hardest thing?
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.660]   If you were trying to engineer Earth and build life
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.120]   and build the simulations,
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.940]   obviously we're living in a video game, what this is.
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.180]   So if you were trying to build this video,
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.100]   what's the hardest part along this evolution pathway?
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.140]   - So bacteria are mostly single cells.
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.180]   They do make colonies, they get together in biofilms,
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.180]   which are really important,
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.900]   but they're all single bacteria in that,
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.820]   and the key is making an organism
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.420]   where cells do different things.
[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.780]   We have skin cells and eye cells and brain cells.
[00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.580]   Bacteria never do that, and the reason is probably energy.
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.980]   Bacteria can't make enough energy to do that.
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.540]   And so there was another cell existing at the time,
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.380]   the archaea,
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:10.220]   and the idea is that a bacteria went into an archaea
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.180]   and became the modern-day mitochondria,
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.020]   the energy factory of the cell,
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.980]   and that now let that cell develop
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.900]   into more and more complicated organisms
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:20.740]   like we have today.
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:21.860]   It was all about energy.
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.780]   - So the mitochondria, the energy,
[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.480]   the mitochondria is the magic thing.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.320]   - I think so.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.500]   It's actually not my idea, it's Nick Jones.
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.620]   Have you heard of Nick Jones?
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.540]   He's an evolutionary biologist in the UK,
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.460]   and he's done experimental work on this,
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.460]   and it's his idea that the defining point
[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.860]   was the ability to make a lot of energy,
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.140]   which a mitochondria can do.
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.260]   It's basically a whole bacteria inside of a bigger cell,
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260]   and that becomes what we now call eukaryotes,
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.700]   and that they can get more and more complicated.
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.220]   So let me bring you back to the viruses.
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.340]   I wanna finish that story.
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.320]   - Yeah, which points of viruses come along?
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.840]   - So remember, we have these precellular,
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.520]   they're called precellular replicons, right?
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.260]   And so we have a precellular stage
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.740]   where we have these self-replicating molecules,
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.620]   and then cells arise,
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:15.620]   and then the self-replicating molecules invade the cells.
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:16.620]   Why?
[00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.060]   Because it's a hospitable environment.
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.260]   I mean, they didn't know that.
[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.100]   They just went in,
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.800]   and it turned out it was beneficial for them,
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.640]   so it stuck, and they replicate inside the cell now
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.540]   where they have pools of everything they need.
[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.300]   They get more and more complicated,
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.940]   and then they steal proteins from the cell
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.300]   to build a protective shell.
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:37.020]   And then they can be released as virus particles.
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:37.900]   They're now protected.
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.020]   They can move from host to host,
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.640]   and because they're at the earliest stages
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.580]   of cellular evolution,
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.500]   they can diversify to infect anything that arises,
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:52.380]   and that is why I think there's so many of them,
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.620]   and everything on the planet is infected
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.140]   because the ancestor of everything
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.540]   was infected many years ago.
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:01.740]   - So it's easier to steal than to build from scratch.
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:05.340]   So it's easier to sort of break into somebody else's thing
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.460]   and steal their proteins.
[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.580]   - Yes.
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:11.460]   My colleague, Dixon de Pommier, calls viruses safe crackers.
[00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.740]   - Safe crackers.
[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.980]   So it's just, from an evolutionary perspective,
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:20.780]   yeah, it's easier to steal because you can select,
[00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.380]   but then you have to figure out mechanisms for stealing,
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.700]   for breaking into, for cracking the safe.
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:26.980]   - Well, you don't have to figure out.
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.620]   It just happens, right?
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.980]   Because molecules are so diverse
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.420]   that a molecule gets into a cell,
[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.820]   and if there's a protein that sticks to it,
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:39.460]   it's gonna stick, and that gives an advantage.
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.180]   There's no planning.
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.100]   There's no thinking about it, right?
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.020]   It just happens.
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.460]   - Oh, we'll return to that.
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:48.940]   (Lex laughing)
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.900]   But these numbers are crazy.
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:55.900]   So what, as these more complex organisms evolved,
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.060]   let's take us humans as an example,
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.420]   should we be afraid of these high numbers?
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:02.700]   Should we be worried that there's
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.140]   so many viruses in the world?
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.300]   - Well, to a certain extent.
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.260]   I mean, it's twofold.
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.340]   They're good and bad, right?
[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.060]   Viruses are no, there's no question they can be bad,
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.060]   and we know that because they've infected
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.500]   and caused disease throughout history,
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.900]   but we're also, you and I are full of viruses
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.180]   that don't hurt us at all and probably help us,
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.980]   and every organism is the same,
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:25.860]   so they are clearly beneficial as a consequence.
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:30.860]   So I think, so every living thing on the planet
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:35.780]   has multiple viruses infecting everything you can see,
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:39.580]   and most of them I think we don't worry about
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.340]   because they can't infect us.
[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:42.180]   They're unable.
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:46.020]   In fact, now you can actually take your feces
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.060]   and send them to a company,
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.980]   and they will sequence your viruses in your feces for you,
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.260]   your fecal virome, right?
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:57.260]   And the most common virus in human feces
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.540]   is a plant virus that infects peppers.
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.140]   It's called pepper model mosaic virus,
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.060]   and that's 'cause people eat a lot of peppers,
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.700]   and it just passes right through you.
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.180]   Cabbage is full of viruses from the insects
[00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.900]   that walk on the cabbage in the fields.
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.060]   We eat them.
[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.140]   They just pass us.
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:16.380]   So I think most of the viruses we don't need to worry about
[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.520]   except when we're talking about species
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.580]   that are closest to us, mammals, of course.
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.380]   And I think the most numerous ones
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.580]   are the most concerning.
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.380]   They're viruses like bats.
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:33.380]   Bats are 20% of mammals, and rodents are 40% of mammals.
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:37.100]   And we humans live nearby, right?
[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.620]   And we know throughout history,
[00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.500]   many viruses have come from bats and from rodents to people,
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.340]   no question about it.
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.620]   - So there's a proximity in terms of just living together
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.260]   and a proximity genetically too,
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.420]   so it's more likely a virus will jump from a bat
[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:50.260]   than a rodent.
[00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:51.080]   - And birds too.
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.940]   Birds can give us their viruses.
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:53.940]   That's happened.
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:57.140]   Influenza viruses come from birds mainly.
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.700]   So I think those are the three species,
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.720]   not species, it's higher than species obviously,
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.300]   but those are the three I would worry about
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.980]   in terms of getting their viruses.
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.540]   And we don't really know what's out there, right?
[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.520]   We have very little clue about what viruses.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.500]   And I've for years wanted to capture wild mice
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.660]   in my backyard and see what viruses they have
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:19.620]   'cause no one knows.
[00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.820]   And it's an easy--
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.780]   - We can't ask them, so you mean map,
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:24.620]   like is there a way to--
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:25.440]   - I can't ask them, yeah.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.620]   No, I would have to sacrifice them and take tissue
[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:30.060]   and then bring it in the lab and do genome sequencing.
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.180]   - So you can do a thorough sequencing
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.820]   to determine which viruses.
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:37.420]   Is there a sufficiently good categorization of viruses
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:38.260]   where you'd be--
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.100]   - That's a very good question.
[00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.660]   So whenever you do sequence, right?
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.180]   You get some environmental sample
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.140]   and you extract nucleic acid and you sequence it.
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.700]   What you do is you run it past the database.
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.140]   The gold standard is the GenBank database
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:54.340]   which is maintained here in the US.
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.620]   And you see if you get any hits.
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.540]   And then you can say, ah, look,
[00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:01.100]   this sequence is similar to this virus
[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.540]   and you can classify all the viruses you see.
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:08.540]   The problem is 90% of your sequence is dark matter.
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.140]   It doesn't hit with anything.
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:14.500]   It's probably a lot of it is unknown viruses
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.060]   and that's gonna be hard to figure out
[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:17.620]   'cause someone's gonna have to go after it
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:18.940]   and sort it through.
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.600]   So yes, you can find a lot of viruses
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.940]   and the numbers you get are astounding.
[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.180]   You can find thousands of new viruses
[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.140]   just by looking in various life forms.
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.380]   But there are many more that we don't pick up
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.180]   because they're not in the database.
[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:36.100]   - Maybe this is a good time to take a quick tangent.
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.020]   What do you think about AlphaFold2?
[00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.260]   I don't know if you've been paying attention to that.
[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:44.180]   With them, DeepMind solving the protein folding problem
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.820]   and then also releasing, first of all,
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.100]   open sourcing the code,
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.260]   which is for me as a software person, I love.
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.340]   And then second of all,
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:57.860]   also making like 300,000 predictions or something like that
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:01.460]   for different protein structures and releasing that data.
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:06.620]   On the side of, 'cause you're saying there's dark matter.
[00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:12.700]   Is there something, first, what are your general thoughts,
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.900]   level of excitement about their work?
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.420]   And second, how can that be applied to viruses?
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.660]   Do you think we'll be able to explore the dark matter
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.540]   of virology using machine learning?
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:26.820]   - Absolutely, 'cause in all this dark sequence,
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:29.900]   you can translate it and make a protein.
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.500]   You can see what a protein looks like.
[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.020]   It has what we call an open reading frame, right?
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.300]   A start and a stop.
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.520]   And right now it's just a bunch of amino acids.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.820]   But if we could fold it,
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:43.220]   maybe the fold would be like something we already know,
[00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:46.500]   some protein fold, which gives you a lot of clues, right?
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.700]   'Cause there are only so many protein folds in biology
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.660]   and that dark matter is probably one of them.
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.240]   So I think that's very exciting because for years,
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:59.580]   I followed structural biologists for years.
[00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.980]   And in the beginning,
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.020]   we couldn't even solve structures of viruses.
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:04.860]   They're too big.
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.820]   We could do small molecules like myoglobin.
[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:07.900]   That was the first one done.
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.420]   Took years to do that.
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:13.060]   Then as computational power increased,
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.820]   then they could start to do viruses, but it took a long time.
[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.460]   X-ray crystallography,
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:21.580]   depending on getting crystals of the virus, right?
[00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.480]   And now we can do cryo-electron microscopy,
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.380]   which is much faster.
[00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.660]   You could solve, the spike of SARS-CoV-2
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.460]   was solved in two months by Jason McClelland here
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.900]   in Austin, actually, at the beginning of the pandemic.
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:35.780]   But you're limited.
[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:38.780]   You can't do huge proteins.
[00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.180]   You can only do moderately sized ones.
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:45.500]   So, or actually, you can do viruses,
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.060]   but you can't do small proteins.
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.740]   So that's speeded it up, but it's still too fast to solve.
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.760]   You get a new protein, you want to solve its structure.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:53.900]   So if we could predict it,
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.980]   and I know from talking to structural biologists,
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.300]   this has been their holy grail from day one.
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.940]   They want to be able to take a sequence of a protein,
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.340]   put it in a computer and have the structure put out
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.220]   without having to do all the experiment.
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.620]   So that's why this is very exciting that you can predict it.
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:10.780]   I mean, it's not finished, obviously,
[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.940]   and there's more to do, but I think it will be a day
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.540]   where you could take any amino acid sequence
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.340]   and predict what it's going to look like.
[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.380]   - See, but aren't structural biologists going to get greedy?
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:21.740]   So once you have that,
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.060]   don't you want to go more complicated then?
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.460]   Don't you want to go,
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.660]   'cause that's just the first step, right?
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.500]   To go from amino acid to structure,
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.140]   then there's multiple protein interactions.
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.380]   Like, how do you get to the virus?
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.020]   - Well, so that's what the ultimate goal
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.700]   of getting a structure is, that then you can do experiments
[00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.420]   and figure out what the structure means, right?
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.860]   So many, in the old days,
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:48.180]   structural biology was a career in itself.
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:49.980]   You worked with people who had a system
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.340]   and just solved proteins for them,
[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.500]   and then you moved on to another one.
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.180]   You didn't really do any experiments.
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.980]   The other people got to do all the interesting experiments.
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:01.980]   Now, young structural biologists are multifaceted.
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.220]   They solve the structure, and then they say,
[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.500]   "What happens if we change this amino acid?
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.940]   "Oh, look, it blocks binding to the receptor.
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.260]   "This must be the receptor binding interface."
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.420]   So that's the exciting stuff, absolutely,
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.500]   is doing the experiment.
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:18.820]   - I wonder if you can do some kinds of simulations
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:23.820]   of different proteins or multi-protein systems
[00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:26.340]   going to war against each other,
[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:29.620]   like to try to figure out...
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:35.380]   Reinforcement learning is used in AlphaZero, for example,
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.060]   to learn chess and Go,
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.220]   and that's using the self-play mechanism,
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.340]   where the thing plays against itself
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.820]   and learns better and better.
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:46.660]   I wonder if you can simulate almost evolution in that way
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.580]   for primitive biological systems,
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.620]   have them in simulation fight each other,
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:53.620]   and then see what comes out,
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.660]   like a super dangerous virus comes out,
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.500]   or super Chuck Norris type of thing
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.660]   that defends against the super dangerous virus,
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:01.820]   and it's all in simulation.
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.180]   - So an example would be,
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:07.860]   we have all these variants of SARS-CoV-2 arising, right?
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:12.860]   Which look to be selected by immune responses,
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:17.300]   but we know what amino acids are changing in the spike,
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.100]   and how they block antibody binding.
[00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.300]   You could simulate that.
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:24.940]   You could say, "What is the antibody looking at?"
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.380]   Where antibodies bind on proteins are called epitopes,
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:28.220]   right?
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.380]   You could map them all and change them in a simulation
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:32.060]   one by one, and go back and forth
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.780]   between the antibody and the virus.
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:38.380]   So all these, evolution is what we call an arms race, right?
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.620]   The virus changes, and then it evades the host,
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.220]   and then the host can change.
[00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.220]   The host takes longer to change though, unfortunately.
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.940]   It takes geological time, but it can,
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.620]   and then the virus can change,
[00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:50.620]   and it can go back and forth.
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:54.340]   And we can see evidence of this in genome sequences
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.220]   of both viruses and their hosts.
[00:21:56.220 --> 00:22:00.020]   And so you can take a protein in a host
[00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:02.700]   that is a receptor for multiple viruses,
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.700]   and you can see all the impacts of virus pressure on it,
[00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.260]   and you could simulate that for sure.
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:08.980]   And that's just one thing that you could do.
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:13.660]   You could simulate changes in, say, an enzyme
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.060]   that makes it resistant to a drug,
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.060]   and predict all the drug resistance.
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:21.220]   But the problem is, people like me,
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:23.380]   the experimental virologist, don't know how to do
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:27.220]   any of that, so we need to collaborate with people.
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.660]   I guess-- - Oh, with other humans.
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.420]   - We do that, we do that. - Okay.
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:35.660]   - But with people from a field that we're not used to,
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:39.060]   I suppose people who, would it be AI, I suppose?
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:39.980]   - Yeah, machine learning people.
[00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.020]   - Machine learning people, and you would say,
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:44.300]   "Look, this is the biological problem.
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.900]   "Is there a way we can use your tools to attack it?"
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:51.660]   - The problem is those people are antisocial introverts
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:55.820]   that have a place like this, and try to hide
[00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.100]   from other people in the world.
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.100]   It's very difficult to find in the wild.
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.980]   - Okay, so outside of doing amazing,
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:07.980]   brilliant lectures online, you host and produce
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:10.940]   five, I would say, related podcasts,
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:14.500]   including my favorite this week in virology,
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.080]   also this week in parasitism,
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.420]   this week in microbiology, and so on.
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.780]   So you're a good person to ask,
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:24.600]   "What are the categories of small things,
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.980]   "small biological things in this world that can kill you,
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.660]   "kill us humans?"
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:34.060]   - You said most viruses are friendly,
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.500]   or at least not unfriendly,
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.640]   but let's look at the unfriendly ones,
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.180]   in viruses and bacteria and those kinds of things.
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.620]   When you look at the full spectrum
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.260]   of things that can kill you,
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.260]   can you kind of paint a brief picture?
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:50.740]   - Yeah, I think the big picture is that
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.780]   the things that can kill you are a minority
[00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.340]   of everything that's out there.
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:57.260]   And we're talking about molecules.
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:00.540]   So we have in us proteins that can kill us,
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:04.620]   prions, that are just, it's a protein in us,
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:08.220]   and if it misfolds, it makes all of its other copies
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:11.740]   misfold, and then you die of a neurological disease.
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:12.740]   That's pretty rare.
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:16.540]   So there are proteins, there are viruses.
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:20.260]   As I said, only certain ones can kill us.
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.000]   But even if we get those from animals,
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.500]   it's not straightforward.
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.820]   If you look at SARS-CoV-2, right?
[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:31.180]   This is probably a once in 100 year pandemic, I would say.
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.780]   Equivalent to 1918 in its devastation.
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.580]   And in between there have been smaller pandemics
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:39.640]   of other viruses, but it doesn't happen all that often.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.520]   So we have a lot of viruses, we have a lot of bacteria
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:46.280]   of various sorts that can cause infections in us.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.280]   And it's a limited number, right?
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.660]   You're streptococci and staphylococci and clostridia,
[00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:54.140]   we could go on and on.
[00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.420]   But we know how to handle those,
[00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:58.300]   as long as we have antimicrobials.
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.420]   It's just that we abuse them and we get resistance,
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.180]   so that can be a problem.
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.060]   Then we have fungi.
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:06.420]   Not mushrooms, but much smaller fungi
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:09.480]   that multiply submicroscopic,
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.420]   or just at the microscopic level.
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.940]   They can, in dry climates of the US,
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.300]   you can inhale their spores and they can grow in your lung
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.840]   if you're immunosuppressed and so forth.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.100]   So those are the tiny guys.
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.340]   And then we have parasites,
[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.980]   which we do this week in parasitism,
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:29.980]   where single cells, even worms of various sorts,
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:33.400]   can invade you and cause all sorts of problems.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:37.220]   - I was kind of terrified to listen to that podcast.
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.020]   What's it like?
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:46.260]   - What you learn is that you travel somewhere
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.700]   and you can get infected and bring it back home.
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:52.640]   Here in the US, we do have certain kinds of parasites,
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.980]   but because of our lifestyle,
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:56.580]   we more or less have avoided them.
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:00.460]   For example, there's a parasite called toxoplasma,
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.960]   which is infected most of the world, actually,
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.180]   because a lot of people like to eat raw meat
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.420]   and you would get it from raw meat.
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:12.300]   And we're not as fond of that here in the US.
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.340]   We like to cook our meat,
[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:16.420]   but that could be a consequence of eating raw meat.
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:19.860]   - Is that what leads to, what is it called, toxoplasmosis?
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.800]   - Yeah, so toxoplasmosis,
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:27.300]   it's mainly a big issue is if you're pregnant
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.420]   and you get toxo,
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:32.540]   then your fetus is gonna be very badly malformed.
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:35.020]   It's gonna have brain defects and so forth.
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:39.500]   And animals can get it as well.
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.300]   So there are a lot of parasites of that nature,
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.300]   which you often acquire by food,
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.020]   eating food of different sorts.
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:46.780]   And it usually happens elsewhere.
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:50.880]   We just, on this week in parasitism, we do a case.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.360]   So Daniel Griffin is a resident physician.
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.500]   He's a doctor, a real doctor, right?
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.700]   And every month he comes up with a case.
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.920]   Okay, this is a person I saw.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:05.020]   And last month this young lady had traveled somewhere
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:09.660]   and she ate raw fish.
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.980]   It was somewhere Southeast Asia or something.
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.900]   And she ended up with red bumps all over her skin.
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.760]   And it turned out it was a parasite from the fish
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.900]   that moved around in her.
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:21.740]   And they're very easy to cure.
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.740]   We have the right doctors and the right drugs.
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:24.580]   You can cure all these.
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:26.020]   - What about diagnose?
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:28.820]   Like connect the red spots to the fact that it's a parasite?
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:31.260]   - Very easy if you have the right diagnostics.
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:33.100]   Now Daniel often goes to parts of the world
[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:34.580]   where they don't have diagnostics
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.240]   and he has to use other mechanisms.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:40.340]   He may have to take a bit and look at it under a microscope.
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:41.960]   And then he may not be able to get the drug
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.840]   depending on where he is.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:47.180]   But often he sees patients who come back to the US
[00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.640]   and they get diarrhea or they have a fever.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.700]   And he says, "Where have you been?"
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.220]   And he can put two and two together.
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.820]   And so we let our listeners do that
[00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:55.260]   and they all send in guesses.
[00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:57.860]   And it's wonderful to hear them go through this.
[00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:58.700]   So there are a lot of parasites--
[00:27:58.700 --> 00:27:59.900]   - Solve the puzzle and solve the case study.
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:00.740]   - That can get you.
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:03.380]   You have to be careful about eating when you go overseas.
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:04.660]   - And water too?
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:05.540]   - Water as well.
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:09.220]   And in parts of Africa there are parasites in the lakes.
[00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.820]   And if you go swimming they can invade you.
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.100]   And in fact they can go into your hair follicles
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.980]   and burrow in and get into your bloodstream.
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:16.980]   - That's exciting.
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.320]   So Daniel is interesting 'cause he's very adventurous
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.800]   and he's not afraid of any of this.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:26.040]   So there's a famous lake in Africa, Lake Malawi,
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.480]   which harbors a lot of these parasites.
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.240]   And he said, "Oh yeah, yeah, I just make sure
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.240]   "I towel off vigorously when I get out."
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.200]   (laughing)
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.040]   - Vigorously.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:34.880]   - Get rid of them.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.180]   And that was the name of an episode.
[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:38.020]   But you know food is--
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:38.960]   - Towel off vigorously?
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:43.400]   - You know sushi, you can get worms from sushi.
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.800]   And the solution is to freeze it.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.880]   And many sushi restaurants now have liquid nitrogen.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.320]   They snap freeze their sushi
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.000]   and that kills all the parasites.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.400]   And a study was actually done in Japan
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.240]   showing that freezing does not alter the taste of sushi
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.080]   because it's--
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:00.900]   - Uh-oh.
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:01.740]   - Except for you see a big industry there.
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:02.580]   - Wow, that's brilliant.
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:03.400]   (laughing)
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.440]   That's brilliant.
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.760]   Yeah, I was thinking about, you know,
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.880]   I'm so boring and bland,
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.640]   especially when I'm now in Texas here
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.280]   and I've been eating quite a bit of barbecue.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:18.960]   I realized I really haven't explored the culinary world.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.300]   And I've been curious to travel and taste different foods.
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:25.080]   Is there something you can say by way of advice,
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.800]   you know, channeling Daniel, I guess,
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.060]   if you were to travel in the world,
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.580]   if eating is the thing that gets you the parasites,
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:39.200]   what's good advice for eating in strange parts of the world,
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.780]   Mongolia, India, China?
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.840]   Is there something you could say by way of advice?
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.240]   - I think Daniel would say
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.560]   make sure your food is cooked, right?
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.060]   - Cooked, but that's so boring.
[00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.480]   - Yeah, it's unfortunate.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.240]   And he would agree with you
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.560]   because, you know, many vegetables are delicious.
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.880]   Salads even are delicious, not cooked,
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.560]   but they can have parasites in them.
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:04.320]   Meats, fish, people like to have uncooked fish.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.100]   So if you wanna be really safe and boring,
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.960]   just make sure everything is cooked.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:11.040]   Now we have a case this week on Twip
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.280]   of a young man who went,
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.640]   I forgot where he went, but he stayed in a hotel.
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.320]   I think, oh, Oaxaca, Mexico.
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.160]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.340]   - Stayed in a hotel.
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:23.760]   And he said, he came back with diarrhea and fever.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.480]   And he said, "I don't know where, I stayed in the hotel.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:30.040]   "I just ate hotel food, lots of vegetables and fruits."
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.720]   And probably they weren't washed with clean water,
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.880]   you know, he got something from that.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:38.520]   The bottom line is most of these infections
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.200]   with parasites can be diagnosed,
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.720]   and you can be treated, and you'll be fine.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:47.520]   So if you really wanna experience the cuisine,
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.240]   I don't think you should worry about it.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.680]   That's what Daniel would say.
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.960]   - Let's return to the basics.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.840]   We're gonna jump around all over the place.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:58.720]   What are the basic principles of virology?
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.160]   Maybe a good place to start is what is a virus?
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.600]   - That's great.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.840]   I mean, I talk in my first lecture for 20 minutes
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:06.880]   before I get to that.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:10.040]   And I wonder if I should put it up front,
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.100]   but it's kind of a boring definition.
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:14.840]   So if you do that, first people will turn off.
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:17.040]   So first you tell them about all the millions
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.920]   and billions of viruses around.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:22.720]   So a virus, we have a very specific definition,
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.520]   'cause it's different from everything else on the planet.
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:28.200]   'Cause first of all, it's a parasite.
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:33.800]   A parasite means you take something from someone else.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.160]   You know, we have human parasites
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.840]   who take money from others, right?
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:40.880]   But in biological terms, a parasite takes something
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:44.280]   from the host that the host would otherwise use energy
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.200]   or some building block or something.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.540]   - There's never really a symbiotic relationship
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:50.420]   between a virus and a host.
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:51.980]   - Well, there can be.
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:53.600]   So that's the dichotomy, I think,
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.980]   is that we define them as parasites.
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:58.740]   Yet, I just told you 20 minutes ago
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:01.500]   that many viruses are probably beneficial.
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.500]   So I think what it means is at some point
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.780]   we're gonna have to change our definition, right?
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:10.220]   Because after all, definitions we make
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:14.160]   are just constructs that make it easier for us to study,
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.760]   that don't necessarily represent what's right.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.420]   - Yeah, like Pluto was a planet at first,
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.660]   and now it's not a planet anymore,
[00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:23.360]   and a lot of people are very upset.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:24.700]   - But it's only according to us.
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.020]   There may be another race living somewhere else
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:28.500]   who thinks it's a planet, right?
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.700]   - Well, maybe that's why viruses are attacking humans.
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:31.540]   They're very angry.
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.980]   They weren't calling them parasites.
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:37.980]   - So right now our definition includes parasite
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:41.380]   because a virus cannot do anything without a cell.
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:44.020]   If this mug were full of viruses,
[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.340]   it would not do anything for years.
[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:49.020]   It would eventually probably lose its infectivity,
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:50.460]   but it's not gonna reproduce here.
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.020]   It needs cells.
[00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:54.220]   And to the first people who discovered viruses,
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:57.340]   that was astounding that they didn't just reproduce,
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.600]   divide on their own like bacteria.
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.660]   So a virus needs to get inside of a cell, inside the cell.
[00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:05.500]   It can't just hang around on the surface.
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:09.140]   It needs to get in in order to make more of itself.
[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:13.020]   And so we call it an obligate intracellular parasite
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:15.020]   because it needs to get in a cell,
[00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:17.300]   and then it takes things from the cell
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.220]   in the form of all kinds of molecules and processes
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:23.340]   and energy and so forth to make new viruses.
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:26.220]   - Obligate means it's obligated to be inside the cell.
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:27.060]   - Absolutely.
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:30.780]   It will not reproduce outside of the cell.
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:35.780]   So this mug of viruses can in no way be living,
[00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:36.900]   in my opinion.
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.140]   However, once it gets inside of a cell,
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:41.220]   now the cell is a virus-infected cell.
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:42.300]   It's alive.
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:45.340]   So a virus, in my view, has two phases, right?
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:48.180]   It's this non-living particulate phase
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:49.560]   that everyone is used to.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.700]   I'll send you, you need a virus for your table.
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:54.540]   I'll send you a nice model.
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:55.380]   I think it would look good here.
[00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:56.220]   - Which, yes, definitely.
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:57.780]   - You don't have to go with all this other stuff.
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:59.540]   - Yeah, well, these are all mechanical.
[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:01.260]   There's no biology here.
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:02.460]   - So you wouldn't want a virus here?
[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:04.020]   - No, I'd want a virus, of course.
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:06.820]   - I'll send you one and then you can look at it.
[00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:09.900]   'Cause now that we have the three-dimensional structures
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:12.580]   solved by structural biologists,
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:14.740]   we take the coordinates and we put it in a 3D printer
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:16.860]   and you can make amazing models, right?
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.900]   Of any virus.
[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:21.500]   - And so there's a huge variety of viruses?
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.300]   - Huge, that we know of,
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.820]   which is only a fraction of what's out there.
[00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:25.740]   - What's the category?
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:27.860]   So there's RNA, there's DNA viruses.
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.020]   What are those?
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.260]   What's DNA and RNA?
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:33.900]   - Two broad categorizations.
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:36.940]   RNA, these are genetic material.
[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:39.180]   Can be two different chemicals.
[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:43.100]   So RNA, everything else on the planet besides viruses
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.140]   is all DNA-based.
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:45.300]   You and I are DNA-based.
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.340]   Everything on the planet today is DNA-based,
[00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:50.180]   except some viruses are RNA-based.
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:53.140]   And that's because, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:57.260]   the first life that arose on the planet was RNA-based.
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:59.500]   - Yeah, so these are like old school viruses.
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:00.620]   - These are old school.
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:02.620]   We call relics, yeah.
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:04.500]   Relics, and this has got a name.
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.780]   It's called the RNA world, which I think is great.
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:09.660]   - Is it big still, or are the relics dying out?
[00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:11.540]   - Oh no, the relics, in my opinion,
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:14.860]   are the most successful viruses, the RNA viruses.
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:16.700]   And SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus.
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.040]   We can talk about why they're so successful.
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.740]   But you have, broadly speaking, viruses with RNA,
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:24.940]   genetic information, which are relics.
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:26.420]   Of course, they're contemporary.
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:28.900]   They have adapted to the modern world
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:31.140]   and the modern organisms living in it.
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:33.220]   And then we have DNA-based viruses,
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:36.440]   which are extremely conservative and slow.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.780]   They're very successful.
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:40.020]   Everyone has a herpes virus infection,
[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:44.500]   but they don't get the news like the RNA viruses do.
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:46.780]   The HIVs and the influenza viruses
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:49.860]   and the SARS coronaviruses, they get all the press,
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.100]   and they're RNA-based,
[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:54.340]   'cause RNA lets you change more so than DNA.
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:57.220]   - So they evolve much faster, the RNA viruses.
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:58.300]   - Much faster.
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.900]   And in fact, when I have a lecture on evolution,
[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.180]   I don't know if you've listened to that when you should.
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:06.580]   It's really, I think it's really interesting.
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:12.740]   RNA viruses exist at their error threshold,
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:17.120]   which means they can't make any more mutations
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.540]   when they reproduce, otherwise they're dead.
[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:20.860]   They would go extinct. - Wow.
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:23.580]   - They're evolving at their error threshold.
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.300]   DNA viruses are hundreds of times lower
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:28.420]   than their error thresholds.
[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:29.260]   And we know this.
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.140]   We can do an experiment to find that out.
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.580]   Now, why that is is a good question.
[00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:38.260]   But that's the reason why RNA viruses
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:39.420]   are far more successful.
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:41.660]   They infect many more hosts,
[00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:44.140]   and they're very, I would say, slippery.
[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:46.460]   They can change hosts really quickly,
[00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:49.500]   because in any animal harboring an RNA virus,
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.940]   like let's say a bat in some cave somewhere,
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:55.180]   it's not just one genome.
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:58.660]   It's millions of different genomes of all kinds,
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:01.260]   all within the framework of, say, coronavirus,
[00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:02.580]   but they're all different.
[00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.780]   And one genome in there might just be right
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:08.220]   for infecting a person if it ever encountered that person.
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.420]   I mean, that's the thing that--
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:11.260]   - Or there could be a large number.
[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:15.020]   There's a tiny fraction, but a large number of them.
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:18.020]   And they're all operating at the threshold of error.
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:19.020]   - That's right. - That's fascinating.
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:21.560]   It's like little, it's like startups,
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:23.900]   little entrepreneurs, like a startup world.
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:25.180]   - Yes, and many of them fail.
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.020]   - Yeah, many of them fail. - Many of the changes fail.
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:27.820]   - And then there's the DNA viruses
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:29.580]   that are like the IBM and the Google.
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.780]   - Exactly, exactly. - The big corporations.
[00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:33.260]   - It's very good, I like that. - They become conservative
[00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:35.020]   with the bureaucracies and all that kind of stuff.
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:36.660]   - And a lot of baggage. - Yeah.
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:39.480]   - Yeah, it's expensive for them to reproduce, yeah.
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.540]   And they don't move quickly.
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:43.820]   Yes, the RNA viruses are the fast-moving members.
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:45.460]   So that's what a virus is.
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:48.900]   We call them oddly intracellular parasites.
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:50.820]   And then I told you there's DNA and RNA,
[00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:52.980]   but then let's go further.
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:54.800]   The nucleic acid's not naked,
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:59.880]   because naked nucleic acid in the world isn't good.
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:03.500]   I mean, it existed in the pre-cellular world,
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:07.180]   but there probably weren't a lot of threats to it then.
[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.740]   Naked nucleic acid doesn't last long in the environment.
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:12.180]   So they're covered, the nucleic acid is covered.
[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:15.840]   It can be covered with a protein shell, a pure protein shell,
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:19.320]   or it can have a membrane around it,
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.380]   which would be lipids from the host cell.
[00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:26.220]   - So lipids, so it's a fatty membrane.
[00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:27.060]   - Fatty membrane, yeah.
[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:30.500]   So our cells are coated with fatty membranes, right?
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:32.540]   Our cells, the outer plasma membrane, right?
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:34.340]   That's the same-- - But viruses can be too.
[00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:35.780]   So they're kind of like cells,
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:38.620]   but without the ability to do the mitochondria stuff.
[00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:39.940]   - Some are, some are.
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:42.800]   They don't have nuclei, they don't have mitochondria.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:46.000]   But they do have a nucleic acid, they have a membrane.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.620]   And then, of course, there's spikes in the membrane
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:51.220]   that allow them to attach to cells.
[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.420]   And so that completes our two different kinds of viruses.
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:55.740]   - So they all have attachment mechanisms,
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:59.260]   like ways to, like keys into the--
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:01.300]   - They all have to get into cells.
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:05.020]   There are a couple of exceptions, though.
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:10.020]   There are viruses of fungi and plants.
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:11.940]   So let's do the fungi.
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:13.560]   Fungi would be like yeast.
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:18.740]   The yeast cell wall is pretty hard to get through.
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:22.060]   So viruses typically don't attach to a yeast
[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:22.900]   and get inside.
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:25.700]   Rather, they just live in the yeast forever.
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:28.740]   And they multiply as mostly nucleic acids,
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.380]   and as the yeast divide, they go into the daughter cells.
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:32.580]   And that's how they exist.
[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:35.660]   Plant viruses, also the plant cell wall,
[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:40.460]   would be very hard to get across by binding a protein.
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.900]   So plant viruses get into plants
[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:47.340]   either by pests that inject them in.
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:48.480]   They're sucking sap out,
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.980]   and they inject virus at the same time.
[00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:52.620]   Or farmers, they have contaminated farm equipment,
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:55.840]   and they roll over the plants and introduces viruses.
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.740]   So those fungi and plant viruses,
[00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:00.580]   they don't have this specific receptor binding
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:01.500]   to get them into the cell.
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:03.620]   But everything else, yeah, the virus binds
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:05.420]   to something on the surface, very specific.
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:09.060]   It's taken into the cell, because that's what cells do.
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:12.620]   When things bind their exterior, they take it in.
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:14.300]   'Cause in most cases, it's good.
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:15.820]   It's something they need.
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.220]   And so the virus slips in.
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:19.260]   I guess you'd call that a Trojan horse, right?
[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:20.080]   - Trojan horse.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:23.340]   It's so hard to not anthropomorphize this whole thing.
[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:24.180]   - It is hard.
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:26.980]   - So obviously, they don't know any of this.
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:29.420]   It's not an actual Trojan horse.
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:32.780]   So they're not getting actually tricked
[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:34.620]   in the way humans trick each other.
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:35.740]   - No, it's all passive.
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:38.620]   And it's just, through so many years of evolution,
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:42.940]   you select something that works, and it continues.
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.940]   And what survives then goes on
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:48.300]   with perhaps a slightly different approach.
[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:49.780]   - I love this idea of passive.
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:52.100]   Of course, according to Sam Harris,
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:54.900]   so for a sufficiently intelligent alien civilization
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:58.140]   observing humans, our behavior might seem passive too,
[00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:00.820]   'cause they understand fully exactly what we're doing.
[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:02.260]   And then there's no free will,
[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:05.100]   and we're all just operating in the same way a cell does,
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:07.820]   but just a much higher level of complexity.
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:10.100]   - Yeah, so I love the distinction
[00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.820]   between active and passive.
[00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:14.820]   - I mean, the point is, I think anthropomorphizing
[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:15.940]   to a certain extent is fine,
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.860]   'cause it helps people understand.
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:19.580]   But when you start to say,
[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:21.100]   I think the virus is doing that
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:24.700]   because then you're putting a human lens on it,
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.580]   and you may be wrong.
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:29.940]   Because you don't know why things happen for a virus.
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:33.460]   So right now, we have variants emerging,
[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:35.980]   and people say, well, I think it's because the antibodies
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:38.180]   are selecting for variants.
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:39.140]   That's a good idea,
[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:41.500]   but it may not be the only thing that's going on.
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:44.780]   - You start imagining them coming to the table negotiating.
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:48.420]   Yeah, you get into trouble with that.
[00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:49.380]   - That's why I tell my students,
[00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:51.820]   be careful about the anthropomorphizing,
[00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:55.980]   because you're gonna apply your values to a virus,
[00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:57.100]   and you have different value.
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:00.580]   You're a human, and what you think is the reason
[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:02.380]   for this outcome may not be right, that's all.
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:04.260]   Just be open-minded about it.
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:05.220]   - In both directions.
[00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:08.100]   I actually, one of the things I push back on
[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:10.300]   is in the space of robotics,
[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:14.580]   most people in robotics try to not anthropomorphize.
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:17.500]   For example, they don't give a gender or a name to robots.
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:20.060]   They really try to see it as a machine.
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:23.860]   And to me, that makes sense in one way,
[00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:25.500]   but it totally doesn't make sense in another.
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:27.660]   If that robot is to interact,
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:30.780]   operate in the human world and interact with humans,
[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:33.940]   we have to anthropomorphize it
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:37.740]   in order to understand as an engineering problem,
[00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:42.140]   how should it operate in a human world?
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:46.060]   Now, the difference with viruses, the scale of operation,
[00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:49.300]   it doesn't make sense to treat them as human-like,
[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:51.620]   'cause the scale of operation is much smaller.
[00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:54.300]   But with robots, you're in the same time scale,
[00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:55.380]   the same spatial scale.
[00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:56.300]   - Of course, in the movies,
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:58.500]   they always give them names and personalities.
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.460]   - Yeah, well, yeah, that's the,
[00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:03.020]   but that's my argument, is we should do the same
[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:03.940]   when you're trying to solve
[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:06.340]   the engineering problem of robotics too.
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:07.780]   It's not just for the movies.
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:08.820]   Well, let me ask you this,
[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:12.300]   because you've said controversially, not really,
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.720]   that viruses are not living.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:18.220]   Defend yourself.
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:19.140]   (laughs)
[00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:20.660]   So are viruses alive or not?
[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:22.900]   - So I've seen many people say, oh, they have to be.
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:27.180]   They have nucleic acids, they evolve, they mutate.
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:29.620]   That's all true, but they don't do it on their own.
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:32.260]   The particles in my mug are just not doing any of that
[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:33.980]   unless they get into a cell.
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:36.220]   So a virus-infected cell is alive.
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:37.820]   I totally agree with that,
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.820]   because in fact, when a virus gets in a cell,
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:45.300]   it converts it into a virus-making factory, if you will.
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:47.260]   It's no longer a cell.
[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:48.940]   Some people call it a virus cell.
[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:51.220]   I don't really like that, but it's fine.
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:53.020]   So that's what I'm talking about.
[00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:54.880]   The particle is not alive.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:57.780]   You can have your virus-infected cell as alive,
[00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:01.260]   but the particle, it just would not do anything
[00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:03.860]   forever without getting inside of a cell.
[00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:07.060]   But once it's in a cell, it is alive then,
[00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:08.260]   but it's no longer a particle.
[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:10.740]   It's taken apart and nucleic acid is moving
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:12.940]   around the cells, making proteins.
[00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:14.140]   Eventually it makes new particles.
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:16.480]   And then those particles released from the cell,
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:17.980]   they're not living anymore.
[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:21.340]   So I think it's kind of like a spore,
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:25.220]   a spore of a, or a seed.
[00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:28.140]   Although the seed doesn't work because the seeds,
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:29.860]   the cells in the seed have the ability
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:31.980]   to make their own energy and so forth.
[00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:34.460]   But a bacterial spore, and it's the same thing,
[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:36.580]   doesn't do anything unless you add water and nutrients
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:37.620]   and then it starts to divide.
[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:39.100]   But it doesn't need to get into a cell.
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:40.700]   It's very different from a virus.
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:42.500]   So that's why the particle.
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:44.500]   And when people think of virus,
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:47.380]   they're always thinking of the particle.
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:49.300]   And that's why I say it can't be alive,
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:51.380]   'cause the particle can't do anything on its own.
[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:53.420]   But if you think of a virus as an organism
[00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:55.940]   with a particle phase in a cell,
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:58.420]   then it makes sense to be alive.
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:44:59.900]   - And by the way, when you say particle,
[00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:01.180]   you're referring to that structure
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:03.460]   that you've been mentioning, some kind of membrane or not,
[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:05.620]   that has been called, what is that,
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:06.820]   a viron particle or something?
[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:07.660]   - Virion. - Virion.
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:10.300]   - So what you should have here, I'll send you one,
[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:11.820]   and then you can refer to it.
[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:13.660]   - What's the sexiest one to have?
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:17.940]   Like what, in terms of particles to have on a table?
[00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:21.460]   - Well, unfortunately the ones that you can 3D print.
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:23.100]   - Oh, they're not going to be super--
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:26.380]   - They're the ones that we know the structures of, right?
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:31.380]   So someone sent me last year a 3D model of SARS-CoV-2,
[00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:32.220]   and it's beautiful.
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:34.740]   It's actually cracked open so you can see the RNA,
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:37.020]   and the spikes are sticking out,
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:40.300]   and they even put some antibodies sticking onto the spikes.
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:42.060]   - That's super cool. - I mean, when I show this
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:43.540]   on a livestream, people love this.
[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:44.980]   They go, "Oh my God, that's beautiful."
[00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:46.660]   It is, it's absolutely gorgeous.
[00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:49.560]   I have that, I have my virus that I worked on
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:52.860]   most of my career, poliovirus, I have a 3D model of that,
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:54.220]   which I actually just had made.
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:56.020]   It's gorgeous, and you can have it made
[00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:57.620]   in any color you want, right?
[00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:01.500]   - What would you say is the most fascinating,
[00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:05.140]   terrifying, surprising, beautiful virus to you?
[00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:08.380]   So of all the viruses you looked at,
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:10.940]   sometimes when you just sit late at night
[00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:13.980]   with a glass of wine, looking over the sunset,
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:16.260]   which virus do you think about?
[00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:21.260]   - So fulfilling all of those adjectives is hard, right?
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:24.940]   Fascinating, exciting, terrifying.
[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:27.140]   - Well, the terrifying is an optional one, I think,
[00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:30.020]   'cause maybe that puts a lot of pressure.
[00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:34.260]   - I'd say terrifying, to me, I'm not terrified
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:37.620]   because I think we can handle most viruses,
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:39.100]   as you see with this brand new one
[00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:42.460]   that emerged a year ago, we can handle it.
[00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.140]   - From a virology perspective.
[00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:45.640]   - Yeah, I mean, the human perspective
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:46.860]   is a different story, right?
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:48.300]   That's always an issue, but.
[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:52.860]   So I think there are a couple
[00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:55.660]   of different categories of virus.
[00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:57.420]   So we could do the terrifying,
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:00.060]   and I think rabies is a terrifying virus
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:02.340]   because unless you're vaccinated,
[00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:04.700]   100% certainty you're gonna die.
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:09.780]   So you get bitten by a rabid raccoon or bat or dog,
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:14.780]   whatever, and there's still 70,000 deaths a year
[00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:16.300]   of rabies throughout the world
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.020]   because there are a lot of feral dogs running around
[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:20.740]   that are infected, unless you're vaccinated,
[00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:23.140]   you're gonna die, there's nothing we can do.
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:26.460]   But we do have a vaccine which we can actually give you
[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:27.820]   even after you've been bitten,
[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:31.140]   which is the only vaccine that works that way.
[00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:32.900]   It's a therapeutic, right?
[00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:34.860]   It will treat your illness
[00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:37.320]   'cause the disease takes so long to develop.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:41.240]   Eventually you get all kinds of neurological issues
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:44.780]   and paralysis and so forth, but it takes time
[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:45.980]   and you can be vaccinated,
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:47.440]   it will prevent that in the meanwhile.
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:50.300]   So people always say, what's the most lethal virus?
[00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:51.140]   Is it Ebola?
[00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:53.620]   I said, no, it's actually rabies.
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:55.980]   Unless you're vaccinated, it will kill you.
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:57.780]   - Maybe it's good to linger,
[00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:01.180]   'cause we'll talk about vaccines a few times today.
[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:05.340]   It's good to linger on cases where vaccines
[00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:10.340]   have clearly, undoubtedly helped human civilization.
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:15.420]   And it seems like rabies is a good example.
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:18.320]   - No, rabies is great because everyone knows
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:21.400]   what happens when somebody gets rabies, right?
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:24.480]   You have fear of water, hydrophobia,
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:31.200]   your body becomes spastic and stiff and jerks around
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:35.520]   and you lose consciousness, you can't, no more--
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:36.680]   - It's not a fun ride to death.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:39.240]   - It's horrible, it's a horrible way to die.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:40.920]   So I think most people know that,
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:44.120]   it's been popularized enough in media, right?
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:47.080]   So that nobody would probably object to getting,
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:51.020]   oh, I was just bit by this raccoon and it ran off.
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:53.060]   Okay, well, we should assume it's rabid,
[00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:56.360]   we should immunize you, and most people are okay with that.
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.580]   'Cause they know the consequences.
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:48:59.920]   And it's also pretty rare, right?
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.820]   It's not like something that you're trying
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:06.820]   to get into the arms of 250, 300 million Americans,
[00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:11.700]   that's hard, but the few thousand every year, it's easy.
[00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:13.820]   - So the transmissibility is difficult, right?
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:16.900]   It has to, oh, it's not airborne, so--
[00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:19.900]   - It's not airborne, it just, you have to be bitten.
[00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:24.780]   Although some people claim you could walk into a cave
[00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:28.340]   and the bats breathing out rabies virus could infect you,
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:32.620]   but I don't really think that's well substantiated.
[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:33.460]   I think it's a bite.
[00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:34.820]   - How would you do a study on that?
[00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:36.380]   - Yeah, it's very hard to do.
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:38.460]   You'd have to collect the vapors in the cave
[00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:40.760]   and show that they're infectious, which,
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:43.220]   and by the way, someone emailed me the other day,
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:44.460]   you'll like this, they said,
[00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:47.100]   "Why can't we just immunize all the bats in the world
[00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:49.340]   against these viruses?"
[00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:50.540]   And I said, "Well, how would you do that?
[00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:52.380]   There are caves everywhere, right?"
[00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:53.300]   - Yeah.
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:56.620]   - He said, "Well, maybe you could just go and aerosolize."
[00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:57.460]   - Yeah.
[00:49:57.460 --> 00:49:58.500]   - It's pretty dangerous.
[00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:01.540]   - And then all the bats should have vaccine passports
[00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:02.380]   to make sure that they're all--
[00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:03.900]   - Yeah, and so you have to get their consent
[00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:05.380]   before you do it.
[00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:10.380]   But we do immunize wildlife against rabies.
[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:15.060]   We have rabies vaccines for wild animals.
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:17.380]   There are a whole bunch of them that get rabies.
[00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:20.340]   And we put it in bait and drop it
[00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:21.540]   from helicopters in the woods,
[00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:24.420]   and it drops down the incidence of rabies in people.
[00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:25.260]   - Wow.
[00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:27.140]   - You know, people hiking get bitten and so forth.
[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:28.980]   It drops the incidence, so we can do that.
[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:30.340]   - I didn't know that.
[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:32.220]   I always wondered how much medical care
[00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:34.020]   we're doing for animals in the wild,
[00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:37.480]   because I've recently become more and more aware
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:41.100]   that animals are living in extreme poverty.
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:41.940]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:44.300]   - Like, you don't know, you think, like, natural,
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:47.580]   it's great, you know, like,
[00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:51.740]   like when animals are living on a farm, it's terrible.
[00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:53.700]   But then you also have to compare to, like,
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:56.300]   what life is like in the, or like the zoo.
[00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:58.740]   You have to compare what life is like in the wild.
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:01.580]   - Well, life in the wild is very tough, I think.
[00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:03.740]   Most animals have to, well, the carnivores anyway,
[00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:06.140]   they have to catch their food every day, right?
[00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:08.180]   - And then there's the viruses there.
[00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:09.180]   - They have viruses as well.
[00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:12.460]   - So the rabies immunization is the only
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:16.380]   one I'm aware of for wild animals.
[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:20.940]   We do immunize lots of other animals.
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:24.980]   We immunize chickens and pigs and cows,
[00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:28.500]   even fish, farmed fish, we pick each fish up
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:31.580]   and give it an injection, you know, when it's a small fish.
[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:36.220]   But that's mostly so that the farmers get a good yield.
[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:38.380]   We don't really care about the animals, right?
[00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:41.020]   We want a good yield for market.
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:46.020]   And then there's some examples where we immunize animals
[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:48.960]   to prevent spillovers into people.
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:53.340]   So there's a disease called Hendra in Australia,
[00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:57.540]   which was discovered in the '90s,
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:51:58.980]   and it turns out there are bats,
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:01.020]   fruit bats, that have this virus.
[00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:05.140]   The bats are fine, but sometimes they fly into horse stalls
[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:06.340]   and the horses get infected.
[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:09.020]   These are, in Australia, it was initially race horses,
[00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:11.260]   which are very expensive, right?
[00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:12.900]   The horses got infected and they died,
[00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:15.060]   and the humans who would take care of them would die also.
[00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:19.260]   So now they immunize the horses to prevent,
[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:20.380]   well, to save the horses.
[00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:21.620]   Probably that's the motivation,
[00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:24.580]   'cause these horses are hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:25.780]   And then the people don't get sick
[00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:27.580]   because the horses don't get sick.
[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:29.340]   You don't wanna immunize all the people
[00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:31.940]   because it's too rare, but that approach
[00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:33.940]   is called the one world health approach,
[00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:37.180]   which means everything's connected on the planet,
[00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:39.300]   and we have to think of everything in the grander scheme,
[00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:40.940]   not just us.
[00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:42.900]   - Yeah, so you can immunize some things
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:44.980]   along the trajectory that a virus would take.
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:45.820]   - Exactly.
[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:48.180]   - So not some things, some living beings.
[00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:49.860]   - In the Arabian Peninsula,
[00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:52.580]   they have a MERS coronavirus issue every month.
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:55.820]   There are a couple of cases where a camel
[00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:59.140]   will infect a human, and the human can get very sick.
[00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:03.180]   It's a respiratory disease, very much like COVID.
[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:05.780]   And so camels are very common there.
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:10.500]   They're raced, they're used as pets, they're eaten.
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:12.500]   So there's a lot of human-camel contact,
[00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:15.060]   but the number of cases are rare to a month,
[00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:16.740]   so you don't wanna immunize all the humans,
[00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:18.940]   so the idea would be to immunize the camels.
[00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:21.140]   So--
[00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:21.960]   - (laughs) I like it.
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:23.660]   So, okay, so you put rabies,
[00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:28.660]   but Ebola also is a famously deadly one.
[00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:30.700]   - Right.
[00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:31.520]   - What is it?
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:33.180]   I don't know, 50, 60% of it's--
[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:37.160]   - Could be 50 to 90, but that's in Africa,
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:38.860]   where the healthcare isn't great.
[00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:42.880]   You saw when cases of Ebola came to the US,
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:43.800]   we could take care of it.
[00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.160]   We knew how to take care of it.
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:46.800]   We had fancy hospitals and so forth,
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:47.920]   and now we have a vaccine.
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:52.260]   So we can, and the vaccine is really good,
[00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:54.960]   but there are many governments in Africa
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.960]   that are suspicious of us,
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:58.960]   and they don't wanna use our vaccine, so they--
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:00.640]   - So there's a vaccine for Ebola.
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:01.480]   - There is, yeah.
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:05.320]   - And the effectiveness and safety of it,
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:06.400]   how much is understood?
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:11.400]   - So this is difficult because there's not a lot of Ebola.
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:14.080]   It's not a continuous, ongoing thing.
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:16.600]   There are sporadic outbreaks here and there.
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:17.720]   - Of a few thousand people.
[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:19.880]   - At most, at most, usually a few hundred,
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:23.040]   and the biggest ever, in fact,
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:25.480]   this is why we didn't for years have an Ebola vaccine.
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:27.920]   The US military, together with Canada,
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:30.580]   developed an Ebola vaccine for service people.
[00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:32.080]   They wanted to say, "Well, we're sending people
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:33.360]   "into these Ebola areas.
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:34.740]   "We want a vaccine for them."
[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:38.160]   So they had developed it through all the preclinical,
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:41.000]   which means before it goes into people,
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.280]   and that stopped because there was no money
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:46.360]   to do a phase one and a phase two and a phase three.
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:47.840]   In fact, for phase two and three,
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:49.520]   you need to have infections going on
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:50.800]   'cause you're looking at how well
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:53.000]   the vaccine prevents infections, right?
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:57.040]   So then there was a West African outbreak in 2015,
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:58.720]   2013, 2015.
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:00.740]   The most cases ever, 25,000.
[00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:02.460]   So they got to test the vaccine,
[00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:07.460]   but they only put it in a few thousand people.
[00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:10.500]   It's not like it's been in hundreds of thousands of people
[00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:12.100]   like the COVID vaccines has been.
[00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:15.740]   So it looks like it has high efficacy,
[00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:18.580]   but we'd like to have more data.
[00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:21.300]   Side effects maybe are not so great.
[00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:23.600]   There are a couple of different available vaccines.
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:25.860]   Some have been tested more than others.
[00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:28.700]   I would say this would probably not be
[00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:31.440]   widely accepted in the US.
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.860]   - But then neither would be something
[00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:38.480]   over 50% deadliness of a virus.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:39.960]   - No, I think if you were,
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:42.560]   in fact, many physicians work in countries
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:44.200]   that have Ebola, so they get vaccinated
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:46.000]   because they understand the choice.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.520]   - Yeah, right, it's always about the choice.
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:49.440]   So--
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:53.240]   - So then one more thing to answer the interesting,
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:57.060]   what are some of the viruses you really are fascinated by?
[00:55:57.060 --> 00:56:01.300]   There are a number of viruses that have clearly been shown
[00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:04.660]   to alter host behavior, and that's how they spread.
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:05.900]   I think those are fascinating.
[00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:09.980]   For example, there's some viruses of plants
[00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:13.420]   that are spread by aphids,
[00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:16.780]   and the aphid bites the plant,
[00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:18.900]   the virus reproduces in the plant,
[00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:21.660]   then it somehow engineers the plant
[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:26.300]   to give off volatile organics to attract more aphids,
[00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:28.060]   which will spread the virus.
[00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:31.460]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:32.300]   - Yeah.
[00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:34.140]   - So that's altering the behavior.
[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:35.100]   (laughing)
[00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:38.700]   Altering because somehow the virus infecting the plant cells
[00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:40.820]   gives off these organics and attracts aphids.
[00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:44.740]   And furthermore, somehow when the aphid bites,
[00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:47.780]   it tastes horrible, so they immediately leave
[00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:49.220]   with the virus they've just picked up
[00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:51.260]   and go to another plant to spread it.
[00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:53.780]   So they're attracted and then repulsed at the same time.
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:55.940]   - And obviously you don't want to anthropomorphize this,
[00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:57.580]   like a strategy they're taking on.
[00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:58.700]   Somehow this worked out.
[00:56:58.700 --> 00:56:59.860]   - It worked out this way.
[00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:00.700]   It just evolved.
[00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:04.300]   And you know, evolution is sometimes hard to trace, right?
[00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:07.300]   Like Darwin famously said, he could never figure out
[00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:09.340]   how an eye evolved from a single cell, right?
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:11.180]   But it did.
[00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:16.140]   - The more complicated, complex the holistic organism is
[00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:19.620]   that the virus invades, the less able it is
[00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:21.420]   to control that organism, right?
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:23.460]   So I wonder if there's viruses that can control
[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:28.460]   human behavior, you know, to induce more spread of the virus.
[00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:34.340]   - Well, I don't see why not.
[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:35.740]   - There's not enough humans, I suppose,
[00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:37.100]   to like evolve through.
[00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:39.300]   - Well, we can't do the experiment to test it, right?
[00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:40.140]   We have to observe.
[00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:41.780]   And that's always hard when you're observing
[00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:45.100]   'cause there's so many things that can confound
[00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:45.940]   what you're looking at.
[00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:47.540]   - Yeah, change human behavior, yeah.
[00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:49.100]   - I mean, there's so many things that impinge
[00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:54.100]   on our behavior, but yeah, I think it's possible.
[00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:56.540]   I think it's highly possible.
[00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:59.260]   If it does it in a plant, why not change
[00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:00.780]   some other organism's behavior?
[00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:01.620]   I think it's fine.
[00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:02.460]   Anyway, those fascinate me.
[00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:06.060]   There are lots of examples of those that are fascinating
[00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:08.820]   and how they work, people are trying to figure out.
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:10.660]   But there's not a lot of money to work on, you know,
[00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:13.540]   insect and plant viruses unless you're going to the USDA.
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:17.100]   So they don't get a lot of work moving forward.
[00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:19.820]   - Well, if you understand some of those viruses,
[00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:23.780]   is that transferable to human viruses, that understanding?
[00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:25.580]   - I think some of it could be, sure.
[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:28.340]   I think the general principles, for example,
[00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:32.300]   how does the virus cause volatile organics to be made?
[00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:34.980]   It must be turning on some genes.
[00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:37.420]   And you could learn principles from that,
[00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:39.020]   how the virus might do that, sure.
[00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:41.340]   I think everything is broadly applicable.
[00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:45.620]   So to say it's not useful to study viruses
[00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:48.100]   of insects and plants is just wrong.
[00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:50.540]   Because in science, you probably know this,
[00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:52.980]   maybe in your field it's the same.
[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:55.420]   If you're curious, you're gonna run into interesting things
[00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:57.220]   that you never planned on, right?
[00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:59.740]   - That's why people, like, you can criticize,
[00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:01.340]   why do we want to go on Mars?
[00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:03.620]   Why do we want to colonize Mars?
[00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:06.680]   Well, it's like, why do you want to go to the moon?
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:10.780]   The reality is when you do really difficult things,
[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:13.180]   engineering things, like all these inventions
[00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:14.380]   along the way are created.
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:17.460]   It's kind of fascinating how basically just,
[00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:22.460]   pick a thing that everyone can agree is kind of cool
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:24.460]   and is really hard and do that.
[00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:26.940]   And then you'll have like thousands of inventions
[00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:28.220]   that have nothing to do with the thing.
[00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:29.060]   - That's right.
[00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:32.060]   I think you should let curious scientists
[00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:35.220]   just follow what they're interested in to a certain extent.
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:37.500]   You can't, you know, in science we say,
[00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:39.460]   we have translational research where we say,
[00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:42.080]   okay, here's some money, go cure cancer or diabetes
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:43.620]   or heart disease, whatever, right?
[00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:44.580]   And that's fine.
[00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:46.740]   But that often doesn't work out very well.
[00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:49.900]   What works better is to say, you have a good lab,
[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:52.180]   you have a good track record, here's some money,
[00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:55.980]   do something, and that's where PCR, CRISPR,
[00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:58.060]   recombinant DNA, all that stuff
[00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:00.820]   which has made the field explode, that's all it came from.
[01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:04.340]   Not from people saying, I want to cure genetic diseases
[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:07.420]   by gene editing, but by saying, what are these repeated
[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:09.860]   things in this bacterium doing?
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:11.180]   - Yep.
[01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:13.340]   Can I ask you a big philosophical question?
[01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:17.220]   So there's these deadly viruses
[01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:21.580]   that are not very transmissible, Ebola, rabies,
[01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:23.820]   and then there's these less deadly viruses
[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:28.820]   that are very transmissible, like COVID,
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:34.080]   I guess kind of borderline, but why isn't there
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:37.140]   super transmissible, super deadly viruses?
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:40.380]   - I think if you compare SARS-1 and 2,
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:42.620]   you get somewhat of an answer, right?
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:45.580]   SARS-1 was more deadly.
[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:50.420]   In fact, over half of the time when people were infected,
[01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:53.460]   they ended up in the hospital 'cause they were that sick.
[01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:58.220]   And then the peak of virus shedding from them happened
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:00:59.660]   long after they went in the hospital.
[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:02.780]   So it's easy to contain the infection
[01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:04.640]   when you're in a hospital, right?
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:09.640]   There was not much pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic shedding
[01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:11.380]   with SARS-1.
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:14.020]   - And shedding means you become infectious.
[01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:17.700]   - So in a respiratory virus, you inhale the droplets
[01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:19.440]   of the virus and they reproduce
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.860]   in your upper respiratory tract,
[01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:22.940]   what we call the nasopharynx, right?
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:24.920]   The nose and going back to that little cavity
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.020]   just above your mouth.
[01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:28.480]   So the virus reproduces really well.
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:30.140]   And then as you talk and sneeze and cough,
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:32.620]   you expel droplets and then those are inhaled
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:35.220]   by other people and then they reproduce.
[01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:39.680]   And for SARS-2, we now know there's a lot of reproduction
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:42.380]   just before you feel anything, if at all.
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:45.620]   So there's a lot of shedding and transmission
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:47.740]   before you get symptomatic.
[01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:50.260]   And as many people don't ever get symptomatic, right?
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:52.060]   So they spread really easily.
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:56.020]   So that explains why some viruses can transmit
[01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:57.440]   a lot better than others.
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:00.100]   And if one happens to knock you out,
[01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:01.460]   then you're never gonna transmit
[01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:03.460]   'cause you're in the hospital like SARS-1.
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:05.900]   - But why can't you have both?
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:08.740]   Why can't you just wait a while before it knocks you out?
[01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:11.280]   But when it knocks you out, it really kills you.
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.280]   - That is a philosophical question, right?
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:16.720]   Because we could talk about why we haven't observed it.
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:21.720]   I mean, one issue is that if you're killed too quickly
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:25.920]   by a highly lethal virus,
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:28.020]   you're not gonna transmit it very well, right?
[01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:31.120]   So Ebola can kill you quite rapidly.
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:33.280]   And most of the transmission occurs
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:38.720]   when people are being cared for at home or in hospitals.
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:41.980]   Doctors and nurses get virus, but people walking around,
[01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:43.740]   you're not walking around when you have Ebola,
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:45.220]   you're too sick.
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:48.260]   You have black bloody diarrhea, you're vomiting,
[01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:53.260]   you're bleeding from your skin and mucus membranes.
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:55.500]   You're not walking around, you're not going to parties.
[01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:57.980]   So I think that's part of it,
[01:02:57.980 --> 01:03:00.420]   that if the infection is too lethal,
[01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:02.580]   you're simply not a good transmitter.
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:05.740]   And I think transmission is probably
[01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:09.760]   one of the most powerful selection forces for viruses,
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:12.760]   because a virus always has to find a new host.
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:16.420]   If it doesn't, it's a startup that fails, right?
[01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:18.580]   If it doesn't find a new host, it's gone.
[01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:22.560]   And so anything that makes the virus transmit better
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:23.640]   is gonna help it.
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:27.520]   And if killing you, being less lethal is part of that,
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.360]   that works too.
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:30.720]   - So there's a strong selection pressure
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.360]   against being lethal.
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:34.900]   - I think there's a strong selection pressure
[01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:38.700]   against being lethal and being more transmissible.
[01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:41.600]   Those two seem to work in opposite ways.
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.440]   And now we don't have a lot of data to support this.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:46.520]   This is kind of a thought experiment,
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:49.600]   but there is one experiment done in Australia
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.840]   many years ago.
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:54.700]   I don't know if you know this, but in the 1800s,
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:57.400]   the hunters in Australia imported a rabbit from Europe
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.460]   so they could hunt it,
[01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:01.040]   because the native rabbit in Australia
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.420]   was too fast for them, they couldn't shoot them.
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:05.560]   So they brought in this European rabbit
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.800]   and they reproduced out of control.
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:10.320]   Within a couple of years, they were everywhere,
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:13.440]   millions of rabbits in all the watering holes,
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.920]   and now they had a problem.
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.520]   So they decided to use a virus
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:19.080]   to get rid of these excess rabbits.
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:22.860]   And they used a virus, a pox virus called myxoma virus,
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:26.220]   which is a natural virus of a different kind of rabbit.
[01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:28.640]   But for these European rabbits, it was quite lethal.
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:30.080]   And it's spread by mosquitoes.
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:33.860]   So they said, "Okay, let's release this virus."
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:38.860]   And the first year, 99.2% of the rabbits were killed.
[01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:45.160]   But that 0.8% that were left had some form of resistance.
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:46.400]   They were variants.
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:49.080]   Every organism, not just viruses, makes mutants.
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:51.020]   And there were some variants of the rabbits
[01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:52.780]   that could survive infection.
[01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:56.600]   And then in subsequent years, the virus became less lethal,
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:59.140]   and then the mosquitoes had a better shot
[01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:01.100]   of transmitting it from one rabbit to another
[01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:02.300]   if the rabbit lived longer.
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:04.180]   That's the selection, probably.
[01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:06.500]   And so in the end, the rabbits lived on.
[01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:07.460]   The virus was there.
[01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:11.420]   It evolved to be more transmissible and less lethal.
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:13.180]   So that's the only-- - Life is amazing.
[01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:15.060]   - That's the only data. - Life on Earth is amazing.
[01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:15.940]   - It is, it is.
[01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:19.420]   If you take the time to look at it and see what's happened,
[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:20.740]   it is amazing.
[01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:22.740]   - It's also humbling that it just makes you realize
[01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:25.260]   humans are just a small part of the picture.
[01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:26.360]   - Of course.
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:28.320]   And we're wrecking it, aren't we?
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:32.500]   - Well, I mean, that's, we're not really,
[01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:34.780]   I mean, viruses are wrecking it in some ways.
[01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:36.860]   Part of this, we're not really wrecking anything.
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:38.180]   It's all part of it.
[01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:41.460]   - But you know when, the ways that humans exist
[01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:43.900]   encourages viruses to infect us, right?
[01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:45.820]   When we were hunter-gatherers,
[01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:49.620]   living in bands of 100 people, very few viruses,
[01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:51.720]   because it was hard for the virus to go
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:53.180]   from one band to another.
[01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:55.860]   And perhaps a hunter would, one of these humans
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:58.600]   would get an animal and bring a virus into camp,
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:05:59.560]   and some people would die,
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:02.160]   but it would never spread to another.
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.500]   And then when we started to congregate in cities,
[01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:06.640]   we figured out agriculture and so forth
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.760]   and how to harvest animals.
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:09.480]   Then we could get bigger and bigger populations,
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:10.960]   and the viruses went crazy.
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.560]   And they went from animals to us.
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:15.120]   So measles went from cows to humans
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:17.480]   when humans learned to domesticate cows
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:20.680]   and started gathering in big cities.
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:24.880]   - Yeah, but now that humans are able to communicate
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:28.240]   and travel globally, the virus has become
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.260]   more and more dangerous, transmissible.
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:33.960]   Thereby, if you look at Earth as an organism,
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:36.780]   thereby pushing humans to be more innovative,
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:39.600]   create Alpha, Fold 2, and 3, and 4, and 5,
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:41.800]   create better systems, and eventually there's rockets
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:43.960]   that keep flying from Earth.
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:47.460]   And eventually the virus is becoming super dangerous
[01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:49.680]   and threatening all of human civilization,
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.520]   will force it to become a multi-planetary species,
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:54.520]   and its organism starts expanding.
[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:55.960]   So I think it's a feature, not a bug.
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:57.520]   I don't know.
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:00.720]   - Well, I think that we have our early,
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:05.720]   probably most of the, we're studying viruses since 1900.
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:09.680]   Most of that time was because of diseases they caused.
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:12.920]   The first viruses discovered, yellow fever,
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:17.920]   virus smallpox, polio virus, influenza virus,
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:21.120]   those were all because people got sick,
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:22.800]   and they said, "Oh, look, this is a virus
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:24.600]   "that's associated with it."
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:28.880]   And so we got good at learning how to take care
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:31.040]   of these infections, making vaccines, and so forth
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:33.240]   over the years, and it's only in the last 20 years
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:36.120]   that we recognize that there are more viruses out there
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:38.240]   that are far more interesting, perhaps,
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:41.120]   but we've learned how to deal with the bad ones, for sure.
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:43.500]   - So we talked about what is a virus.
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.560]   We talked about some of the most dangerous
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:47.080]   and deadly viruses.
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:51.320]   Can we zoom in and talk about COVID-19 virus?
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:52.160]   - Sure.
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.680]   - What your preferred name is, but maybe for this--
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:54.600]   - Well, there's two names, right?
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:58.360]   The virus is SARS-CoV-2, which is hard, it's long, right?
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:00.440]   And then COVID-19 is the disease.
[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:03.280]   So you could say the virus of COVID-19, that's fine.
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.680]   - The virus of COVID-19.
[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:06.240]   But for the purpose of this conversation,
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:08.280]   we'll every once in a while just say COVID.
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:10.520]   - It's fine, no problem.
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.740]   - What is this virus from,
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:16.640]   I don't know how many ways we can talk about it.
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:19.680]   I think from a basic structural,
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:22.960]   like the very end structure,
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:25.920]   biological structure perspective, what is it?
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.080]   What are its variants?
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.080]   Can you describe the basics,
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:32.060]   the important characteristics of the virus?
[01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:35.020]   - So viruses are classified by humans,
[01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:38.280]   just to make it easier to keep track of them, right?
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:40.160]   So this is a coronavirus,
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:45.160]   which is because when they were first discovered,
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:48.280]   I think the first ones were animal coronaviruses.
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:50.440]   They looked at them in the electron microscope
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:51.960]   and it looked like the solar corona,
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.500]   and that's all there is to it.
[01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:56.340]   And I have to say that early in the outbreak,
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:09:00.260]   the place with the highest seropositivity in the US
[01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:03.800]   for a while, 68% was a working class neighborhood
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.500]   in New York City called Corona.
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:08.120]   Can you beat that, right?
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.600]   - That's crazy, yeah.
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:12.220]   - So coronaviruses, they have membranes, right?
[01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:13.180]   We talked about membranes,
[01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:15.000]   they have spike proteins in the membrane
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.320]   so they can attach to cells.
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:19.040]   And inside, they have RNA.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:22.000]   And they are the viruses with the longest RNA
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.360]   that we know of.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.120]   None other comes close.
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:29.620]   For some reason, they're able to maintain 30,000,
[01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:33.840]   so SARS-CoV-2 RNA is 30,000 bases of RNA.
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:37.240]   And some of the other coronas are even longer, 40,000.
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:40.920]   - This is a, coronas are family of viruses
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:45.920]   that included the one you mentioned before, version one.
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:47.800]   - So SARS-CoV-1, yeah.
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:49.520]   - CoV-1 and I guess other ones as well.
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:52.520]   - So the first, we first learned of them in animals.
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:56.840]   A lot of animals, pigs and cows and horses
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:58.240]   have coronaviruses.
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:01.980]   And then in the '60s, we discovered a couple
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:05.240]   of human coronaviruses that just cause colds,
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:08.960]   very mild colds that you wouldn't even think twice about.
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:13.960]   And then suddenly, in 2003, there's this outbreak
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:18.600]   of severe respiratory disease in China.
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:21.560]   And it started in November
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:24.000]   and they didn't tell the world until February.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.220]   And that was really bad because it was already spreading
[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:30.080]   by the time they told people about it.
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:34.620]   But this went to 29 different countries.
[01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:37.480]   Only 8,000 people were infected and then it stopped.
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:43.080]   And that was the first time we saw an epidemic coronavirus
[01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:45.760]   and what they did afterwards is they said,
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:48.400]   okay, it looks like it came from the meat markets.
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.640]   They have live meat markets in Guangzhou
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:54.000]   in the south of China where you can go and pick out
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.440]   an animal and the guy will slaughter it for you
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:57.280]   and give it to you.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:58.640]   And then of course, there's blood everywhere
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:00.600]   and that's how they got infected.
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:02.760]   And they figured out that there's this animal
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:05.780]   called a palm civet that was the source of virus.
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:08.420]   The palm civets are shipped in from the countryside
[01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:10.620]   and the palm civets somehow in the countryside
[01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:11.660]   got it from a bat.
[01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:13.880]   So they went looking in caves in the countryside
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:16.840]   and they found in one cave all the viruses
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:19.120]   that could make up SARS-1.
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:22.360]   And that was 2000, I would say took about five,
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:24.320]   eight years after that outbreak.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:29.320]   So that was the first hint that bats have coronaviruses
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:32.920]   that can infect people and cause problems, right?
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:35.640]   And after that, we should have been ready.
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:38.160]   - So didn't they already start developing vaccines
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.000]   after then? - Yes.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.320]   So some people started making vaccines.
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:46.320]   They tested them in mice, but they never got into people.
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:50.900]   And some people started working on antiviral drugs.
[01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:55.240]   Nothing ever came of them because industry,
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:57.520]   there's no disease, it's gone.
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:59.440]   Why should we make vaccines and drugs?
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:03.060]   And NIH in the US, you submit a grant and they say,
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:03.960]   "Ah, it's too risky.
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:05.560]   "There's none of this virus around."
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:07.400]   So people were really short-sighted
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:10.280]   because I always say we could have had antivirals
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:14.280]   for this, absolutely, for sure, no question.
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:17.160]   In fact, the one antiviral that's in phase three,
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:20.240]   it's called molnupiravir.
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:23.120]   It's the only one that you can take orally, it's a pill.
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:24.240]   It looks really good.
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.320]   That was developed five years ago,
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:28.000]   but never taken into humans.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.320]   It could have been ready.
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:31.240]   So we dropped the ball.
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:35.920]   And then the next decade, 2012, MERS coronavirus
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:38.960]   comes up in the Arabian Peninsula.
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:41.600]   This comes from camels and infects people,
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:44.840]   but probably the camels got it from bats originally
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:46.300]   some time ago.
[01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:50.600]   But that never transmits from person to person, very rarely.
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:54.600]   Every new little outbreak is a new infection from a camel.
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:57.280]   So that was 2012.
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:59.320]   And now here we are, 2019,
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:02.720]   the new outbreak of respiratory disease in China.
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:06.480]   And this one really goes all over the world
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.840]   where SARS-1 could not.
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:09.400]   It's a coronavirus.
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:11.160]   It's different enough from SARS-1
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.000]   that it has very different properties.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.640]   - But it still has a membrane,
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:17.880]   it still has a very long RNA in the middle,
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:19.960]   and then it still has the spike proteins.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:20.800]   - That's right.
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:24.840]   - What are the little unique things
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:27.800]   that make it that much more effective?
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:30.960]   - That make it cause a pandemic of millions of people
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:32.560]   as opposed to SARS-1?
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:37.560]   Well, the genome is 20% different from SARS-1.
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:40.920]   And in those bases, there are things
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:42.920]   that make it different from SARS-1.
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:45.800]   It binds the same receptor, ACE2, on the cell surface.
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:48.000]   That's remarkable.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.100]   It has a lot of the same proteins.
[01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:51.160]   They look similar.
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.080]   If you look at the structure of the spikes,
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:54.660]   they look similar,
[01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:57.000]   but there's enough amino acid differences
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.520]   to make the bio...
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:00.040]   And what it is, we don't know
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:03.200]   because how do you figure that out?
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:06.720]   You need to study animals 'cause you can't infect people.
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:08.940]   And the animal models aren't great.
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:11.600]   - So the way you figure that out
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:14.960]   is you figure out how those differences,
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:18.560]   what functional, like how the difference in the amino acids
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.840]   lead to functional difference of the virus.
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:22.080]   - That's right. - Like how it attaches,
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:23.160]   how it breaks the cell wall.
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:24.000]   - Exactly.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.080]   - And how the hell do you figure that out?
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:29.960]   I guess there's models of interaction.
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:31.760]   - You need to, first you need an animal
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:33.120]   of some kind to infect, right?
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.880]   You can use mice.
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:39.880]   People have used ferrets, guinea pigs, non-human primates,
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:43.240]   all of the above, non-human primates are very expensive,
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:44.600]   so not many people do that.
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:48.440]   And then you can put the virus in the respiratory tract.
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:51.560]   But in fact, none of them get sick like people do.
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:55.520]   Many people with COVID get a mild disease,
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:59.560]   but 20% get a very severe, longer lasting disease
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.760]   and they can die from it, right?
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:03.000]   No animal does that yet.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.440]   So we have no insight into what's controlling that.
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:07.480]   But if you just wanna look at the very first part
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:10.880]   of infection and the shedding and the transmission,
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:14.640]   you can do it in any one of several animal models.
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.640]   Ferrets are really good for transmission.
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:19.600]   They have nasal structures like humans
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:22.760]   and you can put them in cages next to each other
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:24.880]   and they'll transmit the virus really nicely.
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:26.640]   So you can study that.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:29.760]   But the other thing that's important that we should mention
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:32.180]   is how do you manipulate these viruses?
[01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:35.700]   So these are RNA viruses.
[01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:38.740]   You can't manipulate RNA.
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:40.820]   We don't know how to do it.
[01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:45.740]   But DNA, because of the recombinant DNA revolution
[01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:50.740]   that occurred in the '70s, we can change DNA any way we want.
[01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:53.680]   We can change a single base, we can cut out bases,
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:56.980]   we can put other things in really easily.
[01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:01.700]   And if I may give it a personal aspect,
[01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:05.860]   when I went to MIT as a postdoc in 1979,
[01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:08.980]   David Balthamer said, "Here's what I want you to do.
[01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:12.540]   "The moratorium on recombinant DNA experiments
[01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:14.700]   "on viruses has just been lifted.
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:18.140]   "I want you to make a DNA copy of polio
[01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:19.780]   "and see if you put that in a cell,
[01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:21.720]   "whether it will start an infection."
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:27.340]   So okay, so I made a DNA copy of polio virus.
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:31.780]   It's only 7,500 bases, it's much smaller than corona.
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:35.620]   And I took that DNA and I put it in a piece of DNA
[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:38.020]   from a bacteria called a plasmid.
[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:41.460]   And you can grow plasmids in many, many bacteria,
[01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:44.620]   make lots of them and purify the DNA really easily.
[01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:48.720]   And I took that DNA and I sequenced it
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:50.900]   because we didn't know the genome sequence
[01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:52.740]   of polio at the time.
[01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:54.660]   And that took me a year, by the way,
[01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:57.320]   'cause the techniques we had were really archaic
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:00.020]   and nowadays you could do it in 15 minutes, right?
[01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:01.540]   It's amazing.
[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:05.680]   And I took the DNA, I put it into cells and out came polio.
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:08.020]   So that's the start.
[01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:10.740]   Now, since then, everybody has taken that technique
[01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:11.740]   and used it for their virus.
[01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:13.220]   You can now do it with SARS-CoV-2.
[01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:16.020]   You make a DNA copy of any RNA virus,
[01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:19.060]   you can modify it and you put it back into cells
[01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:21.460]   and you'll get your modified virus out.
[01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:23.820]   So that's an important part of understanding
[01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:26.660]   the properties of the virus, let's say, in an animal.
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:28.860]   By changing the virus, you're changing a DNA copy,
[01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:32.540]   you're making the virus then and putting it into the animal.
[01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:35.380]   - Can you clarify, so even an RNA virus,
[01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:38.080]   you can take and turn it into DNA?
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:38.920]   - Yes.
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:41.020]   - And then that allows you to modify it?
[01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:41.860]   - Yes.
[01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:44.300]   - What's that mapping?
[01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:46.020]   Well, no, no, no, what's the process
[01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:48.360]   of going from RNA to DNA?
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:49.700]   - Reverse transcription.
[01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:51.220]   - That's reverse transcription.
[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:53.180]   Oh, so you actually go through the process
[01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:54.740]   of reverse transcription to do this?
[01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:57.780]   - Yes, remember David Baltimore and Howard Timmons
[01:17:57.780 --> 01:18:00.140]   had discovered this enzyme in the '70s.
[01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:01.780]   They got the Nobel Prize for that.
[01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:04.620]   And when I went to David's lab at MIT,
[01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:06.420]   he had the enzyme in the freezer.
[01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:08.860]   He said, "Here, take this and make a DNA copy of polio."
[01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:10.220]   - Yeah, I didn't make the connection
[01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:14.060]   that you can use that kind of thing for an RNA virus.
[01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:14.900]   - And so that's--
[01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:15.980]   - And then modify it.
[01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:18.260]   - See, any DNA virus already exists as DNA,
[01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:19.820]   so you can modify it.
[01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:22.340]   But for RNA viruses, it was difficult.
[01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:25.660]   And so then from that point on, for influenza,
[01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:28.020]   every other RNA virus and coronaviruses,
[01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:29.860]   people made DNA copies,
[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:31.500]   and that's what they used to modify
[01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:34.580]   and ask questions about what things are doing, right?
[01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:35.540]   What's this gene doing?
[01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:36.900]   What if we take it out, what happens?
[01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:39.580]   - Can you do the same thing with COVID?
[01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:41.180]   Is it take the RNA and then--
[01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:44.140]   - Of course, and in fact, in January 2020,
[01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:47.580]   as soon as the genome sequence was released from China,
[01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:50.300]   the labs all over were synthesizing
[01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:54.260]   this 30,000 base DNA and getting--
[01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:58.220]   - What can you figure out without infecting anything?
[01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:01.660]   Just turning into, with the reverse transcription,
[01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:03.500]   turning it to DNA, modifying stuff,
[01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:05.460]   and then putting it into a cell.
[01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:08.420]   What can you figure out from that?
[01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:11.580]   - Well, you could, let's say you can cut out a gene.
[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.220]   You see some genes in the sequence.
[01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:14.660]   I don't know what these genes do.
[01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:15.980]   Let's cut them out.
[01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:18.780]   And then you could cut them out of the DNA.
[01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:22.020]   You put the DNA in cells and maybe you get virus out.
[01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:25.420]   And you go, oh, clearly that gene's not needed
[01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:27.780]   for the virus to reproduce, at least in cells, right?
[01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:29.180]   Or maybe you take the gene out
[01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:31.580]   and you never get any virus, so it's lethal.
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:33.500]   - Is there a nice systematic ways of doing this?
[01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:35.460]   Do people kind of automate it?
[01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:40.020]   - Absolutely, and we, I mean, the problem with SARS,
[01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:42.540]   the COVID virus is it's 30,000 bases.
[01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:44.420]   There's a lot of stuff there.
[01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:48.460]   And what makes it more difficult is that you have to,
[01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:52.860]   it's been classified as a BSL-3 agent,
[01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:54.580]   biosafety level three.
[01:19:54.580 --> 01:19:58.940]   And so not everyone has a lab that's capable of doing that.
[01:19:58.940 --> 01:20:02.160]   So it limits the number of people who can do experiments.
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:05.720]   We're lucky to have a few in New York City,
[01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:07.500]   but not every place has them.
[01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:11.520]   So you cannot work with a virus just out on the bench
[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:13.060]   like we do with many other viruses.
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:15.780]   You have to wear a suit and have to have special procedures
[01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:16.900]   and containment and so forth.
[01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:19.220]   So it makes it difficult to do basic experiments
[01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:20.060]   on the virus.
[01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:22.740]   - But when it's a pandemic, there's a lot of money,
[01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:25.540]   there's a lot of incentive to work on it harder.
[01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:27.320]   - And also you don't need to work on the virus.
[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:29.220]   You can take bits of it and work.
[01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:31.180]   You could take, say, just the spike, right?
[01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:33.860]   And say, can we make a vaccine with just the spike?
[01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:36.040]   'Cause that doesn't require BSL-3.
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:36.880]   So yes.
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:40.420]   - So like building a vaccine requires you to figure out
[01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:42.700]   how, or antiviral drugs,
[01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:45.420]   how to attack various structural parts of the virus
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:47.020]   and the functional parts of the virus.
[01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:47.860]   - Right.
[01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:50.060]   You have to decide on a target.
[01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:50.900]   - Yeah.
[01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:52.340]   - Like, I'm gonna make an antiviral.
[01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:55.460]   What am I gonna target in the virus?
[01:20:55.460 --> 01:21:00.460]   And there are a few things that make more sense than others.
[01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:03.380]   Usually we like to target enzymes.
[01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:05.560]   I don't know if you remember your biochemistry,
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:07.820]   but enzymes are catalytic.
[01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:10.460]   You don't need a lot of them to do a lot of things.
[01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:12.900]   So they're typically in low concentrations
[01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:14.360]   in a virus-infected cell.
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:17.120]   So it's easier to inhibit them with a drug.
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:20.940]   And the coronas have a couple of enzymes that we can target.
[01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:23.620]   So you have to figure that out ahead of time
[01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:25.080]   and decide what to go after.
[01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:27.300]   And then you can look for drugs that inhibit
[01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:28.380]   what you're interested in.
[01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:29.920]   It's not that hard to do.
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:34.040]   - There's just something beautiful about biology,
[01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:36.100]   about the mechanisms of biology.
[01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:40.020]   And I kind of regret falling in love
[01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:41.820]   with computer science so much
[01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:46.280]   that I left that biology textbook on the shelf
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:47.360]   and left it behind.
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:49.480]   But hopefully we'll return to it now.
[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:51.920]   'Cause I think one of the things you learn
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:53.000]   even in computer science,
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:58.000]   that studying biology and certainly neurobiology,
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.760]   you get inspired.
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:05.160]   Here's a mechanism of incredible complexity
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:07.520]   that works really well, is very robust,
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:09.500]   is very effective, efficient.
[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:11.800]   It inspires you to come up with techniques
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:13.760]   that you can engineer in the machine.
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:15.760]   - That's what drives the field forward
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:20.760]   when people improvise and come up with new technologies
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:22.720]   that really make a difference.
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:25.240]   And we have a bunch of those now.
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:28.440]   - What's the difference between the coronavirus family
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:33.080]   and the other popular family, influenza virus family?
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:35.040]   (laughing)
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:37.320]   I mean, if I were, 'cause you mentioned
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.480]   we should have done a lot more
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:39.920]   in terms of vaccine development,
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:42.320]   that kind of thing for coronaviruses.
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:46.440]   But if I were back then, from my understanding,
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:49.840]   the thing we should all be afraid of is influenza.
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:53.840]   Like some strong variants coming out from that family.
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:55.800]   That seems like the one that will destroy
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:23:00.240]   human civilization or hurt us really badly.
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:02.520]   I don't know if you agree with this sense,
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:06.480]   but maybe you can also just clarify
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:09.560]   what to use as the difference between the families.
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:11.000]   - So it's an interesting difference.
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.480]   They both have membranes, right?
[01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:18.080]   So then they have spike proteins embedded in them.
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:20.760]   And they're different spikes.
[01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:24.320]   In fact, for influenza, there are two main ones.
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:26.080]   They're called the HA and the NA.
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:32.240]   But what's inside is RNA, but it's very different RNA.
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:35.720]   And here we have to explain that.
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:40.680]   So viruses with RNA can have three different kinds of RNA.
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:44.520]   They can have what we call plus RNA.
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:49.880]   They can have minus RNA, or they could have plus minus,
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:54.600]   actually two strands hybridized together.
[01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:59.600]   The plus RNA simply means that if you put
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:03.720]   that plus RNA in a cell, your cell has ribosomes in it
[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:05.800]   that make the proteins that you need.
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:08.600]   The ribosomes will immediately latch onto the plus RNA
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:09.960]   and begin to make proteins.
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:15.360]   A minus RNA is not the right strand to make proteins.
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:17.240]   So it has to be copied first.
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:19.640]   And then the plus minus is both together.
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:22.600]   So the SARS coronaviruses,
[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:25.320]   all the coronaviruses have plus RNA.
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:26.840]   So as soon as that RNA gets in the cell,
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:28.480]   boom, it starts an infectious cycle.
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:31.280]   Same thing with poliovirus, by the way, which I worked on.
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:34.920]   Influenza viruses are negative stranded.
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:37.800]   So they cannot be translated when they get in the cell.
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:40.000]   So that's tough for the virus
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.000]   because the cell actually cannot make plus RNA
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000]   from minus RNA.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.160]   It doesn't have the enzyme to do it.
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:53.600]   So the virus has to carry it in, inside the virus particle.
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:55.600]   And then when the minus RNA is in the cell,
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:59.400]   the virus enzyme makes plus RNAs and those get translated.
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:00.320]   So it's a big difference.
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:03.400]   And then in the influenza viruses,
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:07.040]   not only is it minus RNA, but it's in pieces.
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:09.480]   It's in eight pieces.
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:10.880]   We call that segmented,
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:14.880]   whereas the corona is in one long piece of RNA.
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:15.720]   - So what is that?
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:17.880]   Is that they're like floating separately?
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:19.600]   - Yeah, so the genes are on separate pieces.
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:21.800]   They're all packaged inside that virus particle
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:23.760]   of influenza virus, but they're in pieces.
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:26.400]   And why that's important is because
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:29.320]   if two different influenza viruses
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:31.520]   infect the same cell,
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:33.760]   the pieces as they reproduce can mix
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:38.200]   and out can come a virus with a new assortment of pieces.
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:40.240]   And that allows influenza virus
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:43.840]   to undergo extremely high frequency evolution.
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:45.640]   That's why we get pandemics.
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:47.040]   When we have a new flu pandemic,
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:49.960]   it's because somewhere in some animal,
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:53.120]   two viruses have reassorted and made a new virus
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.480]   that we hadn't seen before.
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:26:00.320]   - So you're talking about kind of biological characteristics,
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:03.680]   but what, am I incorrect in my intuition
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:05.720]   that are from the things I've heard
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:09.920]   that the influenza family of viruses is more dangerous?
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:12.600]   Like what makes it more dangerous to humans?
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:16.120]   - Well, it depends on the,
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:19.440]   there are many flavors or vintages of influenza virus.
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:21.240]   Some are dangerous and some are not, right?
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:22.600]   It depends on which one.
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:26.400]   Some, like the 1918 apparently was very lethal,
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:28.320]   killed a lot of people.
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:30.120]   But more contemporary viruses,
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:35.120]   we had a pandemic in 2009 of influenza.
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:39.300]   That wasn't such a lethal virus.
[01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:40.680]   We don't know exactly why,
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:42.320]   but it didn't kill that many people.
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:43.800]   It transmitted pretty well.
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:45.240]   - Is that the bird flu one?
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:47.640]   - They're all deriving,
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:49.760]   that one was called swine influenza.
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:50.600]   - Swine, that's right, swine, yeah.
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:52.320]   - It seemed to have started in a pig,
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:57.080]   but it had bird, it had RNAs from bird influenza viruses.
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:00.640]   These viruses are all reassortants of different viruses
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:03.080]   from pigs and birds and humans.
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:07.200]   But influenza can cause pneumonia
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:10.000]   and can kill you as does SARS-CoV-2.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.560]   So it depends on the virus.
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.680]   So there is another influenza virus
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:15.000]   that's currently circulating.
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.640]   So right now we have the 2009 pandemic virus,
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:20.080]   that's still around.
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:23.880]   And then the 1968 pandemic virus,
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:25.800]   which was the one before 2009,
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:27.440]   that one is still around too.
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:29.120]   And that's more lethal.
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:30.400]   And depending on the season,
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:33.840]   some seasons the 2009 virus predominates,
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:36.240]   some seasons the 1968.
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:38.840]   And when the '68 is around, you get more lethality.
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:41.720]   - So we're living with an influenza family.
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:44.000]   We haven't exterminated them.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.320]   - Right, we never will, never exterminate them.
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:47.160]   - Why?
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:49.560]   - Well, because every shorebird in the world
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:50.840]   is infected with them.
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:53.200]   You know, gulls and terns and ducks
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:54.840]   and all sorts of things.
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:58.280]   - Why can't we develop strong vaccines
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:27:59.520]   that defend against--
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:01.440]   - Oh, we could do that, sure.
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:04.960]   But that would not eliminate them from humans.
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:06.840]   Even if you had the best vaccine,
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:08.920]   you would never get rid of it in people
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:11.040]   because there would always be someone
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:14.440]   who's not vaccinated or in which the vaccine didn't work.
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:16.280]   No vaccine is 100%.
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:17.120]   - Right.
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:18.760]   Well, you just contradicted yourself.
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:20.920]   You said the perfect vaccine.
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:23.200]   - Imperfect, imperfect.
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:26.640]   - But then you said, even if you had the perfect vaccine,
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:29.000]   yeah, some people wouldn't get vaccinated.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.760]   But I understand what you mean.
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:32.680]   I actually was asking, how difficult is it
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:35.240]   to make vaccines like that?
[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:36.920]   It seems like it's very difficult to do that
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:38.880]   for the influenza virus.
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:43.000]   - So it's really easy to make an old-school vaccine.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.520]   So the way the first influenza vaccines were made,
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:51.120]   it was actually Jonas Salk worked on them in the '40s.
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:53.320]   You just grow lots of virus,
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:55.960]   and you grow it in eggs, by the way, chicken eggs.
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:57.000]   - Nice.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:57.920]   Literally?
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:58.760]   Wait, wait.
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:00.960]   - Yeah, chicken, embryonated, so they get fertilized,
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:03.080]   and there's a 10 or 12-day embryo in it,
[01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:04.920]   and you put virus in it, it grows up,
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:05.760]   and then you harvest it.
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:08.480]   You get about 10 mLs of fluid.
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:11.520]   And then you take that, you treat it with formaldehyde
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:14.400]   or formalin, and it inactivates the virus
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.600]   so it's no longer infectious.
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:18.480]   And you just inject that into people.
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:19.840]   And that was the first flu vaccine
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:22.200]   that was made for the US Army, actually,
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:24.240]   and then it got moved over to people.
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:27.400]   We still use that old-school tech today.
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:30.680]   - So you're taking, can you help me out here?
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:34.480]   Okay, so this is a good time to talk about vaccines.
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:37.000]   Okay, so you're talking about,
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.200]   you're taking the actual virus,
[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:42.520]   you put it in an egg, you let it grow up.
[01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:44.080]   It's very funny that you put it in an egg.
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:46.720]   It's very poetic.
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:51.720]   And then how do you make it not infection,
[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:53.960]   not effective or whatever?
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:54.800]   - Not infectious.
[01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:56.640]   - Not infectious, is that the right term here?
[01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:57.480]   - Yeah.
[01:29:57.480 --> 01:29:58.920]   - So how do you make it not infectious?
[01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:02.000]   - You can treat it with any number of chemicals
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.400]   that'll disrupt the particle so it no longer infects.
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:09.040]   - So that step of disrupting the particle,
[01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:12.920]   is that very specific to a particular variant particle?
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:14.880]   - No, the same collection of chemicals
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:16.280]   you can use for all kinds of,
[01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:19.400]   and which have been used for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines also.
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:20.520]   Same technology.
[01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:23.680]   - Okay, so what are, there's several things to ask.
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:25.360]   So you called it old-school in a way
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:27.640]   that's slightly dismissive,
[01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:30.040]   like people talk about Windows 98 or something.
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:31.880]   (both laugh)
[01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:34.840]   So is there risks involved with it,
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:37.400]   or is it just difficult to produce large amounts?
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:38.860]   Does it take a lot of eggs?
[01:30:38.860 --> 01:30:40.160]   - It's very easy.
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:41.660]   I mean, you could do it in cells and culture,
[01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:43.040]   but eggs were convenient.
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:46.280]   And in the 1940s, we didn't have cells in culture.
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:47.280]   We didn't know how to do that,
[01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:49.720]   so we had to use something else.
[01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:52.320]   It's easy to do,
[01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:56.960]   but the process of inactivating the virus with a chemical
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:59.980]   makes it not the best vaccine you can make.
[01:30:59.980 --> 01:31:02.480]   The flu vaccines that we have today,
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:05.760]   which are mostly based on this inactivation,
[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:08.520]   is called inactivated virus vaccines.
[01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:12.880]   - Oh, so like the kind of thing it presents
[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:14.960]   to the immune system to train on
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:19.560]   is not close to the actual virus.
[01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:20.520]   - Yes, that's what we think.
[01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:22.400]   So that's why probably the flu vaccines
[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:23.960]   are just not very good.
[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:29.040]   60% efficiency at the best, right,
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:30.080]   which is not really good.
[01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:31.200]   - What does it mean?
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:33.980]   What is the measure of efficiency for a vaccine?
[01:31:33.980 --> 01:31:37.500]   - Well, how it does in the general population
[01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:38.800]   at preventing influenza.
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:40.800]   - At preventing?
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:41.920]   - Illness, not infection.
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:44.840]   We usually don't measure infection
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:46.080]   when we're testing a vaccine.
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:47.680]   We just measure sickness.
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:50.240]   That's really easy to score, right?
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:52.000]   You do a trial and you say,
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.880]   "If you feel sick, give us a call."
[01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:55.280]   We'll tell you what to do.
[01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:58.040]   - So yeah, I mean, what's sickness?
[01:31:58.040 --> 01:32:01.560]   Sickness is the presence of symptoms.
[01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:04.960]   - So this is good time to say what a symptom is, okay?
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:08.900]   A symptom is what you only can feel.
[01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:11.580]   Only you can feel an upset stomach
[01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:13.380]   or a sore throat or that sort of thing.
[01:32:13.380 --> 01:32:15.380]   - It's the lived experience of a symptom.
[01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:19.060]   - Whereas a sign is something that someone could measure
[01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:20.500]   and tell that you're infected,
[01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:25.500]   like virus in your nasopharynx or something else, right?
[01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:27.100]   Signs and symptoms.
[01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:28.460]   And so in a vaccine trial,
[01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:31.820]   they tell you if you have any of these symptoms,
[01:32:31.820 --> 01:32:35.040]   they give you a paper with the exact symptoms listed
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:36.880]   to make sure you're picking them up, right?
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:41.520]   So for flu, it would probably be fever, sore throat, cough.
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:44.160]   You call them and then they will do a PCR
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:46.580]   and make sure you've got flu and not some other virus
[01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:48.160]   that makes similar symptoms.
[01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:50.940]   And then they would say,
[01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:53.780]   "Are you a vaccine or non-vaccine arm?"
[01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:55.800]   And they count up all the infections
[01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:57.720]   and see how the vaccine did, basically.
[01:32:57.720 --> 01:33:02.120]   - That's so fascinating because the reporting,
[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:03.820]   so symptom is what you feel.
[01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:04.660]   - Yes, for sure.
[01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:08.300]   - And certainly the mind has the ability
[01:33:08.300 --> 01:33:10.180]   to conjure up feelings.
[01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:11.860]   - Oh yes, absolutely.
[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:13.760]   - And so like culturally,
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:16.860]   maybe there was a time in our culture
[01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:21.860]   where it was looked down upon to feel sick
[01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:25.140]   or something like that, like toughen up kind of thing.
[01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:28.560]   And so then you probably have very few symptoms
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:29.480]   being reported.
[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:31.040]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:34.820]   - And now is like much more, I don't know,
[01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:37.880]   perhaps you're much more likely to report symptoms.
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:40.800]   Now it's fascinating 'cause then it changes.
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:42.120]   - Oh, it is definitely a perception
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:45.120]   because your symptom may be nothing to me
[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:46.080]   or vice versa, right?
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:47.480]   And so when you're doing this,
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:51.120]   it's a little bit of a imprecise science
[01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:54.120]   because and even it's a cultural thing.
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:57.840]   In some countries, something that would make us feel horrible
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:33:59.240]   they wouldn't even bother reporting.
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:00.480]   No, I didn't have any symptoms.
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:03.440]   So it's a little bit imprecise and it clouds the results.
[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:05.840]   So if you can measure things, it's always better.
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:07.760]   But you start out with a symptom.
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:11.120]   And if you say, if someone tells you this virus,
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:15.760]   20% of the people are asymptomatic,
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:18.240]   they don't report symptoms,
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:22.000]   that number is probably not a constant.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.740]   It depends where you did the study.
[01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:26.900]   It could be different in China versus South America,
[01:34:26.900 --> 01:34:28.420]   Europe, et cetera, yeah.
[01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:29.580]   - I mean, I was trying to,
[01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:32.420]   so I took two shots of the Pfizer vaccine.
[01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:34.580]   I had zero symptoms.
[01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:35.420]   - Wow.
[01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:36.780]   - So and I was wondering,
[01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:38.740]   well, see, but that's my feelings, right?
[01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:41.100]   This is not, 'cause I felt fine.
[01:34:41.100 --> 01:34:42.060]   I was waiting.
[01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:44.140]   - Did you have pain at the injection site?
[01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:48.380]   - No, it was kind of pleasant.
[01:34:48.380 --> 01:34:50.260]   - You felt nothing the next day, no?
[01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:51.100]   - Nothing. - Okay.
[01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:53.380]   - No tightness, no exhaustion, no.
[01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:56.780]   But see, like I have an insane sleeping schedule.
[01:34:56.780 --> 01:34:59.300]   I already put myself through crazy stuff.
[01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:03.300]   That said, maybe I was expecting something really bad.
[01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:06.780]   Like I was waiting and therefore didn't feel it.
[01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:10.300]   But I also got allergy shots.
[01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:14.620]   And those, I was out all next day,
[01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:16.460]   like exhausted for some reason.
[01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:19.580]   So that gave me like a sense like,
[01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:22.660]   okay, at least sometimes I can feel shitty.
[01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:24.500]   That's good to know.
[01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:25.340]   - Sure, sure.
[01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:27.220]   - And then with the vaccine, it didn't.
[01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:29.020]   But the question is like,
[01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:32.620]   how much does my mind come into play there?
[01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:34.980]   The expectations of symptoms,
[01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:39.340]   the expectations of not feeling well,
[01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:41.340]   how does that affect the sort of the self-reporting
[01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:42.180]   of the symptoms?
[01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:44.620]   - I think it's definitely a variable there,
[01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:46.460]   but there's certainly many people
[01:35:46.460 --> 01:35:48.460]   that don't feel anything after the vaccines.
[01:35:48.460 --> 01:35:52.020]   And there's some that have a whole range of things
[01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:54.620]   like soreness and fever, et cetera.
[01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:55.460]   Yeah.
[01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:56.300]   - So, okay, you were talking about
[01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:58.620]   the old school developments like the egg.
[01:35:58.620 --> 01:35:59.460]   - Right.
[01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:02.380]   - What's better than that?
[01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:04.460]   - So then the next generation of vaccines
[01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:07.900]   which arose in the '50s were what we call
[01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:11.020]   replication competent, where the virus,
[01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:13.980]   you take it and it's actually reproducing in you.
[01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:15.260]   - Yeah, that sounds safe.
[01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:19.060]   - And it can be somewhat problematic, yes,
[01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:22.340]   as you might imagine, 'cause once you put that virus in you,
[01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:24.180]   you have no more control, right?
[01:36:24.180 --> 01:36:25.780]   It's not like you have a kill switch in it,
[01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:28.660]   which actually would be a great idea to put in.
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:31.620]   - Like nanobots?
[01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:32.460]   What composite?
[01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:34.220]   - No, you could just put something in there.
[01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:37.940]   If you added a drug, you would shut it off, right?
[01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:39.920]   And people are thinking about that
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:41.780]   because now we're engineering viruses
[01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:44.860]   to treat cancers and other diseases.
[01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:46.980]   And we may wanna put kill switches in them
[01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:48.580]   just to make sure they don't run away.
[01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:50.380]   - Oh, interesting, so you can like deploy a drug
[01:36:50.380 --> 01:36:55.380]   that binds to this virus that would shut it off in the body.
[01:36:55.380 --> 01:36:56.860]   Something like that.
[01:36:56.860 --> 01:36:58.660]   - Something like that, yeah, that would be the idea.
[01:36:58.660 --> 01:36:59.900]   You'd have to engineer it in.
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:03.620]   Anyway, these were, the first one was yellow fever vaccine
[01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:06.260]   that was made because that was a big problem.
[01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:08.900]   And this virus, and the way you do this,
[01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:12.680]   back in the old day, was empirical.
[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:15.300]   So Max Tyler, who did the yellow fever vaccine,
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:18.600]   he took the virus, which is a human virus, right?
[01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:23.800]   And he infected, I think he used chick embryos.
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:26.540]   And he went from one embryo to another
[01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:29.340]   and just kept passing it, did that hundreds of times.
[01:37:29.340 --> 01:37:32.700]   And every 10 passages, he would take the virus
[01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:36.580]   and put it in a mouse or a monkey, whatever his model was.
[01:37:36.580 --> 01:37:38.060]   And then eventually he got a virus
[01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:41.900]   that didn't cause any disease after 200 and some passages.
[01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:43.880]   And then that was tested in people
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:46.560]   and it became the yellow fever vaccine that we use today.
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:50.460]   He selected for mutations that made the virus
[01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:55.460]   not cause disease, but still make an immune response.
[01:37:55.460 --> 01:37:57.660]   So those are called replication competent.
[01:37:57.660 --> 01:37:59.500]   We now have the polio vaccine,
[01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:03.200]   which was developed in the '50s after the yellow fever.
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:05.480]   Then we had measles, mumps, rubella.
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:09.220]   Those are all replication competent vaccines.
[01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:12.420]   And you mentioned that's a good idea.
[01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:15.500]   They are all safe vaccines.
[01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:18.460]   The only one that has had an issue
[01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:21.380]   is the polio replication competent vaccine.
[01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:26.000]   It was called Sabin vaccine or oral polio virus vaccine,
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.980]   because you take it orally.
[01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:31.460]   It's wonderful because you don't have to inject it.
[01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:33.300]   This is the perfect delivery.
[01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:37.020]   Either intranasal for a respiratory virus
[01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:38.020]   or orally for polio.
[01:38:38.020 --> 01:38:40.900]   It goes into your intestines, it reproduces,
[01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:43.940]   and it gives you wonderful protection against polio.
[01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:48.100]   However, you do shed virus out.
[01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:52.780]   And that virus is no longer a vaccine.
[01:38:52.780 --> 01:38:55.620]   It's reverted genetically in your intestine.
[01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:57.300]   - So you can infect others with polio.
[01:38:57.300 --> 01:38:59.780]   - You can take that virus and then put it into an animal
[01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:00.620]   and give it polio.
[01:39:00.620 --> 01:39:04.380]   And in fact, the parents of some kids
[01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:06.900]   in the '60s and '70s who were immunized
[01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:08.380]   got polio from the vaccine.
[01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:09.820]   The rate was about one
[01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:13.740]   in one and a half million cases of polio.
[01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:15.340]   So it's called vaccine-associated polio.
[01:39:15.340 --> 01:39:19.500]   And I always argue that we may not have
[01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:21.180]   picked the right vaccine.
[01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:25.460]   There was a big fight in the US and other countries
[01:39:25.460 --> 01:39:27.540]   between the inactivated polio
[01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:29.780]   and the infectious polio vaccines,
[01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:31.580]   which ones we should be using,
[01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:33.980]   because we found out that the infectious vaccine
[01:39:33.980 --> 01:39:35.300]   actually caused polio.
[01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:38.060]   And eight to 10 kids a year in the US alone
[01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:39.820]   got polio from the vaccine,
[01:39:39.820 --> 01:39:43.500]   which looking back is really not acceptable in my view,
[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:46.060]   although the public health community said it was
[01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:47.560]   to get rid of polio.
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:51.420]   So now we're close to eradicating polio globally,
[01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:55.940]   but this vaccine-derived polio is a problem.
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:59.220]   So now we have to go back to the inactivated vaccine,
[01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:01.420]   which is tough 'cause it's injected.
[01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:05.020]   - So, okay, so the basic high-level,
[01:40:05.020 --> 01:40:08.340]   how vaccines work principle is
[01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:11.180]   you want to deploy something in the body
[01:40:11.180 --> 01:40:13.860]   that's as close to the actual virus as possible,
[01:40:13.860 --> 01:40:15.540]   but doesn't do nearly as much harm.
[01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:16.380]   - That's right.
[01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:17.780]   - And there's like a million, not a million,
[01:40:17.780 --> 01:40:19.620]   but there's a bunch of ways you could possibly do that.
[01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:20.560]   - So those are two ways.
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:21.980]   And now, of course, we have modern ways
[01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:25.020]   we can make mRNA vaccines, right?
[01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:26.980]   - What are the modern ways?
[01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:29.380]   Do you want to look mRNA vaccine?
[01:40:29.380 --> 01:40:31.100]   - So that's the most modern,
[01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:33.140]   but even before mRNA vaccines,
[01:40:33.140 --> 01:40:36.060]   we learned that we could use viruses
[01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:40.820]   to deliver proteins from a virus that you want to prevent.
[01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:43.980]   And so the Ebola vaccine,
[01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:46.580]   we took the spike gene of Ebola virus
[01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:47.980]   and put it in a different virus,
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:49.580]   and we deliver that to people,
[01:40:49.580 --> 01:40:51.980]   and that's called a vectored vaccine.
[01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:54.560]   And some of the COVID vaccines are vectors
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:57.680]   of different kinds, the most famous are adenovirus vectors
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:00.460]   carrying the spike gene into the cell.
[01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:03.380]   - Can you explain how the vector vaccine works again?
[01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:08.380]   - So we take a virus that will infect humans,
[01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:11.540]   but will not make you sick.
[01:41:11.540 --> 01:41:13.520]   In the case of adenovirus,
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:16.020]   the years and years of people studying it
[01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:18.780]   has told us what genes you could cut out
[01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:21.000]   and allow the virus to infect the cell,
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:22.140]   but not cause any disease.
[01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:24.160]   - So instead of doing selection on it,
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:27.460]   you actually genetically modify it.
[01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:29.220]   - Yes, you modify the vector, yeah.
[01:41:29.220 --> 01:41:30.620]   So you'd be much more precise about it.
[01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:31.500]   - You'd be very precise,
[01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:34.900]   and then you splice in the gene for the spike,
[01:41:34.900 --> 01:41:37.620]   and then you use that to deliver the gene,
[01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:39.660]   and it becomes produced as protein,
[01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:40.940]   and then you make an immune response.
[01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:43.180]   - And vector is the term for this modified.
[01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:44.180]   - Right.
[01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:47.900]   So we're now using viruses at our bidding.
[01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:50.180]   We're using them as vectors, not just for vaccines.
[01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:52.380]   We can cure monogenic diseases.
[01:41:52.380 --> 01:41:55.560]   That is, if you're born with a genetic disease,
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:57.820]   you have a deletion or a mutation in a gene,
[01:41:57.820 --> 01:42:02.020]   a single gene, we can give you the regular gene back
[01:42:02.020 --> 01:42:03.120]   using a virus vector.
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:07.220]   Cancers too, we can cure cancers with vectors.
[01:42:07.220 --> 01:42:09.980]   - Wow, really?
[01:42:09.980 --> 01:42:10.940]   Interesting.
[01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:12.580]   - I think in 10 to 15 years,
[01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:15.220]   most cancers will be treatable with viruses, yeah.
[01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:21.140]   Not only can we put things in the vector to kill the tumor,
[01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:25.420]   we can target the vector to the tumor specifically
[01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:26.880]   in a number of ways,
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:28.220]   and that makes it less toxic, right?
[01:42:28.220 --> 01:42:30.180]   It doesn't infect all your other cells.
[01:42:30.180 --> 01:42:33.700]   - But it takes time to develop a vector
[01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:34.860]   for a particular thing,
[01:42:34.860 --> 01:42:37.620]   'cause it requires a deep understanding.
[01:42:37.620 --> 01:42:40.220]   - Yeah, in fact, we have about a dozen different
[01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:42.940]   virus vectors that have been studied for 20 years,
[01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:46.340]   and those are the set of vaccine vectors that we're using.
[01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:50.780]   So it includes adenovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus,
[01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:54.260]   which is a cousin of rabies, but doesn't make people sick.
[01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:58.640]   Influenza virus is being used as a vector,
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:00.260]   and even measles virus.
[01:43:00.260 --> 01:43:04.160]   So we're familiar with how to modify those to be vectors,
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:07.480]   and those are being used for COVID vaccines.
[01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:10.640]   And then of course, we have the newest,
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:12.620]   which is the nucleic acid vaccines.
[01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:15.220]   So years ago, people said,
[01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:17.760]   "Why can't we just inject DNA into people?
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:22.400]   "Take the spike and put it in a DNA and inject it."
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:25.320]   So people tried many, many different vaccines,
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:28.320]   and in fact, there are no human licensed vaccines
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:29.520]   that are DNA vaccines,
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:33.120]   although there is a West Nile vaccine for horses
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:35.960]   that's a DNA-based vaccine.
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:38.200]   So if you have a horse, you can give it this vaccine,
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:39.040]   but no human.
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:42.640]   - Can you clarify, does a DNA vaccine
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:44.960]   only work for DNA viruses?
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:46.880]   - No, it can work for DNA or RNA,
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:48.440]   'cause remember, for an RNA virus,
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:50.800]   we can make a DNA copy of it.
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:53.840]   And it will still, when you put that DNA in a cell,
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:55.480]   it goes into the nucleus.
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:56.720]   - Okay, right.
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:58.520]   So you're just skipping a step.
[01:43:58.520 --> 01:43:59.360]   - You get proteins.
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:02.160]   - RNA vaccines, you're giving, okay, I got it.
[01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:04.320]   - So those didn't work for human vaccines,
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:07.360]   and there were many HIV/AIDS vaccine trials
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:10.880]   that used DNA vaccines, didn't work.
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:13.400]   And then, a number of years ago,
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:17.880]   people started thinking, "How about RNA, RNA vaccines?"
[01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:20.360]   And I first heard this, I thought, "What?"
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:22.400]   I've worked with RNA my whole career.
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:24.320]   It's so fragile.
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:26.700]   If you look at it the wrong way, it breaks.
[01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:29.840]   I mean, that's being facetious, right?
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:31.680]   But you have to be very careful,
[01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:35.940]   'cause your hands are full of enzymes that will degrade RNA.
[01:44:35.940 --> 01:44:38.840]   So I thought, "How could this possibly work,
[01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:40.200]   "injecting it into someone's?"
[01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:43.980]   It's an example of, I was skeptical, and I was wrong.
[01:44:43.980 --> 01:44:47.040]   It turns out that if you modify the RNA properly
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:49.980]   and protect it in a lipid capsule,
[01:44:51.100 --> 01:44:52.980]   it actually works as a vaccine.
[01:44:52.980 --> 01:44:54.980]   And people were working on this years
[01:44:54.980 --> 01:44:57.120]   before COVID came around.
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:00.360]   They were doing experimental mRNA vaccines,
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:01.540]   and there were a couple of companies
[01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:02.580]   that were working on it.
[01:45:02.580 --> 01:45:07.500]   And so at the beginning of 2020, they said, "Let's try it."
[01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:09.740]   And I was skeptical, frankly,
[01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:12.180]   'cause I just thought RNA would be too labile,
[01:45:12.180 --> 01:45:13.660]   but I was wrong.
[01:45:13.660 --> 01:45:16.020]   - So this is, as we're saying offline,
[01:45:16.020 --> 01:45:18.180]   one of the great things about you
[01:45:18.180 --> 01:45:20.620]   is you're able to say when you're wrong
[01:45:20.620 --> 01:45:22.300]   about intuitions you've had in the past,
[01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:25.140]   which is a beautiful thing for a scientist.
[01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:28.140]   But I still think it's very surprising
[01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:30.060]   that something like that works, right?
[01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:31.380]   - Yeah, I am surprised.
[01:45:31.380 --> 01:45:35.980]   - So you're just launching RNA in a protective membrane.
[01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:36.820]   - Yeah.
[01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:39.780]   - And then, now, one thing is surprising,
[01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:43.860]   that the RNA sort of lasts long enough, right?
[01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:44.900]   - That's right.
[01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:45.740]   - In its structure.
[01:45:45.740 --> 01:45:49.340]   But then the other thing is,
[01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:53.220]   why does it work that that's a good training ground
[01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:56.140]   for the immune system?
[01:45:56.140 --> 01:45:58.540]   Is that obvious?
[01:45:58.540 --> 01:46:01.260]   - Well, I don't think it's obvious to most people,
[01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:04.540]   and it's worth going into, 'cause it's really interesting.
[01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:09.020]   I mean, first of all, they wrap the RNA in fats,
[01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:10.580]   in lipid membranes, right?
[01:46:10.580 --> 01:46:12.740]   And the particular formulation,
[01:46:12.740 --> 01:46:16.020]   they test for years to make sure it's stable,
[01:46:16.020 --> 01:46:17.980]   it lasts a long time after it's injected.
[01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:22.100]   And the two companies that make the current COVID vaccines,
[01:46:22.100 --> 01:46:23.220]   right, Moderna and Pfizer,
[01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:26.620]   they have different lipid formulations, to get to the same.
[01:46:26.620 --> 01:46:29.020]   So that's a real part of it.
[01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:30.220]   And it's not simple.
[01:46:30.220 --> 01:46:31.860]   There are quite a few different lipids
[01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:34.100]   that they put into this coating.
[01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:37.020]   And they test to see how long they protect the RNA
[01:46:37.020 --> 01:46:39.140]   after it's injected, say, into a mouse.
[01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:40.620]   How long does it last?
[01:46:40.620 --> 01:46:41.940]   And the way it works is,
[01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:46.140]   apparently, these lipid nanoparticles,
[01:46:46.140 --> 01:46:48.820]   they get injected into your muscle,
[01:46:48.820 --> 01:46:52.100]   they bump into cells, and they get taken up.
[01:46:52.100 --> 01:46:55.260]   So lipid fat is sticky.
[01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:59.880]   It's greasy, we like to say.
[01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:03.700]   And so your cells are covered with a greasy membrane also.
[01:47:03.700 --> 01:47:06.560]   So when these lipid nanoparticles bump into them,
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:08.380]   they stick, and they eventually get taken up.
[01:47:08.380 --> 01:47:11.260]   And they figured this out right at the beginning.
[01:47:11.260 --> 01:47:13.700]   If we put RNA in a lipid nanoparticle,
[01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:15.220]   will it get taken up into a cell?
[01:47:15.220 --> 01:47:16.340]   And the answer was yes.
[01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:18.660]   It was just, let's try it, and it worked.
[01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:20.340]   - So it's basically experiment.
[01:47:20.340 --> 01:47:22.620]   It's not like some deep understanding of biology.
[01:47:22.620 --> 01:47:25.460]   It's experimentally speaking, it just seems to work.
[01:47:25.460 --> 01:47:26.800]   - Yeah, well, they had some idea
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:30.460]   that lipids would target this to a cell membrane.
[01:47:30.460 --> 01:47:33.860]   And remember, there's no receptor involved.
[01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:36.900]   Like, the virus has a specific protein
[01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:39.260]   that it attaches to a receptor.
[01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:41.620]   It's not efficient enough to just bump around
[01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:43.260]   and get into a cell.
[01:47:43.260 --> 01:47:44.940]   That's what these things are doing.
[01:47:44.940 --> 01:47:47.260]   And they probably optimize the lipids
[01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:49.780]   to get more efficient uptake.
[01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:51.940]   But it's not as efficient as a virus would be
[01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:52.780]   to get into a cell.
[01:47:52.780 --> 01:47:54.460]   - Right, so you have no specific,
[01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:57.620]   I mean, which is why it's surprising
[01:47:57.620 --> 01:48:02.620]   that you can crack into the safe with a hammer.
[01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:04.260]   (laughs)
[01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:06.100]   Or with some fat.
[01:48:06.100 --> 01:48:08.820]   I mean, that's kind of surprising.
[01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:11.900]   It's kind of amazing that it works.
[01:48:11.900 --> 01:48:16.900]   But so, maybe let's try to talk about this.
[01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:21.240]   So, one of the hesitancies around vaccines,
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:24.660]   or basically around any new technology,
[01:48:24.660 --> 01:48:27.680]   is the fact that mRNA is a new idea.
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:32.180]   And it's an idea that was shrouded in some skepticism,
[01:48:32.180 --> 01:48:35.300]   as you said, by the scientific community.
[01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:39.380]   'Cause it's like, it's a cool new technology.
[01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:42.540]   Surprising that it works.
[01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:44.380]   What's your intuition?
[01:48:44.380 --> 01:48:46.420]   I think one nice way to approach this
[01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:51.420]   is try to play devil's advocate and say both sides.
[01:48:51.420 --> 01:48:56.160]   One side is why your intuition says
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:48:59.080]   that it's safe for humans.
[01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:02.380]   And what arguments can you see,
[01:49:02.380 --> 01:49:03.520]   if you could steal man,
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:06.680]   an argument why it's unsafe for humans.
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:09.340]   Or not unsafe for humans,
[01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:14.340]   but the hesitancy to take an mRNA vaccine is justified.
[01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:19.540]   - So, many people are afraid because it's new technology
[01:49:19.540 --> 01:49:22.260]   and they feel it hasn't been tested.
[01:49:22.260 --> 01:49:25.160]   I mean, in theory, what could go wrong?
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:29.020]   This is, the nice thing about mRNA
[01:49:29.020 --> 01:49:30.820]   is that it doesn't last forever.
[01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:35.020]   As opposed to DNA, which doesn't last forever,
[01:49:35.020 --> 01:49:37.140]   but it can last a lot longer.
[01:49:38.180 --> 01:49:40.540]   And it could even go into your DNA, right?
[01:49:40.540 --> 01:49:44.340]   So, mRNA has a shorter lifetime,
[01:49:44.340 --> 01:49:47.300]   maybe days after it's injected into your arm,
[01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:48.720]   then it's gone.
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:49.740]   So, that's a good thing,
[01:49:49.740 --> 01:49:52.040]   because it's not gonna be around forever.
[01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:54.220]   So, that would say, okay,
[01:49:54.220 --> 01:49:57.380]   so it's sticking around for your lifetime,
[01:49:57.380 --> 01:49:58.300]   it's not happening.
[01:49:58.300 --> 01:50:00.020]   But what else could happen?
[01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:03.100]   Well, let's see the protein that's made,
[01:50:03.100 --> 01:50:05.260]   could that be an issue?
[01:50:05.260 --> 01:50:08.980]   And again, proteins don't last forever,
[01:50:08.980 --> 01:50:12.500]   they have a finite longevity in the body.
[01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:17.500]   And this one also lasts, perhaps, at the best, a few weeks.
[01:50:17.500 --> 01:50:18.900]   - This is a protein that's made
[01:50:18.900 --> 01:50:22.060]   after the RNA gets into the cell.
[01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:25.060]   - Yeah, so the lipid nanoparticles taken up into a cell
[01:50:25.060 --> 01:50:27.860]   and the mRNA is translated and you get protein made.
[01:50:27.860 --> 01:50:30.300]   - And there's also a question, I'm sorry to interrupt,
[01:50:30.300 --> 01:50:32.300]   where in the body,
[01:50:32.300 --> 01:50:35.100]   so because it's not well targeted,
[01:50:35.100 --> 01:50:38.320]   or I don't know if it's supposed to be targeted,
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:39.900]   but it can go throughout the body,
[01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:41.480]   that's one of the concerns. - Right, so it's injected
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:45.120]   deep into your deltoid muscle, right here, shoulder.
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:49.780]   And the idea is not to put it in a blood vessel,
[01:50:49.780 --> 01:50:52.420]   otherwise it would then, for sure, circulate everywhere.
[01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:55.180]   So, they go deep in a blood vessel
[01:50:55.180 --> 01:50:57.180]   and it's locally injected.
[01:50:57.180 --> 01:51:00.380]   And they did, before this even went into people,
[01:51:00.380 --> 01:51:01.780]   they did experiments in mice,
[01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:05.020]   where they gave them 1,000 times higher concentrations
[01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:06.820]   than they would ever give to people.
[01:51:06.820 --> 01:51:09.320]   And then, when you do that, it can go everywhere, basically.
[01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:11.300]   You can find these nanoparticles
[01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:14.060]   in every tissue of the mouse.
[01:51:14.060 --> 01:51:17.180]   But that's at 1,000-fold higher concentration, right?
[01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:21.140]   So, I think at the levels that we're using in people,
[01:51:21.140 --> 01:51:22.500]   most of it's staying in the muscle,
[01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:26.060]   but sure, small amounts go elsewhere.
[01:51:26.060 --> 01:51:28.500]   - And could there be a lot of harm caused
[01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:30.460]   if it goes elsewhere?
[01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:33.140]   Like, let's say ridiculously high quantities.
[01:51:33.140 --> 01:51:35.500]   I'm trying to understand what is the damage
[01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:39.420]   that could be done from an RNA just floating about.
[01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:41.260]   - So, the RNA itself is not gonna be a problem.
[01:51:41.260 --> 01:51:42.940]   It's the protein that is-- - The protein.
[01:51:42.940 --> 01:51:43.940]   - Encoded in it, right?
[01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:48.800]   This is a viral RNA, which has no sequence in us.
[01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:50.540]   So, there's nothing that it could do.
[01:51:50.540 --> 01:51:52.840]   It's the protein that I would say,
[01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:56.160]   you could ask, what is that gonna do?
[01:51:56.160 --> 01:52:00.600]   And the one property we know about the spike
[01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:06.600]   is that it can cause fusion of cells.
[01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:09.280]   That's how the virus gets in in the beginning.
[01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:14.280]   The spike attaches to the cell by this ACE2 receptor,
[01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:19.200]   and it causes the virus and the cell to fuse.
[01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:21.080]   And that's how the RNA gets out of the particle.
[01:52:21.080 --> 01:52:24.120]   - But so, wait, I'm a bit confused.
[01:52:24.120 --> 01:52:28.600]   So, with this mRNA vaccine with lipids and the RNA,
[01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:30.720]   there's no spike, right?
[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:33.160]   - The mRNA codes for the spike.
[01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:35.880]   - Oh, the mRNA codes, so it creates the spike.
[01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:36.720]   - Creates a spike.
[01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:39.320]   - And so, that spike could cause fusion of cells.
[01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:43.060]   - Yes, except they modified the spike so it wouldn't.
[01:52:43.060 --> 01:52:45.120]   - Got it.
[01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:46.480]   - They made two amino acid changes in the spike
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:47.320]   so it would not fuse.
[01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:49.600]   - So, they understand enough which amino acids
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:51.080]   are responsible for the fusion.
[01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:51.920]   - That's right.
[01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:52.760]   - Interesting.
[01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:53.580]   This is so cool.
[01:52:53.580 --> 01:52:55.600]   - So, they modified, so now it's not gonna cause fusion,
[01:52:55.600 --> 01:52:57.200]   so that's not an issue.
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:59.680]   It's called the pre-fusion stabilized spike.
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:01.880]   - Cool.
[01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:04.200]   - So, the spike, when it binds ACE2,
[01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:06.840]   that top falls off and the spike,
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:09.320]   and the part of the spike that causes fusion is now exposed.
[01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:12.040]   And that doesn't happen in this mRNA vaccine.
[01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:14.940]   So, those are the things that could have happened,
[01:53:14.940 --> 01:53:18.380]   but I think they're ruled out by what we've just said.
[01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:21.240]   But there's no better test than putting it into people,
[01:53:21.240 --> 01:53:22.360]   right? - Right.
[01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:25.120]   - And doing phase one, phase two, and phase three,
[01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:26.840]   and increasing numbers of people,
[01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:28.920]   and asking, what do we see?
[01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:30.920]   Do we have any concerns?
[01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:35.320]   And so, now it's been in many millions of people,
[01:53:35.320 --> 01:53:40.320]   and we don't see, most of the effects you see in a vaccine,
[01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:43.240]   you see in the first couple of months.
[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:46.140]   Things like the myocarditis with some of the vaccines,
[01:53:46.140 --> 01:53:49.400]   the clotting issues with the AstraZeneca vaccine,
[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:53.540]   EMBRA, you see those relatively quickly.
[01:53:53.540 --> 01:53:58.320]   And we've seen small numbers of those occur,
[01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:01.480]   but other things we haven't seen,
[01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:04.840]   and you never say never, right?
[01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:07.800]   - Right, so, I mean, this is fascinating, right?
[01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:12.800]   It's like, I drink, I put Splenda in my coffee,
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:19.760]   and has supposedly no calories, but it tastes really good.
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:26.160]   And despite what, like, rumors, and blogs, and so on,
[01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:28.920]   I have not seen good medical evidence
[01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:31.400]   that it's harmful to you.
[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:34.360]   But it's like, it tastes too good.
[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:35.440]   So, I'm thinking, like,
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:37.760]   there's gotta be long-term consequences,
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:40.000]   but it's very difficult to understand
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.060]   what the long-term consequences are.
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:46.520]   And there's this kind of, like,
[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:49.520]   distant fear or anxiety about it.
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:53.000]   Like, this thing tastes too good, it's too good to be true.
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.680]   There's gotta be, there's no free launch in this world.
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:54:57.760]   This is the kind of feeling that people have
[01:54:57.760 --> 01:55:00.280]   about the long-term effects of the vaccine.
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:04.400]   That you mentioned that there's some intuition
[01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:08.960]   about near-term effects that you want to remove,
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:11.480]   like, the diffusion of cells, and all those kinds of things.
[01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:14.280]   But they think, okay, this travels to other cells
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:18.660]   in the body, it travels to neurons, or that kind of stuff.
[01:55:18.660 --> 01:55:20.680]   And then, what kind of effect does that have long-term
[01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:22.760]   that's yet to be discovered?
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:25.120]   What do you make, I mean, for this vaccine,
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:28.240]   but in general, in science, about making statements
[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:32.240]   about long-term negative effects?
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:34.480]   Is that something that weighs heavy on you?
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:36.440]   Is that something we can kind of escape
[01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:39.040]   through just large-scale experimentation
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:41.300]   with animals and humans?
[01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:42.960]   - Well, if you're really,
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:44.240]   if you're concerned about long-term,
[01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:46.760]   then you have to do a long-term experiment, right?
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:50.640]   And maybe you don't see something for 50, 60 years.
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:54.600]   So, if someone says to you, there are no long-term effects
[01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:57.480]   of the COVID vaccines, they can't say that
[01:55:57.480 --> 01:56:00.320]   because they haven't done the long experiment, right?
[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:02.880]   There's always the possibility, but you have to weigh it.
[01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:06.160]   It's always, there's no free lunch, right?
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:10.360]   There's always a risk-benefit calculation you have to make.
[01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:12.520]   - You can have the study, it goes for 50 years,
[01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:15.780]   and then decide, but I guess what you're doing is,
[01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:20.120]   just like we said, I forget with which one,
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:22.200]   with polio, with rabies, I forget,
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:27.200]   but you're weighing the side effects of the vaccine
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:31.080]   versus the effects of the virus.
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:34.540]   And both of them, you don't know long-term effects,
[01:56:34.540 --> 01:56:38.600]   but you're building up intuition as you study,
[01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:41.120]   which, what are the long-term effects?
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:45.560]   Like, there's a huge number of people
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:51.480]   that have, I don't want to say experts
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:52.400]   'cause I don't like the word,
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:54.440]   but people have studied it long enough
[01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:56.280]   to where they build up intuition.
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:56:57.760]   They don't know for sure.
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:00.560]   There's basic science being done, there's basic studies,
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:03.040]   but you start to build up an intuition
[01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:07.280]   of what might be a problem down the line
[01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:09.960]   and what is not, biologically speaking.
[01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:14.280]   And so, given that map, then considering the virus,
[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:16.800]   there seems to be a lot of evidence for COVID
[01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:21.800]   having negative effects on all aspects of the body,
[01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:23.360]   and not just even respiratory,
[01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:24.840]   which is kind of interesting.
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:27.080]   So, the cognitive stuff, that's terrifying.
[01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:28.960]   - All kinds of systems evolve, yes.
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:32.360]   - And then you look at the same thing with the vaccine,
[01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:34.680]   and there seems to be less of that.
[01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:36.320]   But of course, you don't know
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:39.240]   if it's some kind of dormant thing that's just going to--
[01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:40.360]   - You won't know.
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:42.560]   You have to make a judgment,
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:44.880]   and for a lot of people, they can't, right?
[01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:47.560]   'Cause they don't have the tools to make the judgment.
[01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:49.320]   I totally understand that.
[01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:54.320]   And we have let people down a few times in medicine, right?
[01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:59.080]   And I know two very specific examples.
[01:57:59.080 --> 01:58:01.880]   The first polio vaccine ever made,
[01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:04.680]   the Salk vaccine was released in 1955.
[01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:07.760]   Immediately, within months,
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:10.720]   few hundred cases of paralysis in kids who got it,
[01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:14.160]   because it was not properly inactivated.
[01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:16.560]   Now, you have to understand,
[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:19.000]   parents were dying for a polio vaccine,
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.320]   'cause kids were getting paralyzed every summer,
[01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:23.720]   30,000 kids a year.
[01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:26.080]   And so, they went and took it.
[01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:28.280]   They took the word of the medical establishment
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:30.840]   that it was safe, and it wasn't.
[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:32.000]   Big letdown.
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:33.200]   Never going to forget something.
[01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:35.120]   Although, I think a lot of people today
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:37.240]   aren't aware of that.
[01:58:37.240 --> 01:58:39.400]   I think that was a big problem that's everlasting.
[01:58:39.400 --> 01:58:43.360]   Then, the attenuated vaccine that we talked about,
[01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:46.880]   the infectious, causing polio.
[01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:51.080]   Yet, parents continued to bring their kids to be vaccinated,
[01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:53.200]   because they were said, "This is the right thing to do."
[01:58:53.200 --> 01:58:55.920]   And I have to say, I was involved in several lawsuits
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:59.360]   where parents of a kid who got paralyzed
[01:58:59.360 --> 01:59:02.760]   from the polio vaccine decided to sue the manufacturer
[01:59:02.760 --> 01:59:05.600]   and get some money for their kid.
[01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:08.000]   And so, they got mad.
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.880]   And I think you could not,
[01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:15.500]   the first issue could have been prevented,
[01:59:15.500 --> 01:59:19.480]   could have been prevented by inactivating it properly.
[01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:22.160]   I think the company just did the wrong thing.
[01:59:22.160 --> 01:59:24.240]   The second, we had evidence for,
[01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:26.920]   and we should probably have not used that vaccine any longer,
[01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:29.160]   but I think that destroys public confidence.
[01:59:29.160 --> 01:59:30.680]   - But those are-- - They're not long-term.
[01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:31.640]   - That's the minority of cases.
[01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:33.440]   - It's a minority, this is a very rare event, yeah.
[01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:35.640]   - But nevertheless, science as an institution
[01:59:35.640 --> 01:59:40.080]   didn't make corrections in that case.
[01:59:40.080 --> 01:59:40.920]   - No, they didn't.
[01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:45.520]   - And so, what do you make of that?
[01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:46.760]   I mean, it's very unfortunate
[01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:49.500]   that those few things can destroy trust.
[01:59:49.500 --> 01:59:51.920]   - But I don't think that lasts 'til today.
[01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:54.200]   I think today is a different era, right?
[01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:55.080]   - Yeah. - And most people
[01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:56.280]   don't know about those stories.
[01:59:56.280 --> 01:59:59.800]   I tell them to you because that's what could happen.
[01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:01.480]   I think it could happen today.
[02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:02.320]   - Yeah.
[02:00:02.320 --> 02:00:06.400]   - If you look at the history of the polio vaccine,
[02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:11.680]   the US Public Health Service wanted kids to be vaccinated.
[02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:14.360]   So they did things that probably weren't correct
[02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:16.640]   to get the vaccine back online, right?
[02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:19.080]   But they did it and they pushed it through.
[02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:23.760]   So the question is, what do we do today?
[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:27.400]   So I can look at, as we just said,
[02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:29.200]   I can look at what might happen
[02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:33.400]   and I can make reasonable decisions
[02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:35.160]   about the likelihood of them happening.
[02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:39.040]   And I can also say, I don't wanna get COVID of any kind
[02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:41.780]   because I've seen how nasty it can be.
[02:00:41.780 --> 02:00:44.120]   And I decide I'm taking the risk,
[02:00:44.120 --> 02:00:46.120]   whatever small of a long-term effect,
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:47.060]   I'm gonna take the risk.
[02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:50.040]   My family took the risk and many other people did.
[02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:50.940]   - Of a vaccine.
[02:00:50.940 --> 02:00:54.020]   - Of getting vaccinated 'cause I think it's very small.
[02:00:54.020 --> 02:00:56.960]   But I understand where people can't make that decision.
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:01:00.000]   And that begs the question, what would they need
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:01.280]   to make a decision?
[02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:05.420]   So if you're concerned about an effect in 40 years,
[02:01:05.420 --> 02:01:09.180]   we're not gonna know for 40 years.
[02:01:09.180 --> 02:01:11.040]   - Yeah, so I think if I were to speak,
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:13.440]   'cause I talked to, like I mentioned,
[02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:15.920]   offline to Joe Rogan and his podcast yesterday,
[02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:18.760]   I talked to him all the time about this.
[02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:23.760]   I think the concern is less about the long-term effects
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:28.760]   on paper, it's more about the,
[02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:36.640]   people like Anthony Fauci and people at the top
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:39.120]   are simply misrepresenting the data
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:42.960]   or are not accurately being transparent,
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:45.000]   not collecting the data properly,
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:48.280]   not reporting on the data properly, not being transparent,
[02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:50.360]   not representing the uncertainties,
[02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:55.360]   not openly saying they were wrong two months ago,
[02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:58.080]   like in a way that's not like dramatic,
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:00.960]   but revealing the basic process of science
[02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:03.720]   when you have to do your best under uncertainty,
[02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:06.040]   just also just being inauthentic.
[02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:09.500]   There's a sense, especially with like a younger generation
[02:02:09.500 --> 02:02:11.680]   now, there's a certain way on the internet,
[02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:14.280]   like the internet could smell bullshit
[02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:16.880]   much better than previous generations could.
[02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:21.720]   And so they see there's a kind of inauthenticity
[02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:26.440]   that comes with being, like representing authority.
[02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:30.440]   Like I am a scientist, I'm an expert, I have a PhD,
[02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:31.880]   I have four decades of work,
[02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:34.040]   therefore everyone should listen to me.
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:38.920]   And somehow that maps to this feeling of,
[02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:40.700]   well, what are they hiding?
[02:02:40.700 --> 02:02:43.080]   If they're speaking from authority like this,
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:45.680]   if everyone is in agreement like this,
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:48.160]   that means they all have emails between each other.
[02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:49.440]   They said, we're gonna tell this,
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:51.800]   this is the message we're gonna tell the public.
[02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:54.840]   Then what is the truth, the actual truth?
[02:02:54.840 --> 02:02:57.200]   Maybe there's a much bigger uncertainty.
[02:02:57.200 --> 02:02:59.960]   Maybe there's dead people in the basement
[02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:03.840]   that they're hiding from bad mRNA vaccine experiments.
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:06.720]   Maybe they're, and then the conspiracy theories
[02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:10.760]   start to grow naturally when there's this kind of mistrust
[02:03:10.760 --> 02:03:11.840]   of that.
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:13.540]   So it's less about kind of,
[02:03:14.020 --> 02:03:18.980]   like a deep concern about long-term effects.
[02:03:18.980 --> 02:03:22.540]   It's a concern about long-term effects
[02:03:22.540 --> 02:03:27.100]   if we find out that there's some secret stuff
[02:03:27.100 --> 02:03:28.400]   that we're not being told.
[02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:30.040]   It all lends on that.
[02:03:30.040 --> 02:03:31.540]   So what the heck, I mean,
[02:03:31.540 --> 02:03:33.380]   so I put the blame not on the data,
[02:03:33.380 --> 02:03:35.580]   but basically on the leaders
[02:03:35.580 --> 02:03:39.260]   and the communicators of the science at the top.
[02:03:39.260 --> 02:03:43.780]   - Well, to that, I would say all the data,
[02:03:43.780 --> 02:03:46.020]   as far as I know, are made public.
[02:03:46.020 --> 02:03:48.780]   So you can dive into it.
[02:03:48.780 --> 02:03:51.540]   And I know a lot of people ask me questions,
[02:03:51.540 --> 02:03:54.180]   and I just say, it's right here in the data.
[02:03:54.180 --> 02:03:55.820]   And I know a lot of people can't do that.
[02:03:55.820 --> 02:03:57.460]   They can't dive into it.
[02:03:57.460 --> 02:04:00.300]   But that's one solution for people who are able.
[02:04:00.300 --> 02:04:03.460]   Now, you could argue, well, maybe they've left data out.
[02:04:03.460 --> 02:04:05.500]   Well, then not even I can help
[02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:07.180]   because then they're hiding it from me too.
[02:04:07.180 --> 02:04:08.580]   And I think that's highly unlikely.
[02:04:08.580 --> 02:04:09.940]   I think for the most part,
[02:04:09.940 --> 02:04:11.860]   the FDA requires the release
[02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:14.260]   of all the clinical trial data, right?
[02:04:14.260 --> 02:04:17.600]   - So, okay, so this clinical trial data, that's one thing.
[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:20.180]   So that's the data that we should be focusing on, right?
[02:04:20.180 --> 02:04:24.180]   So there's a lot of different data sets here.
[02:04:24.180 --> 02:04:25.700]   - So there's preclinical data,
[02:04:25.700 --> 02:04:28.260]   which is everything that was done in the lab
[02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:30.900]   before this vaccine ever went into a human arm.
[02:04:30.900 --> 02:04:32.260]   It's all the cell culture work
[02:04:32.260 --> 02:04:35.900]   that we talked about a little, experiments in animals.
[02:04:35.900 --> 02:04:38.360]   All of that is publicly accessible.
[02:04:38.360 --> 02:04:39.980]   Most of it gets published.
[02:04:39.980 --> 02:04:42.580]   And then there's the initial drug filing,
[02:04:42.580 --> 02:04:45.100]   which is huge, the books of diet.
[02:04:45.100 --> 02:04:46.980]   You can get that and look at it, right?
[02:04:46.980 --> 02:04:49.980]   - This is me sort of asking sort of difficult questions here.
[02:04:49.980 --> 02:04:56.060]   So there's a lot of money to be made by makers of the vaccine.
[02:04:56.060 --> 02:04:59.820]   So for these companies,
[02:04:59.820 --> 02:05:02.500]   obviously there's a distrust of those folks too.
[02:05:02.500 --> 02:05:04.580]   They've done a lot of really good things in this world,
[02:05:04.580 --> 02:05:07.420]   but the incentives are such
[02:05:07.420 --> 02:05:09.980]   that you want to sweep stuff under the rug
[02:05:09.980 --> 02:05:14.980]   if you're not 100% pure in your ethics.
[02:05:14.980 --> 02:05:20.460]   And how hard is it for that data to be fabricated,
[02:05:20.460 --> 02:05:22.940]   manipulated?
[02:05:22.940 --> 02:05:26.140]   Like what's your intuition for the pre-trial stuff?
[02:05:26.140 --> 02:05:29.060]   - I think when you start fabricating,
[02:05:29.060 --> 02:05:31.420]   then you get inconsistencies,
[02:05:31.420 --> 02:05:34.420]   which are pretty easy to pick up.
[02:05:34.420 --> 02:05:36.420]   - When you're talking about some large scale
[02:05:36.420 --> 02:05:38.020]   things of this nature.
[02:05:38.020 --> 02:05:40.980]   - Because then you can look through the data very,
[02:05:40.980 --> 02:05:41.860]   you're gonna, I mean,
[02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:43.700]   we require looking very carefully,
[02:05:43.700 --> 02:05:46.900]   but you'll see inconsistencies from one trial to another.
[02:05:46.900 --> 02:05:50.780]   And that may ring a bell that something's been done.
[02:05:50.780 --> 02:05:51.620]   - Yeah.
[02:05:51.620 --> 02:05:55.180]   It's like the moon landing thing.
[02:05:55.180 --> 02:05:58.080]   Sometimes like going to the moon is easier than faking.
[02:05:58.080 --> 02:05:59.420]   (laughs)
[02:05:59.420 --> 02:06:00.260]   - Right.
[02:06:00.260 --> 02:06:03.420]   - In the sense it might be easier to do large scale trial
[02:06:03.420 --> 02:06:05.980]   and get an effective vaccine versus faking it.
[02:06:05.980 --> 02:06:08.420]   - But you know, when you brought up the for-profit issue,
[02:06:08.420 --> 02:06:11.500]   I think that has always been an issue.
[02:06:11.500 --> 02:06:15.860]   I've always felt that having your health depend
[02:06:15.860 --> 02:06:20.100]   on for-profit industry may not be the best solution.
[02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:23.260]   And I don't know how else to do it.
[02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:25.100]   People tell me I'm a dreamer,
[02:06:25.100 --> 02:06:28.340]   thinking that all medicines could be non-profit.
[02:06:28.340 --> 02:06:30.540]   But I also think that the world should have
[02:06:30.540 --> 02:06:32.820]   one health system that takes care of everyone, right?
[02:06:32.820 --> 02:06:34.780]   Because there are some countries that can't
[02:06:34.780 --> 02:06:37.620]   and other countries have an excess like us.
[02:06:37.620 --> 02:06:40.260]   So I wish we could do that.
[02:06:40.260 --> 02:06:44.220]   - Well, the argument is the speed of which the vaccines
[02:06:44.220 --> 02:06:47.500]   for COVID were produced would never happen
[02:06:47.500 --> 02:06:49.260]   in a non-profit system,
[02:06:49.260 --> 02:06:51.740]   would never happen in a non-capitalist system.
[02:06:51.740 --> 02:06:56.140]   - Oh, I could set up a vaccine production institute
[02:06:56.140 --> 02:06:58.940]   in the US that would get the vaccines done
[02:06:58.940 --> 02:07:00.940]   because you just need to put money into it.
[02:07:00.940 --> 02:07:03.620]   That's what made these vaccines get done, money.
[02:07:03.620 --> 02:07:05.180]   They poured billions of dollars
[02:07:05.180 --> 02:07:06.980]   and they got it done quickly.
[02:07:06.980 --> 02:07:09.760]   But if I set up a non-profit institutes of vaccines
[02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:12.580]   throughout the US, staffed with really talented people,
[02:07:12.580 --> 02:07:15.060]   pay them well, keep them motivated,
[02:07:15.060 --> 02:07:15.900]   you'll get your vaccines.
[02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:18.540]   - No, but that's the thing with capitalism
[02:07:18.540 --> 02:07:22.900]   is that the selection of who to hire,
[02:07:22.900 --> 02:07:24.980]   when you say good people,
[02:07:24.980 --> 02:07:28.180]   capitalism has a machine that fires people
[02:07:28.180 --> 02:07:30.980]   who are not good and selects people that are good.
[02:07:30.980 --> 02:07:32.740]   Coming from the Soviet Union,
[02:07:32.740 --> 02:07:36.500]   the dream of communism is similar to what you're saying,
[02:07:36.500 --> 02:07:37.380]   broadly defined.
[02:07:37.380 --> 02:07:40.060]   It certainly doesn't work in the broad,
[02:07:40.060 --> 02:07:44.860]   the question of whether it works in the healthcare space.
[02:07:44.860 --> 02:07:49.540]   There is some aspect to the machine of capitalism
[02:07:49.540 --> 02:07:53.380]   being the most effective way to select for good people
[02:07:53.380 --> 02:07:55.220]   to effectively produce the thing.
[02:07:55.220 --> 02:07:59.020]   But then of course, a lot of people would argue
[02:07:59.020 --> 02:08:01.180]   even the current healthcare is not,
[02:08:01.180 --> 02:08:03.660]   with regulations, there's some weird mix
[02:08:03.660 --> 02:08:07.100]   where there's a lot of opportunities for inefficiencies,
[02:08:07.100 --> 02:08:09.020]   there's a lot of opportunities for bureaucracy.
[02:08:09.020 --> 02:08:11.860]   So you have the worst of all worlds.
[02:08:11.860 --> 02:08:14.180]   - Can't there be some intermediate that works?
[02:08:14.180 --> 02:08:17.300]   I mean, the other issue that we haven't mentioned
[02:08:17.300 --> 02:08:19.260]   is that politics gets thrown into this
[02:08:19.260 --> 02:08:21.420]   and that really messes up
[02:08:21.420 --> 02:08:23.020]   and it should never be mixed with healthcare,
[02:08:23.020 --> 02:08:26.860]   but it is because a lot of funding comes from the government
[02:08:26.860 --> 02:08:29.340]   so that's another confounding factor.
[02:08:29.340 --> 02:08:33.700]   But I really think I could make a vaccine institute
[02:08:33.700 --> 02:08:36.660]   that if someone didn't do well, I'd fire them.
[02:08:36.660 --> 02:08:39.100]   No, you're not gonna stay if you can't do your job
[02:08:39.100 --> 02:08:41.380]   and do it well, you don't give them incentives,
[02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:44.700]   but it doesn't have to be the two extremes, I think.
[02:08:44.700 --> 02:08:47.740]   There has to be a solution that people don't have
[02:08:47.740 --> 02:08:51.580]   this mistrust for a company making huge profits
[02:08:51.580 --> 02:08:52.460]   off of a drug.
[02:08:52.460 --> 02:08:54.120]   But you know what, it's funny.
[02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:57.500]   It seems that vaccines and antivirals
[02:08:57.500 --> 02:08:59.540]   bear the brunt of this criticism,
[02:08:59.540 --> 02:09:01.340]   yet there are many other pharmaceuticals
[02:09:01.340 --> 02:09:04.340]   that people rely on of all sorts.
[02:09:04.340 --> 02:09:06.740]   They don't seem to question and have issues with those
[02:09:06.740 --> 02:09:09.180]   and they have far more side effects than vaccines.
[02:09:09.180 --> 02:09:11.900]   - It's very strange how we're picking that way,
[02:09:11.900 --> 02:09:16.900]   but I should also say that if you have one big
[02:09:16.900 --> 02:09:22.420]   vaccine institute, one of the other sets of
[02:09:24.120 --> 02:09:28.400]   vaccine conspiracies, I mean, I would say they're
[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:32.440]   a little farther out into the wild set of ideas,
[02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:37.200]   but that's one way to control the populace
[02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:40.300]   is by injecting substances into them.
[02:09:40.300 --> 02:09:44.840]   People, I mean, part of that, funny enough,
[02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:46.160]   it probably has to do with needles
[02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:48.960]   versus something you put in your mouth.
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:50.820]   But there's something about the government,
[02:09:50.820 --> 02:09:52.880]   especially when it's government mandated,
[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:54.900]   injection of a substance into you.
[02:09:54.900 --> 02:09:57.800]   I don't care what the science says,
[02:09:57.800 --> 02:10:00.960]   if it's 100% effective, 100% safe,
[02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:03.980]   there's a natural distrust of what,
[02:10:03.980 --> 02:10:07.660]   like even if this is effective and safe,
[02:10:07.660 --> 02:10:11.960]   giving the government power to do this,
[02:10:11.960 --> 02:10:15.080]   aren't they gonna start getting ideas down the line for,
[02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:15.920]   you know?
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:20.760]   - I think that they can barely govern.
[02:10:20.760 --> 02:10:22.240]   I don't think they're gonna do that,
[02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:26.000]   but you don't have to take, unless you're a federal employee,
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:27.920]   you don't have to take a COVID vaccine.
[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:31.160]   - Yeah, but that largely has to do,
[02:10:31.160 --> 02:10:36.520]   not largely, but there is an individualistic spirit
[02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:41.400]   to the American people.
[02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:44.400]   There's this, like, you're not gonna take my gun away
[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:47.300]   from me, you're not going, and I think that,
[02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:56.080]   that's something that makes America what it is.
[02:10:56.080 --> 02:10:57.500]   Just coming from the Soviet Union,
[02:10:57.500 --> 02:10:59.940]   there's a power to sort of resisting
[02:10:59.940 --> 02:11:01.720]   the overreach of government.
[02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:04.440]   That's quite interesting, 'cause I'm a believer,
[02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:08.040]   I hope that it's possible to have,
[02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:11.600]   to strive towards a government that works extremely well.
[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:14.840]   I think at its best, a government represents the people
[02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:17.880]   and functions in a similar way that you're mentioning.
[02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:20.160]   But that, like, pushback,
[02:11:20.160 --> 02:11:22.600]   even if it turns into conspiracy theory sometimes,
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:25.960]   I think is actually healthy in the long arc of history.
[02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:28.100]   It can be frustrating sometimes,
[02:11:28.100 --> 02:11:30.920]   but that mechanism of pushing back against power,
[02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:33.000]   against authority, can be healthy.
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:36.520]   - I agree, I think it's fine to question the vaccines.
[02:11:36.520 --> 02:11:39.040]   What I have issue with is that many people
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:43.180]   put out incorrect information,
[02:11:43.180 --> 02:11:45.360]   and I'm not sure what their motivations are,
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:47.020]   and it's very hard to fight that,
[02:11:47.020 --> 02:11:50.080]   because then it's my word versus theirs,
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:52.320]   and I'm happy to talk with people
[02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:54.320]   about any of their concerns,
[02:11:54.320 --> 02:11:56.720]   but if you start getting into the stuff
[02:11:56.720 --> 02:11:59.240]   that just isn't true, then we have a problem.
[02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:03.320]   - The thing I struggle with is conspiracy theories,
[02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:04.680]   whatever language you wanna use,
[02:12:04.680 --> 02:12:09.360]   but sort of ideas that challenge
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:12.100]   the mainstream quote-unquote narrative.
[02:12:12.100 --> 02:12:16.160]   Given our current social media and internet,
[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:17.840]   like, the way it operates,
[02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:20.320]   they can become viral much easier.
[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:22.720]   There's something much more compelling about them.
[02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:27.720]   Like, I have a secret about the way things really work.
[02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:30.200]   That becomes viral, and that's very frustrating,
[02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:32.440]   because then you're not having a conversation
[02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:33.420]   on level ground.
[02:12:33.420 --> 02:12:38.280]   When you're trying to present scientific ideas,
[02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:39.840]   and then there's conspiracy theories,
[02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:42.800]   the conspiracy theories become much viral much faster,
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:44.840]   and then you're not just having a discussion
[02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:45.840]   on level ground.
[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:49.160]   That's the frustrating part,
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:51.880]   that it's not an even discussion.
[02:12:51.880 --> 02:12:53.560]   - Can I just say one more thing?
[02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:54.840]   I mean, the internet is here to stay,
[02:12:54.840 --> 02:12:56.160]   so we're gonna have to figure out
[02:12:56.160 --> 02:12:57.280]   how to deal with it, right?
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:12:59.320]   But from my perspective,
[02:12:59.320 --> 02:13:03.020]   I was skeptical that any COVID vaccine
[02:13:03.020 --> 02:13:05.880]   would be ready within a year.
[02:13:05.880 --> 02:13:07.000]   That's amazing. - Me too.
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:12.000]   - Plus, the way I look at the mRNA vaccine as a scientist,
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:13.920]   it's gee whiz to me.
[02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:15.560]   It's amazing that it worked,
[02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:18.660]   and I think the data are great, so I want it.
[02:13:18.660 --> 02:13:21.240]   As a scientist, I want it.
[02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:23.880]   - One of the really sad things, again, with me too,
[02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:26.940]   as a scientist or as an admirer of science,
[02:13:26.940 --> 02:13:31.240]   I don't know if it's politics,
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:34.940]   but one of the sad things to me about the previous year
[02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:38.440]   is that I wasn't free to celebrate
[02:13:38.440 --> 02:13:42.360]   the incredible accomplishment of science with the vaccines.
[02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:44.160]   I was very skeptical that it's possible
[02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:47.660]   to develop a vaccine so quickly.
[02:13:47.660 --> 02:13:50.720]   So it's unfortunate that we can't celebrate
[02:13:50.720 --> 02:13:54.100]   how amazing humans are to come up with this vaccine.
[02:13:54.100 --> 02:13:57.280]   Now, this vaccine might have long-term effects.
[02:13:57.280 --> 02:13:59.400]   That doesn't mean this is not incredible.
[02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:04.300]   - Why couldn't you celebrate?
[02:14:04.300 --> 02:14:08.620]   - Because I would love to inspire the world
[02:14:08.620 --> 02:14:11.320]   with the amazing things science can do.
[02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:14.000]   And when you say something about the vaccines,
[02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:15.640]   they're not listening to the science.
[02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:17.440]   A lot of people are not listening to the science.
[02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:22.440]   What they hear is, oh, you're a Republican
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:25.240]   or you're a Democrat, and you're social signaling,
[02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:26.680]   doing some kind of signaling.
[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:28.520]   - No, I think that the vaccine you're talking about
[02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:30.640]   is injecting something into you,
[02:14:30.640 --> 02:14:33.720]   and maybe you're right that the rhetoric is like,
[02:14:33.720 --> 02:14:36.120]   you better take this or you're dumb.
[02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:38.480]   It's not the right approach.
[02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:40.200]   - I've seen, actually, it's kind of interesting.
[02:14:40.200 --> 02:14:42.960]   I've seen both sides kind of imply that.
[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:47.800]   So the people who are against the vaccine
[02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:52.360]   are dumb for not trusting science,
[02:14:52.360 --> 02:14:55.680]   and the people who are for the vaccine
[02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:59.360]   are called dumb for trusting science,
[02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:01.840]   the scientific institutions. - And nobody wins, yeah.
[02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:03.960]   - And they both kind of have a point.
[02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:08.360]   'Cause you can always, it's like,
[02:15:08.360 --> 02:15:10.280]   is the glass half full or half empty?
[02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:15.280]   Because you can always look at science
[02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:18.160]   from a perspective of certain individuals
[02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:23.160]   that don't represent, perhaps, not greatest leaders,
[02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:25.360]   almost like political leaders.
[02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:29.720]   There's a lot of, yesterday I went on a whole rant.
[02:15:29.720 --> 02:15:32.920]   Again, I said a lot of positive things
[02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:35.760]   about Anthony Fauci before I went on a rant against him.
[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:42.000]   'Cause ultimately, I think he failed as a leader,
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.280]   and I know it's very difficult to be a leader,
[02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:47.360]   but I still wanted to hold him accountable for that
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:50.440]   as a great communicator of science and as a great leader.
[02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:52.280]   - But what do you think he didn't do right?
[02:15:52.280 --> 02:15:53.120]   I'm curious.
[02:15:53.120 --> 02:16:00.040]   - So the core of the problem is the several characteristics
[02:16:00.040 --> 02:16:06.540]   of the way he was communicating to the public.
[02:16:06.540 --> 02:16:09.120]   So one is the general inauthenticity.
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:14.480]   Two is a thing that, it's very hard to put into words,
[02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:18.680]   but there's certain ways of speaking to people
[02:16:18.680 --> 02:16:21.720]   that sounds like you're hiding something from them.
[02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:23.960]   That sounds like you're full of shit.
[02:16:23.960 --> 02:16:25.480]   That's the authenticity piece.
[02:16:25.480 --> 02:16:30.480]   Like it sounds like you're not really speaking
[02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:34.480]   to the full truth of what you know,
[02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:38.420]   and that you did some shady shit in your past
[02:16:38.420 --> 02:16:40.860]   that you're trying to hide.
[02:16:40.860 --> 02:16:42.820]   So that's a way of communicating
[02:16:42.820 --> 02:16:45.020]   that I think the internet and people in general
[02:16:45.020 --> 02:16:46.740]   are becoming much better at detecting.
[02:16:46.740 --> 02:16:48.620]   - Yeah, it's like you said, they're good BS detectors.
[02:16:48.620 --> 02:16:50.260]   - Yeah, good BS detectors.
[02:16:50.260 --> 02:16:54.840]   But contributing to that is speaking from authority.
[02:16:54.840 --> 02:17:00.660]   Speaking with authority and confidence
[02:17:01.540 --> 02:17:04.480]   where neither is deserved.
[02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:09.480]   So first of all, nobody's an authority on this new virus.
[02:17:09.480 --> 02:17:12.200]   We're facing a deadly pandemic,
[02:17:12.200 --> 02:17:15.240]   and especially in the early stages,
[02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:17.560]   it was unclear how deadly it would be.
[02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:19.640]   It was unclear, probably still unclear,
[02:17:19.640 --> 02:17:22.120]   fully how it's transmitted.
[02:17:22.120 --> 02:17:24.400]   The full dynamics of the virus,
[02:17:24.400 --> 02:17:28.520]   the full understanding of which solutions work and not,
[02:17:28.520 --> 02:17:31.200]   how well masks of different kinds work,
[02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:34.260]   how easy or difficult it is to create tests,
[02:17:34.260 --> 02:17:36.480]   how many months or years it's gonna take
[02:17:36.480 --> 02:17:40.480]   to create a vaccine, how well in history
[02:17:40.480 --> 02:17:43.120]   or currently do quarantine methods
[02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:44.680]   or lockdown methods work.
[02:17:44.680 --> 02:17:48.080]   What are the different data mechanisms
[02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:50.720]   that are, data collection mechanisms
[02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:52.080]   that are being implemented?
[02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:55.680]   What are the clear plans that need to happen?
[02:17:55.680 --> 02:17:58.380]   What the epidemiology that's happening?
[02:17:58.380 --> 02:18:00.180]   What is the uncertainty around that?
[02:18:00.700 --> 02:18:05.700]   Then there's the geopolitical stuff with China.
[02:18:05.700 --> 02:18:10.820]   You know, like what, I personally believe
[02:18:10.820 --> 02:18:12.640]   there should have been much more openness
[02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:15.320]   about the origins of the virus,
[02:18:15.320 --> 02:18:17.140]   whether a leak from a lab or not.
[02:18:17.140 --> 02:18:21.200]   I think communicating that you're open to these ideas
[02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:25.380]   is actually the way to get people to trust you,
[02:18:25.380 --> 02:18:28.220]   that you're legitimately open to ideas
[02:18:28.220 --> 02:18:31.280]   that are very unpleasant, that go against the mainstream.
[02:18:31.280 --> 02:18:35.760]   Showing that openness is going to get people to trust you
[02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:40.760]   when you finally decrease the variance in your uncertainty,
[02:18:40.760 --> 02:18:42.840]   like decrease uncertainty and have,
[02:18:42.840 --> 02:18:44.420]   we still have a lot of uncertainty,
[02:18:44.420 --> 02:18:46.480]   but this is the best course of action.
[02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:49.680]   Vaccines still have a lot of uncertainty around them.
[02:18:49.680 --> 02:18:51.280]   mRNA is a new technology,
[02:18:51.280 --> 02:18:53.340]   but we have increasing amounts of data
[02:18:53.340 --> 02:18:54.980]   and here's the data sources
[02:18:54.980 --> 02:18:58.760]   and like laying them out in a very clear way
[02:18:58.760 --> 02:19:01.300]   of this is the best course of action that we have now.
[02:19:01.300 --> 02:19:04.100]   We don't know if it's the perfect course of action,
[02:19:04.100 --> 02:19:06.500]   but it's by far the best course of action.
[02:19:06.500 --> 02:19:09.480]   And that would come from a leader
[02:19:09.480 --> 02:19:13.100]   that has earned the capital of trust from people.
[02:19:13.100 --> 02:19:15.920]   - I mean, I think in recent history,
[02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:19.780]   the worst pandemic is 1918 flu, right?
[02:19:19.780 --> 02:19:22.580]   But that's mainly 'cause we didn't know what to do.
[02:19:22.580 --> 02:19:24.460]   We didn't have many tools at our disposal.
[02:19:24.460 --> 02:19:26.500]   - And that was tied up with World War I.
[02:19:26.500 --> 02:19:27.980]   - That's right, that's right.
[02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:30.380]   - So the leadership there, I mean--
[02:19:30.380 --> 02:19:32.900]   - But I don't know what is a lot of deaths, right?
[02:19:32.900 --> 02:19:35.500]   And any one person is someone's family,
[02:19:35.500 --> 02:19:37.500]   so to them it's a lot, right?
[02:19:37.500 --> 02:19:41.820]   - But that logic, we don't apply that logic generally
[02:19:41.820 --> 02:19:43.480]   because there's a lot of people suffering
[02:19:43.480 --> 02:19:44.940]   and dying throughout the world
[02:19:44.940 --> 02:19:47.860]   and we turn the other way all the time.
[02:19:47.860 --> 02:19:49.220]   And that's the story of history.
[02:19:49.220 --> 02:19:51.660]   So saying you all of a sudden--
[02:19:51.660 --> 02:19:53.180]   - What bothers me though, I mean,
[02:19:53.180 --> 02:19:56.300]   personally, I don't like anyone dying anywhere,
[02:19:56.300 --> 02:20:00.220]   but especially considering what technology
[02:20:00.220 --> 02:20:02.460]   we're able to muster, yet we still kill each other.
[02:20:02.460 --> 02:20:04.620]   It's just dichotomy to me.
[02:20:04.620 --> 02:20:07.800]   - Yeah, but I mean, this is the, what is it, Paul Farmer?
[02:20:07.800 --> 02:20:10.260]   There's these great stories.
[02:20:10.260 --> 02:20:15.260]   I mean, that's the burden of being in healthcare,
[02:20:15.260 --> 02:20:22.500]   being a doctor, is you have to help.
[02:20:23.100 --> 02:20:25.300]   You can't help but help a person in front of you
[02:20:25.300 --> 02:20:26.140]   who's hurting.
[02:20:26.140 --> 02:20:26.980]   - Sure, sure.
[02:20:26.980 --> 02:20:30.100]   - But you also are burdened by the knowledge
[02:20:30.100 --> 02:20:33.260]   that you helping them, you spending money and effort
[02:20:33.260 --> 02:20:36.900]   and time on them means you're not going to help others.
[02:20:36.900 --> 02:20:38.540]   And you cannot possibly allocate
[02:20:38.540 --> 02:20:40.240]   that amount of time to everybody.
[02:20:40.240 --> 02:20:42.220]   So you're choosing which person lives
[02:20:42.220 --> 02:20:43.700]   and which person dies.
[02:20:43.700 --> 02:20:44.540]   - Sure.
[02:20:44.540 --> 02:20:46.460]   - And you're doing so, the reason you're helping
[02:20:46.460 --> 02:20:47.740]   the person in front of you
[02:20:47.740 --> 02:20:49.500]   is because they're in front of you.
[02:20:49.500 --> 02:20:53.260]   And so the reason right now we care a lot about COVID
[02:20:53.260 --> 02:20:56.620]   is because the eye of the world has turned to COVID,
[02:20:56.620 --> 02:20:59.280]   but we're not seeing all the other atrocities
[02:20:59.280 --> 02:21:00.460]   going on in the world.
[02:21:00.460 --> 02:21:02.780]   They're not necessarily related to deaths,
[02:21:02.780 --> 02:21:05.260]   they're related to suffering, human suffering,
[02:21:05.260 --> 02:21:07.380]   which you could argue is worse than death,
[02:21:07.380 --> 02:21:08.660]   prolonged suffering.
[02:21:08.660 --> 02:21:09.500]   - Of course.
[02:21:09.500 --> 02:21:11.620]   - So there's all of these questions.
[02:21:11.620 --> 02:21:15.740]   And the fundamental question here is,
[02:21:15.740 --> 02:21:19.380]   are we overreacting to COVID in our policies?
[02:21:19.380 --> 02:21:23.740]   So this is the, when we turn our eye
[02:21:23.740 --> 02:21:26.940]   and care about this particular thing and not other things,
[02:21:26.940 --> 02:21:29.220]   are we dismissing the pain that business owners
[02:21:29.220 --> 02:21:31.700]   who've lost their businesses are going to feel?
[02:21:31.700 --> 02:21:35.740]   And then the long, talking about long COVID,
[02:21:35.740 --> 02:21:38.580]   the long-term effects, economic effects
[02:21:38.580 --> 02:21:40.900]   on the millions of people that will suffer,
[02:21:40.900 --> 02:21:44.900]   that suffer financially, but also suffer from their dreams
[02:21:44.900 --> 02:21:46.740]   being completely collapsed.
[02:21:46.740 --> 02:21:50.740]   So a lot of people seek, gain meaning from work.
[02:21:50.740 --> 02:21:52.820]   And if you take away that work,
[02:21:52.820 --> 02:21:55.700]   there's anger that can be born, there's pain.
[02:21:55.700 --> 02:21:57.180]   And so what does that lead to?
[02:21:57.180 --> 02:22:01.860]   That can lead to the rising up of charismatic leaders
[02:22:01.860 --> 02:22:05.100]   that channel that anger towards destructive things
[02:22:05.100 --> 02:22:06.700]   that's been done throughout history.
[02:22:06.700 --> 02:22:10.220]   So you have to balance that with the policies
[02:22:10.220 --> 02:22:12.060]   that you have in COVID.
[02:22:12.060 --> 02:22:16.220]   And then, I mean, very much my main opposition
[02:22:16.220 --> 02:22:20.700]   to Fauci is not on the details, but the final result,
[02:22:20.700 --> 02:22:25.020]   which is, I just observe that there's a significant decrease
[02:22:25.020 --> 02:22:30.020]   in trust in science as a, not the institution,
[02:22:30.020 --> 02:22:32.700]   but the various sort of mechanisms of science.
[02:22:32.700 --> 02:22:35.860]   I think science is both beautiful and powerful.
[02:22:35.860 --> 02:22:38.220]   And the reason why we have so many amazing things
[02:22:38.220 --> 02:22:42.580]   and such a high quality of life and distrust in that,
[02:22:42.580 --> 02:22:44.540]   that the thing we need now to get out
[02:22:44.540 --> 02:22:46.580]   of all the troubles we're in,
[02:22:46.580 --> 02:22:48.580]   continue getting out of the troubles we're in,
[02:22:48.580 --> 02:22:51.860]   is science, the scientific process, broadly defined,
[02:22:51.860 --> 02:22:54.380]   like innovation, technological innovation,
[02:22:54.380 --> 02:22:56.460]   scientific innovation, all of that.
[02:22:56.460 --> 02:23:02.380]   Distrust in that is totally the wrong thing we need.
[02:23:02.380 --> 02:23:07.460]   And so anybody who causes a distrust in science, to me,
[02:23:07.460 --> 02:23:14.220]   carries the responsibility of that.
[02:23:14.220 --> 02:23:17.060]   And should be, because of the responsibility,
[02:23:17.060 --> 02:23:21.460]   I mean, should be fired, should be, or at least openly
[02:23:21.460 --> 02:23:24.380]   have to carry the burden of that,
[02:23:24.380 --> 02:23:27.420]   of having caused that kind of level of mistrust.
[02:23:27.420 --> 02:23:30.460]   Now, it's maybe unfair to place it on any one individual,
[02:23:30.460 --> 02:23:33.940]   but you have to, I think in your pockets,
[02:23:33.940 --> 02:23:37.180]   the buck stops at the top, like the leaders have to-
[02:23:37.180 --> 02:23:40.060]   - Sure, no, no, there's a clear leader here, yes,
[02:23:40.060 --> 02:23:40.980]   absolutely.
[02:23:40.980 --> 02:23:43.700]   - So even if it's not directly his fault,
[02:23:43.700 --> 02:23:48.340]   you know, he has to carry the price of that.
[02:23:48.340 --> 02:23:50.900]   - Do you think we should, at this point, say,
[02:23:50.900 --> 02:23:54.340]   okay, we have vaccines, you can decide
[02:23:54.340 --> 02:23:57.420]   whether you take 'em or not, let's move forward?
[02:23:57.420 --> 02:23:59.180]   - Maybe you can help me understand this,
[02:23:59.180 --> 02:24:04.180]   because it seems like, why is that not the right solution?
[02:24:04.180 --> 02:24:07.260]   Completely open society, the vaccines,
[02:24:07.260 --> 02:24:11.180]   at least in the United States, as I understand,
[02:24:11.180 --> 02:24:16.180]   are widely available, so this is the American way,
[02:24:16.180 --> 02:24:18.380]   you have the decision to make.
[02:24:18.380 --> 02:24:23.300]   If you have conditions that make you worried to get COVID
[02:24:23.300 --> 02:24:26.200]   and go to the hospital, then you should get vaccinated,
[02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:29.500]   because here's the data that shows that it's much less
[02:24:29.500 --> 02:24:34.280]   likely for you to die, right, if you get vaccinated.
[02:24:34.280 --> 02:24:36.620]   If you don't want to get vaccinated because you're worried
[02:24:36.620 --> 02:24:40.360]   about long-term effects of vaccine, then you don't have to,
[02:24:40.360 --> 02:24:44.460]   but then you suffer the consequences of that, and that's it.
[02:24:44.460 --> 02:24:47.280]   - So here's what I think is driving,
[02:24:47.280 --> 02:24:50.260]   I think it's all about kids, right,
[02:24:50.260 --> 02:24:51.980]   because they're gonna go back to school in the fall,
[02:24:51.980 --> 02:24:54.000]   and many of them can't be vaccinated, right,
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:59.000]   so if they get infected, they do have less frequency
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.260]   of disease, but it's not zero.
[02:25:01.260 --> 02:25:04.700]   They do get sick, and they can have long-term consequences,
[02:25:04.700 --> 02:25:09.340]   and at that age, it would be a shame, right,
[02:25:09.340 --> 02:25:10.640]   and it's not even their choice.
[02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:13.480]   They can't decide to get vaccinated or not,
[02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:15.220]   because they can't have access to it,
[02:25:15.220 --> 02:25:19.380]   so I think that's what would drive my efforts
[02:25:19.380 --> 02:25:22.540]   to try and get more people, at least in schools, vaccinated,
[02:25:22.540 --> 02:25:23.780]   but I might be wrong.
[02:25:23.780 --> 02:25:24.940]   It may not be that.
[02:25:24.940 --> 02:25:26.540]   - Can you kind of dig into that a little bit?
[02:25:26.540 --> 02:25:27.380]   So there's,
[02:25:27.380 --> 02:25:33.260]   so you're saying that there should be an effort
[02:25:33.260 --> 02:25:37.620]   for increased vaccinations of kids going to school,
[02:25:37.620 --> 02:25:39.860]   just not for societal benefit,
[02:25:39.860 --> 02:25:42.220]   but for the benefit of each individual kid, right?
[02:25:42.220 --> 02:25:46.100]   - So right now, kids under 12, right,
[02:25:46.100 --> 02:25:47.580]   are not yet vaccinated.
[02:25:47.580 --> 02:25:48.500]   Is that correct?
[02:25:48.500 --> 02:25:49.900]   - Yeah, I think so.
[02:25:49.900 --> 02:25:53.420]   - And it's not gonna be in time for school opening,
[02:25:53.420 --> 02:25:54.780]   that they get vaccinated,
[02:25:54.780 --> 02:25:59.700]   and then, I suppose the teachers
[02:25:59.700 --> 02:26:01.380]   are all gonna be vaccinated.
[02:26:01.380 --> 02:26:02.800]   Makes sense for them to do that,
[02:26:02.800 --> 02:26:05.360]   but I'm just worried the kids are gonna be transmitting it
[02:26:05.360 --> 02:26:07.480]   amongst them, and many states don't allow
[02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:08.920]   a mask mandate in school,
[02:26:08.920 --> 02:26:13.920]   so I think that's what's driving the larger narrative
[02:26:13.920 --> 02:26:16.760]   in the US to protect kids.
[02:26:16.760 --> 02:26:19.840]   It's kind of what I hear from Daniel Griffin,
[02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:21.680]   'cause increasing numbers of kids
[02:26:21.680 --> 02:26:24.040]   are being admitted to hospitals now,
[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:28.320]   because they're becoming the major unvaccinated population.
[02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:29.680]   They're hanging out over the summer,
[02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:32.320]   and that's just gonna get worse in the fall,
[02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:35.440]   and so you could have a lot of kids with long COVID
[02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:38.360]   and disabled their entire lives, right?
[02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:40.320]   - And of course, hearing from people
[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:42.160]   who are vaccine-hesitant,
[02:26:42.160 --> 02:26:44.900]   I hear exactly the kids' statement,
[02:26:44.900 --> 02:26:49.900]   but they're saying they don't want the long vaccine,
[02:26:49.900 --> 02:26:53.280]   the long-term effects of the vaccine to affect the kids.
[02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:56.080]   That's of this new vaccine.
[02:26:56.080 --> 02:26:58.700]   - Which I would say is, as I said before,
[02:26:58.700 --> 02:27:00.720]   you can't say never,
[02:27:00.720 --> 02:27:05.720]   but we do know that long COVID exists.
[02:27:05.720 --> 02:27:06.920]   We don't know for how long,
[02:27:06.920 --> 02:27:09.360]   'cause we've only looked out six or eight months.
[02:27:09.360 --> 02:27:12.480]   We know that exists, and the frequency is increasing.
[02:27:12.480 --> 02:27:14.320]   It certainly exists in young kids,
[02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:16.640]   and we have no idea about long vaccine effects,
[02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:20.700]   so I think they have to make their decision based on that.
[02:27:20.700 --> 02:27:24.480]   - But, yeah.
[02:27:24.480 --> 02:27:28.240]   - But your question is, why don't we just open up society,
[02:27:28.240 --> 02:27:29.560]   say, "Here, we have these vaccines.
[02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:30.840]   "If you want to protect yourself."
[02:27:30.840 --> 02:27:32.200]   I think it's mainly the school
[02:27:32.200 --> 02:27:34.380]   that's driving the whole narrative.
[02:27:34.380 --> 02:27:35.360]   That's my opinion.
[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:37.800]   - In which direction, not to open up, or?
[02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:40.580]   - No, to open up, but to try and get,
[02:27:40.580 --> 02:27:42.340]   you know, their efforts at the federal level
[02:27:42.340 --> 02:27:44.000]   to get people vaccinated, right?
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000]   - But see, how high are the risks for kids?
[02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.140]   I mean, my understanding was it's,
[02:27:48.140 --> 02:27:50.580]   I mean, yes, it's non-zero, but it's very low.
[02:27:50.580 --> 02:27:53.680]   - But what is the numbers?
[02:27:53.680 --> 02:27:58.400]   Now, 70,000 hospitalizations so far in kids
[02:27:58.400 --> 02:28:01.120]   as of last week, so yes, it's low,
[02:28:01.120 --> 02:28:05.480]   but polio was low.
[02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:08.840]   Polio was 20, 30,000 kids a year paralyzed,
[02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:11.560]   and many people have actually argued
[02:28:11.560 --> 02:28:13.920]   that that vaccine wasn't necessary, you know?
[02:28:13.920 --> 02:28:17.240]   That it wasn't a substantial enough health problem.
[02:28:17.240 --> 02:28:19.040]   - But paralyzed is different than hospitalized,
[02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:20.920]   so what does hospitalized mean?
[02:28:20.920 --> 02:28:21.760]   - Long COVID.
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:23.080]   - But this is the long COVID question.
[02:28:23.080 --> 02:28:24.560]   I mean, this is the open question.
[02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:26.440]   It was long COVID in kids.
[02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:27.280]   What is that?
[02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:30.680]   Well, a lot of the same issues,
[02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:34.200]   cognitive issues, motor issues,
[02:28:34.200 --> 02:28:37.720]   respiratory, GI dysfunction.
[02:28:37.720 --> 02:28:39.280]   How long?
[02:28:39.280 --> 02:28:40.120]   We don't know.
[02:28:40.120 --> 02:28:43.240]   I mean, it could end in a year.
[02:28:43.240 --> 02:28:46.080]   As you know, there are other post-acute
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:48.200]   infectious sequelae that we know about,
[02:28:48.200 --> 02:28:51.040]   you know, chronic fatigue, ME/CFS.
[02:28:51.040 --> 02:28:53.240]   It's thought to be a post-infectious sequelae,
[02:28:53.240 --> 02:28:55.160]   which has gone for many decades now
[02:28:55.160 --> 02:28:56.560]   in many millions of people.
[02:28:56.560 --> 02:28:58.720]   This could be another one of those.
[02:28:58.720 --> 02:29:02.720]   So I'm just saying it might be worth erring on the side
[02:29:02.720 --> 02:29:05.880]   of not letting the kids get infected.
[02:29:05.880 --> 02:29:09.880]   - Yeah, well, I'm trying to keep an open mind here,
[02:29:09.880 --> 02:29:12.080]   and I appreciate you doing the same.
[02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:17.080]   Of course, I lean on definitely not requiring people
[02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:21.520]   to get vaccinated, but I do think getting vaccinated
[02:29:21.520 --> 02:29:24.840]   is just the wiser choice,
[02:29:24.840 --> 02:29:28.440]   looking at all the different trajectories before us.
[02:29:28.440 --> 02:29:29.920]   Getting vaccinated is,
[02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:33.200]   seems like from the data,
[02:29:33.200 --> 02:29:35.520]   it seems like the obvious choice, frankly.
[02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:38.120]   But I'm also trying to keep an open mind.
[02:29:38.120 --> 02:29:40.120]   There's some things in the past that seemed obvious
[02:29:40.120 --> 02:29:42.080]   would turn out to be completely wrong.
[02:29:42.080 --> 02:29:44.840]   So I'm trying to keep an open mind here.
[02:29:44.840 --> 02:29:48.080]   So for example, one of the things,
[02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:50.200]   I'd love to get your thoughts on this,
[02:29:50.200 --> 02:29:52.960]   is antiviral ideas.
[02:29:52.960 --> 02:29:55.000]   So ideas outside of the vaccine.
[02:29:55.000 --> 02:30:00.400]   So ivermectin, something that Brett Weinstein
[02:30:00.400 --> 02:30:02.120]   and a few others have been talking about.
[02:30:02.120 --> 02:30:03.200]   There's been a few studies.
[02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:07.160]   Some of them have been shown not to be very good studies,
[02:30:07.160 --> 02:30:11.480]   but nevertheless, there seems to be some promise.
[02:30:11.480 --> 02:30:16.480]   And I wanted to talk to Brett about this particular topic
[02:30:16.480 --> 02:30:17.400]   for two reasons.
[02:30:17.400 --> 02:30:19.980]   One, I was really bothered by censorship of this.
[02:30:19.980 --> 02:30:22.080]   That's a whole nother topic.
[02:30:22.080 --> 02:30:25.960]   I just, I'm bothered by censorship.
[02:30:25.960 --> 02:30:27.520]   There's a gray area, of course,
[02:30:27.520 --> 02:30:32.200]   but it just feels like that should not have been censored
[02:30:32.200 --> 02:30:34.920]   from YouTube, like discussions of ivermectin.
[02:30:34.920 --> 02:30:36.760]   We can set that aside.
[02:30:36.760 --> 02:30:39.760]   The other thing, I was bothered by the lack
[02:30:39.760 --> 02:30:44.760]   of open-mindedness on exploring things like ivermectin
[02:30:44.760 --> 02:30:48.040]   in the early days, especially when,
[02:30:48.040 --> 02:30:51.680]   at least I thought the vaccine would take a long time.
[02:30:51.680 --> 02:30:53.160]   I mean, it's not just ivermectin.
[02:30:53.160 --> 02:30:57.500]   It's really seriously, at a large scale,
[02:30:57.500 --> 02:31:01.360]   rigorously exploring the effectiveness of masks.
[02:31:01.360 --> 02:31:03.700]   And the big one for me is testing.
[02:31:03.700 --> 02:31:07.040]   Like the fact that that wasn't explored aggressively
[02:31:07.040 --> 02:31:11.500]   to lead to mass manufacturing, like May 2020, is absurd.
[02:31:11.500 --> 02:31:14.800]   Anyway, so I was bothered by these solutions
[02:31:14.800 --> 02:31:16.280]   not being explored and not,
[02:31:16.280 --> 02:31:19.400]   by now having really good ivermectin studies.
[02:31:19.400 --> 02:31:20.960]   - So can I talk about ivermectin?
[02:31:20.960 --> 02:31:21.800]   - Yeah, I would love that, yeah.
[02:31:21.800 --> 02:31:23.040]   - Sure, so full disclosure,
[02:31:23.040 --> 02:31:26.620]   my wife worked on ivermectin at Merck for 20 years.
[02:31:26.620 --> 02:31:27.680]   (Lex laughing)
[02:31:27.680 --> 02:31:30.920]   Okay, so they just want people to know,
[02:31:30.920 --> 02:31:34.560]   but I didn't, don't talk to her all the time about it.
[02:31:34.560 --> 02:31:37.240]   And anyway, she hasn't been at Merck for a long time.
[02:31:37.240 --> 02:31:39.880]   As you know, ivermectin is a very safe drug
[02:31:39.880 --> 02:31:43.600]   used to treat certain parasitic infections, right?
[02:31:43.600 --> 02:31:47.320]   And it is approved, it's amazing.
[02:31:47.320 --> 02:31:48.680]   You can take one dose a year
[02:31:48.680 --> 02:31:51.680]   and be protected against river blindness in Africa,
[02:31:51.680 --> 02:31:52.720]   in certain parts of Africa.
[02:31:52.720 --> 02:31:54.640]   It's remarkably effective.
[02:31:54.640 --> 02:31:57.800]   And so it's quite a safe drug
[02:31:57.800 --> 02:32:01.240]   at the doses that are approved.
[02:32:01.240 --> 02:32:04.480]   Now, early last year, a study was done,
[02:32:04.480 --> 02:32:07.360]   I believe in Australia, which showed in cells in the lab,
[02:32:07.360 --> 02:32:11.120]   if you infect with SARS-CoV-2 and then put ivermectin in,
[02:32:11.120 --> 02:32:13.840]   it would inhibit the virus production substantially.
[02:32:13.840 --> 02:32:16.020]   It was quite clear, right?
[02:32:16.020 --> 02:32:19.640]   But the concentrations they were using were rather high
[02:32:19.640 --> 02:32:24.640]   and could not be achieved by the approved dosing.
[02:32:24.640 --> 02:32:27.840]   So you would need to do a dosing study
[02:32:27.840 --> 02:32:29.000]   to make sure it's safe.
[02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000]   And the reason is that ivermectin
[02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:32.640]   binds to receptors in your brain,
[02:32:32.640 --> 02:32:34.680]   and it can have high doses.
[02:32:34.680 --> 02:32:37.520]   Some people take high doses inappropriately,
[02:32:37.520 --> 02:32:39.680]   and they have neurological consequences.
[02:32:39.680 --> 02:32:42.680]   So if you needed 10 times more ivermectin,
[02:32:42.680 --> 02:32:44.920]   you'd have to make sure it would be safe.
[02:32:44.920 --> 02:32:46.480]   - So this is a question of safety too.
[02:32:46.480 --> 02:32:47.320]   - Right.
[02:32:47.320 --> 02:32:51.320]   So I think it has always been the case
[02:32:51.320 --> 02:32:54.580]   that it should have been properly studied, but it wasn't.
[02:32:54.580 --> 02:32:56.100]   There were lots of trials here and there,
[02:32:56.100 --> 02:32:58.680]   lots of improperly controlled trials
[02:32:58.680 --> 02:33:00.920]   where someone would just treat some patients and say,
[02:33:00.920 --> 02:33:03.760]   "Hey, they all did fine, but have no control arm."
[02:33:03.760 --> 02:33:05.240]   And there were some controlled trials,
[02:33:05.240 --> 02:33:06.480]   but they were very small.
[02:33:06.480 --> 02:33:11.480]   So right now, a 4,000 person trial is enrolling
[02:33:12.640 --> 02:33:16.640]   to test in a randomly controlled trial setting,
[02:33:16.640 --> 02:33:17.800]   whether it works or not.
[02:33:17.800 --> 02:33:20.300]   There's still plenty of cases that you can do that.
[02:33:20.300 --> 02:33:23.040]   So you can ask whether there are any side effects.
[02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:24.960]   I think that's completely fine.
[02:33:24.960 --> 02:33:28.480]   And if it says it works, then we should use it.
[02:33:28.480 --> 02:33:31.320]   In the meantime, I always tell people,
[02:33:31.320 --> 02:33:33.800]   if you wanna use ivermectin, you can do it off-label.
[02:33:33.800 --> 02:33:35.640]   It's FDA approved.
[02:33:35.640 --> 02:33:36.660]   And if your physician says,
[02:33:36.660 --> 02:33:38.720]   "I'm gonna give you this off-label,"
[02:33:38.720 --> 02:33:41.520]   I don't have any objection,
[02:33:41.520 --> 02:33:43.800]   but I don't know if it's gonna work.
[02:33:43.800 --> 02:33:48.800]   Now, a friend of ours last week in New Jersey got COVID.
[02:33:48.800 --> 02:33:50.560]   He went to his local hospital
[02:33:50.560 --> 02:33:55.560]   and their regimen was remdesivir, dexamethasone, ivermectin.
[02:33:55.560 --> 02:33:59.180]   It's written, that's what they do for every COVID patient.
[02:33:59.180 --> 02:34:01.200]   They just give it to them automatically.
[02:34:01.200 --> 02:34:04.360]   And so he recovered.
[02:34:04.360 --> 02:34:08.360]   So who's to say it was or was not ivermectin, right?
[02:34:08.360 --> 02:34:12.840]   So I don't have any strong ideological opposition.
[02:34:12.840 --> 02:34:14.640]   I just think it should be tested
[02:34:14.640 --> 02:34:16.720]   for what you wanna use it for.
[02:34:16.720 --> 02:34:19.280]   And that's being done, and I think that's fine.
[02:34:19.280 --> 02:34:23.520]   - Is it strange to you that ivermectin
[02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:25.640]   or other things like it weren't tested
[02:34:25.640 --> 02:34:27.680]   aggressively in the beginning?
[02:34:27.680 --> 02:34:32.680]   From a broad scientific community aspect,
[02:34:32.680 --> 02:34:36.000]   I can be a little bit conspiratorial,
[02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:39.080]   and this is what people talk about with ivermectin,
[02:34:39.080 --> 02:34:41.360]   is with the vaccines, there's quite a lot of money
[02:34:41.360 --> 02:34:42.680]   to be made.
[02:34:42.680 --> 02:34:45.640]   With ivermectin, there's not as much money to be made.
[02:34:45.640 --> 02:34:48.400]   Is that too conspiratorial?
[02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:51.520]   Like, why didn't we try more solutions in the beginning?
[02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:55.560]   - Well, all the money was put into vaccines, right?
[02:34:55.560 --> 02:34:57.360]   Very little was put into antivirals.
[02:34:57.360 --> 02:34:59.520]   Because the decision was made at a very high level,
[02:34:59.520 --> 02:35:01.600]   probably involving Dr. Fauci.
[02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:04.720]   We're gonna put 24 billion into vaccines, right?
[02:35:04.720 --> 02:35:06.280]   - Yeah.
[02:35:06.280 --> 02:35:08.080]   - And I think part of the reasoning is
[02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:10.160]   they give you years worth of protection,
[02:35:10.160 --> 02:35:11.440]   whereas an antiviral works,
[02:35:11.440 --> 02:35:13.280]   and you have to keep dosing and so forth.
[02:35:13.280 --> 02:35:16.040]   But ivermectin is not trivial in this.
[02:35:16.040 --> 02:35:18.640]   I agree, it should have been tested early on,
[02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:21.880]   but we had a really bad experience with hydroxychloroquine,
[02:35:21.880 --> 02:35:23.900]   which we can talk about too.
[02:35:23.900 --> 02:35:28.780]   Ivermectin is very hard to synthesize.
[02:35:28.780 --> 02:35:31.640]   Most drugs you synthesize chemically.
[02:35:31.640 --> 02:35:34.720]   You devise a formulation and a synthesis,
[02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:36.680]   and they do it, they scale it up, and it's fine.
[02:35:36.680 --> 02:35:38.360]   Ivermectin's really hard.
[02:35:38.360 --> 02:35:41.560]   And so what they do instead is they take the culture
[02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:43.880]   of the bacterium that makes it,
[02:35:43.880 --> 02:35:45.440]   and they grow it up, and they ferment it,
[02:35:45.440 --> 02:35:47.240]   and then they purify it.
[02:35:47.240 --> 02:35:50.160]   And Merck owns the bacteria.
[02:35:50.160 --> 02:35:55.460]   A number of years ago, two employees of Merck stole it
[02:35:55.460 --> 02:35:58.200]   and left the company and tried to market it,
[02:35:58.200 --> 02:36:00.000]   and they were arrested, and they got put in jail.
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.760]   So they protect it very carefully.
[02:36:02.760 --> 02:36:05.680]   So you can't just make it.
[02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:07.680]   If you do, it's incredibly expensive.
[02:36:07.680 --> 02:36:10.160]   And now India, it's very cheap apparently.
[02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:12.560]   They use it quite liberally there.
[02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:14.440]   And I don't know how they're making it.
[02:36:14.440 --> 02:36:16.640]   Maybe they've licensed it from Merck and so forth.
[02:36:16.640 --> 02:36:21.640]   But that's why it hasn't been tested more widely, I think.
[02:36:21.640 --> 02:36:24.120]   - There's complexities in terms of getting a lot of it
[02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:25.400]   and manufacturing a lot of it.
[02:36:25.400 --> 02:36:26.400]   - Yes. - Okay.
[02:36:26.400 --> 02:36:28.360]   So what was the other, the hydro--
[02:36:28.360 --> 02:36:32.280]   - Hydroxychloroquine was also shown early on
[02:36:32.280 --> 02:36:34.400]   to inhibit virus in cell culture.
[02:36:34.400 --> 02:36:37.360]   And that's not surprising.
[02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:41.280]   Hydroxychloroquine, of course, is used for malaria.
[02:36:41.280 --> 02:36:46.280]   And what it does, when your cell takes up things
[02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:49.640]   from the plasma membrane, including viruses,
[02:36:49.640 --> 02:36:52.120]   it goes through a pathway called the endocytic pathway,
[02:36:52.120 --> 02:36:54.080]   which involves a vesicle moving through the cell.
[02:36:54.080 --> 02:36:57.600]   And as it moves through the cell, its pH drops.
[02:36:57.600 --> 02:37:00.200]   And that lets a lot of viruses out actually.
[02:37:00.200 --> 02:37:01.840]   And hydroxychloroquine blocks that.
[02:37:01.840 --> 02:37:04.120]   So it blocks infection with a lot of viruses.
[02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:10.120]   So the problem with those early studies that were published
[02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:14.120]   is that they were done in kidney cells and culture,
[02:37:14.120 --> 02:37:16.280]   where the only way the virus can get in
[02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:17.520]   is through the endosome.
[02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:20.920]   And hydroxychloroquine inhibits that,
[02:37:20.920 --> 02:37:24.400]   and that's why it inhibits in kidney cells and culture.
[02:37:24.400 --> 02:37:28.040]   But lung cells and respiratory cells of humans
[02:37:28.040 --> 02:37:31.560]   where the virus reproduces can get in two different ways.
[02:37:31.560 --> 02:37:34.680]   It can get in from this endocytic pathway,
[02:37:34.680 --> 02:37:37.880]   which is inhibited by hydroxychloroquine,
[02:37:37.880 --> 02:37:40.320]   or it can get in at the cell surface,
[02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:43.120]   which is not inhibited by hydroxychloroquine.
[02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:46.500]   So when you treat patients, it has no effect in the lung
[02:37:46.500 --> 02:37:50.160]   because the virus can just bypass it.
[02:37:50.160 --> 02:37:53.160]   And all the usage initially were based
[02:37:53.160 --> 02:37:57.200]   on the studies done in kidney cells and culture.
[02:37:57.200 --> 02:38:00.560]   So that was just wrong, scientifically incorrect,
[02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:02.400]   yet it drove a lot of, and today,
[02:38:02.400 --> 02:38:05.000]   many people still think they should be taking it.
[02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:09.240]   - So that not panning out kind of resulted
[02:38:09.240 --> 02:38:14.240]   in a loss of optimism about other similar things panning out?
[02:38:14.240 --> 02:38:15.600]   - Well, that and many other drugs,
[02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:17.880]   repurposed drugs were tried, right?
[02:38:17.880 --> 02:38:20.240]   A lot of HIV antivirals were tried.
[02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:22.200]   I think the problem with hydroxy,
[02:38:22.200 --> 02:38:24.040]   I think hydroxychloroquine influenced
[02:38:24.040 --> 02:38:26.080]   the ivermectin narrative, right?
[02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:29.380]   People thought that data was being hidden
[02:38:29.380 --> 02:38:30.960]   about hydroxychloroquine, so they said,
[02:38:30.960 --> 02:38:33.120]   well, they must be doing the same thing with ivermectin.
[02:38:33.120 --> 02:38:34.840]   But with hydroxychloroquine,
[02:38:34.840 --> 02:38:39.060]   it just scientifically could not work as an antiviral.
[02:38:39.060 --> 02:38:42.120]   The other problem that is more broad
[02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:44.000]   that is important to point out is that
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:49.600]   when you have COVID and you need an antiviral,
[02:38:49.600 --> 02:38:50.920]   it's usually because you can't breathe
[02:38:50.920 --> 02:38:52.960]   when you go in a hospital.
[02:38:52.960 --> 02:38:53.980]   'Cause if you're mildly ill,
[02:38:53.980 --> 02:38:55.400]   you're never gonna go to your doctor
[02:38:55.400 --> 02:38:56.840]   and ask for an antiviral.
[02:38:56.840 --> 02:38:58.420]   And the problem is when you can't breathe,
[02:38:58.420 --> 02:39:00.400]   it's no longer a viral issue.
[02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:02.280]   It is now an inflammatory issue,
[02:39:02.280 --> 02:39:05.320]   and no antiviral in the world is gonna help you.
[02:39:05.320 --> 02:39:09.040]   So that's why remdesivir doesn't work very well,
[02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:10.580]   'cause it's mainly given intravenously
[02:39:10.580 --> 02:39:12.340]   to people who go in a hospital.
[02:39:12.340 --> 02:39:16.760]   If you get ivermectin in the hospital,
[02:39:16.760 --> 02:39:19.020]   it's not gonna do anything for reducing virus,
[02:39:19.020 --> 02:39:20.880]   because by that time, you have very little virus
[02:39:20.880 --> 02:39:21.840]   to begin with.
[02:39:21.840 --> 02:39:23.200]   You have an inflammatory problem
[02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:24.880]   that you need to treat in other ways.
[02:39:24.880 --> 02:39:28.920]   So this is why a lot of the antivirals failed,
[02:39:28.920 --> 02:39:30.920]   because they're used too late.
[02:39:30.920 --> 02:39:33.060]   What you need is a pill you take
[02:39:33.060 --> 02:39:34.560]   on that first positive test,
[02:39:34.560 --> 02:39:36.880]   when you have a scratchy throat.
[02:39:36.880 --> 02:39:39.700]   You get a PCR in 15 minutes, I'm positive,
[02:39:39.700 --> 02:39:42.800]   take a pill, boom, that's gonna inhibit it.
[02:39:42.800 --> 02:39:44.980]   If you wait 'til you can't breathe,
[02:39:44.980 --> 02:39:47.320]   and that's why the monoclonals even don't work
[02:39:47.320 --> 02:39:49.220]   if you're in a hospital that well,
[02:39:49.220 --> 02:39:50.240]   'cause it's too late.
[02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:54.440]   And the approach now is, if you're in a high-risk group,
[02:39:54.440 --> 02:39:57.920]   if you're over 65, if you are obese,
[02:39:57.920 --> 02:40:00.760]   or have diabetes, or any other comorbidities,
[02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:03.820]   your first sign of a scratchy throat positive,
[02:40:03.820 --> 02:40:06.020]   you get monoclonals.
[02:40:06.020 --> 02:40:07.360]   Then they might help you.
[02:40:07.360 --> 02:40:09.880]   But if you wait 'til you go in a hospital, it's too late,
[02:40:09.880 --> 02:40:12.080]   'cause the viral curve drops.
[02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:15.880]   After that first symptom, within three days,
[02:40:15.880 --> 02:40:18.520]   you're no longer shedding enough virus to transmit.
[02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:20.720]   It drops really quickly.
[02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:23.200]   So that's the reason a lot of these antivirals failed,
[02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:25.880]   'cause they were tested in hospitalized patients.
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:29.500]   And we have nothing but remdesivir now, unfortunately.
[02:40:29.500 --> 02:40:30.940]   So it was the wrong approach.
[02:40:30.940 --> 02:40:33.800]   We should have been giving it to people
[02:40:33.800 --> 02:40:35.840]   who just tested positive from the start.
[02:40:35.840 --> 02:40:38.120]   - Or just even for preventative and see--
[02:40:38.120 --> 02:40:39.660]   - You could do that too.
[02:40:39.660 --> 02:40:42.040]   But I have to say, the other issue is,
[02:40:42.040 --> 02:40:45.040]   this monopiravir is a drug in phase three now.
[02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:48.420]   It's an oral antiviral, it looks good.
[02:40:48.420 --> 02:40:51.160]   If we go ahead with just one,
[02:40:51.160 --> 02:40:53.320]   we're gonna get resistance within a few months,
[02:40:53.320 --> 02:40:54.360]   and it will be useless.
[02:40:54.360 --> 02:40:56.840]   We need to have at least two or three drugs
[02:40:56.840 --> 02:40:58.840]   that we can give in combinations.
[02:40:58.840 --> 02:41:01.680]   And we know that, 'cause that's what took care of HIV,
[02:41:01.680 --> 02:41:05.280]   that's what took care of HCV, hepatitis C virus.
[02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:08.120]   It really reduces the emergence of resistance.
[02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:11.600]   - Joe Rogan got quite a bit of heat recently
[02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:16.600]   about mentioning a paper and a broader idea,
[02:41:16.600 --> 02:41:19.920]   which I don't think is that controversial,
[02:41:19.920 --> 02:41:21.740]   but maybe we can expand on it.
[02:41:21.740 --> 02:41:27.820]   And the idea is that vaccines create selective pressure
[02:41:27.820 --> 02:41:34.280]   for a virus to mutate and for variants to form.
[02:41:34.280 --> 02:41:40.400]   First of all, from a biological perspective,
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:42.120]   can you explain this process?
[02:41:42.120 --> 02:41:45.680]   And from a societal perspective,
[02:41:45.680 --> 02:41:47.600]   what are we supposed to do about that?
[02:41:47.600 --> 02:41:49.580]   - So let's get the terminology right.
[02:41:49.580 --> 02:41:54.080]   So as we talked about earlier, viruses are always mutating.
[02:41:54.080 --> 02:41:58.360]   So no vaccine or no drug makes a virus mutate.
[02:41:58.360 --> 02:42:01.240]   - That's the wrong perspective in which to look at it.
[02:42:01.240 --> 02:42:05.000]   - What the immune response is putting pressure,
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.040]   selection pressure on the virus.
[02:42:07.040 --> 02:42:11.520]   And if there's one particle with the right mutation
[02:42:11.520 --> 02:42:14.100]   that can escape the antibody, that will emerge.
[02:42:15.280 --> 02:42:17.720]   So that's what happens with influenza virus, right?
[02:42:17.720 --> 02:42:21.440]   We vaccinate every year and there are not a lot of people
[02:42:21.440 --> 02:42:23.900]   that get infected, so they get natural immunity.
[02:42:23.900 --> 02:42:28.920]   And then the virus is incredibly varied.
[02:42:28.920 --> 02:42:30.280]   It mutates like crazy.
[02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:32.160]   And there's in some person somewhere,
[02:42:32.160 --> 02:42:34.440]   there's one variant that escapes the antibody,
[02:42:34.440 --> 02:42:37.160]   which has been induced either by infection or vaccination.
[02:42:37.160 --> 02:42:38.000]   It can be both.
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:41.320]   And that drives the emergence of the new variants.
[02:42:41.320 --> 02:42:43.900]   So the next year we need to change the vaccine.
[02:42:43.900 --> 02:42:48.900]   So I would say both natural infection and vaccination,
[02:42:48.900 --> 02:42:51.480]   sure, select for variants.
[02:42:51.480 --> 02:42:53.520]   Absolutely, there's no question,
[02:42:53.520 --> 02:42:55.440]   because they're inducing immunity.
[02:42:55.440 --> 02:43:00.040]   Now, what happened last year was at the beginning of 2020,
[02:43:00.040 --> 02:43:02.320]   very few people in the world were immune
[02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:04.920]   as the virus first started spreading.
[02:43:04.920 --> 02:43:09.140]   But you can see in the sequences of those isolates
[02:43:09.140 --> 02:43:11.040]   from the beginning of 2020,
[02:43:11.040 --> 02:43:14.660]   you can see all of the changes that are now present
[02:43:14.660 --> 02:43:17.700]   in the variants of concern at very, very low frequencies.
[02:43:17.700 --> 02:43:18.700]   They were already there,
[02:43:18.700 --> 02:43:21.940]   but there was no selection for them to emerge.
[02:43:21.940 --> 02:43:25.380]   Until November, when we now had many millions of people
[02:43:25.380 --> 02:43:29.780]   who had mostly been infected, but also some vaccinated,
[02:43:29.780 --> 02:43:33.060]   then we saw the alpha variant emerge in England,
[02:43:33.060 --> 02:43:35.360]   probably because of immune selection.
[02:43:35.360 --> 02:43:38.300]   Now the virus that had the change
[02:43:38.300 --> 02:43:41.980]   that evaded the antibody had an advantage,
[02:43:41.980 --> 02:43:44.060]   and that virus drove through the population.
[02:43:44.060 --> 02:43:44.900]   So that's what we're seeing.
[02:43:44.900 --> 02:43:46.020]   We're seeing all these variants
[02:43:46.020 --> 02:43:47.980]   are simply antigenic selection.
[02:43:47.980 --> 02:43:52.740]   - So the variants, the mutations that are at the core
[02:43:52.740 --> 02:43:56.780]   of these "variants," they were always there all along.
[02:43:56.780 --> 02:44:00.420]   The vaccine or the infections did not create them.
[02:44:00.420 --> 02:44:02.660]   - No, the infections don't create them, they're selected.
[02:44:02.660 --> 02:44:07.660]   - It's like the vaccine wipe out a lot of the variants,
[02:44:08.220 --> 02:44:13.220]   right, and then by making your body immune to them,
[02:44:13.220 --> 02:44:15.540]   but some of them survive.
[02:44:15.540 --> 02:44:16.820]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:44:16.820 --> 02:44:19.500]   - And then there's another tree that's built,
[02:44:19.500 --> 02:44:22.560]   and it's unclear what that tree leads to.
[02:44:22.560 --> 02:44:27.060]   I mean, it could make things much worse or much better.
[02:44:27.060 --> 02:44:28.340]   We don't know.
[02:44:28.340 --> 02:44:31.220]   - Well, with flu, we see year after year, the virus changes.
[02:44:31.220 --> 02:44:33.580]   We change the vaccine, we deal with it,
[02:44:33.580 --> 02:44:35.540]   we change it again, there's an unending series.
[02:44:35.540 --> 02:44:37.580]   - But see, that's a very different story.
[02:44:37.580 --> 02:44:40.500]   Do you think COVID will be,
[02:44:40.500 --> 02:44:45.940]   with some likelihood, like the flu,
[02:44:45.940 --> 02:44:47.860]   where it's basically variants,
[02:44:47.860 --> 02:44:52.780]   we'll never be able to eradicate it?
[02:44:52.780 --> 02:44:57.380]   - It will never eradicate it in any case, ever.
[02:44:57.380 --> 02:44:59.820]   - Well, come up with a vaccine
[02:44:59.820 --> 02:45:03.140]   that makes you immune to enough variants
[02:45:03.140 --> 02:45:07.260]   where there's not enough evolutionary room.
[02:45:07.260 --> 02:45:09.140]   - Well, if you cut down the number of infections,
[02:45:09.140 --> 02:45:12.220]   then you reduce the diversity, sure, right?
[02:45:12.220 --> 02:45:15.180]   The problem is, let's say you're a cynic,
[02:45:15.180 --> 02:45:18.060]   and you say, "Well, vaccination is just selecting
[02:45:18.060 --> 02:45:20.060]   "for variants, so let's stop it."
[02:45:20.060 --> 02:45:21.500]   But then you're gonna have infection,
[02:45:21.500 --> 02:45:23.300]   and that's gonna select for variants,
[02:45:23.300 --> 02:45:26.300]   and you're more likely to get very sick,
[02:45:26.300 --> 02:45:28.660]   because we know the vaccines are really good
[02:45:28.660 --> 02:45:30.100]   at preventing you from dying.
[02:45:30.100 --> 02:45:34.100]   So that's why it still makes sense to use vaccines,
[02:45:34.100 --> 02:45:36.740]   because they prevent you from dying.
[02:45:36.740 --> 02:45:38.180]   That's the bottom line.
[02:45:38.180 --> 02:45:41.060]   But can we ever make a vaccine
[02:45:41.060 --> 02:45:44.580]   that deals with all variants?
[02:45:44.580 --> 02:45:45.580]   Absolutely.
[02:45:45.580 --> 02:45:49.260]   And the reason I say that is because people
[02:45:49.260 --> 02:45:53.380]   who get naturally infected with SARS-CoV-2,
[02:45:53.380 --> 02:45:55.100]   they develop COVID, they recover.
[02:45:55.100 --> 02:45:59.580]   If you give them one vaccine dose,
[02:45:59.580 --> 02:46:01.460]   they make an immune response
[02:46:01.460 --> 02:46:05.740]   that handles all the variants that are around right now.
[02:46:05.740 --> 02:46:07.780]   All of them, much better than people
[02:46:07.780 --> 02:46:10.380]   who've gotten two doses of vaccine.
[02:46:10.380 --> 02:46:12.820]   For some reason, their immune response
[02:46:12.820 --> 02:46:16.860]   has suddenly broadened after the infection vaccination,
[02:46:16.860 --> 02:46:18.540]   and they can handle all the variants
[02:46:18.540 --> 02:46:19.380]   that we know of so far.
[02:46:19.380 --> 02:46:22.780]   So that tells me we can devise a strategy
[02:46:22.780 --> 02:46:24.540]   to do the same thing with a vaccine
[02:46:24.540 --> 02:46:26.620]   that makes a really broad vaccine
[02:46:26.620 --> 02:46:27.940]   that'll handle all the variants.
[02:46:27.940 --> 02:46:30.660]   - Well, you actually, on the virology blog,
[02:46:30.660 --> 02:46:32.340]   I don't know if you're the author of that, but--
[02:46:32.340 --> 02:46:33.900]   - I am, yes.
[02:46:33.900 --> 02:46:36.820]   Oh, the blog, yes, but there's a particular post
[02:46:36.820 --> 02:46:39.420]   that was talking about reporting on a paper
[02:46:39.420 --> 02:46:40.900]   that a mix and match strategy--
[02:46:40.900 --> 02:46:44.220]   - Oh, yes, that's one of my co-writers, Trudy Ray, yeah.
[02:46:44.220 --> 02:46:46.620]   - Yeah, it's an interesting idea
[02:46:46.620 --> 02:46:49.380]   that there's some early evidence now
[02:46:49.380 --> 02:46:52.380]   that mixing and matching vaccines,
[02:46:52.380 --> 02:46:56.500]   like one shot of Pfizer and one of like Moderna or something,
[02:46:56.500 --> 02:47:00.460]   that creates a much better immunity
[02:47:00.460 --> 02:47:02.820]   than does two shots of Pfizer.
[02:47:02.820 --> 02:47:05.420]   - I think that's worth exploring, absolutely.
[02:47:05.420 --> 02:47:08.420]   And this is relevant, that what we're doing with influenza,
[02:47:08.420 --> 02:47:11.260]   instead of having to vaccinate people every year,
[02:47:11.260 --> 02:47:12.860]   why can't we devise a vaccine
[02:47:12.860 --> 02:47:14.780]   which you'd get once in your lifetime,
[02:47:14.780 --> 02:47:17.420]   or maybe once every 10 years, okay?
[02:47:17.420 --> 02:47:22.420]   So the spike of influenza, it's a long protein,
[02:47:22.420 --> 02:47:24.700]   kind of like the spike of SARS-CoV-2,
[02:47:24.700 --> 02:47:26.340]   it's stuck in the virus membrane,
[02:47:26.340 --> 02:47:31.340]   and the very tip, that's the part that changes every year.
[02:47:31.340 --> 02:47:33.740]   That's where the antibodies bind.
[02:47:33.740 --> 02:47:36.500]   But the stem doesn't change.
[02:47:36.500 --> 02:47:39.900]   And if you make antibodies to the stem,
[02:47:39.900 --> 02:47:41.700]   they can also prevent infection.
[02:47:41.700 --> 02:47:44.060]   It's just that when people are infected
[02:47:44.060 --> 02:47:45.980]   or with the current vaccines,
[02:47:45.980 --> 02:47:48.860]   they don't make many antibodies to that stem part.
[02:47:48.860 --> 02:47:51.420]   But we're trying to figure out how to make those,
[02:47:51.420 --> 02:47:53.660]   and we think they would be broadly protective,
[02:47:53.660 --> 02:47:57.880]   and you'd never be able to, or more rarely be able to,
[02:47:57.880 --> 02:48:00.940]   have a variant emerge that escaped it.
[02:48:00.940 --> 02:48:02.460]   And I think we can do the same thing
[02:48:02.460 --> 02:48:05.500]   with coronavirus too, for sure.
[02:48:05.500 --> 02:48:08.380]   - Can I ask you about testing?
[02:48:08.380 --> 02:48:10.140]   - Sure, sure.
[02:48:10.140 --> 02:48:13.300]   - You mentioned PCR, what kind of tests are there?
[02:48:13.300 --> 02:48:18.160]   The antigen test, what are your thoughts on each?
[02:48:18.160 --> 02:48:22.480]   Maybe this is a good place to also mention viral load,
[02:48:22.480 --> 02:48:26.140]   and the history of the virus
[02:48:26.140 --> 02:48:27.700]   as it passes through your body,
[02:48:27.700 --> 02:48:31.220]   in terms of what's being tested for,
[02:48:31.220 --> 02:48:33.380]   and all those kinds of things.
[02:48:33.380 --> 02:48:38.380]   - So the first tests that were developed were PCR,
[02:48:38.380 --> 02:48:40.220]   polymerase chain reaction,
[02:48:40.220 --> 02:48:43.740]   they're basically nucleic acid amplification tests.
[02:48:43.740 --> 02:48:44.780]   And the very first ones,
[02:48:44.780 --> 02:48:47.940]   they stuck the swab all the way up into your brain, almost.
[02:48:47.940 --> 02:48:49.220]   (laughing)
[02:48:49.220 --> 02:48:50.820]   I had that done a couple weeks ago.
[02:48:50.820 --> 02:48:53.400]   Oh my gosh, it's really nasty.
[02:48:53.400 --> 02:48:56.260]   But now they do an anterior nares swab.
[02:48:56.260 --> 02:48:59.660]   They get a bunch of cells and some mucus,
[02:48:59.660 --> 02:49:02.620]   which has virus and parts of virus,
[02:49:02.620 --> 02:49:04.260]   stick it in a test tube,
[02:49:04.260 --> 02:49:05.940]   and then they run a reaction,
[02:49:05.940 --> 02:49:09.000]   which by the way, involves reverse transcriptase,
[02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.940]   'cause it converts the viral RNA to DNA,
[02:49:11.940 --> 02:49:14.200]   and then you amplify it.
[02:49:14.200 --> 02:49:18.900]   And you can specify what part of the viral RNA
[02:49:18.900 --> 02:49:20.260]   you want to amplify.
[02:49:20.260 --> 02:49:22.500]   And then a machine will detect it,
[02:49:22.500 --> 02:49:25.060]   and it can be done in 15 minutes.
[02:49:25.060 --> 02:49:29.060]   But you're detecting pieces of RNA, not infectious virus.
[02:49:29.060 --> 02:49:32.380]   So we're measuring viral RNA loads, right?
[02:49:32.380 --> 02:49:36.780]   And a common mistake that many people who should know better,
[02:49:36.780 --> 02:49:40.060]   you know, physicians and scientists of all kinds,
[02:49:40.060 --> 02:49:42.600]   they think that indicates how much virus you have.
[02:49:42.600 --> 02:49:44.400]   It doesn't.
[02:49:44.400 --> 02:49:48.580]   It's a diagnostic of whether you have bits of RNA in you,
[02:49:48.580 --> 02:49:51.300]   and it probably means you're infected.
[02:49:51.300 --> 02:49:55.460]   But you can't use it to shed light on what's going on.
[02:49:55.460 --> 02:49:56.860]   And I'll tell you why in a bit,
[02:49:56.860 --> 02:49:59.460]   but first we have to explain some other things.
[02:49:59.460 --> 02:50:06.340]   So until you get to about a million copies of RNA,
[02:50:06.340 --> 02:50:08.520]   so you can measure the copy number in this test,
[02:50:08.520 --> 02:50:09.660]   this PCR test.
[02:50:09.660 --> 02:50:13.820]   It's a number called CT, or cycle threshold.
[02:50:13.820 --> 02:50:15.340]   The test, the way the machine works,
[02:50:15.340 --> 02:50:16.380]   it goes through cycles.
[02:50:16.380 --> 02:50:19.940]   In every cycle, it amplifies what you put in.
[02:50:19.940 --> 02:50:23.900]   And the more cycles you need to see something,
[02:50:23.900 --> 02:50:26.660]   that means there's not a lot of RNA there.
[02:50:26.660 --> 02:50:31.140]   So if you do a test and you have a cycle threshold of 35,
[02:50:31.140 --> 02:50:33.660]   you have very little RNA in you.
[02:50:33.660 --> 02:50:36.180]   Contrary, if you have a cycle threshold of 10,
[02:50:36.180 --> 02:50:37.020]   you have a ton of RNA,
[02:50:37.020 --> 02:50:39.540]   and you only took 10 cycles to detect it.
[02:50:39.540 --> 02:50:42.780]   And you can extrapolate from that number
[02:50:42.780 --> 02:50:46.100]   the number of copies you have per sample, say per swap.
[02:50:46.100 --> 02:50:49.140]   And if you don't have a million, you're not infectious.
[02:50:49.140 --> 02:50:50.780]   You're not gonna infect anyone.
[02:50:50.780 --> 02:50:54.740]   So in the early days, no matter what PCR result you had,
[02:50:54.740 --> 02:50:56.060]   they would quarantine you.
[02:50:56.060 --> 02:50:58.340]   And that was wrong because you're not shedding.
[02:50:58.340 --> 02:51:00.060]   You don't need to be quarantined,
[02:51:00.060 --> 02:51:02.780]   but it wasn't thought through properly, right?
[02:51:02.780 --> 02:51:04.580]   - And that's where you had like 14 days
[02:51:04.580 --> 02:51:05.420]   or something like that.
[02:51:05.420 --> 02:51:07.940]   - 14 days, which is now we know is too long
[02:51:07.940 --> 02:51:11.620]   because you don't shed for that long in a normal infection.
[02:51:11.620 --> 02:51:14.160]   Now it's 10 days should be fine.
[02:51:14.160 --> 02:51:16.180]   So what happens is you get infected.
[02:51:16.180 --> 02:51:17.860]   You don't know it, of course.
[02:51:17.860 --> 02:51:19.780]   The virus starts to grow very quickly.
[02:51:19.780 --> 02:51:24.700]   And within four or five days, you reach a peak of shedding.
[02:51:24.700 --> 02:51:28.260]   You're making a lot of RNA and you may be asymptomatic.
[02:51:28.260 --> 02:51:30.060]   You're shedding, you can infect others.
[02:51:30.060 --> 02:51:32.820]   And then you may or may not have your symptom onset.
[02:51:32.820 --> 02:51:36.260]   So you shed for a couple of days before symptom onset.
[02:51:36.260 --> 02:51:38.660]   And then within three days, four days,
[02:51:38.660 --> 02:51:41.500]   the viral RNA crashes and you're no longer shedding.
[02:51:41.500 --> 02:51:42.980]   You're no longer transmitting.
[02:51:42.980 --> 02:51:44.580]   So that's the one kind of test we have.
[02:51:44.580 --> 02:51:47.700]   It can tell you if you're infected at the moment,
[02:51:47.700 --> 02:51:51.500]   but it won't tell you if you're gonna be infected tomorrow.
[02:51:51.500 --> 02:51:52.700]   'Cause if you're negative today,
[02:51:52.700 --> 02:51:54.060]   you could be positive tomorrow.
[02:51:54.060 --> 02:51:56.180]   You just might be in a different part
[02:51:56.180 --> 02:51:58.340]   of the incubation period.
[02:51:58.340 --> 02:52:01.100]   So that's one test been used the most.
[02:52:01.100 --> 02:52:05.060]   You can now get 15 minute versions of them
[02:52:05.060 --> 02:52:06.900]   in a walk-in or whatever.
[02:52:06.900 --> 02:52:08.100]   Then there are antigen tests,
[02:52:08.100 --> 02:52:11.660]   which look for the proteins that the virus is making.
[02:52:11.660 --> 02:52:13.480]   So as it's reproducing in your nose,
[02:52:13.480 --> 02:52:16.180]   it's not only making genomes, it's making proteins.
[02:52:16.180 --> 02:52:18.380]   And so these you can buy in the drug store.
[02:52:18.380 --> 02:52:22.180]   And these would have been great if they had,
[02:52:22.180 --> 02:52:24.340]   Michael Mina last year had the idea
[02:52:24.340 --> 02:52:26.500]   that if we could make a little stick,
[02:52:26.500 --> 02:52:28.620]   a little piece of paper that you would suck on
[02:52:28.620 --> 02:52:30.380]   and it would tell you if you're infected or not,
[02:52:30.380 --> 02:52:32.580]   if this could cost less than a buck,
[02:52:32.580 --> 02:52:34.060]   everybody could test themselves.
[02:52:34.060 --> 02:52:37.060]   - Which they can cost less than a buck, by the way.
[02:52:37.060 --> 02:52:39.100]   - Yeah, but they were never made, right?
[02:52:39.100 --> 02:52:42.340]   - They're never mass manufactured.
[02:52:42.340 --> 02:52:44.820]   So his idea is to do like daily tests.
[02:52:44.820 --> 02:52:47.340]   - Yeah, daily, and then the kid's going to school,
[02:52:47.340 --> 02:52:49.860]   he's positive or she's positive.
[02:52:49.860 --> 02:52:51.820]   Well, if it's cheap enough, you just take another test
[02:52:51.820 --> 02:52:53.540]   'cause they have a certain error frequency.
[02:52:53.540 --> 02:52:55.300]   If it's positive twice, you stay home
[02:52:55.300 --> 02:52:57.180]   and the next day you try again.
[02:52:57.180 --> 02:52:59.860]   And I think this would have revolutionized
[02:52:59.860 --> 02:53:02.460]   because the PCR tests are more expensive at the time
[02:53:02.460 --> 02:53:05.340]   and they take longer to do and so forth.
[02:53:05.340 --> 02:53:07.060]   But that never happened.
[02:53:07.060 --> 02:53:10.780]   But now we do have $20 BinaxNOW and others that you can buy
[02:53:10.780 --> 02:53:12.260]   and people buy them.
[02:53:12.260 --> 02:53:13.980]   - See, but that can still happen, right?
[02:53:13.980 --> 02:53:16.020]   And this is the very frustrating thing to me
[02:53:16.020 --> 02:53:18.980]   because I'm worried about variants,
[02:53:18.980 --> 02:53:20.660]   but I'm also worried about future,
[02:53:20.660 --> 02:53:22.780]   much more deadly pandemics.
[02:53:22.780 --> 02:53:28.460]   I know we kind of said, yes, COVID, lots of deaths,
[02:53:28.460 --> 02:53:31.020]   but it could be a lot worse too.
[02:53:31.020 --> 02:53:35.780]   So I'm thinking what is going to be the right response
[02:53:35.780 --> 02:53:38.580]   for the future pandemic of its kind?
[02:53:38.580 --> 02:53:39.900]   And what's the right response
[02:53:39.900 --> 02:53:41.620]   for continued number of variants
[02:53:41.620 --> 02:53:44.580]   and some of the variants might be deadlier
[02:53:44.580 --> 02:53:45.940]   or more transmissible?
[02:53:45.940 --> 02:53:50.940]   - Well, the antigen tests will pick up the variants.
[02:53:50.940 --> 02:53:52.700]   That's not a question.
[02:53:52.700 --> 02:53:55.060]   The PCR may be influenced by changes,
[02:53:55.060 --> 02:53:58.460]   but you can quickly adapt the primers that you use.
[02:53:58.460 --> 02:53:59.300]   - But that's what I mean.
[02:53:59.300 --> 02:54:03.260]   Like to me, all these discussions about vaccines and so on,
[02:54:03.260 --> 02:54:06.820]   vaccines, we got very lucky that they took so little time.
[02:54:06.820 --> 02:54:07.660]   - Right.
[02:54:07.660 --> 02:54:10.500]   - And you have to be aware, no matter what,
[02:54:10.500 --> 02:54:13.300]   that there's hesitancy with the vaccines in this country.
[02:54:13.300 --> 02:54:15.660]   Before, I mean, yeah, that's a reality.
[02:54:15.660 --> 02:54:18.580]   You can't just be like magically saying that
[02:54:18.580 --> 02:54:20.420]   you're going to overcome that.
[02:54:20.420 --> 02:54:22.180]   And I don't think there's any hesitancy
[02:54:22.180 --> 02:54:24.020]   and cheap tests at home.
[02:54:24.020 --> 02:54:24.860]   - I agree.
[02:54:24.860 --> 02:54:27.020]   I think if someone, so the question is,
[02:54:27.020 --> 02:54:29.220]   if someone tested positive, would they stay home?
[02:54:29.220 --> 02:54:30.060]   That's the question.
[02:54:30.060 --> 02:54:32.340]   What if their job depends on them going in?
[02:54:32.340 --> 02:54:33.540]   I mean, that's-
[02:54:33.540 --> 02:54:36.660]   - Well, you have to look at sort of aggregate
[02:54:36.660 --> 02:54:38.180]   how many people would decide.
[02:54:38.180 --> 02:54:43.060]   And I think, again, a lot of that is in leadership,
[02:54:43.060 --> 02:54:45.060]   but I think a lot of them,
[02:54:45.060 --> 02:54:47.140]   I would say most people would stay home.
[02:54:47.140 --> 02:54:49.460]   - I think that Mena had the idea
[02:54:49.460 --> 02:54:53.180]   and it would have changed the whole situation for sure
[02:54:53.180 --> 02:54:56.220]   if it could have been made when we talked to him last spring,
[02:54:56.220 --> 02:54:57.300]   I think, or summer.
[02:54:57.300 --> 02:55:00.740]   We would have gotten around a lot of the issues
[02:55:00.740 --> 02:55:02.380]   that we're in today because I think people
[02:55:02.380 --> 02:55:04.000]   would have stayed home and not transmitted.
[02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:06.060]   And I think it's still valuable to this day.
[02:55:06.060 --> 02:55:09.860]   In the fall, if we don't have vaccine uptake,
[02:55:09.860 --> 02:55:12.420]   we could just test kids every day
[02:55:12.420 --> 02:55:14.420]   and keep them home when they're infected.
[02:55:14.420 --> 02:55:17.620]   And we don't have it.
[02:55:17.620 --> 02:55:20.660]   But I think, and I'm not privy to what was going on,
[02:55:20.660 --> 02:55:23.020]   but I don't think a lot of emphasis
[02:55:23.020 --> 02:55:25.140]   was put on testing early on.
[02:55:25.140 --> 02:55:27.060]   The CDC developed the first one.
[02:55:27.060 --> 02:55:27.980]   It was flawed.
[02:55:27.980 --> 02:55:29.420]   They had to recall the kits.
[02:55:29.420 --> 02:55:30.420]   I mean, that was a fiasco.
[02:55:30.420 --> 02:55:32.240]   They should have had 100 companies
[02:55:32.240 --> 02:55:34.740]   making the tests initially, right?
[02:55:34.740 --> 02:55:37.980]   So for the future, I think what we have learned
[02:55:37.980 --> 02:55:40.420]   is we need to have a rapid antigen test
[02:55:40.420 --> 02:55:43.700]   right off the bat that's doable.
[02:55:43.700 --> 02:55:46.240]   You can't do it in a day like you can for PCR
[02:55:46.240 --> 02:55:49.700]   because you need to make antibodies
[02:55:49.700 --> 02:55:51.180]   to the protein that you're looking for
[02:55:51.180 --> 02:55:52.940]   and you need to do those in animals.
[02:55:52.940 --> 02:55:57.700]   But you can do it in weeks and we should be ready for that.
[02:55:57.700 --> 02:56:00.700]   - Yeah, I mean, to me, that's obvious.
[02:56:00.700 --> 02:56:02.820]   That's obviously the best solution.
[02:56:02.820 --> 02:56:06.900]   Second to that, if we understood how well masks work.
[02:56:06.900 --> 02:56:11.340]   Like, maybe let me ask you this question.
[02:56:11.340 --> 02:56:13.040]   Let's put masks aside.
[02:56:13.040 --> 02:56:18.140]   How well do we understand how COVID is transmitted?
[02:56:18.140 --> 02:56:23.140]   There's droplets of different sizes, aerosols,
[02:56:23.140 --> 02:56:24.860]   tiny, tiny droplets.
[02:56:24.860 --> 02:56:28.520]   It seems like that's a very difficult thing
[02:56:28.520 --> 02:56:29.880]   to understand thoroughly.
[02:56:30.900 --> 02:56:34.220]   So it seems like it's transmitted both ways.
[02:56:34.220 --> 02:56:36.580]   It's unclear how exactly.
[02:56:36.580 --> 02:56:39.460]   So how much do we understand
[02:56:39.460 --> 02:56:41.460]   and why is it so difficult to understand fully?
[02:56:41.460 --> 02:56:43.980]   - I think it's clear that it's transmitted
[02:56:43.980 --> 02:56:45.660]   through the air mostly.
[02:56:45.660 --> 02:56:47.140]   It's not touching.
[02:56:47.140 --> 02:56:48.780]   We thought initially it would be a lot of touch
[02:56:48.780 --> 02:56:50.940]   but very little of that.
[02:56:50.940 --> 02:56:53.940]   It's through the air and when you talk,
[02:56:53.940 --> 02:56:57.420]   mainly when you talk, you expel a lot of droplets, right?
[02:56:57.420 --> 02:57:00.220]   Even the plosives that your foam thing here
[02:57:00.220 --> 02:57:02.300]   are meant to pee, right?
[02:57:02.300 --> 02:57:03.860]   That you send out little sprays
[02:57:03.860 --> 02:57:05.420]   and those have viruses in them.
[02:57:05.420 --> 02:57:07.980]   The big drops fall to the ground
[02:57:07.980 --> 02:57:12.000]   and the little ones can go 100 feet or more, right?
[02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:14.680]   But the little ones also have less virus in them.
[02:57:14.680 --> 02:57:19.460]   So I'm not sure, well, we certainly do not know
[02:57:19.460 --> 02:57:22.060]   how much virus you need to be infected.
[02:57:22.060 --> 02:57:25.660]   But it's probably at least several thousand particles,
[02:57:25.660 --> 02:57:26.900]   if not more.
[02:57:26.900 --> 02:57:30.100]   And it could be that for most people,
[02:57:30.100 --> 02:57:33.340]   the tiny droplets don't have enough virus
[02:57:33.340 --> 02:57:34.860]   to infect someone else.
[02:57:34.860 --> 02:57:37.740]   But there's one observation about this virus
[02:57:37.740 --> 02:57:39.300]   that's really interesting.
[02:57:39.300 --> 02:57:42.700]   And that is that 80% of transmissions
[02:57:42.700 --> 02:57:47.000]   are done by 20% of the people, of the infected people.
[02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:50.460]   Not every infected person transmits.
[02:57:50.460 --> 02:57:52.540]   That's been borne out in multiple studies.
[02:57:52.540 --> 02:57:56.380]   And in fact, there's a study at University of Colorado
[02:57:56.380 --> 02:57:59.300]   where they quantified the viral RNA loads
[02:57:59.300 --> 02:58:01.900]   in all the swabs that had been done of students
[02:58:01.900 --> 02:58:03.460]   for like a six month period.
[02:58:03.460 --> 02:58:08.420]   And most of the infectious virus,
[02:58:08.420 --> 02:58:13.420]   most of the RNA copies were found in 15 to 20% of the people.
[02:58:13.420 --> 02:58:16.940]   The rest had really low and they probably,
[02:58:16.940 --> 02:58:18.900]   that's probably why they don't transmit.
[02:58:18.900 --> 02:58:22.900]   So those are the ones that might get enough virus
[02:58:22.900 --> 02:58:25.780]   in the tiny droplets to be able to infect someone
[02:58:25.780 --> 02:58:27.020]   at a distance.
[02:58:27.020 --> 02:58:29.340]   And I think that's entirely possible.
[02:58:29.340 --> 02:58:31.540]   Why is it hard to study?
[02:58:31.540 --> 02:58:33.300]   You can't do it in real life
[02:58:33.300 --> 02:58:35.860]   because you don't know who's infected.
[02:58:35.860 --> 02:58:38.300]   And if you do this, there's not a controlled environment
[02:58:38.300 --> 02:58:39.740]   to measure droplets and so forth.
[02:58:39.740 --> 02:58:42.760]   You'd have to do it in a laboratory situation.
[02:58:42.760 --> 02:58:44.620]   If you use an animal, you just don't know
[02:58:44.620 --> 02:58:47.000]   what the relevance of that is to people.
[02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:50.500]   You'd have to use human and do challenge experiments.
[02:58:50.500 --> 02:58:52.380]   And we don't do that at this point,
[02:58:52.380 --> 02:58:53.800]   at least not for this virus.
[02:58:53.800 --> 02:58:55.940]   So that's why it's hard to know what's going on.
[02:58:55.940 --> 02:58:58.300]   So we have to make inferences
[02:58:58.300 --> 02:59:01.260]   from epidemiological associations
[02:59:01.260 --> 02:59:03.880]   where you're studying say transmission in a household
[02:59:03.880 --> 02:59:06.140]   where people are stuck in the same rooms together
[02:59:06.140 --> 02:59:07.020]   and you can get an idea
[02:59:07.020 --> 02:59:09.820]   of what kind of droplets were involved.
[02:59:09.820 --> 02:59:11.340]   - So that makes it much harder to,
[02:59:11.340 --> 02:59:14.180]   if you're leaning on epidemiological stuff
[02:59:14.180 --> 02:59:17.260]   as opposed to like biophysics or something like that.
[02:59:17.260 --> 02:59:18.380]   - Very hard.
[02:59:18.380 --> 02:59:21.860]   - So that makes it, but that makes it really hard
[02:59:21.860 --> 02:59:24.040]   to then develop solutions like masks,
[02:59:24.040 --> 02:59:26.600]   to ask the question, how well do masks work?
[02:59:26.600 --> 02:59:28.820]   Because then to answer that question,
[02:59:28.820 --> 02:59:32.280]   you can lean on epidemiological stuff again,
[02:59:32.280 --> 02:59:34.520]   like looking at populations that wear masks
[02:59:34.520 --> 02:59:36.560]   versus don't wear masks,
[02:59:36.560 --> 02:59:38.840]   as opposed to actually saying,
[02:59:38.840 --> 02:59:41.840]   like from an engineering perspective,
[02:59:41.840 --> 02:59:46.600]   like what kind of material and what kind of tightness,
[02:59:46.600 --> 02:59:50.440]   by which amount decreases the viral load
[02:59:50.440 --> 02:59:52.500]   that's received on the other end?
[02:59:52.500 --> 02:59:55.860]   - But some experiments have been done with masks
[02:59:55.860 --> 02:59:58.460]   and just droplets with no virus in them, right?
[02:59:58.460 --> 02:59:59.300]   - Yes.
[02:59:59.300 --> 03:00:01.380]   - And you can measure the efficiency
[03:00:01.380 --> 03:00:04.420]   of different mask materials at keeping those in.
[03:00:04.420 --> 03:00:09.420]   - So if I say that this mask stops 70%
[03:00:09.420 --> 03:00:12.980]   of this or larger size droplet,
[03:00:12.980 --> 03:00:18.040]   that leads to this percent decreased transmission.
[03:00:19.200 --> 03:00:23.060]   And also on both the generation
[03:00:23.060 --> 03:00:27.580]   and the receiving end and the giving end.
[03:00:27.580 --> 03:00:28.420]   - Sure.
[03:00:28.420 --> 03:00:30.580]   - So how well do masks protect you from others?
[03:00:30.580 --> 03:00:34.220]   How well do you do mask protect others from you?
[03:00:34.220 --> 03:00:36.960]   Like all of those things seem like
[03:00:36.960 --> 03:00:40.180]   they could be more rigorously studied.
[03:00:40.180 --> 03:00:41.580]   - There's no doubt about it.
[03:00:41.580 --> 03:00:46.140]   And now is the time because once this is over,
[03:00:46.140 --> 03:00:47.220]   nobody's going to do it.
[03:00:47.220 --> 03:00:48.380]   - Nobody's going to care.
[03:00:48.380 --> 03:00:49.220]   - No.
[03:00:49.220 --> 03:00:52.920]   - But it seems like to me, so tests is one thing,
[03:00:52.920 --> 03:00:57.920]   but masks, like good masks, whatever the good means,
[03:00:57.920 --> 03:01:01.700]   whatever that means, like some level of a quality
[03:01:01.700 --> 03:01:05.820]   of material on your face, if it's shown to actually
[03:01:05.820 --> 03:01:09.020]   like thoroughly shown to work well,
[03:01:09.020 --> 03:01:10.980]   that seems like an obvious solution
[03:01:10.980 --> 03:01:16.420]   to reopen society with, if you have a good understanding
[03:01:16.420 --> 03:01:17.960]   of how well they work.
[03:01:17.960 --> 03:01:20.100]   Because if you don't have a good understanding,
[03:01:20.100 --> 03:01:23.020]   if there's a lot of uncertainty, that's when you get,
[03:01:23.020 --> 03:01:25.000]   and you have people speaking from authority,
[03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:27.980]   that's when you start getting the politicization
[03:01:27.980 --> 03:01:28.820]   of the solution.
[03:01:28.820 --> 03:01:29.660]   - Of course, of course.
[03:01:29.660 --> 03:01:32.220]   No, the data, there are some data,
[03:01:32.220 --> 03:01:36.380]   most, they're mostly epidemiological,
[03:01:36.380 --> 03:01:39.160]   and they show some effect in some countries, right?
[03:01:39.160 --> 03:01:40.820]   But they could be way better.
[03:01:40.820 --> 03:01:41.660]   - Yeah.
[03:01:41.660 --> 03:01:44.940]   - And, but the fact that they're not perfect,
[03:01:44.940 --> 03:01:46.780]   then people take advantage of and say,
[03:01:46.780 --> 03:01:48.120]   well, look, they don't work that well,
[03:01:48.120 --> 03:01:49.120]   so I'm not gonna wear it.
[03:01:49.120 --> 03:01:53.040]   I think, as you said, people can use it as an excuse.
[03:01:53.040 --> 03:01:56.220]   But even if it works, so Daniel always says it,
[03:01:56.220 --> 03:02:00.640]   a mask will cut down transmission by 50 to 60%,
[03:02:00.640 --> 03:02:03.480]   and then distance will do another 30%.
[03:02:03.480 --> 03:02:05.820]   - Yeah, those numbers are made up, though.
[03:02:05.820 --> 03:02:08.360]   I mean, they're not made up, but they're estimates.
[03:02:08.360 --> 03:02:09.200]   - Absolutely.
[03:02:09.200 --> 03:02:12.840]   And many of them are made based on models, right?
[03:02:12.840 --> 03:02:13.680]   - Yeah.
[03:02:13.680 --> 03:02:15.580]   - We will make this model, and let's say the mask
[03:02:15.580 --> 03:02:17.920]   cuts down this much, what will be the effect on it?
[03:02:17.920 --> 03:02:19.080]   I mean, yeah, they're models,
[03:02:19.080 --> 03:02:20.840]   and it's for the same reason.
[03:02:20.840 --> 03:02:25.040]   I don't believe the transmission of the variants,
[03:02:25.040 --> 03:02:27.320]   because it's all based on statistical models as well,
[03:02:27.320 --> 03:02:29.600]   not biological experiments done in the lab.
[03:02:29.600 --> 03:02:32.080]   - So in that sense, vaccine data's much better
[03:02:32.080 --> 03:02:33.240]   than mask data.
[03:02:33.240 --> 03:02:34.520]   - For sure, for sure.
[03:02:34.520 --> 03:02:37.200]   - So my problem with the mask data,
[03:02:37.200 --> 03:02:38.520]   which I always thought was fascinating,
[03:02:38.520 --> 03:02:41.440]   I stopped talking about it, I was in a paper about masks.
[03:02:41.440 --> 03:02:45.120]   I stopped talking about it because what started happening
[03:02:45.120 --> 03:02:48.060]   is masks created assholes on both sides.
[03:02:48.060 --> 03:02:50.460]   The people that were in Silicon Valley,
[03:02:50.460 --> 03:02:52.580]   the friends of mine that were wearing masks,
[03:02:52.580 --> 03:02:56.260]   the way they look at others who don't is like--
[03:02:56.260 --> 03:02:58.540]   - That's a whole 'nother issue, right, yeah.
[03:02:58.540 --> 03:02:59.940]   - But that's what-- - I understand.
[03:02:59.940 --> 03:03:02.620]   - That happens when you don't have solid science.
[03:03:02.620 --> 03:03:03.460]   - Understood.
[03:03:03.460 --> 03:03:05.660]   - They now start judging you like you're
[03:03:05.660 --> 03:03:07.300]   a lesser human being.
[03:03:07.300 --> 03:03:10.420]   You're not only dumb, but you're just,
[03:03:10.420 --> 03:03:11.580]   you're almost like evil.
[03:03:11.580 --> 03:03:14.380]   You're doing bad for society by not wearing a mask.
[03:03:14.380 --> 03:03:17.180]   And then the people looking in the other way
[03:03:17.180 --> 03:03:19.880]   are seeing you for the asshole that you're being
[03:03:19.880 --> 03:03:22.120]   for judging them unrightfully.
[03:03:22.120 --> 03:03:24.560]   So they almost wanna say F you by not wearing the mask.
[03:03:24.560 --> 03:03:26.700]   And there's this division that's created
[03:03:26.700 --> 03:03:30.460]   that was heartbreaking to me because masks, like testing,
[03:03:30.460 --> 03:03:33.480]   is a solution that was available early on.
[03:03:33.480 --> 03:03:36.000]   And if understood well, it could be deployed
[03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:37.160]   in a mass scale.
[03:03:37.160 --> 03:03:39.220]   And it seems like there's some historical evidence
[03:03:39.220 --> 03:03:41.800]   for other viruses where it does very well.
[03:03:41.800 --> 03:03:42.640]   - That's correct.
[03:03:42.640 --> 03:03:45.800]   - And so the fact that this was politicized,
[03:03:45.800 --> 03:03:48.820]   yeah, was a little bit heartbreaking.
[03:03:48.820 --> 03:03:51.860]   - You can find in the literature studies,
[03:03:51.860 --> 03:03:54.660]   mostly of healthcare workers and influenza,
[03:03:54.660 --> 03:03:57.660]   where you can actually, 'cause you see the people every day,
[03:03:57.660 --> 03:04:00.600]   they can sample them, you can actually see what masking does
[03:04:00.600 --> 03:04:04.140]   and some of them show an effect and others do not.
[03:04:04.140 --> 03:04:05.680]   Then that's the problem.
[03:04:05.680 --> 03:04:08.360]   Like any trial, sometimes if it's not big enough
[03:04:08.360 --> 03:04:10.460]   and then people latch onto that, see,
[03:04:10.460 --> 03:04:11.700]   it doesn't really work.
[03:04:11.700 --> 03:04:15.080]   But I think the main issue is that in January,
[03:04:15.080 --> 03:04:20.080]   both CDC and WHO said, "Masks don't work, don't use them."
[03:04:20.080 --> 03:04:22.320]   That was the kiss of death for masks.
[03:04:22.320 --> 03:04:25.160]   Because when they then changed their mind,
[03:04:25.160 --> 03:04:28.140]   they didn't say, "We screwed up."
[03:04:28.140 --> 03:04:29.320]   They just said, "Wear masks."
[03:04:29.320 --> 03:04:33.120]   If they had said, "We made a mistake, we were wrong,"
[03:04:33.120 --> 03:04:36.680]   I think more people would have worn masks, but they didn't.
[03:04:36.680 --> 03:04:39.180]   And like you said, admitting you're wrong
[03:04:39.180 --> 03:04:41.580]   is like a real big part of it.
[03:04:41.580 --> 03:04:43.260]   - I also think almost the better way
[03:04:43.260 --> 03:04:46.640]   is not just saying you're wrong,
[03:04:46.640 --> 03:04:51.480]   but in January revealing the uncertainty
[03:04:51.480 --> 03:04:52.440]   under which we operate.
[03:04:52.440 --> 03:04:57.440]   Like actually reveal what was done with the Spanish flu
[03:04:57.440 --> 03:04:59.760]   at the beginning of the previous century,
[03:04:59.760 --> 03:05:03.320]   'cause there's a lot of mask controversy then too.
[03:05:03.320 --> 03:05:05.140]   It went back and forth and that was actually the source
[03:05:05.140 --> 03:05:06.960]   of a lot of distrust there too.
[03:05:06.960 --> 03:05:09.320]   So, and then look at influenza,
[03:05:09.320 --> 03:05:11.120]   like how is it effective with that
[03:05:11.120 --> 03:05:13.920]   and just reveal this, we don't know.
[03:05:13.920 --> 03:05:17.740]   But with some probability,
[03:05:17.740 --> 03:05:20.160]   this is the best option we got currently.
[03:05:20.160 --> 03:05:23.640]   And then in a month or two, adjust it,
[03:05:23.640 --> 03:05:25.320]   saying that, you know what,
[03:05:25.320 --> 03:05:27.880]   our uncertainty decreased a little bit,
[03:05:27.880 --> 03:05:29.200]   we have a better idea.
[03:05:29.200 --> 03:05:32.400]   That was an incorrect estimate,
[03:05:32.400 --> 03:05:34.880]   but reveal that you're struggling.
[03:05:34.880 --> 03:05:36.860]   It's not like this weird binary clock
[03:05:36.860 --> 03:05:38.480]   that goes one direction or the other.
[03:05:38.480 --> 03:05:41.240]   You're struggling with uncertainty.
[03:05:41.240 --> 03:05:44.880]   And like trusting, people maybe criticize me sometimes
[03:05:44.880 --> 03:05:48.040]   with this, but I think most people are actually intelligent.
[03:05:48.040 --> 03:05:51.800]   Like trusting the public to be intelligent
[03:05:51.800 --> 03:05:54.080]   with if you give them, if you have transparent
[03:05:54.080 --> 03:05:57.720]   and give them information in a real authentic way.
[03:05:57.720 --> 03:05:59.600]   Like don't look like you're hiding something.
[03:05:59.600 --> 03:06:01.140]   I think they're intelligent enough
[03:06:01.140 --> 03:06:03.160]   to use that data to make decisions.
[03:06:03.160 --> 03:06:05.120]   It's the same thing as with the testing,
[03:06:05.120 --> 03:06:07.600]   is if you put that power in the people's hands
[03:06:07.600 --> 03:06:08.680]   to know if they're sick or not,
[03:06:08.680 --> 03:06:12.280]   they're gonna make, en masse, the right decision, I think.
[03:06:12.280 --> 03:06:17.120]   The masks and the testing has been a bit heartbreaking.
[03:06:17.120 --> 03:06:19.460]   - I think it's a good point, though,
[03:06:19.460 --> 03:06:23.080]   that most people don't seem to have an objection to testing.
[03:06:23.080 --> 03:06:23.920]   It's a good point.
[03:06:23.920 --> 03:06:24.740]   - Yes. - Yeah.
[03:06:24.740 --> 03:06:28.000]   - And then obviously, Makumena makes that point brilliantly.
[03:06:28.000 --> 03:06:31.560]   And still, there's very little excitement around that.
[03:06:31.560 --> 03:06:35.000]   - But he said he was going to do it.
[03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:35.840]   I don't understand.
[03:06:35.840 --> 03:06:37.600]   I mean, I haven't spoken to him since then.
[03:06:37.600 --> 03:06:38.720]   So I don't know what--
[03:06:38.720 --> 03:06:39.560]   - He's pushing it.
[03:06:39.560 --> 03:06:41.640]   Well, I mean, but he can't do it alone.
[03:06:41.640 --> 03:06:44.680]   He has to get, so one of the resistances,
[03:06:44.680 --> 03:06:48.160]   FDA doesn't like cheap things.
[03:06:48.160 --> 03:06:49.120]   - Yeah.
[03:06:49.120 --> 03:06:50.240]   - They don't wanna approve it.
[03:06:50.240 --> 03:06:53.000]   So that makes the mask manufacturer,
[03:06:53.000 --> 03:06:55.120]   like with the emergency exceptions,
[03:06:55.120 --> 03:06:57.440]   all those kinds of things, very difficult.
[03:06:57.440 --> 03:06:59.560]   And then there's not much money to be made on it
[03:06:59.560 --> 03:07:00.780]   without that.
[03:07:00.780 --> 03:07:01.620]   I don't know.
[03:07:01.620 --> 03:07:04.840]   I think there's just economic pressures against it.
[03:07:04.840 --> 03:07:09.840]   And because so much investment was placed on the vaccines,
[03:07:09.840 --> 03:07:13.360]   and obviously there's an incentive mechanism there
[03:07:13.360 --> 03:07:16.120]   where the companies, lobbyists and all those,
[03:07:16.120 --> 03:07:18.800]   there's this machine that says,
[03:07:18.800 --> 03:07:22.080]   arguing for tests is difficult
[03:07:22.080 --> 03:07:25.480]   because the thing that's worked for most severe viruses
[03:07:25.480 --> 03:07:27.160]   in the past is vaccines.
[03:07:27.160 --> 03:07:30.360]   Now we have vaccines, why the hell would you need tests?
[03:07:30.360 --> 03:07:34.480]   At that time, like, why the hell do you need tests
[03:07:34.480 --> 03:07:36.080]   when we can be working on vaccines?
[03:07:36.080 --> 03:07:37.720]   It seems like the obvious thing to be working
[03:07:37.720 --> 03:07:40.680]   is the vaccines from their perspective,
[03:07:40.680 --> 03:07:43.160]   but it's not obvious at all to me.
[03:07:43.160 --> 03:07:44.440]   - I think you should have both.
[03:07:44.440 --> 03:07:46.600]   I think have vaccines and good testing,
[03:07:46.600 --> 03:07:48.920]   and that covers you really well
[03:07:48.920 --> 03:07:50.080]   because you're always gonna have people
[03:07:50.080 --> 03:07:52.080]   who don't get vaccinated.
[03:07:52.080 --> 03:07:54.200]   - I don't know if you've been paying attention to this.
[03:07:54.200 --> 03:07:55.720]   There's a guy named Brett Weinstein,
[03:07:55.720 --> 03:07:57.800]   there's a guy named Sam Harris.
[03:07:57.800 --> 03:08:01.480]   They have good representation, I would say,
[03:08:01.480 --> 03:08:06.280]   of two sides of a perspective on vaccines.
[03:08:06.280 --> 03:08:09.680]   So from Sam Harris's perspective,
[03:08:09.680 --> 03:08:13.240]   it's obvious that everybody should get vaccinated
[03:08:13.240 --> 03:08:18.240]   and it's irresponsible to not get vaccinated.
[03:08:18.240 --> 03:08:22.360]   I think he represents a lot of people's belief in that.
[03:08:22.360 --> 03:08:27.360]   And then Brett talks a lot about ivermectin,
[03:08:28.520 --> 03:08:32.680]   but also talks about a hesitancy towards the vaccine
[03:08:32.680 --> 03:08:35.040]   for people who are healthy,
[03:08:35.040 --> 03:08:37.520]   for people who are younger, that kind of thing,
[03:08:37.520 --> 03:08:40.840]   and saying we should consider long-term effects
[03:08:40.840 --> 03:08:45.200]   of the vaccine in making this calculation.
[03:08:45.200 --> 03:08:47.520]   What do you make about this conversation?
[03:08:47.520 --> 03:08:49.400]   Some of it happens on Twitter,
[03:08:49.400 --> 03:08:52.020]   some of it happens in the space of podcasts.
[03:08:52.020 --> 03:08:56.240]   Do you pay attention to this kind of thing?
[03:08:56.240 --> 03:08:58.240]   What's your role in this?
[03:08:58.240 --> 03:09:02.080]   What do you hope is the way to resolve this conversation?
[03:09:02.080 --> 03:09:04.040]   Do you think it's healthy?
[03:09:04.040 --> 03:09:05.740]   - Well, a conversation is always healthy,
[03:09:05.740 --> 03:09:09.280]   but to make definitive statements is not
[03:09:09.280 --> 03:09:11.340]   because it suggests you have information
[03:09:11.340 --> 03:09:12.180]   that you don't have.
[03:09:12.180 --> 03:09:16.880]   So we talked about long-term effects.
[03:09:16.880 --> 03:09:18.680]   I think you need to balance those
[03:09:18.680 --> 03:09:20.960]   versus long-term effects of the disease,
[03:09:20.960 --> 03:09:22.520]   and you can make your decision.
[03:09:22.520 --> 03:09:26.560]   I don't think you need to tell everybody to get vaccinated.
[03:09:26.560 --> 03:09:28.760]   I think you need to present the case.
[03:09:28.760 --> 03:09:30.360]   You say, "Here, we made good vaccines.
[03:09:30.360 --> 03:09:32.200]   "Here's the safety profile.
[03:09:32.200 --> 03:09:34.440]   "Here's the risk-benefit balance,"
[03:09:34.440 --> 03:09:35.320]   and you should decide.
[03:09:35.320 --> 03:09:36.200]   You're a smart person.
[03:09:36.200 --> 03:09:37.920]   You should decide.
[03:09:37.920 --> 03:09:41.280]   Now, companies are gonna do differently, right?
[03:09:41.280 --> 03:09:43.320]   Companies may say, "You have to be vaccinated to work here."
[03:09:43.320 --> 03:09:45.660]   My employer, Columbia, said,
[03:09:45.660 --> 03:09:47.380]   "We have to be vaccinated to work in the fall,
[03:09:47.380 --> 03:09:49.480]   "and if you wanna be a student, you have to be vaccinated."
[03:09:49.480 --> 03:09:52.280]   So you decide whether you wanna go or not.
[03:09:52.280 --> 03:09:57.280]   But the idea that you should make a decision
[03:09:57.280 --> 03:10:02.520]   based on long-term effects, there is no evidence, right?
[03:10:02.520 --> 03:10:05.240]   So how can you make a decision when we don't have evidence,
[03:10:05.240 --> 03:10:06.320]   whereas we do have evidence
[03:10:06.320 --> 03:10:08.480]   that there are long-term effects of getting COVID?
[03:10:08.480 --> 03:10:10.240]   So I don't think that's a fair argument,
[03:10:10.240 --> 03:10:13.680]   and it just makes people scared to say that.
[03:10:13.680 --> 03:10:16.240]   But on the other hand, for someone to say it's a no-brainer
[03:10:16.240 --> 03:10:19.320]   and to denigrate people for not being vaccinated,
[03:10:19.320 --> 03:10:20.440]   that's not the approach either
[03:10:20.440 --> 03:10:23.280]   because they're gonna dig in and say,
[03:10:23.280 --> 03:10:25.720]   "I'm not doing this 'cause you tell me to," right?
[03:10:25.720 --> 03:10:28.640]   I think the middle ground is to say,
[03:10:28.640 --> 03:10:31.640]   take a bit of both and say,
[03:10:31.640 --> 03:10:34.980]   "Here are the potential issues, and here are the benefits,
[03:10:34.980 --> 03:10:37.320]   "and this is what I would do,"
[03:10:37.320 --> 03:10:38.720]   and you have to just decide on your own.
[03:10:38.720 --> 03:10:39.560]   I'd leave it to them.
[03:10:39.560 --> 03:10:40.900]   I say, "You decide, and if you don't want to,
[03:10:40.900 --> 03:10:42.240]   "you know, it's up to you.
[03:10:42.240 --> 03:10:44.440]   "You don't have to get vaccinated.
[03:10:44.440 --> 03:10:46.300]   "And you'll probably get infected at some point,
[03:10:46.300 --> 03:10:47.880]   "and maybe you'll be okay."
[03:10:47.880 --> 03:10:50.080]   (Luke laughs)
[03:10:50.080 --> 03:10:51.640]   But here's the best available data,
[03:10:51.640 --> 03:10:55.800]   and it looks like the vaccines are a pretty damn
[03:10:55.800 --> 03:10:56.780]   smart solution.
[03:10:56.780 --> 03:10:57.620]   They seem to work.
[03:10:57.620 --> 03:11:00.040]   - I think you tell people what you did
[03:11:00.040 --> 03:11:01.920]   and present both sides calmly,
[03:11:01.920 --> 03:11:04.740]   and I think digging in, you know, like in a debate,
[03:11:04.740 --> 03:11:06.960]   I don't think that's terribly useful.
[03:11:06.960 --> 03:11:08.940]   So that's my view.
[03:11:08.940 --> 03:11:11.840]   I mean, people come to me all the time and ask me,
[03:11:11.840 --> 03:11:14.160]   "I'm worried.
[03:11:14.160 --> 03:11:14.980]   "What should I do?"
[03:11:14.980 --> 03:11:16.120]   And I say, "What are you worried about?
[03:11:16.120 --> 03:11:19.020]   "Let's talk about it and go through it calmly."
[03:11:19.020 --> 03:11:20.760]   And if they want to still take ivermectin,
[03:11:20.760 --> 03:11:22.600]   I say, "It's fine, it's your choice.
[03:11:22.600 --> 03:11:23.440]   "I don't have a problem with that."
[03:11:23.440 --> 03:11:25.000]   - I love that.
[03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:26.720]   I love that's the way you think.
[03:11:26.720 --> 03:11:30.420]   People should definitely listen to "This Week in Virology"
[03:11:30.420 --> 03:11:33.000]   and follow your work.
[03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:33.960]   It's brilliant.
[03:11:33.960 --> 03:11:35.800]   I've been really enjoying it lately.
[03:11:35.800 --> 03:11:38.360]   It's like, it's my favorite way to stay in touch
[03:11:38.360 --> 03:11:42.200]   with the happenings of COVID.
[03:11:42.200 --> 03:11:45.560]   Obviously, you put in a lot of other stuff in there, but.
[03:11:45.560 --> 03:11:47.800]   - We used to do other viruses before COVID.
[03:11:47.800 --> 03:11:49.160]   It was quite interesting.
[03:11:49.160 --> 03:11:52.560]   And I'm trying to slip other viruses in
[03:11:52.560 --> 03:11:56.160]   because I think they're informative in many ways,
[03:11:56.160 --> 03:11:57.320]   and we're gonna do more and more of that.
[03:11:57.320 --> 03:11:58.640]   But I have to say, I canceled,
[03:11:58.640 --> 03:12:00.880]   usually I record on Tuesday and Friday,
[03:12:00.880 --> 03:12:02.960]   and I canceled today so I could be with you.
[03:12:02.960 --> 03:12:03.920]   - It's a huge honor.
[03:12:03.920 --> 03:12:05.080]   I appreciate that.
[03:12:05.080 --> 03:12:06.700]   - No, no, it's fine.
[03:12:06.700 --> 03:12:07.920]   I think a couple of other people
[03:12:07.920 --> 03:12:10.260]   were gonna be away anyway, so.
[03:12:10.260 --> 03:12:12.060]   So I do a lot of different pods.
[03:12:12.060 --> 03:12:13.320]   They're all on YouTube.
[03:12:13.320 --> 03:12:17.640]   I also do a live stream on Wednesday nights on YouTube,
[03:12:17.640 --> 03:12:18.520]   which you can find,
[03:12:18.520 --> 03:12:21.400]   and that's where people can come and ask questions.
[03:12:21.400 --> 03:12:22.460]   We don't have an agenda.
[03:12:22.460 --> 03:12:25.320]   We just start, and by 30 minutes in,
[03:12:25.320 --> 03:12:27.480]   there's 700 people with questions
[03:12:27.480 --> 03:12:28.600]   that I can't even get through
[03:12:28.600 --> 03:12:29.600]   'cause there's so many of them.
[03:12:29.600 --> 03:12:33.800]   And I'm actually astounded that so many people
[03:12:33.800 --> 03:12:35.680]   have really good questions.
[03:12:35.680 --> 03:12:37.480]   Most of them are reasonable,
[03:12:37.480 --> 03:12:39.000]   and they come back every week.
[03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:41.900]   So it's a great, it's turning into a great forum
[03:12:41.900 --> 03:12:43.280]   to have a nice discussion.
[03:12:43.280 --> 03:12:46.960]   - And the YouTube channel's called what?
[03:12:46.960 --> 03:12:49.000]   - So you could search for my name,
[03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:50.400]   which is Vincent Draconello.
[03:12:50.400 --> 03:12:51.320]   It'll turn up.
[03:12:51.320 --> 03:12:56.400]   Or my handle on YouTube is profvrr,
[03:12:56.400 --> 03:12:58.060]   P-R-O-F-V-R-R.
[03:12:58.060 --> 03:13:03.080]   - Have you read The Plague by Camus by any chance?
[03:13:03.080 --> 03:13:05.800]   - Years ago, years ago.
[03:13:05.800 --> 03:13:07.180]   I have to read it again.
[03:13:07.180 --> 03:13:08.720]   That's really relevant, yeah.
[03:13:08.720 --> 03:13:10.840]   - Let me sort of ask you a question about it.
[03:13:10.840 --> 03:13:14.000]   It describes a town that's overtaken by a plague,
[03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:16.500]   and it's blocked off from the rest of the world.
[03:13:16.500 --> 03:13:19.480]   And it kind of reveals the best and worst of human nature.
[03:13:19.480 --> 03:13:21.240]   That's like how people respond to that,
[03:13:21.240 --> 03:13:25.120]   sort of the encroaching, their own mortality,
[03:13:25.120 --> 03:13:27.240]   their own death on the horizon.
[03:13:27.240 --> 03:13:28.960]   I think one of the messages in the book
[03:13:28.960 --> 03:13:33.960]   that ultimately, like love for others.
[03:13:33.960 --> 03:13:36.840]   So it's like a lot of people wanna become isolated,
[03:13:36.840 --> 03:13:38.440]   and they hide from each other.
[03:13:38.440 --> 03:13:42.040]   But ultimately the thing that saves you is love,
[03:13:42.040 --> 03:13:44.000]   which is one of the things I've,
[03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:46.360]   just watching this pandemic,
[03:13:46.360 --> 03:13:48.940]   you know, with the distance, with the masks,
[03:13:48.940 --> 03:13:50.560]   that's all fine.
[03:13:50.560 --> 03:13:53.880]   But there's a distancing from people,
[03:13:53.880 --> 03:13:58.300]   of that tension, the breaking of the common humanity
[03:13:58.300 --> 03:13:59.260]   between people.
[03:13:59.260 --> 03:14:00.660]   That's one of the reasons I,
[03:14:00.660 --> 03:14:05.180]   when I came to Austin earlier this year, just to visit,
[03:14:05.180 --> 03:14:06.420]   I fell in love with the city,
[03:14:06.420 --> 03:14:09.020]   because even with the masks and the distance,
[03:14:09.020 --> 03:14:12.340]   there was still a camaraderie,
[03:14:12.340 --> 03:14:15.780]   like, I don't know, just a love for each other,
[03:14:15.780 --> 03:14:18.040]   just a kindness towards each other.
[03:14:18.040 --> 03:14:20.840]   And that's what I took away from the plague.
[03:14:20.840 --> 03:14:23.420]   Mostly it's told the story of the doctor,
[03:14:23.420 --> 03:14:27.020]   who basically gives in,
[03:14:27.020 --> 03:14:30.500]   and just gives himself as a service to others.
[03:14:30.500 --> 03:14:33.000]   And that love is the thing that liberates him
[03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:34.700]   from his own conception of mortality.
[03:14:34.700 --> 03:14:37.940]   The fact that he's here, he's going to die.
[03:14:37.940 --> 03:14:41.780]   What do you think about this, the effect of the virus?
[03:14:41.780 --> 03:14:43.100]   We talked a lot about biology,
[03:14:43.100 --> 03:14:48.100]   but the effect of the virus on the fabric
[03:14:48.100 --> 03:14:50.620]   of the common humanity that connects us.
[03:14:50.620 --> 03:14:54.220]   - That's what a pandemic does.
[03:14:54.220 --> 03:14:56.340]   It really cuts that, right?
[03:14:56.340 --> 03:14:58.500]   'Cause small outbreaks are local,
[03:14:58.500 --> 03:15:00.940]   they don't have global effects.
[03:15:00.940 --> 03:15:03.120]   But when you have something this big,
[03:15:03.120 --> 03:15:07.480]   where pretty much nobody escapes,
[03:15:07.480 --> 03:15:10.260]   and not just making people sick,
[03:15:10.260 --> 03:15:12.500]   it changes your life, right?
[03:15:12.500 --> 03:15:14.620]   People lose jobs, they change jobs,
[03:15:14.620 --> 03:15:16.140]   they move somewhere else.
[03:15:16.140 --> 03:15:20.300]   They have all kinds of disruptions.
[03:15:20.300 --> 03:15:22.100]   Kids can't go to school.
[03:15:22.100 --> 03:15:25.540]   Really shows you, I mean, I always like to say,
[03:15:25.540 --> 03:15:30.300]   a tiny virus can bring earth to its knees.
[03:15:30.300 --> 03:15:31.860]   A tiny virus that you can't even see,
[03:15:31.860 --> 03:15:33.460]   and that most people don't even think about
[03:15:33.460 --> 03:15:34.380]   most of the time.
[03:15:34.380 --> 03:15:37.780]   And the real effect is not just sickness,
[03:15:37.780 --> 03:15:39.260]   it's what it does to people.
[03:15:39.260 --> 03:15:42.860]   Because in the end, we are animals,
[03:15:42.860 --> 03:15:45.340]   and most animals like each other.
[03:15:45.340 --> 03:15:47.640]   And they interact, they have great social structures,
[03:15:47.640 --> 03:15:49.820]   and that makes them do well.
[03:15:49.820 --> 03:15:54.060]   I guess the exception is people in AI, right?
[03:15:54.060 --> 03:15:56.620]   They can be on their own.
[03:15:56.620 --> 03:15:57.900]   - Well, that's why you build robots
[03:15:57.900 --> 03:15:59.020]   that you fall in love with.
[03:15:59.020 --> 03:15:59.860]   - That's right.
[03:15:59.860 --> 03:16:02.020]   And so I think when a,
[03:16:02.020 --> 03:16:06.100]   the real story is what it does to society, for sure.
[03:16:06.100 --> 03:16:08.680]   Which has ramifications way beyond
[03:16:08.680 --> 03:16:10.580]   the number of people dying,
[03:16:10.580 --> 03:16:12.760]   and the vaccines, and the tests, and all of that.
[03:16:12.760 --> 03:16:15.660]   And this one has really made a big rupture.
[03:16:15.660 --> 03:16:17.400]   And you could tell, not now so much,
[03:16:17.400 --> 03:16:18.700]   I think being out and about now,
[03:16:18.700 --> 03:16:21.140]   things look pretty normal,
[03:16:21.140 --> 03:16:23.820]   except for some people wearing masks.
[03:16:23.820 --> 03:16:25.060]   You would never know.
[03:16:25.060 --> 03:16:28.260]   I mean, the airport this morning was completely jammed.
[03:16:28.260 --> 03:16:29.740]   People going, and they're all on vacation,
[03:16:29.740 --> 03:16:31.540]   they're all wearing shorts, right?
[03:16:31.540 --> 03:16:34.380]   So they're back to normal, it's August.
[03:16:34.380 --> 03:16:36.840]   But last year is really different.
[03:16:36.840 --> 03:16:39.660]   In New York, where you're used to lots of people
[03:16:39.660 --> 03:16:41.220]   on the street, it was eerie.
[03:16:41.220 --> 03:16:43.080]   It was just quiet.
[03:16:43.080 --> 03:16:46.060]   But under it all, people are still,
[03:16:46.060 --> 03:16:49.060]   most people help each other when they have to, right?
[03:16:49.060 --> 03:16:52.360]   Most people are willing to,
[03:16:52.360 --> 03:16:53.660]   if something happens to someone,
[03:16:53.660 --> 03:16:55.360]   to reach out and help them.
[03:16:55.360 --> 03:16:58.880]   There are always exceptions where people are meaned,
[03:16:58.880 --> 03:17:01.940]   and that's just the way animals are.
[03:17:01.940 --> 03:17:03.880]   We're not the only ones that can be meaned
[03:17:03.880 --> 03:17:05.780]   to our own species.
[03:17:05.780 --> 03:17:08.740]   But I think most of the motivation
[03:17:08.740 --> 03:17:12.300]   for everything that was done is to help other people.
[03:17:12.300 --> 03:17:15.660]   I mean, I do think that the vaccine manufacturers,
[03:17:15.660 --> 03:17:18.180]   maybe not the leaders, but the people working in the labs,
[03:17:18.180 --> 03:17:21.660]   really wanted to get this out quickly and help people.
[03:17:21.660 --> 03:17:26.420]   I think at every level, people who are contributing
[03:17:26.420 --> 03:17:28.020]   really wanted to help other people,
[03:17:28.020 --> 03:17:30.260]   and feel proud that they're able to do that.
[03:17:30.260 --> 03:17:34.800]   So I view it as, we're never gonna be 100% good
[03:17:35.740 --> 03:17:37.740]   because animals are not.
[03:17:37.740 --> 03:17:40.520]   Evolution made us, I mean, we're lucky.
[03:17:40.520 --> 03:17:42.700]   We somehow rose above by having
[03:17:42.700 --> 03:17:44.200]   incredible brain and so forth.
[03:17:44.200 --> 03:17:47.020]   But a lot of our base instincts are animals.
[03:17:47.020 --> 03:17:50.460]   They chase each other and have alpha males
[03:17:50.460 --> 03:17:51.300]   and all that stuff.
[03:17:51.300 --> 03:17:53.520]   And we always have a little bit of that in us.
[03:17:53.520 --> 03:17:58.520]   But we do have some humanity that this really ripped up.
[03:17:58.520 --> 03:18:00.020]   It really did.
[03:18:00.020 --> 03:18:05.240]   And I think, for me, someone who studied viruses
[03:18:05.240 --> 03:18:07.860]   for over 40 years, it's just amazing
[03:18:07.860 --> 03:18:11.340]   that an invisible thing can do that, right?
[03:18:11.340 --> 03:18:13.420]   - It goes back to the thing you found fascinating,
[03:18:13.420 --> 03:18:15.300]   which is a virus affecting human behavior.
[03:18:15.300 --> 03:18:17.660]   - Yes. - Or behavior of the organism.
[03:18:17.660 --> 03:18:22.960]   - Yes, so humans can make weapons and do harm,
[03:18:22.960 --> 03:18:25.460]   and you can see that, but this you can't even see.
[03:18:25.460 --> 03:18:27.700]   You can't, and look what it has done.
[03:18:27.700 --> 03:18:28.620]   And it'll do it again.
[03:18:28.620 --> 03:18:29.780]   There'll be more.
[03:18:29.780 --> 03:18:32.840]   I just, I wish we would be more prepared,
[03:18:32.840 --> 03:18:34.840]   because we know what to do.
[03:18:34.840 --> 03:18:38.900]   We know we should be making antivirals, vaccines, masks,
[03:18:38.900 --> 03:18:42.140]   testing masks, making test modalities
[03:18:42.140 --> 03:18:46.140]   that we can really quickly redesign.
[03:18:46.140 --> 03:18:49.100]   But after SARS-1, all that went out the door.
[03:18:49.100 --> 03:18:50.200]   People didn't do anything,
[03:18:50.200 --> 03:18:51.900]   and that's why we're in this situation.
[03:18:51.900 --> 03:18:54.860]   So people ask me this all the time.
[03:18:54.860 --> 03:18:57.840]   Are we gonna be ready for the next one?
[03:18:57.840 --> 03:18:59.540]   And I always say, we should be.
[03:18:59.540 --> 03:19:03.040]   We have all the information we need to know what to do.
[03:19:03.040 --> 03:19:05.880]   But somehow, I think people forget.
[03:19:05.880 --> 03:19:12.780]   - That said, sometimes we really step up
[03:19:12.780 --> 03:19:14.860]   when the tragedy is right in front of us.
[03:19:14.860 --> 03:19:16.140]   - We do. - On the catastrophe.
[03:19:16.140 --> 03:19:17.260]   So I don't know.
[03:19:17.260 --> 03:19:18.780]   Somehow humans have still survived.
[03:19:18.780 --> 03:19:21.100]   The fact that we had nuclear weapons for so many decades,
[03:19:21.100 --> 03:19:23.140]   and we still have not blown each other up,
[03:19:23.140 --> 03:19:24.980]   whether by terrorists or by nation,
[03:19:24.980 --> 03:19:27.540]   is quite surprising. - It's amazing.
[03:19:27.540 --> 03:19:30.660]   That's always, after reading the Pentagon Papers,
[03:19:30.660 --> 03:19:32.960]   it's even more amazing, right?
[03:19:32.960 --> 03:19:34.420]   So I don't know how we do it.
[03:19:34.420 --> 03:19:38.560]   I tend to believe there's that,
[03:19:38.560 --> 03:19:42.300]   at the surface, you notice the greed, the corruption,
[03:19:42.300 --> 03:19:45.580]   the evil, but the core of human nature,
[03:19:45.580 --> 03:19:46.980]   of the human spirit is,
[03:19:46.980 --> 03:19:50.840]   one, in the scientific realm, is curiosity,
[03:19:50.840 --> 03:19:54.340]   and more deeply is kindness, compassion,
[03:19:54.340 --> 03:19:56.820]   and wanting to do good for the world.
[03:19:56.820 --> 03:19:59.380]   I believe that desire to do good
[03:19:59.380 --> 03:20:01.060]   outpowers all the other stuff
[03:20:02.160 --> 03:20:04.560]   by a large amount, and that's why we don't,
[03:20:04.560 --> 03:20:06.960]   we have not yet destroyed ourselves.
[03:20:06.960 --> 03:20:08.320]   There's a lot of bickering.
[03:20:08.320 --> 03:20:10.360]   There's a lot of wars on the surface,
[03:20:10.360 --> 03:20:13.140]   but underneath it all, there's this ocean
[03:20:13.140 --> 03:20:16.240]   of love for each other.
[03:20:16.240 --> 03:20:20.020]   I mean, I think there's an evolutionary advantage to that,
[03:20:20.020 --> 03:20:23.640]   and it would be a good explanation
[03:20:23.640 --> 03:20:25.440]   why we still haven't destroyed ourselves.
[03:20:25.440 --> 03:20:27.440]   - God, we had so many opportunities.
[03:20:27.440 --> 03:20:30.540]   If you look at all the wars in history, so many.
[03:20:30.540 --> 03:20:33.360]   I was just, my son was telling me
[03:20:33.360 --> 03:20:35.880]   about the Ottoman Empire, right?
[03:20:35.880 --> 03:20:39.520]   I mean, it's just, you know, war after war,
[03:20:39.520 --> 03:20:42.120]   and then other countries splitting up countries
[03:20:42.120 --> 03:20:45.300]   with no regard to who's living where, right?
[03:20:45.300 --> 03:20:49.440]   It's just, how can these people do this?
[03:20:49.440 --> 03:20:50.840]   - Yeah, it's fascinating.
[03:20:50.840 --> 03:20:52.040]   Human history's fascinating,
[03:20:52.040 --> 03:20:54.600]   and we're still young as a species.
[03:20:54.600 --> 03:20:56.320]   We have a lot-- - Very young, yeah.
[03:20:56.320 --> 03:20:59.120]   - More time to go, and a lot more ways
[03:20:59.120 --> 03:21:00.540]   to destroy ourselves.
[03:21:00.540 --> 03:21:02.240]   Do you have advice, like you said,
[03:21:02.240 --> 03:21:03.880]   you have many decades of research
[03:21:03.880 --> 03:21:06.400]   and an incredible career and life.
[03:21:06.400 --> 03:21:08.060]   Do you have advice for young people
[03:21:08.060 --> 03:21:11.720]   about career, about life, people in high school,
[03:21:11.720 --> 03:21:15.360]   people in college, of how to live a life
[03:21:15.360 --> 03:21:16.460]   they can be proud of?
[03:21:16.460 --> 03:21:20.000]   - So, what I like to do is tell people,
[03:21:20.000 --> 03:21:22.360]   don't plan it, because I didn't plan anything.
[03:21:22.360 --> 03:21:25.000]   Everything I did was one step at a time.
[03:21:25.000 --> 03:21:26.660]   You don't have to plan.
[03:21:26.660 --> 03:21:31.140]   I just found things that were interesting to me.
[03:21:31.140 --> 03:21:33.500]   So, my father was a doctor,
[03:21:33.500 --> 03:21:35.820]   and he wanted me to be a doctor,
[03:21:35.820 --> 03:21:39.100]   but I was not interested in taking care of people.
[03:21:39.100 --> 03:21:43.220]   I learned that, but I couldn't say no to him.
[03:21:43.220 --> 03:21:46.340]   So, I was a biology major in college,
[03:21:46.340 --> 03:21:51.340]   and I graduated, and I didn't have anything to do.
[03:21:51.340 --> 03:21:54.840]   So, I liked science, so I got a job in a lab.
[03:21:56.180 --> 03:22:00.700]   It was very exciting, and that led to everything else
[03:22:00.700 --> 03:22:02.900]   that I've done, one step at a time.
[03:22:02.900 --> 03:22:05.860]   And I think the most important thing you can do,
[03:22:05.860 --> 03:22:06.980]   well, there are two important things.
[03:22:06.980 --> 03:22:08.700]   You can be really curious all the time.
[03:22:08.700 --> 03:22:10.080]   You mentioned curiosity.
[03:22:10.080 --> 03:22:12.060]   I think curiosity is essential.
[03:22:12.060 --> 03:22:15.620]   You have to be curious about everything,
[03:22:15.620 --> 03:22:18.180]   and if you are, you're never gonna be bored.
[03:22:18.180 --> 03:22:20.980]   And so, people who say they're bored,
[03:22:20.980 --> 03:22:22.540]   I say, you are not curious.
[03:22:22.540 --> 03:22:24.220]   You should just think about things
[03:22:24.220 --> 03:22:27.460]   and say, look at something and say, how does that work?
[03:22:27.460 --> 03:22:29.340]   Or what is it doing, and how do they get there?
[03:22:29.340 --> 03:22:30.500]   And you'll never be bored.
[03:22:30.500 --> 03:22:32.900]   And the other thing is when you find something,
[03:22:32.900 --> 03:22:35.360]   which may take time, it's fine.
[03:22:35.360 --> 03:22:38.580]   You have to be passionate about it.
[03:22:38.580 --> 03:22:40.900]   You have to put everything into it,
[03:22:40.900 --> 03:22:42.980]   and that's what I did with viruses.
[03:22:42.980 --> 03:22:47.980]   So, I think they're amazing, and I tell my classes,
[03:22:47.980 --> 03:22:51.220]   I love viruses.
[03:22:51.220 --> 03:22:53.140]   They're amazing, and people think I'm morbid
[03:22:53.140 --> 03:22:55.340]   because obviously they kill people,
[03:22:55.340 --> 03:22:56.580]   and I shouldn't love something.
[03:22:56.580 --> 03:22:57.500]   But that's not the point.
[03:22:57.500 --> 03:22:58.340]   That's not what I mean.
[03:22:58.340 --> 03:23:00.540]   I love them in the way they have emerged
[03:23:00.540 --> 03:23:03.120]   and how they work and so forth
[03:23:03.120 --> 03:23:04.300]   and all that we don't know about them.
[03:23:04.300 --> 03:23:06.300]   So, you need to be curious and passionate
[03:23:06.300 --> 03:23:07.760]   and don't plan too much.
[03:23:07.760 --> 03:23:11.060]   And just find something that you don't call a job.
[03:23:11.060 --> 03:23:14.580]   As someone said on the livestream last week,
[03:23:14.580 --> 03:23:17.380]   I wish I had a job I liked as much as you.
[03:23:17.380 --> 03:23:18.460]   I said, it's not a job.
[03:23:18.460 --> 03:23:20.420]   I never looked at it as a job.
[03:23:20.420 --> 03:23:23.740]   It's my vocation, it's my passion.
[03:23:23.740 --> 03:23:25.940]   If it's a job, then you're not gonna like it.
[03:23:25.940 --> 03:23:28.420]   - Yeah, something that doesn't feel like a job.
[03:23:28.420 --> 03:23:33.020]   So, you said viruses are kind of passive,
[03:23:33.020 --> 03:23:38.540]   non-living, you could say, or even cells are passive.
[03:23:38.540 --> 03:23:39.900]   And humans are kind of active.
[03:23:39.900 --> 03:23:42.340]   We seem to be making our own decisions.
[03:23:42.340 --> 03:23:44.780]   So, let me ask you the why question.
[03:23:44.780 --> 03:23:47.620]   What do you think is the meaning of this life of ours?
[03:23:48.820 --> 03:23:51.380]   - Oh, there's no meaning, it just happened.
[03:23:51.380 --> 03:23:52.320]   It's an accident.
[03:23:52.320 --> 03:23:55.100]   I think there's no life elsewhere
[03:23:55.100 --> 03:23:57.380]   because this is just a rare accident that happened
[03:23:57.380 --> 03:23:58.740]   in the right conditions.
[03:23:58.740 --> 03:24:00.360]   I mean, people all think I'm wrong
[03:24:00.360 --> 03:24:01.780]   because there are billions and billions
[03:24:01.780 --> 03:24:02.940]   of stars out there, right?
[03:24:02.940 --> 03:24:05.220]   So, there's a lot of opportunity.
[03:24:05.220 --> 03:24:06.340]   There's no meaning.
[03:24:06.340 --> 03:24:10.580]   It's just, what do they call it?
[03:24:10.580 --> 03:24:13.340]   A perfect storm of events that led
[03:24:13.340 --> 03:24:15.840]   to molecules being formed and eventually,
[03:24:15.840 --> 03:24:19.960]   I mean, it took a long time for life to evolve, right?
[03:24:19.960 --> 03:24:24.080]   But it's just driven by conditions.
[03:24:24.080 --> 03:24:25.600]   If something emerged that worked,
[03:24:25.600 --> 03:24:27.040]   it would then go on to the next step.
[03:24:27.040 --> 03:24:29.200]   There's no meaning other than that.
[03:24:29.200 --> 03:24:31.160]   The only difference is that we,
[03:24:31.160 --> 03:24:34.120]   and I think many other animals can probably,
[03:24:34.120 --> 03:24:36.080]   we have the ability, we're sentient, right?
[03:24:36.080 --> 03:24:38.280]   We can influence what happens to us.
[03:24:38.280 --> 03:24:41.480]   We can take medicines, right?
[03:24:41.480 --> 03:24:44.480]   We can alter what would normally happen to us
[03:24:44.480 --> 03:24:47.880]   so we can remove some of the selection pressure.
[03:24:47.880 --> 03:24:52.720]   But I think everything else on the planet just goes,
[03:24:52.720 --> 03:24:55.160]   looks for food and give a lot of offspring
[03:24:55.160 --> 03:24:56.240]   so you can perpetuate.
[03:24:56.240 --> 03:24:58.720]   It's just a natural biological function.
[03:24:58.720 --> 03:25:01.960]   - Yeah, they're much more directly concerned with survival.
[03:25:01.960 --> 03:25:04.640]   I think humans are able to contemplate their mortality.
[03:25:04.640 --> 03:25:08.500]   We can see that even if we're okay today,
[03:25:08.500 --> 03:25:10.320]   we're eventually going to die
[03:25:10.320 --> 03:25:13.040]   and we really don't like that.
[03:25:13.040 --> 03:25:14.400]   So we try to come up with ways
[03:25:14.400 --> 03:25:17.040]   to push that deadline farther and farther away.
[03:25:17.040 --> 03:25:18.440]   - Well, we have really,
[03:25:18.440 --> 03:25:20.440]   I mean, we used to die in our 30s, right?
[03:25:20.440 --> 03:25:22.040]   Now it's 70s, 80s.
[03:25:22.040 --> 03:25:26.120]   - Well, most of us used to die in the first few weeks.
[03:25:26.120 --> 03:25:27.260]   - That's true.
[03:25:27.260 --> 03:25:29.120]   Yeah, infant death.
[03:25:29.120 --> 03:25:31.980]   I always tell people the only thing
[03:25:31.980 --> 03:25:34.280]   that's 100% is death.
[03:25:34.280 --> 03:25:36.280]   It's the only thing in the world that's 100.
[03:25:36.280 --> 03:25:37.720]   - Do you think about your own mortality?
[03:25:37.720 --> 03:25:39.040]   - No, I never think about it.
[03:25:39.040 --> 03:25:42.200]   I'm just enjoying day to day and I don't think about it.
[03:25:42.200 --> 03:25:43.040]   - Really?
[03:25:43.040 --> 03:25:44.200]   You work on viruses,
[03:25:44.200 --> 03:25:47.600]   you don't contemplate your own mortality
[03:25:47.600 --> 03:25:51.760]   given the deadliness of the viruses around us?
[03:25:51.760 --> 03:25:53.600]   - I never thought COVID would kill me.
[03:25:53.600 --> 03:25:56.280]   No, I never was afraid of that, not at all.
[03:25:56.280 --> 03:26:00.400]   I mostly feared for other people getting sick,
[03:26:00.400 --> 03:26:02.160]   especially people who could die.
[03:26:02.160 --> 03:26:03.640]   I didn't want that to happen to them.
[03:26:03.640 --> 03:26:04.920]   But I always thought that,
[03:26:04.920 --> 03:26:10.760]   it's obviously not a realistic viewpoint not to be worried
[03:26:11.800 --> 03:26:13.920]   because many people are.
[03:26:13.920 --> 03:26:16.120]   But I've been relatively healthy.
[03:26:16.120 --> 03:26:18.520]   They should sequence my genome
[03:26:18.520 --> 03:26:21.360]   because it works really well and I have a good immune system.
[03:26:21.360 --> 03:26:24.160]   - Maybe you'd be the first immortal person.
[03:26:24.160 --> 03:26:25.920]   - I don't think so. - There's gotta be a first.
[03:26:25.920 --> 03:26:27.200]   - I don't think so.
[03:26:27.200 --> 03:26:31.280]   I think that biologically you just can't,
[03:26:31.280 --> 03:26:33.420]   the ends of our chromosomes keep getting shorter
[03:26:33.420 --> 03:26:36.200]   and shorter and that's eventually what kills us.
[03:26:36.200 --> 03:26:39.680]   So you just can't keep going on.
[03:26:39.680 --> 03:26:42.280]   But that's fine, I don't need to.
[03:26:42.280 --> 03:26:43.760]   I understand from the vampires
[03:26:43.760 --> 03:26:45.560]   that it's not good to live forever.
[03:26:45.560 --> 03:26:50.440]   - I guess make the most of the time you got.
[03:26:50.440 --> 03:26:53.240]   That's the, bacteria live a much shorter time
[03:26:53.240 --> 03:26:55.160]   so we got that on bacteria.
[03:26:55.160 --> 03:27:00.160]   - Bacteria are just little bags of chemicals that split.
[03:27:00.160 --> 03:27:05.160]   So they have no stake in the matter at all.
[03:27:05.160 --> 03:27:08.240]   I think you have to go a long ways
[03:27:08.240 --> 03:27:13.000]   before you get into some kind of consciousness.
[03:27:13.000 --> 03:27:15.480]   - Yeah, it's weird that this bag of chemicals
[03:27:15.480 --> 03:27:17.080]   has a stake in the matter.
[03:27:17.080 --> 03:27:21.400]   Like our human body is, consciousness is a weird thing.
[03:27:21.400 --> 03:27:23.560]   - Not just in us, but they make half of the oxygen
[03:27:23.560 --> 03:27:26.400]   on the planet, 20% of the oxygen comes from bacteria.
[03:27:26.400 --> 03:27:29.940]   And they made, in the beginning of Earth,
[03:27:29.940 --> 03:27:34.120]   they made enough oxygen to start oxygenation going,
[03:27:34.120 --> 03:27:36.560]   life going, I mean, they have an incredible role.
[03:27:36.560 --> 03:27:38.400]   It's all an accident, just happened.
[03:27:38.400 --> 03:27:44.680]   - Well, Vincent, like I told you, I'm a huge fan.
[03:27:44.680 --> 03:27:47.080]   It's a big honor that you were talking with me today.
[03:27:47.080 --> 03:27:48.440]   Thank you so much for coming down.
[03:27:48.440 --> 03:27:50.640]   Thank you for spending so much time with me.
[03:27:50.640 --> 03:27:53.040]   And thank you for everything you do
[03:27:53.040 --> 03:27:54.920]   in terms of educating about viruses,
[03:27:54.920 --> 03:27:57.320]   about biology, microbiology and everything else.
[03:27:57.320 --> 03:27:59.160]   I can't wait, everybody should check out
[03:27:59.160 --> 03:28:01.920]   Vincent's YouTube, watch his lectures,
[03:28:01.920 --> 03:28:05.080]   listen to the podcast, it's truly incredible.
[03:28:05.080 --> 03:28:06.800]   Thank you so much for talking to me, Vincent.
[03:28:06.800 --> 03:28:08.260]   - My pleasure.
[03:28:08.260 --> 03:28:10.240]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:28:10.240 --> 03:28:12.280]   with Vincent Recaniello.

[03:28:16.580 --> 03:28:18.760]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[03:28:18.760 --> 03:28:21.000]   from Isaac Asimov.
[03:28:21.000 --> 03:28:23.160]   The saddest aspect of life right now
[03:28:23.160 --> 03:28:25.420]   is that science gathers knowledge
[03:28:25.420 --> 03:28:27.760]   faster than society gathers wisdom.
[03:28:27.760 --> 03:28:31.520]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[03:28:31.520 --> 03:28:34.100]   (upbeat music)
[03:28:34.100 --> 03:28:36.680]   (upbeat music)
