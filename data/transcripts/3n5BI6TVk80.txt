[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480]   So that's what we lose in a normal schedule.
[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.380]   A lot less deep work, a lot longer working hours,
[00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.960]   and just a lot more grinding organizational skill required
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.120]   even to just sort of get through the day, which is draining.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.780]   And what do we gain from that?
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.440]   Less visible productivity,
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.400]   in the sense of producing things that the world notices
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.200]   and would assess as being valuable.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.400]   I'm Kyle Newport, and this is Deep Questions, episode 228.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:44.080]   This is the show where I answer questions from my audience
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.240]   and give advice about the challenge of cultivating
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.240]   a deep life in a world increasingly beset by distractions.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.520]   Now I'm here as always in my deep work HQ.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.800]   I'm joined by my producer, Jesse.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.640]   Jesse, I just did the math.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.000]   This episode's coming out, what, the day after Christmas?
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.840]   - Yeah.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.680]   - It's our holiday episode.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.860]   - Holiday episode.
[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.000]   - We should have brought in Christmas lights.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.480]   I had that idea, by the way.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.240]   I was gonna decorate the HQ, and then I didn't.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.060]   But it was my idea.
[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.200]   I was gonna bring in some lights and do whatever,
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.820]   and then life happened.
[00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.520]   - The last time we had props, we brought the skeleton.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.320]   - Yeah, so Halloween got a skeleton.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.760]   We should have done this in Santa hats.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.960]   I apologize, this is me dropping the ball.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.600]   I honestly didn't really, I've lost track of time.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.600]   We're sort of just barreling through December.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.480]   My family, there's a lot going on.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.400]   I'm dealing with each thing as we get there.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.400]   So it didn't really occur to me,
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.520]   we're recording this a week in advance more or less,
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.520]   that like, oh, this is actually the holiday episode.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.060]   You know, I did a survey.
[00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.120]   You might be surprised by the answer.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.560]   I surveyed our listeners to find out what holidays
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.540]   do they celebrate during this period?
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.200]   Number one response, Festivus.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.920]   - Really?
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.740]   - No.
[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.580]   (laughing)
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.420]   Made that up.
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.120]   I just wanted to air grievances later in the episode.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.680]   I did not, I did not, I did not interview them on that.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.880]   All right, we've got a good, simple show today
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.200]   in honor of the holidays.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.640]   One deep dive, which you will see is tangentially
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.840]   connected to the current season.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.660]   Five questions, carefully selected,
[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.480]   a mix of questions about the struggle
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.900]   to find more depth in your work
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.720]   and questions about finding more depth
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.560]   in your life outside of work.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.320]   We got a good mix, followed by our favorite final segment,
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.360]   three interesting things.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.760]   I have three interesting things sent to me
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.160]   from around the internet in recent weeks,
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.080]   all about the struggle to live deeply.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.720]   All right, that is the show.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.800]   I want to mention a brief experiment going on
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.040]   over at the YouTube channel,
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.260]   youtube.com/CalNewportMedia.
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.320]   In addition to the videos of this podcast,
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.480]   I launched an experimental video with friend of the show,
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.520]   an old friend of mine, comedian, Jamie Kilstein.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.720]   We did a pilot episode of a show we're calling
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.380]   Jamie and Cal Explain the Internet.
[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.180]   The short premise is, I don't use social media,
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.800]   so I know very little about what's happening on the internet.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.640]   Jamie is, as you've heard from his interviews on this show,
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.240]   is working really hard to be disconnected from social media,
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.880]   so he also doesn't really know what's going on right now
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.760]   in the internet.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.800]   So we are the two worst people in the world
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.560]   to ask to explain contemporary internet trends,
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.420]   and that is exactly what we do.
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.000]   So we take five trending ideas, memes, tweets,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.020]   TikToks, et cetera, from the week in the internet,
[00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.280]   and we struggle to explain them.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.360]   What's the idea behind the show?
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.920]   Well, A, I just thought that'd be funny,
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.600]   me trying to explain TikTok,
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.560]   but there's an underlying actual motivation here,
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.980]   which is when you are immersed in internet culture,
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.200]   it seems totalizing.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.400]   Like, this is the world,
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.200]   this is all that matters in the world,
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.400]   everyone in the world is equally as invested
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.000]   in what's going on in this internet world,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.040]   and that can be a problem,
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.560]   because often what's happening in internet culture
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.400]   can be distressing, it can be outraging,
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.160]   it can be depressing,
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.500]   it can be nerve-wracking or anxiety-producing.
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.960]   And so I think there's some benefit, perhaps,
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.680]   to see a show that others internet culture.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.760]   So you have people from the outside
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.720]   struggling to understand it, and yeah, it's funny,
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.960]   but it also, I hope, also sends the message of,
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.780]   look, a lot of this stuff is kinda arbitrary.
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.520]   This is not real life,
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.720]   this is not everything that's happening in the world.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.180]   It only feels that way if you're in it.
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.200]   Just look at these two idiots
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.640]   who don't know anything about it,
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.480]   see how mysterious this is to their eyes,
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.880]   that's what this looks like to most of the world.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.120]   So hopefully there'll be some relief to be gained
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.300]   from those who feel too engaged in internet culture.
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.720]   So that's a Jamie, or Cal and Jamie explain the internet.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.560]   It's an experiment.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.000]   We might try a few episodes,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.440]   see if we like it, see if you like it,
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.560]   but there is at least one up there
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.840]   if you wanna check it out.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.520]   All right, and with that, I think we're ready to jump in.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.120]   I wanna start with a deep dive.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.920]   I'm gonna call this a world without busyness.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.940]   It is inspired by the holiday break
[00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.160]   that especially in the American context,
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.600]   most workers get the week between Christmas and New Year's.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.340]   So we have the holiday break just started
[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.640]   when you're listening to this podcast.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.220]   I wanna talk about the week before.
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.560]   The week before the holiday break.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.320]   That is the week that I'm in right now as I record this.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.040]   For me, as for a lot of people,
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.720]   the week before this break is a really nice week of work.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.800]   And the reason is is because it's 40% less busy
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.040]   than a typical work week
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.360]   as people are getting ready for the holidays,
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.760]   people aren't starting new initiatives,
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.760]   people aren't scheduling as many meetings.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.060]   This is particularly true in the academic context
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.200]   where I work, the semester is over
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.380]   and people will wait till the new year
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.400]   to really get things ramped up.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.740]   So it's like an easier week.
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:08.800]   You're still working,
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.540]   but the work doesn't seem as onerous.
[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.900]   So what I have here, I'm gonna switch to the tablet.
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.200]   So for those who are watching this on YouTube,
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.940]   you're gonna see me drawing on the screen here.
[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.760]   I have a very crudely drawn calendar.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.500]   Those who are listening,
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.000]   you can imagine this being expertly drafted
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.200]   with beautiful penmanship and straight lines.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.140]   Those who are watching online know that's not the case.
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.080]   I have Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.380]   just sort of blocked out here on this calendar.
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.600]   And what I wanted to do is roughly block out
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.060]   what my week looks like this week.
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.700]   And I have three categories here.
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.120]   Deep work, admin, and appointment.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.220]   So things that are sort of scheduled on the calendar
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.660]   that you have to go and go somewhere else.
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.460]   So this week, and I looked at my calendar this morning,
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.080]   so this is pretty accurate.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.220]   Most mornings, Monday through Thursday,
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.060]   actually every morning this week, not most, every morning,
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.660]   I can just write in the morning.
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.540]   So I'm blocking that off for deep work.
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.620]   I'm only doing this if you're listening,
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.620]   Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
[00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.980]   Friday, we're leaving to go visit my parents.
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.060]   So we're not doing any work at all.
[00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.140]   So we're gonna cross that off, no work on Friday.
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.900]   So we've got four days.
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:26.200]   Can do deep work every morning, working on, I'm writing.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.220]   All right, most afternoons,
[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.300]   I can put Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.220]   plenty of time to do another deep work session.
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.220]   So I'm blocking that off on my calendar.
[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.740]   And for me this week, that's gonna be largely,
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.520]   I'm working on a particular new proof
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.140]   for a computer science paper,
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.300]   something I'm working on with some collaborators.
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.380]   All right, what about appointments?
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.260]   So these are scheduled things.
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:54.340]   Well, because it's a week before a break, it's pretty light.
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.320]   It's basically today.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.140]   So I'm blocking off most of Monday.
[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.580]   And most of my appointments today
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.420]   are what I'm doing right now.
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.660]   I'm podcasting, I'm at the studio,
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.500]   I'm podcasting some other things I wanna get done.
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.220]   And I'm gonna put a little sliver of deep work
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.060]   'cause I do wanna finish
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.040]   until Jesse has a little more writing I wanna do
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.340]   because I had to cut it short this morning.
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.900]   All right, and then on most other days,
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.220]   there's a little bit of admin work.
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.060]   If I do 30 to 60 minutes,
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:26.820]   most of these on Tuesday, on Wednesday and Thursday,
[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.260]   that is enough to keep on top of things
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.000]   that are coming via email, things on my calendar,
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:31.840]   things that need to get done.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.000]   There's still a little detail that I have to get done.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.780]   I have a doctoral student who's defending a dissertation
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.180]   pretty soon after the break, for example,
[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.560]   there's some paperwork to be filed.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.260]   There's a web designer working on an update to our website.
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.460]   I have a couple of things to send her.
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:49.460]   So about 30 to 60 minutes on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.900]   will keep me very much on top of administrative work,
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.020]   email requests, et cetera.
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.160]   So here we have a calendar that if you're looking online,
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.220]   you'll see deep work every morning,
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.700]   Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.220]   is sort of modest admin block.
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.940]   And then another deep work session in the afternoon,
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.100]   space in between, plenty of breathing room,
[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.380]   go for a walk, whatever.
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.900]   These days can all end at three or four o'clock.
[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.260]   Monday is the one day where I have sort of appointments
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.880]   during the day after a morning deep work session,
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.940]   I'm not even working on Friday.
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.540]   And that's my holiday schedule.
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:23.420]   Now here's the thought experiment I want you to follow.
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.680]   What if this was my schedule every week?
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.180]   Right?
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:33.500]   What would happen to my observable productivity
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.740]   if I had more or less a schedule like this every week?
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.660]   Two deep work sessions a day,
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.980]   30 to 60 minutes admin, one day with appointments,
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.040]   and on a regular basis,
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.280]   maybe an entire day just taken off to do other things.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.660]   I would argue that my visible productivity
[00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.080]   and the things that people at the scale of years
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.740]   would notice about me, which is books, academic articles,
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.700]   New Yorker articles, and this podcast.
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.520]   The big visible things that define my impact.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.940]   That productivity would not only be preserved
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.900]   with this schedule, it would almost certainly be increased.
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.980]   More articles, books at a faster rate,
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.780]   higher quality probably for this podcast,
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.780]   just because of the more than enough time
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:13.740]   to work on these things,
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.180]   consistency working on these things,
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.940]   and more than enough time for the mind to refract
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.820]   and reconfigure between things.
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.760]   I would probably be more productive.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.780]   I think a lot of people would have a similar conclusion
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.420]   that if they could take the pre-holiday week schedule
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.180]   and do that every week of the year,
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.420]   their observable important productivity
[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.300]   would not diminish.
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.300]   If anything, it would probably increase.
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:41.140]   Now let's compare this to a normal week.
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.780]   Let's grab a week in mid-January.
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.300]   What goes wrong with this sort of
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.180]   pre-holiday week schedule I put down here?
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.520]   Well, there's two things that change.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.940]   One, the number of appointments would rapidly increase.
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.700]   The idea that I've just consolidated them
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:58.580]   for the half a day on one day would be unrealistic
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.580]   under my normal scheduling demands.
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.500]   So there would be, I would say,
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.980]   three to four, at least three to four
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.260]   other non-trivial appointments
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.380]   scattered throughout these days.
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.860]   I would also say these admin blocks
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.260]   would have to double or sometimes triple in length.
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.820]   There's just way more things pulling at my attention
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.260]   that I have to do that are time-consuming.
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.900]   So now maybe I need on average two hours a day of admin.
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.540]   So you expand the admin,
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.820]   you throw in a lot more of these appointments,
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.500]   and maybe you can preserve, let's say,
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.620]   the morning deep work session,
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.340]   but what you really lose is two things.
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.620]   A, a lot of those afternoon deep work sessions go away,
[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.980]   and the length of your workday increases.
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.340]   When I'm in my normal schedule,
[00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.900]   the only way to actually make that all work
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.580]   is I have to also aggressively time block plan
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.580]   just to try to make every piece fit.
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.580]   I have to combine that with a weekly plan
[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.660]   and a strategic plan to try to make everything fit.
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:50.880]   In this holiday schedule that's on, that I drew on the screen,
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.060]   I don't even have to be that on my game,
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.420]   productivity speaking.
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.020]   It's a pretty simple schedule.
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.980]   I work, take my time, do some admin,
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:59.180]   go for a breather, do a little more work.
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.020]   I'm done.
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.980]   So that's what we lose in a normal schedule.
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.900]   A lot less deep work, a lot longer working hours,
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.460]   and just a lot more grinding organizational skill required
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.620]   even to just sort of get through the day, which is draining.
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.320]   And what do we gain from that?
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.920]   Less visible productivity,
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.900]   in the sense of producing things that the world notices
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.380]   and would assess as being valuable.
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.580]   That actually goes down.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.380]   So in some sense, this is my question
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.000]   in this holiday period.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.320]   And this is, I would say, probably the question
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.660]   in knowledge, work, productivity,
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.000]   the one that we're not answering,
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.660]   the one that we're ignoring to instead focus on the minutiae.
[00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:43.360]   Well, is Slack more efficient than email?
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.960]   What's our rules around setting up meetings?
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.520]   Are you a bullet journal person or a time block planner?
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:53.280]   As we look at the particular leaves on the trees,
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.480]   we're missing the outline of the whole forest.
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.040]   And this is the question that we're not asking,
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.760]   but I think we should.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.000]   Why don't we have every week
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.640]   be like the week before the holiday break?
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.560]   What is preventing us from doing it?
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.580]   What would we have to change to make that the standard?
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:13.320]   And if we did, would our organizations, our universities,
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.620]   our companies, our small entrepreneurial endeavors,
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.500]   would they fall apart?
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.680]   Or would they actually become better at what they do?
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.360]   That's the question we should be asking.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.720]   So I thought I would pose it to you, my audience,
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.580]   because you have a week to actually think about it.
[00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:30.080]   - Is there a reason why you draw
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.180]   the morning blocks on the bottom?
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:36.580]   - Yeah, that's an interesting question.
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:41.580]   That matches, I have kind of reversed it, haven't I?
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.200]   - I just didn't know if there was some.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.200]   - Yeah, 'cause in my time block planner, I go down.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.960]   In Google Calendar, time also goes down.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.840]   And yet in my mind, I think this is interesting.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.720]   When I visualize my schedule in my mind,
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.040]   I think about time moving upwards.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.120]   Yeah, so this is, if you're watching this on the YouTube,
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:06.160]   you'll see an interesting artifact of the way my mind works.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.080]   My mind visualizes schedules as time moving up.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.280]   - Yeah, you're climbing a ladder.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.240]   - You're climbing the ladder,
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.840]   you're piling things on top of each other.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.640]   That's an interesting observation.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.160]   Yeah, so maybe I'll label this.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.600]   All right, for those who are watching,
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.940]   I'm gonna add an expository label here.
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:26.840]   Let's do, I'll put like 9 a.m. at the bottom.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:31.640]   And then I'll make the very top here like 4 p.m.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.560]   This is my ideal schedule.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.360]   Now I can't complain because I actually get to do this
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.760]   during the summer, every year.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.320]   So I get my taste of this.
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.240]   So it's not just the week before.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.960]   For most people, it's like just one or two weeks
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:45.800]   or this is true.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.680]   I get this all summer, this schedule.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.120]   And I love this schedule.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.600]   - So in the evenings, you'll read
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.440]   or before nine o'clock, you'll read a little bit?
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.120]   - Yeah, I mean, it's kids.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.120]   Well, it's exercise, kids, other stuff, kids.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.000]   So it's family stuff.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.920]   - People would probably be curious about
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.600]   when you read your five books on that schedule.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:12.400]   - So typically, if I'm up, I'm reading in the morning.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.360]   Like this morning, I was up.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.920]   So I read in the morning, I read in bed.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:18.880]   And then yeah, we put together,
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.240]   we do reading sessions in the evening.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:25.240]   So now if I, usually at least one of my books
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.320]   will be for work.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.000]   Like I need it for a New Yorker article
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:28.840]   or something like that.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.960]   And because that's work, for those, I'll put aside time.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.840]   You know, hey, this is what I'm gonna do in the afternoon.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.080]   You know, I'm gonna put aside an hour here,
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:36.920]   an hour there.
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.320]   We'll see.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.080]   Did we talk about Thriller December last week?
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:41.920]   We did, right?
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:42.760]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.000]   Okay, so hopefully people, this is your week.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.240]   The week that you're off is the week
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.120]   to really make progress on Thriller December.
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.080]   So hopefully people are going well.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.160]   I'm three thrillers deep now.
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.960]   I'm now reading, I added to my list.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.280]   I went back, I aborted from one thriller.
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.440]   I'll talk about that when we do our reading roundup
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.280]   next month.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.840]   I was like, okay, I gotta get the bad taste out of my mouth.
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.160]   So I went back and I'm reading Robin Cook's
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.840]   original novel, "Coma" from 1976.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.120]   Invented the medical.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.600]   He says it invented the medical thriller genre.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.080]   Like him and Crichton might argue about that,
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.360]   but it's really good.
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.160]   It's really good.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.840]   They haven't even got to the thrillery parts yet.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.600]   It's like third year med students
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.640]   at Boston Memorial Hospital.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.800]   And there's two cases in a row
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:32.240]   of young, healthy patients going in for surgery
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.840]   and something happens during the surgery
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.520]   and they get brain dead.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.600]   And you're starting to realize,
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.280]   I think it, but so Cook gets into the details
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.520]   of all the, the science of, of how anesthesia works.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.440]   And so it's like brings you into the hospital world.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.080]   It's like ER in a book.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.560]   You're starting to realize like there's something
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.120]   going afoul here.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.400]   I think someone's organs are being harvested
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.520]   and it's cool.
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.360]   I'm enjoying it.
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.200]   All right.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.040]   Anyways, thriller of December.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.200]   You got one more week, read.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.080]   All right.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.400]   We got a good collection of questions to dive into.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.880]   Before we do, I want to briefly mention
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.800]   one of the sponsors that makes
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.120]   the Deep Questions podcast possible.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.600]   That is our friends at WREN,
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.080]   W R E N, which is a startup that's making it easy
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:17.040]   for everyone to make a meaningful difference
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.360]   in the climate crisis.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.720]   So the way the website works now
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.720]   is they're focused on monthly subscriptions
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.200]   where you calculate your carbon footprint,
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.760]   then offset it by supporting awesome climate projects
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.400]   that plant trees, protect rainforces
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.400]   and remove CO2 from the sky.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.400]   So you can actually offset the carbon footprint
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:38.160]   that you are generating elsewhere in your life.
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.240]   Now, the idea behind this,
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.840]   why I think this is an interesting strategy
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.800]   is that it lowers the barrier of entry to do something.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.560]   As we learn in almost any type of endeavor,
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.440]   the best way to do something big
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.480]   is to start with something small.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.680]   You have to break that barrier.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.080]   That step from I'm doing nothing
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.320]   to I'm doing something is the key step.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.560]   Now, once you're in the mindset of like,
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:00.840]   oh, I'm already doing something
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.440]   about this issue I care about,
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.200]   now you're more open to doing more things.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:09.200]   It's the gateway drug into more effective action.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.000]   Now, I think that's important, especially right now.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.040]   Like one of the things I've noticed,
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.920]   if you'll excuse a little cultural commentary,
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:19.720]   especially in sort of a place like suburban DC,
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:25.080]   there's this list of sort of approved things you can do
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.200]   to help with something like climate change
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.680]   that tend to have big price tags,
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.880]   which is fine if you can do it.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.760]   And I'm talking about like solar installations
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:33.960]   or buying expensive electric cars.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.000]   If you can do that, great.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.720]   But for people who don't have that budget,
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.160]   it can make them be in a situation
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.760]   where they feel like, well, then I can't do anything.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:40.960]   So I'm just gonna turn that off.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.520]   I can't afford a Tesla.
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.000]   So I guess this is not for me.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.320]   That's why I like something like REN.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.160]   It's an entry point where you don't have to buy a Tesla
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.200]   or cover your whole roof in solar panels
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.120]   to feel like at least you're starting.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.520]   And you can break that seal.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.840]   So I'm glad, I think it's from a social psych perspective,
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.480]   it's an interesting idea.
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.800]   So sign up for REN is an easy way
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:03.400]   to do something meaningful about the climate crisis.
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.240]   So it's gonna take all of us to end the climate crisis.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.720]   Do your part today by signing up for REN.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.320]   Go to ren.co/deep, sign up,
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.000]   and they will plant 10 extra trees in your name.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.800]   That's W-R-E-N.co/deep.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.080]   Start making a difference.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.240]   I only mentioned the solar panels
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.880]   because my neighbor's putting them on today.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.840]   I was hearing the hammering.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.440]   So that's why it's on my mind.
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.120]   - He's got a great roof for it too.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.120]   We have a terrible roof for solar panels.
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:33.080]   - Really? - I mean, you've seen my house.
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.160]   It's like straight up.
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.080]   And then these like Victorian weirdnesses,
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.880]   you know, all angles or whatever.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:45.880]   But my neighbor has like a, from a big flat South facing,
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.440]   you know, fill that thing up and electricity
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.240]   is gonna electricity is gonna flow.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.560]   The rest of us will have to do with REN.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.640]   I also wanna talk about my friends at ZocDoc.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.480]   ZocDoc is the only free app that lets you find
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.360]   and book doctors who are patient reviewed,
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.400]   take your insurance and are available when you need them
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.280]   to treat almost every condition under the sun.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.280]   I don't know if you know this, Jesse,
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.560]   but people have been getting sick in recent years.
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.920]   - Yeah. - Stuff going around.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.280]   Do you know about this?
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.040]   - Heard about it. - Yeah.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.760]   So people, especially younger people are saying,
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.000]   I need a doctor and then wondering,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.480]   well, how do I find a doctor?
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.240]   Like, do I go to the yellow pages?
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.960]   Do I, you know, ask friends?
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.000]   You do, but then you don't know,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.360]   like, are they taking patients?
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.920]   Do they like this person?
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.360]   ZocDoc makes it simple.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.360]   It says, okay, here's doctors.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.200]   What do you wanna look for?
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.920]   Your area, this specialty, take this insurance,
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.920]   has openings, boom, here's the list.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.160]   Okay, now let me look at patient reviews
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.400]   of each of these doctors to see what's going on.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.800]   Does this one have a really long wait?
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:46.640]   Is there something fishy?
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.480]   Is this one great?
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.320]   People love them.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.320]   It just makes it easy to get signed up
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.200]   for the medical care that you need.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.240]   As I've talked about before,
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.880]   I have now two different healthcare providers
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.240]   who use ZocDoc, my primary care physician,
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.720]   and my dentist.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.720]   So in addition to helping me identify these providers,
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.920]   it also makes it simple to do,
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.920]   let's say, the intake paperwork.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.760]   I can check in online ahead of time,
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.240]   so it makes the experience great.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.680]   So I'm a big ZocDoc fan.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.840]   95% because of all the services they offer
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.200]   and the convenience it introduces,
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:22.000]   5% because I like saying the name, ZocDoc.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.040]   So go to zocdoc.com/deep
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.840]   and download the ZocDoc app for free,
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.000]   then find and book a top-rated doctor today,
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.480]   many who will be available within 24 hours.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:37.480]   That's Z-O-C-D-O-C.com/deep,
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:41.560]   zocdoc.com/deep.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.900]   Now, interestingly, I don't know if you know this,
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:49.900]   but the actor The Rock also sponsors ZocDoc on his podcast,
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.840]   and there the promo code is zocdoc.com/rock.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.440]   Wait, we need one more.
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.720]   There's a, what's another rhyming?
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.200]   So there's a person I know who,
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:07.360]   he has a dock in Rockport.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.040]   He has a podcast about it,
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.320]   and it's about living by the water in Rockport,
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:15.240]   and his ad for ZocDoc is zocdoc.com/rockdoc.
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.400]   I could keep going.
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.840]   ZocDoc is a great company.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.080]   All right, let's do some questions.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.280]   All right, Jesse, what's our first question here?
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.960]   - All right, first question is from
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.960]   Little Better Than Average.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.800]   In the era of quiet quitting,
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.440]   the new normal is to just do the bare minimum.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.320]   Does this mean that showing even a little bit of initiative
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:39.200]   and willingness to do more important work
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.160]   can now set you apart from others?
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:44.360]   - I have two parts to my answer here.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.480]   I mean, first, let me just address this idea
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.600]   that we're in an era of quiet quitting,
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.580]   where quiet quitting is so ubiquitous
[00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.860]   that it's just assumed that most people around you
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.000]   are doing this.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   That, of course, is nonsense.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.480]   The thing about internet movements
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.200]   is that because they're leveraging
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:06.440]   the amplification effects of internet distributed
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.640]   and algorithmic curation,
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.500]   they have a way for those who are plugged into it,
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.440]   they have a way of making internet trends
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.720]   seeming universal.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.080]   Everyone is doing this.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.120]   Everyone is feeling this.
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.180]   We see this on topic after topic, right?
[00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.500]   So like you're plugged into,
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.640]   let's say you're plugged into med Twitter
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.000]   during the COVID pandemic,
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.760]   suddenly in your mind,
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:32.260]   like all of these particular possible terrible things
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:33.960]   around COVID are happening everywhere.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.040]   And it's only by the grace of God
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.260]   you've survived being outside for 10 minutes
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:42.200]   because the internet makes these things seem totalizing.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.340]   Let's say you're in political Twitter,
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:48.660]   you're really plugged in the conservative Twitter
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:51.200]   and like it makes it feel like,
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.520]   or independent Twitter,
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.320]   it makes it feel like essentially 80% of the populace
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.640]   has been canceled.
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.520]   And there's almost no one left
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.780]   and there's marauding bands of cancelers
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:02.980]   and like you're a day away from it.
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:03.820]   'Cause it totalize,
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.680]   it makes it seem like this is happening everywhere.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.920]   Well, same thing for a trend like quiet quitting.
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.920]   I'm sure the actual number of people
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.280]   who would say I am doing this,
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.260]   I'm purposely pulling back
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.080]   is a relatively small percentage
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.960]   and has no real large effect on,
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.120]   let's say the dynamics of your particular workplace.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.880]   But the internet, if you're plugged into,
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.920]   let's say TikTok makes it seem like everyone is doing this.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.440]   So that's just a side commentary on internet movements.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.400]   That's not to say by the way, that it's not important.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.880]   I think internet movements play a good signaling purpose.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.080]   Like quiet quitting's importance is not that,
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.460]   oh my God, everyone's doing this now,
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.880]   what's gonna happen to the economy?
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.680]   Because of course that's not what's happening.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.920]   It's importance is there's a real signal
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.580]   that's being amplified here.
[00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.760]   So there's an actual unease or dis-ease
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.960]   that this particular generation is having with work
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:49.940]   as they're trying to figure out
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:51.240]   the role of work in their life.
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.660]   That signal's important
[00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:54.580]   and it's important to amplify that signal.
[00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.440]   So that's where internet movements are important
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.000]   is that they amplify signals
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.800]   that might be meaningful to shifts happening in the culture,
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.880]   but we have to be careful
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.560]   because the tendency or human wiring
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.840]   is to receive it as if this thing is happening universally.
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.800]   So you can be worried about COVID
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.600]   without thinking that you're probably
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.640]   gonna be the last person alive in your town.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.680]   You can be worried about things like cancellation
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.940]   without also having to believe
[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:20.060]   that you're like one day away from it
[00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.660]   and most universities have lost
[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:23.200]   half of their faculty to canceling.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.680]   So this is the tension of internet movements.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.640]   They can amplify messages,
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:32.200]   but that amplification mechanism
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.200]   can deceive us in the feeling like these trends
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.800]   are way more universal than they really are.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:37.940]   This is a bit of a divergence,
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:39.520]   but just a little bit of internet culture chat.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.200]   So what about this particular question though?
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.700]   If people are average,
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.720]   do I have to do just a little bit more to stand out?
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.680]   Yes, this is true.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.020]   And we don't need quiet quitting for this
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:51.140]   to be an effective dynamic.
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.460]   This is something I've talked about for years,
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.340]   especially if you are entry level
[00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:57.560]   in a knowledge work setting.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.740]   You do not have to be a superstar
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:05.660]   on a national scale to quickly get ahead.
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.300]   You have to just be a little bit better
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.940]   than the other young employees at your same employer.
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:13.020]   And that's not as hard as you think.
[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:14.620]   And in particular, there's two things you can do
[00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:17.140]   that will almost always make you stand out.
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:20.040]   One, deliver.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.040]   So people trust you not to drop the ball.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.000]   If they ask you to do something, you do it.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:24.920]   And you get it done by the time
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.760]   you said it's gonna get done.
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.360]   And they don't have to worry about bothering you
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.640]   and sending you follow up messages and saying,
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.260]   sometimes Cal does this, sometimes Cal doesn't.
[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.000]   They trust you're gonna get things done.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.400]   It's not that hard to do, but it's pretty rare.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.360]   And that gets noticed.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.440]   A quick test about whether or not you're succeeding
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.200]   on that particular property.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:48.140]   Do the people you work for send lots of follow up emails
[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:50.260]   or chats after they ask you to do something like,
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.100]   hey, how's this going?
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:51.920]   Have you done this yet?
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.180]   If so, that means they don't really trust you.
[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:57.060]   If they don't, then you're probably doing this right.
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:00.420]   Number two, exceed expectations.
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:03.220]   You don't need to be a perfectionist,
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.060]   but just when you get a task,
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.460]   think like, what do they really need here?
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:08.380]   What are they really looking for?
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.660]   Let me make sure I get them what's really gonna help them.
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.220]   Like, what is the, why did they want me
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.600]   to pull out these quotes?
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.240]   Oh, they're trying to put together this marketing message.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.360]   My boss is putting together this whatever.
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:20.800]   And so what would really make that succeed?
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.520]   Well, let me pull out some better, let me call up a client.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.200]   I know what he needs.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.480]   And so let me make sure that like,
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.480]   I'm really meeting those expectations.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.400]   You don't have to be perfectionist.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.320]   It's not like you're knocking down the park.
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.760]   It's just that we know when Cal turns something in,
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.080]   it's gonna be what we need.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:35.920]   It's gonna be good.
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.200]   It's not gonna be, hey, I did the task, man.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.040]   Why are you on my back?
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.000]   Like, technically I put some quotes down.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.740]   You know, like this guy did, this client did ask me
[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:44.580]   where the bathroom is.
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.500]   That is technically a quote.
[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.420]   Get off my back, quiet quitting.
[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:50.780]   I'm worth more than my labor.
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:51.860]   I'm a human being.
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:55.420]   Just meet the expectations you're looking for.
[00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.900]   You do these two things, in about one year,
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:02.180]   you're gonna, your path is going to angle upwards
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:03.420]   much quicker.
[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.540]   It's not hard, but it's rare.
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:07.140]   Of course, the question is why?
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:11.360]   Like why bother advancing quickly when you're new to a job?
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.760]   I mean, isn't that just playing into, you know,
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:17.040]   the sort of exploitative dynamic of capitalism
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:17.920]   or something like that?
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.920]   The reason is, is because when you advance quickly,
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.080]   you build career capital.
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.860]   Career capital is what gives you control over your career.
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:25.880]   Career capital is what's gonna set you free.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.600]   Career capital is what's going to allow you
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.440]   to decide what you want your working life to be like,
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.000]   mold it towards what resonates and away from what doesn't.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.480]   It is the only way to make your job work for you
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.540]   and not the other way around.
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:43.540]   The things that make great work great is appealing.
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:44.700]   It's in demand.
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.560]   You have to have something to offer in return.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.700]   So if you don't like aspects of work,
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:55.160]   you don't like this thing or this boss or these hours,
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.500]   you can't complain your way out of it.
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.660]   You usually can't quit your way out of it,
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.500]   but you can career capital your way out of it.
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.260]   You become so good, you can't be ignored.
[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:05.340]   And then you use those skills as leverage and say,
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:06.180]   not today.
[00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:07.100]   Now I'm doing this.
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:08.020]   Now I'm doing that.
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:08.960]   I'm going over here.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.800]   I'm freelancing.
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.020]   I'm renegotiating my contract.
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.180]   I'm going to this company that just specialize on this,
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:15.560]   fully remote, and I only check in once a week.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.580]   All of those types of things that you could use
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.820]   to take control of your career
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:22.140]   are returns on investment of career capital
[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:24.380]   gathered by you being good and advancing quickly.
[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.120]   This is the quickest way to get to career capital
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.720]   if you're new.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.500]   Be reliable, don't drop the ball,
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:30.980]   deliver past expectations.
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.940]   Do those things for a year.
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:34.880]   Your trajectory goes fast.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.660]   Just remember, as you build your capital,
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:38.300]   don't wait too long to invest it.
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:42.140]   Actually, I have an article,
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:43.940]   might be out by the time this comes out.
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:46.980]   I have a quiet quitting article I wrote for The New Yorker
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:50.660]   that we were fact checking it and copyed it.
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:51.500]   So I think it's ready.
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.140]   So it's probably, it's kind of like a year
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.100]   in review style article.
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:55.340]   So probably, I don't know,
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:57.640]   but probably by the time you hear this podcast,
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.660]   I'll have a quiet quitting article
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.500]   you can find at The New Yorker.
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:01.540]   And if not, then, you know,
[00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:03.140]   it'll be like in the new year or something.
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.140]   But I've been thinking a lot about quiet quitting recently.
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:09.260]   All right, what's our next question?
[00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:11.180]   - Next question is from Yorick.
[00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:13.300]   I am a consultant expected to work
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:16.420]   on billable client projects from nine to five.
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:18.820]   My employer expects all other work
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.680]   to happen outside of those hours.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:24.440]   I've been trying to minimize these out of our obligations,
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.700]   but I definitely feel the pressure
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.440]   to give up more of my time.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:30.800]   On a normal day, I am busy until 8.30 PM.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.540]   How do I reclaim my time?
[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:37.340]   - Well, this is the reality of your job
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.740]   and the reality of a lot of these billable hour jobs.
[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:42.060]   So this is true of a lot of lawyer positions,
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:43.220]   definitely true about a lot of high
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:44.840]   in consultancy positions.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:48.420]   You're supposed to be billing client hours
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.300]   to a certain level.
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:51.740]   So you're actually pretty lucky
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.460]   that it's 40 hours a week in law,
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.300]   it can be much higher.
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:59.560]   And then everything else has to happen outside of that.
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.420]   And the employer doesn't really care where you do it.
[00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:02.260]   It's like, get that done,
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:05.380]   but like you need to, we're gonna track your billables.
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.860]   And then we have all this other stuff.
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:09.340]   York here who asked this question,
[00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:11.340]   he had sent us a longer elaboration.
[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:14.260]   I mean, a lot of the stuff is internal focused.
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:16.900]   So he mentioned like doing an internal training
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.220]   about a new technology, setting up,
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.300]   it's like internal facing admin work.
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:22.920]   And all that's just like, hey, you get that done,
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:24.620]   but you can't reduce your billable hours.
[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:26.260]   That's the reality of those jobs.
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:30.060]   So you're not going to be able to,
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:32.300]   almost certainly not going to be able to just
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:36.740]   request your way out of it and just say,
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:39.180]   I want less billable hours.
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:40.780]   So I have time to do this other type of work,
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:41.980]   or I don't want to do other type of work
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:43.740]   because they need the billable hours
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.140]   and that work has to get done.
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:47.500]   You have three options if you want to improve things.
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.220]   And these are based on experience I've had,
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:51.100]   like watching people in these situations,
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.540]   different ways they've finagled this.
[00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:57.700]   So number one is you can build an internal practice.
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.620]   I've seen this both in consultancies
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:01.300]   and law firms.
[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:04.420]   It's where you get a specialty that you do.
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:07.420]   And you essentially build a independent practice
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.180]   within the larger company that you work for.
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:12.100]   We say, I do this type of work.
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.820]   Usually it's you're gathering your own clients,
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.580]   you're dealing with those clients,
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:19.840]   you're billing at a higher rate than other people
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.020]   because it's a specialty that you do.
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:23.420]   And you basically are hands off
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:25.020]   from the rest of the organization.
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:26.660]   Now in the sort of post COVID time,
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.300]   you might negotiate this with a,
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:30.340]   you're largely remote,
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:32.620]   maybe you move to somewhere farther away.
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:34.580]   You only see that you're only in the office once a week.
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:36.320]   Like you're kind of detaching yourself
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.860]   from the day-to-day office culture.
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.900]   And you're more of like an independent contractor,
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.220]   even though you are a paid employee of that firm.
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:43.480]   I see this all the time.
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.500]   Like, look, I'm our media specialist.
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:50.300]   I'm our whatever retirement law specialist at the law firm.
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.560]   I bring in money, you're happy about it.
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.880]   I bring in work.
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.060]   I just go and do that.
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:56.340]   I report back once a month
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:58.660]   on how things are going to leave me alone.
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.300]   That's one option.
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:01.180]   And that gives you more control.
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.460]   Now you're kind of out of the normal stream
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:04.780]   of doing the other type of office work.
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:06.140]   And you're in more control of your hours.
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:10.060]   You can control that and make up time if you need to.
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.180]   Option number two,
[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:14.580]   quit your job and do the same work as a freelancer.
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:17.500]   This happens all the time in DC.
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.000]   Jesse, you probably know people who have done this.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.340]   In DC, this happens all the time
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:22.900]   where there's these really specialized
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.920]   kind of consulting positions,
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:29.100]   procurement for whatever, USAID aid.
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.260]   And it's like a very specific expertise or whatever.
[00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:33.900]   And you're doing it for a consulting firm
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:34.740]   and you realize like,
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:37.300]   I could just contract with some clients directly
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:39.300]   and just do it hourly.
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.340]   I know some people who have done this
[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:42.920]   and they actually make more money
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.660]   than they were making before.
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:46.820]   They have more control over their hours
[00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:47.660]   because who cares, right?
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:48.480]   It's their money.
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.060]   They can say, I don't, I work this much or that much.
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:52.620]   They can control how much they do.
[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:54.040]   The internal admin stuff goes away.
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.660]   There's no internal trainings to organize
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:56.500]   when you work for yourself.
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.100]   It's harder and more stressful, right?
[00:33:58.100 --> 00:33:59.980]   So there's no free lunch,
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:02.520]   but if you have a very specialized expertise,
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.700]   there may be an opportunity for you
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.700]   to just do that directly with clients.
[00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.780]   And then you gain autonomy
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:12.320]   in exchange for a little bit more economic risk.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.960]   The final option is get a different job.
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.020]   The reality of billable hours is this,
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.940]   it's what these jobs are like.
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:21.140]   So get a different job.
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:22.640]   But when you go to get a different job,
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:25.620]   this time be more careful about how you evaluate them.
[00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:26.660]   I'm assuming the way,
[00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:28.380]   like many people who end up in these jobs,
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:31.120]   they end up there because of money or prestige.
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.380]   I'm looking for a job.
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:35.380]   This consultancy is offering this much money.
[00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:37.140]   Hey, that's impressive.
[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:38.220]   That's a good salary.
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:39.060]   I feel validated.
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:40.640]   Let's do that.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:42.220]   Or I went to law school.
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:43.060]   Here's the big firm.
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:44.460]   The big firms are the hard ones to get into.
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:46.300]   I got a big firm job.
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:47.940]   That's impressive in the eyes of the people
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:49.500]   I know from law school.
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:50.860]   I can pat myself on the back.
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:52.280]   That's how you end up in these jobs.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.500]   You need better criteria.
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.180]   If you go back to find a different job, York,
[00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:56.140]   you need better criteria.
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:57.780]   And these criteria should be based
[00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:59.720]   in lifestyle-centric career planning.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.660]   What you want your life to be like in five years from now,
[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:03.980]   10 years from now, 15 years from now.
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:05.780]   Have that vision, all aspects of your life,
[00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:08.100]   not just the general aspects of the professional.
[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.420]   And then you're working backwards to find careers
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:13.360]   and other decisions that can move you towards there.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:16.020]   So if this vision of your life doesn't have you
[00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:17.900]   like plugged in and working till 830,
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.240]   then you're gonna disqualify a job
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.340]   that's almost certainly gonna require you
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:22.640]   to work till 830.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.300]   And so maybe go for a different job.
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:25.540]   Oh, but this job doesn't pay as much.
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:26.380]   Okay, great.
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:30.380]   But this job is in, you know, Boise instead of suburban DC.
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:31.540]   The cost of living is half.
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:33.120]   It all works out.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.820]   So you gotta have a better criteria.
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.260]   If you're going back to the drawing board,
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:38.300]   this time be more careful about how you're selecting
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.440]   what job you're gonna do.
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:45.600]   All right, making progress here.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:48.180]   Our next, what do we got here is our next question.
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.460]   - All right, next question's from CK.
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:53.020]   I recently participated in an online writing course
[00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.140]   that used Twitter to distribute your writing
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:56.900]   among other writers.
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:59.400]   Writing blog posts doesn't reach anyone.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.820]   This course's premise is that using social media
[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:03.540]   lets you see what sticks.
[00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:04.620]   Do you agree?
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:06.800]   What do you suggest to a writer just starting out
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.360]   and looking for feedback?
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:12.100]   - That's a good question.
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:16.460]   So first of all, I looked up this course's website.
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:18.340]   So I don't actually wanna use the name of this course.
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:20.700]   So Jesse, don't put the website up on the screen,
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:22.820]   but I have the website here.
[00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:24.540]   I have the website for the course.
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.100]   I'm trying to figure out what he's talking about.
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.620]   An online writing course that uses Twitter,
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:30.220]   because I need to understand what this,
[00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:35.220]   what CK means by wanting to be a writer.
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.420]   So I'm looking at this course now,
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:41.420]   and it says it's a cohort-based course
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.960]   that focuses on the fundamentals of writing on the internet.
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.220]   Unlike other writing courses,
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.020]   you don't learn passively.
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:51.100]   It looks like they're using Twitter
[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:52.780]   to create a sort of writing group.
[00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:55.180]   So you pass your writing around to other people.
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:57.420]   Here's a few other things about this.
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.980]   All right, here's their sales pitch.
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:01.420]   Have you ever wanted to start writing online,
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:03.460]   but aren't sure the first step to take?
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:04.980]   Have you started writing online, but now feel stuck?
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:05.820]   Do you have plenty of ideas,
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.980]   but struggle to put yourself out there?
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:10.940]   If any of these sound familiar, this course is for you.
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:14.980]   All right, here's a testimonial.
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:20.580]   "I'm left more energized now than ever before,
[00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:22.420]   more creative and more clear.
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:23.260]   For the first time ever,
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:24.860]   I feel excited to sit down for 45 minutes,
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:25.940]   completely uninterrupted and do nothing
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:27.780]   except think and write."
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:30.060]   So look, I'm reading this, Jesse,
[00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:33.620]   and this is not a knock on this course.
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:35.220]   I mean, it's a knock on me being sort of
[00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:37.100]   not plugged into internet culture.
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:38.660]   But what is this talking about?
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:41.700]   I've just read like 10 quotes,
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.180]   and it's all like about,
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:45.260]   they just keep saying writing online,
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:47.340]   they're having a hard time writing online.
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.060]   This will help you get motivated to write online.
[00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:49.900]   The testimonial is like,
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.500]   "I've never been more energized to write online."
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.660]   What does that mean, write online?
[00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:56.020]   - It's trying to get you to buy it.
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:56.980]   - The course. - Yeah.
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:58.020]   - Yeah.
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.220]   - It just wants you to buy the course.
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.620]   - But, all right, okay. - It's like a typical
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:02.540]   sales page.
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:03.540]   - All right, here's some more details.
[00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:05.100]   "The biggest mistake early writers make,
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.600]   publishing weekly blog posts into the void.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.020]   In the beginning, you think you know
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:10.860]   what you want to write about,
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:12.340]   and you think you know what people want to read,
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:14.220]   but newsflash, you don't, you need feedback,
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.420]   and this thing helps you get feedback."
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:16.420]   So what is it that,
[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:19.460]   what's the problem this is solving for people?
[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:20.740]   Like when it's saying writing online,
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:22.260]   do they mean like content marketing?
[00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.620]   Like, "I want to write online and make money off of it."
[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:26.460]   Is it expression?
[00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.260]   Like, "I just want to write online and share my thoughts,
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:30.660]   but I want to be able to have an audience
[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:31.740]   of people who are listening to it."
[00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:32.580]   Is it people-- - I would assume
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.580]   it's more related to the first topic
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:35.420]   that you just brought up.
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:36.660]   - So, okay, so this is,
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:37.620]   because they're not talking about,
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:39.020]   "We're going to help you make money,"
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:41.260]   but you think this is like content marketing.
[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.100]   - Although I would say more copywriting
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.860]   if it was the first topic that you talked about.
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:48.020]   - So I have, so, okay, that's the first problem, CK.
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:48.940]   And I think this is the issue.
[00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:50.460]   I mean, I'm not plugged into internet culture,
[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:51.860]   but I don't understand what this course
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.740]   is trying to offer you, which tells me,
[00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:56.500]   "I'm not quite sure what it is you're trying to go for
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:02.140]   when you say you want to be a writer
[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:04.140]   and should social media be involved
[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:07.220]   in you becoming a writer."
[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:08.460]   - I think what he's talking about,
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:10.460]   or she, I'm not sure who CK is,
[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:14.340]   but they want to do it as a profession, get paid.
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:17.500]   - Right, so here's my thoughts then.
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.180]   We have three, I'm going to give
[00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:21.980]   three possible interpretations of, including this one.
[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:23.380]   This one, I think is the right one.
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:25.020]   But let me give two other interpretations first,
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.340]   and then we'll go to the third interpretation.
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:27.540]   For each of these interpretations
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:29.860]   of what this audience member
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:32.340]   might be wanting to do with writing,
[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:33.780]   I'm going to have a quick thought.
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:36.300]   So one, if you want to write for fun,
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:37.460]   like you want to express yourself,
[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:39.100]   and also as like a community building thing,
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:41.220]   you want to be around other people who write
[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:43.540]   on the same topic, you're doing fantasy novels,
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:44.580]   and you love fantasy novels,
[00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:45.420]   you want to be around other people
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:46.500]   who are trying to write fantasy novels,
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.580]   and you like those people and you like writing,
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:52.100]   then I think a writing group is great.
[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:54.820]   I would recommend an in-person writing group,
[00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:57.900]   of which many exist, or an online writing group,
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:59.980]   where it's just, here's 15 people working on this
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.220]   and we all get together on Zoom.
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:03.820]   But it should be a group of people that you know,
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:05.300]   you get to know, and you meet with regularly
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:06.140]   to work on your writing.
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:11.020]   That is a well-established path in the world of writing.
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:14.020]   And a lot of people who write for fun do this.
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:14.980]   And it's like, we get together
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:16.180]   and we pass around manuscripts,
[00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.300]   and you should definitely do that, CK.
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.660]   So if you want to write for fun,
[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.300]   get a real writing group
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.620]   that you can sustainably work with.
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.100]   I don't think social media has any role in that.
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:27.340]   But social media is not really relevant.
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:30.180]   You're not trying to become Brandon Sanderson.
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:31.420]   You're not worried about audience building.
[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.140]   So just get together with people and write.
[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:35.180]   I think that's fantastic.
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:36.220]   The second interpretation is
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.660]   you want to be a professional writer.
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:40.100]   Maybe like a professional journalist
[00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.860]   or a professional novelist.
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:43.940]   All right, well, there's well-worn paths.
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:46.620]   I mean, you can't make up your own path there.
[00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:48.220]   If you want to be a professional writer,
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:51.020]   you need to study how professional writers get there,
[00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:53.740]   what skills they build, how they build them.
[00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:55.380]   Professional writers don't get there
[00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:58.060]   by kind of copywriting on the internet
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.460]   and spreading their name with social media.
[00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:02.620]   That's completely different.
[00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:03.540]   So if you want to be a journalist,
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:04.860]   if you want to be a professional writer,
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:06.220]   I've talked about that, I've written about that.
[00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:07.940]   A hundred other people written about it.
[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:11.460]   You know, face the reality of how those worlds actually work
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:13.940]   and then figure out if there's a reasonable entrance
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:15.220]   for you into those worlds.
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.900]   There's a lot of different answers to that question.
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:20.500]   None of those answers are going to be,
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:23.580]   you know, start a blog and promote it with Twitter.
[00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:26.500]   All right, the third thing, this is Jesse's interpretation,
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.100]   is that you want to make money online
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:32.980]   as a content marketer or producer of content online.
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.540]   That's its own thing.
[00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:37.660]   That's its own world.
[00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:42.060]   You know, typically, I don't know that world well,
[00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:44.220]   but I know it somewhat well.
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:46.260]   And I mean, typically the key to that world
[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:49.340]   is you have to have a really clear thing
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.580]   that you're offering that's interesting to people
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:53.020]   or solves a problem they have,
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:55.660]   that you are the right person to be writing about it.
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:59.420]   So you have some sort of bold demonstration
[00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:02.500]   of this makes me the right person to write about it.
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:05.300]   And then you deliver that message
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:08.860]   in a very sort of compelling, easily graspable way.
[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:10.500]   I would say, and you can correct me if I'm wrong here, Jesse,
[00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:13.140]   that tends to be now more days, much more visual.
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:14.980]   So like if you're trying to,
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:19.380]   like let's say you're in like weightlifting,
[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:22.020]   you're like the plates, what's the guy,
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:23.340]   more plates, more dates.
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:26.860]   - I don't know that guy's name,
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:27.700]   but I know what you're talking about.
[00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.780]   - Yeah, anyway, he's like a fitness influencer
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:30.620]   or something, right?
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.300]   It's bodybuilding or weightlifting or whatever, yeah.
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:35.060]   No, it's more visual.
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:38.180]   So things are more like video or Instagram.
[00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:41.500]   I'm assuming this guy's like very strong.
[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:42.980]   So there's like some bold demonstration
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:44.860]   like why I'm the right person to talk about this.
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.980]   I don't think there's as much anymore
[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:49.020]   people starting native with just blogs.
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:52.020]   I mean, I see that out there, people just trying to,
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:54.220]   you can tell they took some sort of content marketing course
[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:55.060]   because they have some schedule
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:56.860]   with which they're posting these blog posts,
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.940]   but it really feels like it's pulling teeth.
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:00.620]   It's just like, I gotta write my Thursday post
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:02.140]   and it's, you know, there's like, what am I,
[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:03.140]   why am I here for?
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:04.780]   Like, who are you, what are you offering?
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:05.620]   What's the unique take?
[00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:07.700]   So I think a lot of this content marketing
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:11.180]   or influencer type side hustles tends to be more visual.
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:12.020]   It's gonna be more video.
[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:15.940]   It's gonna be more Instagram image type based.
[00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:18.060]   But the key there is the emphasis is not,
[00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:19.540]   I need a lot of feedback on my writing.
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:22.380]   Well, what you need there is a particular hook.
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:23.860]   I am talking about this thing.
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:26.500]   I have a message, a theory, a community,
[00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:29.260]   and my life is a compelling demonstration
[00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:31.020]   of this in action.
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:33.140]   And so it's almost like if that's your goal
[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:36.060]   is to make money online by the production of content,
[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:37.980]   I would put most of my energy right now
[00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:39.780]   into doing something really interesting
[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:42.860]   and easily demonstrable online activity.
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:44.620]   That's where I'd put my energy.
[00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:48.020]   I'd be, you know, going on the adventure
[00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:51.180]   of writing across the country while doing whatever.
[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:52.620]   I'd be getting in really good shape
[00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:53.860]   or learning to shoot the bow
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:56.260]   or learning the three languages in three months
[00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:57.220]   or whatever it is, right?
[00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:00.060]   Like actually work on developing yourself
[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:02.620]   as an exemplar of some sort of really interesting thing.
[00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:04.740]   That's probably where you should put your energy.
[00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:06.660]   And then you can figure out how do I deliver this
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:07.780]   to people in a compelling fashion?
[00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:09.180]   That's probably what's gonna matter.
[00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:11.040]   But basically none of these interpretations
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:15.260]   we're talking about really say what you need to be doing
[00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:16.940]   is like sharing your writing on social media,
[00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:18.120]   at least as step one.
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:20.300]   So I don't know.
[00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.060]   People sometimes say I'm snobbish about this, Jesse,
[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.820]   just because like I've been writing for a long time
[00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:27.780]   and I write for, you know,
[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:29.720]   I write books for the biggest publisher in the world.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:32.020]   I write magazine articles for the New Yorker
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:36.300]   that I'm out of touch with what it's like to be coming up.
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:38.300]   So it's possible I'm being a little bit snobbish about it,
[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:41.780]   but like I'm not turning my nose at like influence
[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:42.620]   or culture.
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:45.540]   I think that could be a powerful side hustle.
[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:46.820]   It's just, I don't think you get there
[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:49.540]   by getting feedback on your blog, right?
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:53.140]   I think you get there by, you know,
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:54.540]   carrying the rock while you run,
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:58.660]   thinking of Cameron Haynes, right?
[00:44:58.660 --> 00:44:59.500]   Is that his name?
[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:00.820]   - Yeah. - The bow hunter.
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:02.780]   And doing these like incredible feats of endurance
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:05.880]   and strength that also videotape very well.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:09.300]   And you can show him hitting a target from far away,
[00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:12.260]   carrying a rock up a hill and like Joe Rogan
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:14.140]   saw him do that and was like, you have to come on my show.
[00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:15.320]   It's like doing,
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.060]   that's my understanding of influence or culture.
[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.780]   Now, I mean, I don't understand that there's the whole,
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:22.300]   obviously like TikTok influence, which I don't understand.
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:23.780]   That's more about like how you literally look
[00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:24.980]   or something, I don't know.
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:28.020]   But they're like YouTube, you know, Twitter based.
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:30.820]   And now I can sell a lot of books or courses.
[00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:32.260]   Like you gotta be doing something cool.
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:33.100]   - Yeah.
[00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:34.340]   - So it's like, focus on doing something cool.
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:37.500]   Hey, the side effect is you'll still have ended up
[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:40.060]   doing something cool regardless of what happens with.
[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:41.580]   - Yeah.
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:43.740]   - That's almost like writing is not that important
[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.740]   for that sort of making money,
[00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:47.380]   producing content for the internet.
[00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:50.980]   Writing is not as important as it maybe once was.
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:52.900]   - No matter what, I mean, those great videos and stuff,
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:55.340]   they definitely write the scripts, you know.
[00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.500]   - Oh yeah, they spend a lot of time on them.
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:59.220]   - Yeah, scripts have to be like.
[00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:02.180]   - But it's a different, it's different.
[00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:03.020]   - Yeah.
[00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:04.020]   - Like the YouTube idiom, like it's different
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:06.540]   than I'm trying to write like a 2000 word
[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:07.700]   argumentative essay.
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:08.520]   - Yeah.
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:09.500]   - And then they edit them so heavily.
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:11.220]   If they write the scripts, when they edit, edit, edit,
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:13.740]   edit until it's like, so you don't, for example,
[00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:16.780]   have to have a very carefully crafted script
[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:20.060]   because you're gonna edit out 80% of it.
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:21.060]   And there's a whole art in that,
[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:23.620]   but I think that's an art in just you do it, you practice.
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:24.460]   - Yeah.
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:27.580]   - All right, let's move on.
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:28.900]   What's our next question?
[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:31.420]   - All right, next question is from Flavio.
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:36.060]   I organize filmmaking workshops and produce my own films.
[00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:39.060]   I am developing a new website to sell my own content
[00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:40.260]   directly to my audience.
[00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:43.780]   It will include a blog, newsletter, and podcast.
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:47.700]   Should I use social media to help build an audience
[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.900]   or just post on my site and let the audience
[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:51.100]   grow organically?
[00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:52.820]   - All right, that's good.
[00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:53.740]   It's a related question.
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:56.380]   So we're pairing two questions that are somewhat related.
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:47:00.700]   All right, so let's, in Flavio or Flavio's case,
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:03.500]   he has like an existing project
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:06.020]   that he wants to better promote.
[00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:10.860]   I think it is possible to use social media
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:15.860]   to promote a relevant project without massive net harms.
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:17.900]   But it's difficult.
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:21.780]   So I have some advice about if you wanna try to do that,
[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:22.620]   how to do it.
[00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:28.980]   First, I'm gonna say treat your social media channels
[00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:31.300]   like almost a television channel.
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:35.580]   I have a very specific programming
[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:37.580]   that I have thought through.
[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:39.100]   Here's the content and the look
[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:41.220]   and the schedule of this programming.
[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:42.900]   Let's see how this season does.
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:43.740]   Like you're thinking about it
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:45.900]   almost like a television programmer.
[00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:49.100]   So in this case, Flavio's in filmmaking,
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:51.300]   does filmmaking courses, produces his own film.
[00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:54.300]   So maybe like when he's thinking about Instagram,
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:58.140]   it is these like beautifully shot short videos
[00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:00.260]   all on the same topic.
[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:03.300]   You can imagine it's like all on cinematography
[00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:05.460]   and you have like a demonstration
[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:06.700]   each one of these short videos.
[00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:08.740]   And it's like, here's what we do.
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:10.500]   It's one of these every two weeks
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:11.460]   and here's how it looks.
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:12.500]   And we post it here.
[00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:14.740]   And we post it here and on YouTube.
[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:17.500]   And it's like you're programming a television channel.
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:21.860]   Then stick to that schedule,
[00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:23.140]   use a computer to publish,
[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:26.180]   have no interaction with your channel.
[00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:27.700]   You're not on there listening to DMs
[00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:29.020]   and answering responses.
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:33.340]   It's like the executive at the Discovery Channel
[00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:34.860]   is they're putting the content out there
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:36.980]   and for an audience to consume.
[00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:39.780]   I think that's the only sustainable way to do it.
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:41.980]   So you have this clarity of here's what we're doing
[00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:43.980]   and why and what it looks like and it's regular.
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:46.620]   The audience can build expectations for this
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:49.100]   and you're not on there interacting.
[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:52.100]   There is whole different levels of difficulty
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:55.460]   that this can span.
[00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:56.540]   From the very simplest,
[00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:58.340]   you can have a strategy, a channel strategy
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:02.700]   like Ryan Holiday, where it's a quote once a day.
[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:05.100]   Stoic quote once a day, he has a big list of them.
[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:06.540]   Someone puts them on there.
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:09.220]   Very simple content, but very clear
[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:10.340]   what he's trying to do.
[00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:12.260]   On the other end of the scale of difficulty,
[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:17.220]   you could have something like Adam Savage's Tested.com
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:19.100]   where they do treat it like a television channel,
[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:20.740]   but there's a series of different types
[00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:21.820]   of videos they produce.
[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:23.540]   They're actually pretty high
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:25.900]   man hour production requirements,
[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:28.340]   but you really know there's these Q&As,
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:31.460]   one day builds and experiences.
[00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:33.540]   And they're sort of released on a semi-regular schedule
[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:34.420]   with a common look.
[00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:36.260]   And so you can have whole sorts of degrees
[00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:38.420]   of difficulty here, but the key is you're seeing it
[00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:40.660]   like I'm using these as channels.
[00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:42.820]   I'm putting this on Instagram,
[00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:44.820]   much in the same way that Discovery Channel might say,
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:47.020]   ooh, Comcast is gonna carry our channel now.
[00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:51.420]   What you want to avoid if you're gonna try this strategy
[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:56.420]   is the Faustian bargain of I can build an audience.
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:50:00.060]   Like I can see the number tick up faster
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:02.180]   on one of these social media platforms.
[00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:06.260]   If I become a sort of Greek chorus commenter
[00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:08.340]   on the affairs of the world.
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:11.140]   That I am going to just react to things that are going on,
[00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:13.060]   that are relevant to my particular world.
[00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:14.260]   I'm gonna comment on things.
[00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:16.260]   I'm gonna go back and forth with people,
[00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:18.940]   make takes, see what gets picked up by other people
[00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:19.780]   and what doesn't.
[00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:24.540]   That's the fastest way to grow a say a Twitter following
[00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:27.540]   or Instagram following, but it is a Faustian bargain
[00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:28.820]   because what that will require.
[00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:29.740]   So if this is what you do,
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:30.940]   yes, your numbers will go up quicker,
[00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:34.540]   but what that requires is 10 to 30 typically posts a day.
[00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:36.220]   So you're doing it constantly
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:38.180]   and that sucks you into that world.
[00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:40.500]   And your entire world becomes this online world
[00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:43.300]   and it's anxiety producing and it's stressful
[00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:44.660]   and it saps your energy.
[00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:46.020]   It's incredibly distracting
[00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:48.900]   and it reduces your ability to do almost anything else.
[00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:50.940]   I also think those type of audiences
[00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:53.940]   don't translate into sales of the other things you're doing
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:55.820]   at nearly the same conversion rate
[00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:57.420]   as another type of audience.
[00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:58.700]   If you've built up an audience
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:01.580]   because you post the cinematography video,
[00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:04.420]   every two weeks and it's beautifully done and informative,
[00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:06.580]   that is an audience that's gonna convert at a high rate
[00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:08.740]   when you sell an online course about filmmaking.
[00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:10.540]   If you have a, instead a big audience
[00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:12.460]   that's three times as big, but it's been built up
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:13.740]   because you're on there talking
[00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:15.300]   about the film industry all day long
[00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:16.860]   and getting involved in controversies
[00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:18.860]   and doing takes and sniping at people,
[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:20.500]   that's not an audience that's gonna convert
[00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:21.820]   very high to your filmmaking course.
[00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:23.700]   So yeah, maybe you have a hundred thousand followers
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:27.340]   instead of 30,000, but you get less conversion
[00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:28.740]   to your online course that in the vision
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:32.020]   where you have this program channel mentality.
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:32.940]   So that's what I'm gonna suggest.
[00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:36.420]   If you were going to do a social media promotion strategy,
[00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:37.820]   treat it like a TV channel,
[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:41.860]   program, schedule, specific content,
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:43.900]   theory behind it, thought behind it,
[00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:45.340]   execute, execute, execute.
[00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:47.260]   Don't get involved in interactions.
[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:49.060]   Don't talk to people.
[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:50.100]   Don't try to build an audience
[00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:52.100]   because people are interested in your takes.
[00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:55.000]   That is a bet that I don't think is worth taking.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:00.620]   I've been, speaking of cinematography,
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:05.500]   I was re-watching "The Revenant" recently,
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:10.500]   which won, just 2015, won the Oscar for best cinematography.
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.780]   It's like a miracle of cinematography.
[00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:14.180]   - Is that with Anthony Hopkins?
[00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:17.980]   - No, you're thinking of similar.
[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:19.980]   That is a movie, there is an Anthony Hopkins movie
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:21.220]   where he's being chased by a bear.
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:22.420]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:25.500]   "The Revenant," he gets attacked by a bear
[00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:27.740]   and they leave him for dead.
[00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:32.180]   But when he's essentially like completely immobilized
[00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:37.140]   from his injuries, he sees Tom Hardy kill his son.
[00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:38.700]   And then Tom Hardy leaves him for dead.
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:40.100]   And then he sort of emerges
[00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:42.080]   and the whole thing is him tracking him down.
[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:43.780]   But it's a miracle of cinematography
[00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:46.940]   because it's all natural light.
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:50.540]   And it's all filmed, almost entirely filmed,
[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:52.040]   except for some of the flashback sequences
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:55.660]   and broom sequences with wide angle primate lenses.
[00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:56.500]   - Okay, yeah, I've seen this.
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:53:01.060]   - So no like telephoto, no like zoomed in,
[00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:03.900]   the only establishing shots are of nature for the most part.
[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:07.740]   And there's like some, I think they did the initial attack
[00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:10.740]   at the riverboat in deep focus, so that's different.
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:14.320]   But once they're out there, it's a prime wide angle lens,
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:17.960]   usually below eye level and is just in there,
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:20.300]   just like up to the person's face and turn to camera
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:21.300]   as they're looking up here.
[00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:25.300]   And so you're just like in this, you're in the world.
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:26.460]   And you can see so much detail
[00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:27.800]   because you're on the wide angle lens, right?
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:29.340]   So it's this huge,
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:30.900]   they're using a good digital Aeroflex camera.
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:32.340]   So it's good resolution still.
[00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:34.180]   And you're seeing, so it's like you're there.
[00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:35.340]   Like you're just natural light,
[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:37.580]   like right among the people, right among the crowd.
[00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:40.900]   It's a, you know, anyways, I'm impressed.
[00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:41.740]   - Nice.
[00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:44.580]   - That one best, and then the director won best director.
[00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:47.180]   And it was the year after he did Birdman.
[00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:48.020]   - Oh yeah.
[00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:48.860]   - And got best director for that back.
[00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:50.380]   I mean, that's a flex.
[00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:52.860]   Birdman, Revenant, you know, you flex, you drop the mic
[00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:54.860]   and then, you know, go do what you wanna do.
[00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:56.900]   So anyways, I've been enjoying that.
[00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:57.860]   I'm very impressed.
[00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:00.740]   - That is a diversion.
[00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:05.660]   I like diverting into the cinema when I can.
[00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:07.900]   All right, let's, people are probably tired
[00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:09.860]   from the holidays, but let's do one more question here.
[00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:10.700]   - Okay.
[00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:15.820]   CT, how do I address my growing desire to make new friends
[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:18.260]   and build a network outside my hometown connections
[00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:19.940]   when I'm already balancing a job
[00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:22.500]   and a side project of writing a novel?
[00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:26.220]   - Well, okay, first of all, I'm not impressed.
[00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:27.740]   I mean, I'm impressed that you're writing a novel.
[00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:30.100]   I'm not impressed by the idea that this somehow
[00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:32.940]   is a unique obstacle to making friends.
[00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:34.940]   Lots of people have lots of things going on outside of work
[00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:37.460]   and still have friends, but it is hard to make new friends.
[00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:38.700]   Jesse, I'm gonna ask you.
[00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:42.260]   You're like the most friendly person I know.
[00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:45.620]   You make friends with people just walking down the street.
[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:47.700]   So let's pick your brain on this.
[00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:51.980]   Like, what is Jesse's tips for like finding
[00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:54.220]   and meeting people, interesting people?
[00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:57.100]   You just sort of live in a city.
[00:54:58.060 --> 00:54:58.900]   What do you do?
[00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:01.860]   - One thing that you can do is, you know,
[00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:04.060]   you can meet a lot of community people at gyms
[00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:05.980]   or classes or stuff like that.
[00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:06.820]   - Like activities.
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:07.980]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:09.500]   Especially like group classes.
[00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:11.060]   If you consistently go to some of those
[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:14.380]   and you meet a lot of regular people that do the same thing
[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:15.780]   around the same times that you go.
[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:17.940]   - So like when you started, how long ago did you start
[00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:20.420]   the new CrossFit box you've been going to?
[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:25.860]   - I started that gym in May.
[00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:27.220]   - So have you met anybody?
[00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:28.540]   - Yeah, I know a lot of people there.
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:29.380]   - Not surprised.
[00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:30.620]   - Yeah, like a lot.
[00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:31.460]   And then.
[00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:32.660]   - And like an interesting thing you do,
[00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:36.060]   which I think people don't always think of,
[00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:38.660]   but they should, is like you actually invest
[00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:41.180]   in a country club membership.
[00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:42.540]   - Yeah.
[00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:43.860]   - Which is not as bad as you might think.
[00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:46.300]   You worked me through the numbers at some point.
[00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:49.340]   But it's like there is multiple different
[00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:51.300]   social possibilities that all,
[00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:52.420]   because there's all these different,
[00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:55.220]   there's different sports going on and tournaments
[00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:59.420]   and I met one of your friends, Leo, right?
[00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:03.100]   Yeah, who you met at the club.
[00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:03.940]   And the way you explained that to me,
[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:06.540]   it's like that's actually like a really good investment.
[00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:08.100]   It's not far from your house.
[00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:10.140]   You can go to tennis, you work on golf,
[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:10.980]   or you're gonna play golf,
[00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:12.980]   then you get people to play golf.
[00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:15.140]   These are all sports you end up playing with.
[00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:17.100]   You meet other people who are doing them.
[00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:19.300]   I think that was a really smart move
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:21.540]   that like someone like CT,
[00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:22.540]   you wouldn't normally think about it
[00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:24.940]   'cause people think like, well, that's,
[00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:26.900]   it's for lawyers to network or something.
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:29.340]   Or like it feels like something that like,
[00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:31.540]   your parents in the 80s did or something.
[00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:32.900]   But it's actually very savvy.
[00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:34.420]   Like there's a lot of activity,
[00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:38.860]   a huge return on that investment in terms of socialization,
[00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:40.300]   socializing, meeting people.
[00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:41.540]   - Yeah.
[00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:44.660]   Meet a lot of people at those types of gyms
[00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:47.620]   and even classes, like say you took Spanish classes
[00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:49.700]   like the local community college or something like that.
[00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:50.540]   - Yeah.
[00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:52.500]   - You can meet people like that.
[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:53.340]   - Before we had kids,
[00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:55.780]   my wife and I did some photography classes.
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:56.740]   - Yeah.
[00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:58.420]   - And some cooking classes.
[00:56:58.420 --> 00:56:59.260]   Through the community,
[00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:00.780]   I think it was the community college.
[00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:01.620]   It was something like that.
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:02.820]   Or was that the, maybe some of this was at like
[00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:04.460]   the Brattle Theater in Cambridge.
[00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:07.340]   But yeah, we'd met people.
[00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:08.180]   - Yeah.
[00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:10.180]   - Like, oh great, then let's like go
[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:11.740]   to a photo exhibit together or something like that.
[00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:12.740]   - Yeah.
[00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:14.140]   And then especially in DC, I mean,
[00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:17.140]   go to a bunch of those, you know,
[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:19.620]   go downtown, go to museums, go to like tours,
[00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:22.100]   go to stuff like that.
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:23.460]   - Yeah, sign up for these things.
[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:24.300]   - Yeah.
[00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:25.260]   - Yeah, there's a lot of lectures.
[00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:28.380]   There's a lot of, yeah, a lot of shows.
[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:29.300]   - The more of those you go to,
[00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:31.580]   you probably recognize some familiar faces.
[00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:33.620]   - So CT, I think the idea here is
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:36.900]   invest a lot of energy into this.
[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:37.740]   I think it's worth,
[00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:38.700]   and it doesn't take,
[00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:40.260]   a lot of this is happening after hours,
[00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:41.100]   it's on weekends,
[00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:42.660]   and it's not like it's every day.
[00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:44.700]   But it takes energy.
[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:46.260]   You have to sign up for things and go places.
[00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:47.820]   And then once you meet people, ask them to do things.
[00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:48.820]   Like there's a lot of energy in it,
[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:50.700]   but it's absolutely worth doing.
[00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:52.220]   Because not only is it important to make new friends,
[00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:54.860]   but actually I think the whole process of trying to do this
[00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:57.220]   is itself really interesting activity.
[00:57:57.220 --> 00:57:58.180]   Like you're not gonna be upset
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:57:59.420]   that like I've been going to a gym
[00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:00.540]   and I went to these lectures
[00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:02.340]   and I experimented with like photography
[00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:04.380]   and I had coffee with two or three different people.
[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:05.460]   And maybe I didn't really like those people,
[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:06.300]   but that was interesting.
[00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:07.140]   I went to a new place.
[00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:09.420]   Like it's activity and it's interesting
[00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:11.420]   and it's stimulating and it's new.
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:15.500]   And so even the act of getting out there
[00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:18.740]   and trying to meet friends itself,
[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:21.340]   it's interesting even before you actually like sift through
[00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:23.180]   and find the right friends.
[00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:24.220]   - You could volunteer.
[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:25.340]   - Volunteer.
[00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:27.980]   Yeah, I've always thought about that.
[00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:28.900]   There's a trail around here.
[00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:31.140]   I used to hike more and it was closer to our old house.
[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:33.180]   And there was a group that maintained the trail.
[00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:34.220]   I was like, that'd be cool.
[00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:35.060]   - Yeah.
[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:37.020]   - Like you would really get to know that trail well
[00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:40.900]   and like trail maintenance and get to spend time outside.
[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:42.380]   So go for it CT.
[00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:44.140]   I think Jesse and I both agree.
[00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:46.220]   Sign up for lots of things, do lots of things.
[00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:50.860]   All right, well, the final segment I wanna get to
[00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:53.300]   in today's show is the three interesting things.
[00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:56.700]   Before we get there, let me briefly mention
[00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:59.580]   another one of the sponsors that makes this show possible.
[00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:02.420]   That's my personal nighttime savior,
[00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:05.060]   our friends at 8Sleep.
[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:09.940]   8Sleep offers the pod, the only sleep technology
[00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:12.640]   that dynamically cools and heats each side of your bed
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:14.420]   to maintain the optimal sleeping temperature
[00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:15.500]   for what your body needs.
[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:18.000]   With the pod, you can start sleeping as cool as 55 degrees
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.540]   or as hot as a hundred degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:22.700]   So it is a cover you put on top of your mattress
[00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:24.860]   and you put your normal sheet on top of that.
[00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:27.220]   It hooks into a very quiet running box.
[00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:30.420]   You keep somewhere back behind your bed
[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:32.340]   and it has these capillary systems.
[00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:35.060]   So it can cool or heat what's going on in the bed.
[00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:36.260]   I have been pitching this.
[00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:39.380]   I have been doing this pitch to people IRL.
[00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:42.260]   Multiple occasions in the last few weeks,
[00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:44.160]   I've just made people one-on-one pitches
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:45.900]   why they should get an 8Sleep.
[00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:49.320]   And because this is personal experience,
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:50.940]   controlling a temperature of the mattress
[00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:52.540]   makes such a big difference for sleep quality.
[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:55.260]   So for me, I can keep it just a little bit cool
[00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:58.060]   and it makes a big difference for me.
[00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:00.340]   My bed's not cold.
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:01.780]   Instead, what the 8Sleep is doing
[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:04.720]   is pulling away all the extra heat I might generate.
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.820]   So it's, I don't get hot.
[01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:08.740]   All throughout the night,
[01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:11.060]   it feels like it feels when you first get into the bed,
[01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:12.540]   when it's a little bit cool, kind of comfortable,
[01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:13.760]   it just keeps it there.
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:16.260]   So 8Sleep, I'm telling you from personal experience,
[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:18.500]   really does improve the quality of your sleep.
[01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:21.780]   Crucially, it can control both sides of the bed separately.
[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:23.620]   So if you're in bed with someone
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:25.980]   with different temperature needs, no worries,
[01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:28.580]   they can do their own thing.
[01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:34.420]   So 8Sleep is now on the third generation, the Pod 3,
[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:37.660]   which enables even more accurate sleep and health tracking
[01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:39.180]   with double the amount of sensors.
[01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:41.820]   So in addition to that precise control,
[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:42.940]   it actually can figure out,
[01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:44.340]   are you asleep, are you not asleep?
[01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:46.300]   It tracks metrics, it's all in an app,
[01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.500]   and then it shows you in the morning,
[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:49.380]   here's what your sleep is like, here's how it's going.
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:51.620]   So if you're into the quantified life type of things,
[01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:54.700]   they're getting pretty good at that as well.
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:57.260]   So the Pod is not magic, but it feels like it.
[01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:58.980]   Of the different things I endorse on the show,
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:01.180]   it's the thing I for sure use every single day
[01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:02.220]   because I sleep on it every night.
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:07.220]   So go to 8sleep.com/deep and save $150 on the Pod.
[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:10.340]   8Sleep currently ships within the US, Canada, the UK,
[01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:12.040]   select countries in the EU and Australia.
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:17.040]   That's 8sleep, E-I-G-H-T, sleep.com/deep.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:22.020]   Also wanna talk about our friends at Ladder.
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:26.920]   So this is a busy time of year.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.440]   The holidays are happening.
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:32.260]   You're about to enter into the New Year's resolution crunch.
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:35.300]   Probably one of the things you have on that list,
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:36.780]   or maybe one of the things you have on that list
[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:39.540]   is it's time to finally get life insurance.
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:40.660]   You know you need life insurance
[01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:43.100]   to protect those who depend on you.
[01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:44.980]   You've probably been procrastinating.
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:47.860]   Now it's time to actually do it.
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:51.180]   And the way to do it is to use Ladder.
[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:54.960]   Ladder is a 100% digital, no doctors, no needles,
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:56.540]   no paperwork if you're applying
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:59.140]   for $3 million in coverage or less.
[01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:01.740]   Instead, you just answer a few questions on a website
[01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:04.380]   and then it comes back and gives you quotes.
[01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:05.580]   So you need just a few minutes
[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:07.380]   on a phone or a laptop to apply.
[01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:08.940]   Their smart algorithm works in real time
[01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:11.140]   and you'll find out if you're instantly approved.
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:13.320]   No hidden fees, cancel any time,
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:14.800]   get a full refund if you change your mind
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.640]   in the first 30 days.
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:18.420]   Ladder policies are insured by insurers
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:20.420]   with long proven histories of paying claims.
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:25.420]   They're rated A and A+ by AM Best, so you can trust them.
[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:29.500]   It just makes the task of getting life insurance simple.
[01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.860]   You go to ladderlife.com/deep,
[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:34.620]   type, type, type, click, click, click, you're done.
[01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:37.020]   Take that off the list, go on to the next thing,
[01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:38.640]   the next New Year resolution.
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.740]   So go to ladderlife.com/deep today
[01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:42.300]   to see if you're instantly approved.
[01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:46.900]   That's L-A-D-D-E-R life.com/deep,
[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:50.140]   ladderlife.com/deep.
[01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:55.340]   All right, we're up to the last segment of our show.
[01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:56.500]   That's three interesting things.
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:59.060]   That's where I take three interesting things
[01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:01.980]   that readers have sent me
[01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:04.780]   to my interesting@calnewport.com email address
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:07.820]   from the world of the news and internet and media
[01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:10.760]   that are relevant to our goal of living a deep life.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:14.420]   If you are watching on the YouTube channel,
[01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:16.020]   youtube.com/calnewportmedia,
[01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:17.620]   you will see everything I'm talking about.
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:21.060]   If you're just listening, I'll narrate what's going on here.
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:24.080]   But in the three interesting things segment, I have visuals.
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:27.040]   All right, the first interesting thing to talk about
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:30.060]   is an article by an up and coming brilliant young writer.
[01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:32.740]   The article is called "On Teenage Luddites,"
[01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:34.220]   and it was published by me
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:37.780]   on my newsletter at calnewport.com.
[01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:39.920]   on December 16th.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:44.020]   So this article, I just wanted to briefly mention it
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:47.940]   'cause it's reacting to a New York Times piece
[01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:50.040]   that essentially everybody sent me.
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.900]   So the New York Times published this piece,
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:54.540]   and I have its exact title in here.
[01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:56.240]   Let me scroll here and find it.
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:00.260]   So the exact title of this New York Times piece was
[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:03.780]   "Luddite Teens Don't Want Your Likes."
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:07.040]   And it was written by Alex Vadikul.
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:10.720]   Who hung out with the Luddite Club,
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.440]   a group of Brooklyn high school students
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.840]   who have an informal organization dedicated
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:18.520]   to promoting a lifestyle of self-liberation
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:19.400]   from social media technology.
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:21.960]   I have a typo, look at this, "literation."
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.880]   No one has pointed out that typo to me yet,
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:25.240]   so no one's really reading.
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:29.320]   So the article, this New York Times article opens
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:30.240]   on a meeting of the club.
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:33.460]   It's being held on a dirt mound in Prospect Park.
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:35.680]   Some of the members are drawing in sketch pads
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:38.320]   or watercoloring, they're reading books.
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.280]   One of the teenagers was reading Bothius's
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:41.780]   "The Constellation of Philosophy,"
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:44.400]   which is both impressive and hilarious.
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:48.640]   Someone else, and this is true, was whittling a stick.
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:49.920]   And it's a group of teenagers,
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:52.480]   they're like, "We don't wanna be on our phones all day."
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:55.440]   The article goes on to talk to the founder of the group,
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.960]   a 17-year-old named Logan Lane, who said,
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.320]   "Although it was hard to recruit members,
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.500]   "word is now spreading."
[01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.160]   They've heard of at least three different chapters
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:07.840]   that might be forming at other New York area high schools.
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.920]   So my point in this article, so my article
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:11.420]   on teenage Luddites was responding
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:12.640]   to this New York Times article.
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:16.160]   And essentially I was saying, "I told you so."
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:21.160]   In particular, I cited in my article how back in 2019,
[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:23.900]   when I was on tour for Digital Minimalism,
[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:27.800]   I started to come across parents who were telling me stories
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:30.640]   about their teenagers quitting social media,
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:33.160]   and in some cases, handing in their smartphones
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:38.160]   for dumber phones, as an act of authentic self-liberation.
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:42.680]   That it was a counter-cultural move to not use those tools.
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:44.600]   So they weren't slinking away from this
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.040]   and hoping they didn't lose all their friends.
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:48.120]   These were tales of teenagers who were trying
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:49.440]   to impress each other by saying,
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.600]   "Look, I don't use those things.
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.720]   "They can't tell me what to do."
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.600]   And I have been arguing ever since then,
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:57.120]   when I'm in interviews and people ask me
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.680]   with a solemn face, "Well, what about teens?
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:01.400]   "Teens in technology?
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:03.680]   "They're a goner."
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:05.280]   I say, "I'm more optimistic."
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:07.720]   Because of those stories I heard from parents
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.220]   back when I was promoting Digital Minimalism,
[01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:12.840]   I was convinced that this will emerge.
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:15.920]   Leaving social media, leaving the attention economy
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:19.080]   will emerge as a counter-culture.
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:21.920]   Something that is cool or authentic among teenagers.
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:23.760]   And using these services will be seen
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:26.740]   as what's more old-fashioned.
[01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:30.240]   So I think teenagers were going to liberate themselves
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.200]   from these technologies.
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.800]   But here was my quote,
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:34.140]   "We don't need to convince teenagers
[01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:35.640]   "to stop using their phones.
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:37.420]   "We just need them to discover on their own
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:39.620]   "just how uncool these online media conglomerates
[01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:42.100]   "with their creepy geek overlords really are."
[01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:45.080]   I think what's really helped accelerate that
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:49.360]   has been the dethroning of the CEOs of these tech companies
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:52.360]   from being geek heroes to being,
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:55.800]   at least in the perspective of a lot of mainstream media,
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.620]   Bond villains.
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:07:01.080]   So what could be less cool if you're a 17-year-old
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:05.040]   in Brooklyn than trying to support Mark Zuckerberg
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:06.760]   or trying to support Elon Musk?
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:10.000]   So I think this de-romanticization is already happening.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.480]   So this article in the New York Times,
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:17.480]   I found and presented as a signal that my prediction
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.120]   of this counter-cultural movement
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.760]   is beginning to pick up speed.
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.440]   That we're going to see more and more of this going forward.
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.960]   And the reason why I'm more confident about this
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.360]   than I ever have been before
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.360]   is the following quote from Logan Lane,
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:33.160]   the founder of the Brooklyn-based Luddite Club.
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:35.560]   Lane said in that New York Times article,
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:37.520]   "My parents are so addicted.
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:40.560]   "My mom got on Twitter and I've seen it tear her apart.
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:42.020]   "I guess I like being offline
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:44.600]   "because I get to feel a little superior to them."
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:48.880]   Zuckerberg is screwed, Musk is screwed,
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:51.380]   ByteDance, the maker of TikTok is screwed.
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:55.040]   If kids start seeing, hey, this is something my parents do
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:58.800]   and I get to feel superior to them by not being on my phone,
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.400]   they will walk over hot coals to do that.
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.440]   So I found that all to be quite positive.
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:07.800]   All right, interesting thing, number two,
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.960]   it's a quote sent to me in an email.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:12.160]   So I have the whole email here.
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:17.000]   This was from Carl, I blacked out his actual email address,
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.440]   but I thought this was cool.
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.680]   He said, "Look, I just read this quote
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.600]   "by the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:25.340]   "in his book, The Meditations.
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:27.520]   "It made," and I'm jumping over some things here.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.400]   "It made me think, hey, wait a second,
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:32.400]   "he's talking about deep work."
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:34.140]   So here's the Marcus Aurelius quote.
[01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:37.640]   This is from book two of The Meditations, section five.
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:39.880]   "Firmly as a Roman and a man should,
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:42.620]   "think at all times how you can perform the task at hand
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:45.000]   "with precise and genuine dignity,
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.880]   "sympathy, independence, and justice,
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:51.120]   "making yourself free from all other preoccupations."
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:54.100]   Well said Marcus Aurelius.
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:59.260]   One might assume he would not be a big fan of TikTok.
[01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:03.100]   So I like that, "Make yourself free of all preoccupations
[01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:04.820]   "so you can perform the task at hand
[01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:07.520]   "with dignity, sympathy, and independence."
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:08.340]   Well said.
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:10.960]   All right, third interesting thing.
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:15.600]   I thought we'd do a little bit of deep life,
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.940]   an injection of deep life aspiration
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:19.200]   in honor of the holiday season.
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:22.680]   We're all at home, taking a week off work.
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:26.360]   Let's get our daydreaming muscles fired up here.
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:29.040]   So a listener sent me this article.
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.280]   Oh, look at this picture, Jesse.
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:34.460]   All right, so for those who are listening, not watching,
[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:35.960]   there is a picture of a cabin
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:39.600]   surrounded by snow-laden evergreens
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:41.180]   with probably like a foot and a half of snow
[01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:42.320]   on the cabin's roof.
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:44.920]   And you can see mountains in the background.
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:46.820]   This is from Outside Magazine.
[01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:48.540]   Here's the title.
[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:51.940]   "We left the city for a teeny cabin in a ski town.
[01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:54.120]   "We don't regret a thing."
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:56.780]   I don't even have to read this article.
[01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:58.580]   I think we get the gist.
[01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:00.780]   It's a single mom and her daughter,
[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.840]   tired of city life in Densver,
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:04.520]   got rid of most of their stuff,
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:06.120]   move into a 110-year-old cabin
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:08.600]   in Steamboat Springs, Colorado.
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:10.600]   They ski all the time.
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.360]   They're kind of in the middle of nowhere.
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:14.040]   It's beautiful, and they love it.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.880]   So there we go.
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.440]   It's just a little injection
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:23.340]   of deep life aspiration serum straight into your veins.
[01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:25.540]   If this is resonating with you, just ask the question,
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:27.380]   what about this is resonating?
[01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:28.580]   That is how you support
[01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:30.580]   your own lifestyle-centric career planning.
[01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:32.620]   You begin to encounter stories like this
[01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:33.740]   that hit you in the right way.
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:35.080]   You try to figure out what about it
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:35.920]   hits you in the right way.
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:37.220]   You isolate that.
[01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:39.220]   You collect these isolated attributes,
[01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:41.140]   which you then put into your lifestyle vision,
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:43.580]   and then you get to use those to help shape
[01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:46.340]   or create your own version of what this author
[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:48.440]   and their 14-year-old daughter did.
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:49.740]   So that looks good to me.
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:53.680]   All right, everyone, I will let you get back
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:56.160]   to your Festivus feats of strength
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:57.720]   and airing of grievances.
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:58.760]   Hopefully your Festivus pole
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:01.200]   has been decorated well this year.
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:05.240]   I'll be back next week with another episode of the show.
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:08.580]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:12.220]   (upbeat music)
[01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:14.800]   (upbeat music)
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:17.840]   (upbeat music)
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:20.420]   (upbeat music)
[01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:21.600]   (upbeat music)
