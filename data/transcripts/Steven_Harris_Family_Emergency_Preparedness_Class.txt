[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Enjoying your podcast? We'll be brief.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   If you're looking for the perfect holiday gift,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   give Scratchers from the California Lottery.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   With so many to choose from,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   you're sure to find the right gift for anyone on your list.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Now that your holiday shopping list is figured out,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   enjoy this bird singing Jingle Bells.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   [Birds chirping]
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Give the gift of Scratchers from the California Lottery.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   A little play can make your day.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Please play responsibly.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Must be 18 years or older to purchase, play, or claim.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   The audio you are about to hear
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   is a recording from a family emergency preparedness class
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   conducted and presented by Stephen Harris.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Stephen Harris is a man who comes from a professional background
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   in the automotive and energy industry,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   and he's also had a tremendous amount of experience
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   in teaching emergency preparedness and civil defense.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   This class is one of the most practical
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   family emergency preparedness classes that I have ever heard.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   I found it to be incredibly useful over the years,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   very, very practical,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   and I hope that you find it also to be useful and practical.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Some of the information over time can become out of date,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   so after listening to the class,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   I would recommend that you check out some of Steve's other websites.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Starting at his website, Stephen, S-T-E-V-E-N,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Stephen1234.com.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Stephen1234.com is a website where he links to many of his other pages
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   with newer, more updated information.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   He has a page called solar1234.com
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   that has a tremendous amount of valuable information on it.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   He has a number of other websites,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   including links to his knowledgepublications.com,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   where he sells books and DVDs of information on energy.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   He has many other websites that are linked to from Stephen1234.com.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   So if you enjoy and appreciate the information,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   make sure to click on that and go over to that website at Stephen1234.com
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   and see what projects Stephen Harris is working on today.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   The following is a free seminar on family preparedness.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   It was given by Stephen E. Harris
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   to the City of Warren, Michigan, Civilian Emergency Response Team
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   on June 26, 2003.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   It covers the majority of subjects a family needs to know
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   to help protect themselves in the time of a disaster.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   This file can be found at www.knowledgepublications.com.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   That's K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E-P-U-B-L-I-C-A-T-I-O-N-S.com.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And more information on Mr. Harris can be found at www.stephenharris.net.

[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Anyways, I want to thank everyone for coming here.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   This is going to be a pretty fun seminar and a fun class,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   and we appreciate your enthusiasm.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   A lot of people said they just wanted to come here to learn.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   They thought they had something new.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Some people came here saying that they had something specific they wanted to find out.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And it's very encouraging to see the amount of people who come in here just because they want to learn something
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   and kind of exploring to see what they can't find out.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   We have all too little of that happening today in general.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   My name is Stephen Harris.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   I work with the Warren Civilian Emergency Response Team.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   That's the CERT team for you people who are newbies here, where we are going to try to recruit you.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   I also work for Doctors for Disaster Preparedness.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   That is a civil defense and health organization that is concerned with the greater health issues of citizens of the United States
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   and sometimes elsewhere.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   My background is I went to school for electrical engineering education, and I also have a ham radio license.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Some of my background is in the early '90s.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Before, I used to develop strategic simulations like combat simulators and fun stuff.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   I wish I didn't get out of that field.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And all through the '90s, I worked in the scientific laboratories of Chrysler and Daimler Chrysler,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   and one of my specialties was electrochemistry.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Currently, I am a consultant, private consultant in the energy field.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   I specialize in hydrogen, fuel cells, solar, reformation, bioenergy,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   and you'll see how I intertwine energy and how very important energy is to our lives.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   The reason you're here -- and we can live in a city like this -- and what kills you is lack of energy.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   We're here because we have a lot of energy, and what harms you is a lack of energy.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   We're here because we have a lot of energy,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   and what will kill you very quickly is what happens because you don't have any energy.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   If you want more information, you can go to stevenharris.net -- S-T-E-V-E-N-H-A-R-R-I-S dot N-E-T.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Some of the references of some things I will be talking about you can get in a free book
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   called "Nuclear War Survival Skills."
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   I have up at USA Homeland Defense dot com.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   We had that name, Homeland Defense, long before 9/11, and it became really popular.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   So we've been very committed to civil defense and protecting people
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   before it became a news event and part of world history.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Now, it's just the cases are there so you can distinguish the difference as you're reading it
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   so it doesn't look like a jumble of letters.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Okay.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Preparedness, okay?
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   I don't call this survivalism.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   I don't call this kooky stuff.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   I call this family preparedness.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Preparedness is not things you have.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   It is what you know.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   It's what you have between your ears.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   If you've got a goofy little light like this, okay, it's got a light on one end
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   and it's got a strobing beacon, "Help, help!
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   I'm being repressed.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Come help me.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Here's my beacon."
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   This does not keep you safe, okay?
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Preparedness, what we're going to teach you tonight, is not stuff.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   We're going to teach you principles, things that I can't take away from you.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   If I give you a class on CPR, you now know how to resuscitate human beings
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   who are of cardiac and respiratory failure.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   If you walk away from this building five, ten years from now, you still retain that knowledge.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   You don't need a gizmo, a thing, a stuff with you to save that person's life.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   That's what we're going to teach you here in the family preparedness class.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   You don't need stuff like this.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   If you rely upon your stuff, your things, okay, your little stoves and cook camps
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   and special knives, and you get someplace and you're without it.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   You're driving through San Francisco and an earthquake happens,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   and you're on the freeway, and everything comes down around you--
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   no power, buildings down, people in panic--
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   and you've got all your stuff here in Michigan, what are you going to do?
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   You're going to give up.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   You're going to die.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   If you rely upon your stuff and you get caught without your stuff, you feel helpless,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   and you're going to act helpless, and you're going to become a victim.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   So what we're going to do is put stuff in your mind,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   so if you're out in San Francisco and the whole place comes down around you,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   you're going to know how, where, and what is a resource to you,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   and how to find it, get it, use it for the areas that you're sensitive to,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   the things that are going to kill you or harm you or other people.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   So keep that in mind.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   We're showing some things today, but I'm using things to illustrate principles.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   They're not hard and fast rules.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   They're not recipes.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   They're just methods of accomplishing what you want to do.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Another name for this is expedient civil defense.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Expedient civil defense is what you have around you.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Things around you that you have on you or around you or in your house
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   are resources for different things that you don't even realize.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   For example, we have a big storm coming today.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   High winds.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Knocks off a tree branch.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   It comes down like a missile.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Puts a hole this big right through your roof, right through the shingles,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   right into the bathroom, shatters the toilet.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   You're looking up.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   The rain is coming in.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   How are you going to stop that leak with what you have in your house?
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Not a leak.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   That's the answer I was looking for.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Very, very few people will look at a shower curtain as anything but a shower curtain.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   It's a large piece of plastic that is waterproof.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   It is about the largest piece of waterproof plastic you have in your average house
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   unless you've got tarps or other things or other bigger pieces of plastic put away.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Thermal draperies have plastic.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Fiberglass.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   That's good thinking.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Fiberglass what?
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Some of the longer curtains have fiberglass lining in them.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   It might be water permeable.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Okay.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   People who answer questions get a card that you put your name on or initial or some other type of identification mark.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   We have door prizes.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   I want you to stay through the whole thing.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   So at the end of the class, I am going to pick up all the cards,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   and we're going to put them in a hat and draw them.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   And the person whose name I draw, obviously you ask more questions, you get more cards.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   The better chance you get to win the door prize.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Dumb questions get two cards.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Okay.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   But this is what I mean by expedient civil defense.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   We're going to be talking about this.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   What is in your house, and how can you use it when you need it?
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Don't look at a shower curtain as a S-H-O-W-E-R-C-U-R-T-A-I.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Okay.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Everything comes down.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Five counties, Macomb, Wayne, Oakland, St. Clair, Monroe, no power, two weeks.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   For whatever reason, what are you going to do?
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   For what?
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Fire and light.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   What's your question?
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   I'll give you three cards for that answer.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   Candles.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   No candles.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   No, it's just like, okay, here's, you know, it's more of a rhetorical question.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   What are you going to do?
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   I mean, you're losing a lot of stuff.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Well, five counties.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   How about five states?
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Pennsylvania.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Gone.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   No power.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Do you think it can happen?
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   I was out in Arizona doing vehicle development work.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   I think it was '96 or '97, and we had 11 states out.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Eleven states out.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Something happened to the power lines, a cascade failure.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Eleven states from Washington to Arizona, including New Mexico, out of power.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Okay.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   It's not like you have a thunderstorm, we might have today.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   And you're in Warren.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   You've got no power.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   What do you do?
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   Well, you go to the motel or the hotel in Sterling Heights or up in Shelby Township.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   You say, oh, okay, we're going to -- you know.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   You've got 11 states out.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   You ain't going nowhere.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Where are you going to go?
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   You've got to stay home.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   And what's going to happen to you while you're staying home?
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   What do you lose?
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   We'll get to that in a minute, but what can cause this?
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   An EMT burst, a nuclear detonation high up in the atmosphere.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   It can bring down the power grid.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   It can also eliminate -- most electronics won't work.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   It's a complex subject, which I won't get into.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   Here's a more recent one.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   SARS going rampant.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   We've had three emerging infections in two years, plus an anthrax attack.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Who can tell me the three emerging infections we've had in the last two years?
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   Emerging means we've never had these diseases in the continental United States before.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Monkeypox.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   What else?
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   SARS is up there, but you get a card anyway.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   I think you said West Nile first.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Okay, we've had three emerging infections in the last two years.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   We've not had this.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Normally we get one emerging infection every 40 years.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   We've had three and two.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   I should tell you, our world is a little bit different today.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   SARS shut down Asia.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   You don't realize it because you're not reading the Asian news.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Okay, this is people not going to work.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   I've got news for you.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   If it was 10 times worse, 100 times worse -- and there are agents and diseases out there that are 10 and 100 times worse than SARS.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   They are wildfire what they'll go through a population.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Your power grid is going to come down from lack of maintenance or other issues.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   What if you have people not going to work and you get a thunderstorm like around here?
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   A million people are out of power.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   How fast do you think those people are going to want to go out and fix the power lines?
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   So the power can come down for a lot of reasons.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Oh, anthrax.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   We've had an anthrax attack.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   It was kindergarten.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   It was nothing.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   It cost a guy $1.25 to shut down half the postal system for about a month.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   A study from the government was 200 pounds of anthrax released airily at an optimum temperature environment with an optimal dispersion unit
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   would kill 2 million people in Washington, D.C.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   What do you think that's going to do to your infrastructure?
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   You're going to want to stay home.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   If you're scared and power problems, ice storms can do this and have done it, you want to cripple a city, shoot one driver a day.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   The guy driving the gas truck, you know, the big trucks, shoot him.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   You're not going to blow the thing up, I guarantee you, okay?
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   This ain't Hollywood.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Gas trucks don't go up in big balls of fire from one little bullet.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Just shoot the driver.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   How long do you think before the gas stations start running out of gas?
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   A day and a half.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   You don't have gas.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Can you go to the grocery store?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Can you go to the bank?
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Can you go to work?
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   Most of us commute 30 miles a day on average.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   You're stuck with what you got, and food deliveries aren't going to be coming in that quickly either.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Let's see, bring down the power grid, go out and shoot a bunch of large transformers, wait for the repair crews to come and shoot them.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   This is what terrorists have an option to do in this country.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   If you shoot the repair crews coming to fix something, you take out 20 more large substations,
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   how quickly do you think the repair people are going to want to go out and fix those repair stations?
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   They're going to have to have rings of police around them before they even go in to begin to fix that stuff.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   So it's not just big things, nuclear weapons.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   I mean, one man crippled the entire D.C. area and put it into fear for a number of weeks, okay?
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   One man, one rifle, one bullet a day did it.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   It can happen here as well.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   So anyways, how long do you think the power will be out, and do you want to bet your life on it?
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   You say, "Oh, it won't be out for three days."
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   You want to bet your family on it?
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Nuclear detonation, it's not the nuke that kills you, it's the lack of infrastructure.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   You can choose it's any weapon, any natural disaster.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   It's not the immediate effects.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   Nuclear weapons really aren't that big, okay?
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   You just don't have one of them and it doesn't kill everyone in southeast Michigan.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   They're really pretty small these days in comparison, but it brings down the power grid.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   It stops the emergency response.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   It destroys a lot of roads and infrastructure, and it's the people on the outside where most of us live
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   that are going to suffer from the lack of power.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   We have a cute quote in the civil defense industry.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   You know the nice thing about a nuclear weapon?
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   You know when one's gone off.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   A biological agent's silent attack, you don't know what's happened until people start developing the symptoms.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   But you always know when a nuclear detonation's gone off.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Bright light, big bang, you can say, "It's right there."
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   You know to run right there and go help people.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   You don't know that in a biological.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   So here's what happens when we're talking about no power.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   You have no lights, no water, no sewage.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Your toilet is not going to work.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Even if you did have water, the sewage lines have pumps that pump the sewage up and over hills
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   and back down to the sewage treatment plant.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   We all don't live uphill in the sewage treatment plant at all.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Don't flow downhill.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   You have no traffic lights.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   You have no refrigeration.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   You have no radios, no television, no communications, no ATM, no banks, no Visa cards.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   How much cash in your pocket?
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   Everyone open up their wallet real quickly, briefly.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Your wallet, your purse.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Just tell me roughly how much cash you got.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   About $18.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   $18.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   $11.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   $11.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   One young, 31.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   You'll probably be the highest here.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Okay, she's got the high.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   What do you got?
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   $53.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Huh?
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   $53.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   $53.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:51.160]   880 or you just want a card? He just got paid. What was the average answer 1020 30? I got
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:18:00.860]   over 200.200 you get a card okay. I can live a lie how would you like to be standing there
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:06.240]   going I need food and you run to the grocery store and the cash registers aren't working
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:10.200]   they're sitting there with calculators the ATM you know there's no communications no
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:16.080]   power lines this just happened you're there and you want to buy a bunch of food and you
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:22.240]   got 30 bucks in your pocket or 20. I mean if you think I'm going to go off and buy myself
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.080]   a month's worth of food at the last minute when something happens and you got 20 bucks
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:31.080]   in your pocket you're mistaken except I'll show you how to buy 20 months a month's worth
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:35.360]   of food for 20 bucks. You got a question? I beat him but wouldn't there be like riots
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:42.960]   and stuff? Yeah yeah there's an old saying any city is three days away from a riot. I'm
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:53.840]   going to take back your card for talking. I'm sorry no I'm. I gave you a card already.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:19:08.440]   Okay I work for you. Now okay you get my point you got 10 20 30 bucks in you that's all you
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:15.920]   got to get foods some people have 200 you're going to ask them can I mow your grass. There's
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:23.160]   a disaster. What else is gone when the power is gone you got no refineries no trucks coming
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.960]   in no deliveries everyone wants to go to the grocery store they're at worse than 1/10th
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.520]   capacity the registers aren't working the scanners aren't working okay and they're using
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.480]   little they can even grocery stores do have hand calculators for every station okay so
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:40.120]   they can check you out manually they are prepared for this okay it's just they're going to be
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:46.920]   very efficient. A young man asked about riots the police are overwhelmed. They got no power
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:51.640]   the alarm systems are going off like crazy half the signals aren't getting in and the
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:57.560]   bad actors in our society are going hey you know we can go in over there the cops aren't
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:01.680]   going to know they're going to show up if they can show up so you have a criminal element
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:10.240]   who may take advantage of the situation but generally what happens is after your children
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:15.720]   are hungry for three days and without water and you're becoming desperate and someone
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:22.360]   else has food and you don't like them or their lawyer you're going to go take it from them
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:26.760]   okay because your kids are more important if I had a bunch of food and you knew where
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:31.480]   I lived and your kids were hungry wouldn't you think about coming and trying to get some
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:37.360]   food for your kids? Through one tactic or another. There are some people here who are
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:44.080]   going to use the other tactic so yeah there is a civil unrest and civil disobedience section
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:48.600]   that goes along with this but we're going to talk about keeping you protected from these
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.640]   situations. Hurricane Andrew perfect example you don't know what happened during Hurricane
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:56.240]   Andrew it became quite lawless down there and people stood out in front of their house
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:02.920]   with AK-47s and any other type of weapon. They stood in front of their hubble their
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:07.160]   heap and said this heap is mine okay don't you come in looking through the stuff. The
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:13.320]   police actually said during Hurricane Andrew if you're attacked or you know shoot, shoot
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:18.520]   the person put the body up by the street we'll come pick it up. It was martial law it was
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:23.760]   almost every person for themselves in some situations. That can and does happen in the
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:30.800]   world. So you're standing there watching TV or not watching TV and you're sitting there
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:35.120]   and it was me it was 9.50am in the morning and a phone call came in and said Steve turn
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.280]   on the TV. You're sitting there and you're watching both the towers burning and one of
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:44.880]   them collapses down in front of you and you're going oh great did they release a biological
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:50.440]   agent are there 30 airplanes coming in we don't know what's going to happen. You're
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:55.680]   sitting there and you go I don't have any food, water, what's coming. You get this wonderful
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.400]   sinking feeling in your legs. You ever have it? Like you're looking over a bridge like
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:04.800]   this okay looking way down you get this horrible sinking feeling in your legs you're going
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:12.400]   what am I going to do you don't want that to happen. On 9.11 the first thing I did was
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:18.120]   went to the bank with all my money. The second thing I did was I went to the grain elevator
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:25.640]   up in Armada and I bought 1500 pounds of corn. Now I have two years worth of food for I have
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:30.520]   about a year and a half for two people okay. A year easily nice and comfortable. I went
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:35.400]   and bought 1500 pounds of corn. Cost me a grand total of $110. You know why I bought
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:45.200]   that? Why did I buy? No it does and believe me I had a problem with it going bad. I had
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:49.320]   plenty of storage for myself. I had plenty of storage. Why do you think I bought 1500
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:56.760]   pounds of corn? No actually I make some of the meanest corn bread in the world and I
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:02.680]   don't care to eat it. Because it's easier to feed your neighbors than it is to shoot
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:08.200]   them. I didn't know what was coming next. I bought it for my neighbors. Now it's a whole
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:12.120]   nother class but I can show you how to do some miracle stuff with corn. It's a wonderful
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:19.200]   food. 1500 pounds for $110 how could you get any cheaper? You need some cooking class.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.400]   But tell you what when my neighbors get hungry they'll sit there and they'll turn the grinder
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:27.480]   with the corn in them real quickly. We're eating the storage. I had a friend of mine
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:31.880]   he went to Costco he likes oysters. They bought a bunch of smoked oysters and they put it
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:35.960]   in their pantry. So they're eating the smoked oysters and the neighbors are grinding the
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:40.640]   corn but I tell you what they'll be very happy to grind the corn. That's not in this class
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:47.280]   though. That's what I did at 9/11. I didn't have that sinking feeling in me. You're vulnerable
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:55.600]   okay? Down for whatever reason. Stuff is down, it's not working. What can kill you? Everything's
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:00.080]   not working. What's the first thing that can kill you? What are you most vulnerable to?
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.280]   What's the most important thing to have in your supplies?
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.280]   Water.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.280]   Huh?
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.280]   First thing you need is food.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.280]   Medication.
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:12.320]   That's one for you. One for you. What have you said? What's the most important? Most
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.360]   people are saying water. Do you think water is the most important thing to have in your
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:16.360]   supplies?
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.360]   Water.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.360]   Wrong.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.360]   Wrong answer.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.360]   Wrong on water.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.360]   They were in here man. I mean, we're in a really good tier.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:39.640]   I took a card away. Wrong. It is not the important thing. Clothing is the most important thing
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:48.680]   to have. Clothing is your mobile personal shelter. You're saying water because it's
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:56.520]   90 degrees outside today. What if this class is in December? Weather kills in minutes.
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:01.400]   I stopped for a guy on 696 when he had a cold snap. It was 20 below. So I'll say it was
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:07.120]   5 below. He was walking down 696. He was wearing a lightweight fall jacket. Maybe a little
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:11.720]   bit heavier, but not a winter jacket. He was walking down 696. He had a mile to go to the
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.280]   exit. You know what? If I didn't stop and pick him up, he would not have made it. He
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:22.880]   would have been dead. Minus 5 degrees Fahrenheit with 20 mile per hour winds. A healthy adult
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:30.160]   human being, you can be dead in 15 minutes or less.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.160]   Who said huh?
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:42.200]   I have a freezer at home that gets down to minus 80. Why don't I get down to minus 5
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:51.080]   and put you in there for a few minutes? You'll understand what I mean. Weather kills in minutes.
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.880]   Without water, you die how quickly?
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.440]   Within a week.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:59.500]   A week. Let's say three to seven days, depending upon your health condition, your hydration.
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:03.800]   Some people can die in a day. Generally it's three to seven days. And the last two days
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:09.760]   are miserable. No water kills in days. How long before you die of food starvation?
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:10.760]   A week.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:19.580]   Weeks. Two weeks to a month at least. Some of us can go a little longer. Without vitamins
[00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:26.480]   and nutrients, you're not going to have any problems, lack of nutrients for months to
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:31.240]   a year. Then it's more problems than it is death.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:41.440]   This is me. One of the things I do is I do -- give me one of your cards. This is me.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:46.360]   We're snow camping. This happens to be 15 degrees Fahrenheit, 30 mile per hour winds,
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:50.600]   12 inches of snow coming down. No tent. We're not in a tent. We've got something else we're
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:55.760]   using. It's a little plastic shelter that we put together that's expedient. And we'll
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:03.600]   camp outside for days below zero. We're not cold, okay? We're not cold at all. And this
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:08.320]   is a whole 20-hour class in itself for doing cold weather stuff.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:37.760]   I'm going to answer that question. You know what you use a cooler for in the wintertime?
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:52.200]   You use a cooler in the wintertime to keep food warm. You use a cooler, okay. It's zero
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:57.280]   degrees Fahrenheit and you have stuff that you don't want to freeze, okay? What might
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:58.800]   not you want to have freeze?
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.800]   Water.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:00.800]   How much water?
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:08.480]   It's like yogurt. I'm just going to say it. It's like yogurt. You don't want your yogurt
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:14.320]   to freeze. You really like your strawberry yogurt. You get ornery if you don't have it.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.920]   Water freezes at what temperature?
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:16.920]   32 degrees.
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:26.120]   32 degrees Fahrenheit. If you have something in water and that water is not solid, meaning
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:32.040]   ice, it will always be 32 degrees Fahrenheit. At atmospheric conditions, you will not get
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:39.880]   water turning to ice with crystals floating around in it below 32. So it's what they used
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:44.520]   to use in root cellars in the old days. They would put barrels of water down in their root
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:49.400]   cellars in the wintertime because as long as that barrel of water was freezing, the
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:53.000]   cellar would not get below 32 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:59.360]   Water is actually releasing heat when it's freezing. That barrel is releasing heat and
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:07.240]   keeping the cellar warm until it's completely solid. So in the wintertime, you use a cooler
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:12.880]   to keep your stuff warm. All you do is dump the ice out that freezes and you put in more
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:17.520]   water from a well and you can keep your stuff from freezing.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:29.160]   Wait till we go on duty. I'm going to have some choice. I'm going to remember this. You
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:40.640]   invited me. This is a 21 hour course in itself. You don't really, in extreme cold weather,
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.720]   you actually don't layer. The one thing to remember is you want to have a thick of a
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:49.400]   layer all the way around you as uniform as possible that permeates moisture. You put
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.800]   your mouth up to it. If you can breathe through it, that's what you want. If you put your
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:56.560]   mouth up to it, you can't breathe through it. You're trapping moisture. And that's what
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:01.920]   moisture control is the secret to cold weather.
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:05.280]   Some interesting stuff about cold weather. At 10 degrees Fahrenheit, you need as much
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:10.560]   water as you do at 100. If it's 10 degrees Fahrenheit, you've got to drink as much as
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:16.160]   if you were in a 100 degree environment. You need that much water. Hydration is very important
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:21.060]   in the wintertime. For us, certain people who are out there helping in the wintertime,
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:25.760]   you've got to have water with you in the winter as important as you do today.
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:34.540]   Okay, hydration. Water drives your heat mechanism in your body. If you become deficient on water,
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:38.880]   your heat mechanism won't be generating. You'll start getting cold. It's a positive feedback
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:44.240]   reaction. It runs away. So you become a little bit hydrated in the wintertime, will very
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:49.400]   quickly can get you dehydrated, can get you into trouble quickly. And you won't know it.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:53.240]   So you really want to force water into your body when it's cold. You're outside at 20
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:58.860]   degrees working with CERT, make sure you're drinking water. You will actually be warmer
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:02.960]   if you're drinking water than if you let yourself get thirsty.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:07.900]   Another important thing about clothing, your personal mobile shelter. What about Pat Boese?
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:13.680]   It was 60 degrees outside and he got hit with 55 degree water. They almost called a real
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:18.800]   emergency to stop the exercise and come take care of him because he was beginning to go
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:26.760]   into the initial stages of hypothermia at 60. 40 degrees and rainy is almost as bad
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:32.000]   as miserable as if you were outside and it was just 10 degrees Fahrenheit. 40 degrees
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.080]   and wet and rain can kill you hypothermically about as quickly as being out in cold water.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:43.040]   So remember, the most important thing is clothing, your mobile personal shelter. You've got to
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:49.520]   have that taken care of before you even begin to think about going on to the next system.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:55.440]   This is Dr. Pat Cutt. He's a friend of mine. I've done a lot of medical work. Anyone interested
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:00.520]   in the extreme cold weather system, it's part of Jim Phillips Powell's system. He teaches
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.280]   winter classes professionally.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:07.960]   Okay, mobile personal shelter is number one. Then what? The most important thing that everyone
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:14.960]   said was water. What is water? Water is not only the water itself, it's what you need
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:20.920]   to hold the water, to disinfect the water, to carry the water, and to consume it. When
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:27.640]   we say water is number two, we mean all of that. Water is no good unless you've got containers
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:34.640]   to move it, haul it, purify it. Contaminated water is no good to you. How much water do
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:37.360]   you need per day?
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:40.000]   Eight to ten glasses.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.440]   Who said a gallon?
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:42.960]   I did.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.000]   Did you say a gallon because she did?
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:45.680]   Two.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:52.680]   Well, today you do. Today you need two gallons. Okay, how much water do you need a day?
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.720]   Eight to ten.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:57.160]   Eight to ten glasses?
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:04.160]   A later average. The answer is, on average, you need a gallon of water. Now let's qualify
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:12.600]   that statement. You need a half a gallon a day to drink at about seven degrees ambient,
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:17.000]   and you're not exerting yourself. If you're exerting yourself, you need a lot more. A
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.720]   mentor and dear friend of mine who worked out in Nevada test sites with experiments
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:26.560]   and stuff told me he would drink nine gallons of water a day when he was in Nevada in the
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:30.040]   field working. Okay, one man, nine gallons, yes.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:34.680]   Why is it so hard to drink a gallon a day if that's what you need?
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:40.760]   Because you ain't thirsty. It's about a half a gallon a day that you need to consume. The
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:47.760]   other half, as the screen says, is for hygiene, cooking, food preparation, and a lot more.
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:51.760]   If you're in a hot environment, you will be drinking water on a very regular basis. I
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:56.640]   spent quite a bit of time in Death Valley at 120 doing vehicle development work, and
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:00.000]   you continually have a bottle of water on you, and you're always sucking on that bottle
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.080]   of water throughout the day.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.720]   What happens when you have to go to the bathroom?
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:08.360]   You hardly ever urinate. In a hot, hot, hot environment, you hardly ever urinate because
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:13.200]   it all comes out through perspiration too quickly. If you consume nine gallons of water,
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:16.840]   it's very unlikely you're going to be urinating that much in a day. It's going to come out
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:21.360]   through sweat and through the hydration of the body. It's really interesting to be in
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.880]   a hot environment like that. It's really, and to observe it from a third person.
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:29.240]   I've been in Death Valley, and the birds walk in your shadow. Literally, you have little
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:33.080]   birds going, "Tee-tee-tee," hopping along as you move because they want to stay in your
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:40.080]   shadow. Hot and cold, much more, okay? A gallon's your benchmark. That's what you want to try
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.960]   to have, okay? Most everyone who has personal preparedness supplies does not have enough
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:53.440]   water. They rely upon their tap. Try to store as much as you can, and we're going to talk
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.520]   about this.
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:59.760]   Okay, where is the water in your house? If I said to you, and it's the only reason you
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:05.040]   came, "You need to fill up 100 gallons of water," here's a challenge to you, Expedient
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:09.840]   Civil Defense. You want to fill 100 gallons of water in 30 minutes in your house, average
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.840]   house. Forget the pool stuff. How are you going to do it?
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.840]   [Audience responds, "Bathtub."]
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.840]   No bath?
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.840]   [Audience responds, "Fire hose."]
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.840]   Bathtub! Hold on, hold on. I've got to check. Wrong! Wrong on the bathtub! You see why I
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:23.840]   say wrong? No, I went to Detroit to get this, okay? I found an abandoned house in Detroit.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:41.840]   Okay, wrong! Not in the bathtub. Oh, who says their bathtub's clean? And they'll drink it,
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:51.920]   right? Okay, you think your bathtub's clean, you've got a residue of all this stuff up
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:56.120]   in there. You start drinking water contaminated with this, I'll wait until the medicine section
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:59.120]   of the seminar will tell you what's going to happen to you.
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.120]   Okay.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.120]   [Audience responds, "Trash cans."]
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:05.120]   Trash cans, trash cans. How are you going to fill up water in your house?
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.120]   [Audience responds, "Water."]
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:13.120]   No, you're just going to... Something's happening right now, okay? Your spider sense is telling
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:18.120]   you, "I better get more water now." You've got a half hour, you want 100 gallons. How
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.120]   are you going to do it?
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.120]   [Audience responds, "Garbage bag."]
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:24.120]   Garbage bag. What are some of the available containers?
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.120]   [Audience responds, "Milk cartons."]
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:32.120]   Milk cartons have an organic contaminant in them called...
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.120]   [Audience responds, "Beer bottles."]
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:40.120]   Beer bottles! What are you going to do to fill up water in your house? 100 gallons. 100
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.120]   beer bottles... Well, maybe in your house.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.120]   [Audience laughs]
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.120]   Trust me, 100 plus.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.120]   [Audience responds, "Ware."]
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:49.120]   No! How are you going to fill up 100 gallons in your house?
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.120]   [Audience responds, "Bath."]
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:54.120]   We've got half the answer, we've got trash bags. What are you going to do with the trash
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.120]   bags?
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.120]   [Audience responds, "Put them in the garbage cans."]
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.120]   Garbage cans, maybe.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.120]   [Audience responds, "Ice cubes."]
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:00.120]   Give me a card back.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.120]   [Audience laughs]
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.120]   [Audience responds, "Oh, you're going to put them in the trash cans."]
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.120]   Yes!
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.120]   [Audience responds, "Line your bathtub."]
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:10.120]   Trash bags, unscented, untreated. Some of the trash bags today have treatments on them.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:16.120]   Unscented trash bags in boxes, in chest of drawers. In the bathtub? Well, I guess you
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:22.120]   could put the plastic bag in the bathtub. In trash cans. Oh, right here. The cheapest
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:28.120]   container in the world. The most space for the least dollar, unless you go to carboards,
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:34.120]   okay? These things right here, plastic coats, 8, 22 gallons for a box. That's cheaper than
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:40.120]   a 30-gallon trash can at 8 bucks. You can put them into here. You've got stuff in there,
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:48.120]   Christmas ornaments? Dump them. Dump the junk out and put the water in there, okay? You
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.120]   can even do it without a trash can.
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:53.120]   [Audience responds, "Well, no, it's the same as Tupperware."]
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:58.120]   No. Tupperware are little things you put in your purse, you take to work, you eat macaroni
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.120]   and cheese out of.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.120]   [Audience responds, "Yeah."]
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:04.120]   Don't say Avon either, okay?
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.120]   [Audience laughs]
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:12.120]   Kiddie pool! Fifteen-dollar kiddie pool! 300 gallons of water. What's this important?
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:17.120]   Not much for us, but I've got friends in Tucson. They run out of water. They're dead.
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:23.120]   They're 50, 60 miles from a lake. They can't leave the valley. It's 100 degrees. You're
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:29.120]   out of water, you're dead. The wells are 1,000 feet deep. They ain't going to get more water.
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:33.120]   If there's something happening, they think their power's going to go out, $15 for something
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:38.120]   you can inflate in 30 seconds with a vacuum cleaner and put 300 gallons of water in is
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:42.120]   a heck of an emergency storage reservoir of water.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:46.120]   Everyone's going to think of swimming pools in Tucson, okay? Everyone's going to be in
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:49.120]   everyone else's swimming pools, and if you want your own personal storage, you've got
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:54.120]   to have something or anything under control. So kiddie pools work good for that.
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:59.120]   But for us in Michigan, trash bags in boxes, drawers, bathtub, trash can, what is water
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:02.120]   in a bathtub good for? Even that bathtub you saw?
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.120]   [Audience responds, "Toilet flush."]
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:08.120]   If you can flush your toilet, it's good for water for--if you've got a bunch of blood
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:14.120]   and other stuff worse than the bathtub, it's good for washing that off. It's good for things
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:17.120]   like that. So we would want water that's called non-potable. Yes, young lady?
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:20.120]   [Audience responds, "How can you get water in a drawer?"]
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.120]   Get what?
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:24.120]   [Audience responds, "How can you get water in a drawer?"]
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.120]   Someone translate, I can't hear.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.120]   [Audience responds, "How can you get water in a drawer?"]
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:33.120]   Trash bag! Put it in the trash bag, put the bag into the drawers.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:37.120]   [Audience responds, "How much does a plastic-filled drain need to get all the water in it?"]
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:41.120]   Water weighs. Who can tell me what water weighs to two digits?
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.120]   [Audience responds, "28."]
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:43.120]   How much does water weigh?
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.120]   [Audience responds, "Eight pounds."]
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.120]   To two digits.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.120]   [Audience responds, "Eight pounds."]
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:54.120]   To two digits, that's one digit. How much can--even in metric, who can tell me what water weighs?
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:40:01.120]   One liter of water is 2.2 kilograms in English units. One gallon of water is 8.3 pounds.
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:09.120]   So 22 times 8.3. You would put it someplace, like in the room, put the trash bag in, and
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:13.120]   then you'd fill it up and leave it in place. You wouldn't be--
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:17.120]   [Audience responds, "Most people would have to drag that, because it's about the size of a meter to fill it up."]
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:24.120]   No, you fill it up in place. You fill it up. You put it where you want it, and you put the hose into--the garden hose--until you fill it up.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.120]   [Audience responds, "You're not dragging it and putting it somewhere."]
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:28.120]   Bring the water to it, Mohammed.
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.120]   [Laughter]
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:34.120]   What's the saying? If you can't bring the water to Mohammed, bring the--Mohammed?
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:37.120]   [Laughter]
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:42.120]   [Audience responds, "You wouldn't drag it, then. You'd put them all in place. You'd get some sort of hose and--"]
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:47.120]   Two--if this thing is full of water, two men can pick this and move it. It actually won't collapse.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:53.120]   This is a good one, okay? Two men can pick up this 18-gallon tote and actually slide it and move it.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:41:01.120]   But it's 8--you know, 20 times 8, 160 pounds. This becomes challenged at that weight.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:05.120]   But it's a good way of filling up water pretty quickly. Okay?
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:10.120]   Drawers--chest of drawers. Normally, like, a foot high. You pull the drawer out, put a bag into it.
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:14.120]   You can store 20, 30 gallons in a chest of drawer real easily.
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:20.120]   I mean, just throw--I mean, do what you normally do. Throw your clothes on the bed.
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:23.120]   Okay, do you understand water and expedient sewage defense?
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:28.120]   This is one thing for you to remember. If something happens, you procrastinate, you don't have any preparedness.
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:33.120]   You're going to have to do it real quickly. If you're in San Francisco, and a big earthquake happens,
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:37.120]   and a fire line is ruptured, you see a bunch of water spurting up in San Francisco,
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:43.120]   or someplace in California where it's even hotter. You know, you're going to be looking for something to hold water.
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:49.120]   Start thinking about plastics and boxes so you can grab the water before it goes away.
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:53.120]   This is what I mean by expedient sewage defense and by principles.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:57.120]   This is what I don't want to leave you when you leave here today. Question?
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:01.120]   He just brought up, what if you have a water bed with the conditioner that you put in the water bed?
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:05.120]   It's horrible, but what can you use the water bed water for?
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:11.120]   That's right, you can use it for that. That's perfectly correct.
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:14.120]   What, he didn't want your card?
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:19.120]   Yeah, but see, it doesn't matter. He had the idea. You're the one who spoke up.
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:21.120]   We talked about that in CERT.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:28.120]   If you see someone having a problem health-wise or something that your training covers, it could be anything,
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:34.120]   you think you're right, you think you can help, you have to step forward and take the initiative and help and treat that person.
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:38.120]   If you're having a heart attack and I think you're going to break his ribs, you don't know what the heck you're doing,
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:40.120]   I'm going to remove you and I'm going to give him CPR.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:44.120]   It's my duty to do that because I think I know how to do it better than you.
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:54.120]   I could be wrong, but nevertheless, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear,
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:58.120]   and the inaction that comes from it is the worst cancer you could ever have.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.120]   Think about that.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:02.120]   So you had the idea, but you didn't voice it to me.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:05.120]   She did it. That's why she got the card.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:10.120]   If you think you need to do something, it's up to you to do it if you think it's right or you shouldn't.
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:16.120]   Don't wait for me to come up and say, "Do you know CPR? Go help him."
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.120]   Question?
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:22.120]   I have a little pool in the backyard, and if you keep it too long, the water, you've got to put chlorine in it.
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:25.120]   How long will this water in these pockets stay open?
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:31.120]   I will cover that question in a bit, but let's cover it right now.
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.120]   Here we go. It's better here than in contact.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:36.120]   I've got water in bottles here.
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:42.120]   These are--well, don't read everything.
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:46.120]   My girlfriend said the same thing, and she believed every sign that happened.
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:53.120]   I said I was going to put a sign on the front door.
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:44:02.120]   So anyways, these are empty soda bottles that are rinsed out with tap water and filled with tap water, and I capped and put away.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:05.120]   These soda bottles happen to be three liters.
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:07.120]   They're 99 cents a piece.
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:09.120]   They're at Kroger's.
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:13.120]   They're my choice for cheap cola, and they're also my choice for a water bottle.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:18.120]   These are made out of what's called PET, polyethylene terephthalate.
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.120]   That's what soda bottles are.
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:20.120]   They don't degrade.
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:22.120]   They'll stay good forever.
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:26.120]   A milk carton will degrade naturally over a period of 6 to 18 months.
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:30.120]   You put water in milk cartons, and if you wash it out really good, you'll start getting leaks.
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.120]   I have done it.
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:35.120]   Okay, everything I'm showing you here, I have done.
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:37.120]   I'm not telling you what someone else said.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.120]   I'm not telling you what was in the book.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:41.120]   Everything I'm showing you, I've done.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.120]   These store for decades.
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:44.120]   Milk cartons don't.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:48.120]   This is the easiest way for you to store water in your house in the event of an emergency.
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:50.120]   A lot of people consume soda and juice.
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:54.120]   Rinse the bottles out and put water into them and store them.
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:57.120]   You store them right on the concrete.
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.120]   Anywhere.
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:59.120]   And it doesn't matter.
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:02.120]   On concrete, it'll disintegrate a little bit faster.
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:05.120]   It happened to me.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:06.120]   Generally, no.
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.120]   It shouldn't.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:10.120]   I can't think of anything that plastic is so unreactive.
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:17.120]   I can't think of anything within the calcium chemistry of concrete that would force deteriorate it any quicker.
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:20.120]   I can tell you the formula for the plastic and for the concrete.
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:22.120]   I can't think of off the top of my head what would do it.
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:24.120]   I could be wrong, but I can't think of anything that would.
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:27.120]   Am I looking at an inch of water in that program?
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:31.120]   You're looking at a three-liter bottle that's 14 inches tall.
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:34.120]   [Audience chatter]
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.120]   Reflection.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.120]   Yeah, my basement's a swimming pool.
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:41.120]   Well, I figured it might maybe have something to do with you storing them outside in the winter.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.120]   No.
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.120]   And if you had them in a vat and you were changing the water so they wouldn't --
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.120]   No, this is in my basement.
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:47.120]   Okay.
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:49.120]   Now, the question is, this is just tap water.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:50.120]   Should I put anything in there?
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:51.120]   No.
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:52.120]   This is city tap water.
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:53.120]   Do I need to put bleach in there or anything?
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.120]   It's already in there.
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.120]   It's already -- that's right.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:46:01.120]   There's more than enough in there that it's just fine.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.120]   What's your question, young lady?
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:11.120]   Why does it -- why doesn't it --
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:14.120]   It's a different chemical formulation of the plastic.
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:18.120]   We make so many milk cartons that we want them to deteriorate in a landfill.
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:22.120]   The milk cartons aren't underneath pressure.
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:26.120]   You take one of these bottles of soda with carbon dioxide in them and you shake them up,
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:30.120]   it can get up to 150 pounds per square inch.
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:34.120]   It's got to be a very strong vessel to handle the carbonation.
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:38.120]   It's shook up in trucks when it's moved, gone over potholes and bumpy roads.
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:40.120]   Not that we have those in Michigan.
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:42.120]   So they've got to be very strong bottles.
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:47.120]   And in order for that, the material science -- it's called material science, okay?
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:49.120]   The material science of the plastic has to be much better.
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:51.120]   It has to be a different formulation.
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:56.120]   Like metal is stronger than wood, this formulation of plastic is superior to the plastic used in milk cartons.
[00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:58.120]   That's a good question.
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.120]   Does the water go bad?
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.120]   Good question.
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:02.120]   That's where we're getting to.
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:07.120]   How often do I have to open up every one of these bottles and pour the water out and refill them?
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.120]   How often do I have to do that?
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:09.120]   Every year.
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:10.120]   When you want to drink.
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:12.120]   That's right, when you want to drink.
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:14.120]   How often do I have to change the water?
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:16.120]   Let's say I've got 500 bottles stored.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:18.120]   How often do I have to do this all this labor?
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:20.120]   You don't.
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:23.120]   All water is about a billion years old.
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.120]   Think about it.
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:26.120]   All water is at least as old as the glaciers.
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:35.120]   Most water can be -- that water you're drinking out of the tap, the actual water molecule can be up to a billion years old.
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:37.120]   So you think your water is going to go spoil on you?
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:39.120]   What happens -- what spoils water?
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:42.120]   You get bacteria.
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:44.120]   You get something growing in it.
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:50.120]   If you don't have anything in there to grow, you don't have a growth medium, like milk residue is a growth medium.
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:55.120]   You don't have any bacteria to begin with in there, you aren't going to get --
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:58.120]   bacteria is not going to go through that plastic.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:01.120]   If you don't have anything in there to begin with, you're not going to get anything.
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:05.120]   If you wish to test me on this, feel free to come over.
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:09.120]   I'll give you some water dated 1994 and you can drink it.
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:10.120]   You're talking city water.
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:11.120]   City water.
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.120]   I'm talking city water.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:14.120]   You're not going to go out and take spring water.
[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:15.120]   No, I'm not going to take spring water.
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:16.120]   What's your question?
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:17.120]   What if you don't have a basement?
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:20.120]   Can you store that in your attic?
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:24.120]   Attic is a good place for storing water.
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:29.120]   Above the walls that are supporting walls, you can put boxes of water very easily.
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:30.120]   Can you heat in a summer?
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:32.120]   No, no problem.
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:37.120]   Now, you don't want to drink water that's more than 103 degrees Fahrenheit because it doesn't have a hydration effect on you.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:41.120]   You can't keep cool by drinking water more than 103 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.120]   Just to store it just in case.
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:44.120]   Fine.
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:45.120]   It's wonderful.
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:46.120]   It's perfect.
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.120]   Yes, anywhere you can put it.
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:51.120]   You can put it -- if you take these bottles and you put a piece of wood between them and you start stacking them up,
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:57.120]   you can stack up a tremendous amount of water in a closet, okay, or anywhere you want.
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:02.120]   You can even make it decorative, I guess.
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:05.120]   Do you think I bought all these cases of Evian?
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:06.120]   No.
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:07.120]   No.
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:10.120]   I had a girlfriend, and she loved Evian.
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:14.120]   She carried a one-and-a-half liter bottle around with her everywhere she went.
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:16.120]   I called it her baby.
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:19.120]   Come on, honey, you know, did we have to take the baby to the movies?
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:21.120]   She carried it with her everywhere.
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:26.120]   Needless to say, I had her save all her bottles for me, and I picked them up,
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:29.120]   and I accumulated these over about a period of two years.
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:33.120]   Why was one upside down for you?
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:36.120]   Because I had too much alcohol to drink the night previous.
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:37.120]   What's your question?
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:43.120]   I can't get hydration effects to get to --
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:49.120]   The young lady asked, "Why don't you want to drink water more than 103 degrees Fahrenheit?"
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:50.120]   Because it won't hydrate.
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:53.120]   What's your body temperature?
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:58.120]   98.6.
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:00.120]   So if you're trying to stay cool,
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:05.120]   do you think you can stay cool if you're pouring a source of heat into you?
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:06.120]   No.
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:09.120]   Even then, it wants to evaporate to your skin, and it cools you,
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:13.120]   but the thing is you're taking in too much heat at 103.
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:17.120]   The good news is it's not hard to cool water down.
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:18.120]   So anyways, here we go.
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:20.120]   Here's a bunch of boxes of water.
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:21.120]   It didn't cost me anything.
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:28.120]   I got 18 boxes times 12 times 1-1/2 liters just stored and put away.
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:30.120]   It'll be good there forever.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:31.120]   This is just one thing I did.
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.120]   You can deal with anything.
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:38.120]   You have juice bottles, okay?
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:40.120]   You are more than welcome to come,
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:44.120]   and that's one of the things you need to do is you don't keep this stuff to yourself.
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:47.120]   If you do preparedness and someone asks you about it, you show it to them.
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:48.120]   You encourage them.
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:50.120]   "Well, I'm going to come over to your place."
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.120]   You're more than welcome.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:55.120]   I would love to have your resources and your talent at my place,
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:57.120]   even if you're just a strong back.
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:59.120]   I'd love to have you come over.
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:04.120]   However, I would be much more comfortable if I helped you with some of this preparedness stuff,
[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:09.120]   and if I had some stuff at your house such that you were more prepared personally
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:15.120]   and then we could augment and complement each other rather than just have you come over and utilize my stuff.
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:17.120]   But you're more than happy to come over.
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:23.120]   You might be turning the grain mill to corn, but I guarantee you, I guarantee you,
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:30.120]   I can tell you one thing, if you're on a corn diet, store toilet paper.
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.120]   Let's see, how long has it been?
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:36.120]   It's 7:30, we started at 6, it's already been an hour.
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:42.120]   15, 30, 55-gallon drums, if you want them, you can get them at a place called Maxi Container,
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:45.120]   it's six miles in Detroit, great company.
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:53.120]   You want the blue food-grade drums, HDPE, high-density polyethylene.
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:56.120]   55-gallon drums are a little hard to move around, but it's nice to have one,
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:57.120]   just put a bunch of water into it.
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:01.120]   People prefer this to the bottles and stuff.
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:06.120]   The thing to remember, these are 15 gallons, this is a 30, you can move a 15 around.
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:11.120]   You can manhandle a 15-gallon drum around from upstairs and downstairs.
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:14.120]   It's just another option for you for storing water.
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:17.120]   If you're going down the street and you see someone threw a dresser drawer out
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:20.120]   and you want to put plastic bags and use that for your storage, fine.
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:22.120]   If you're going to put them in pop bottles, fine.
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:24.120]   But whatever it is, do it.
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:26.120]   Try it, okay?
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:28.120]   [Audience member] Do I put plastic bags in those drums?
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.120]   No, you don't.
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:34.120]   Basically, you don't have to put plastic in plastic.
[00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:35.120]   So what is water?
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:39.120]   Water is water, it's the stuff to carry and prepare water.
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:42.120]   We're going to cover purification real quickly.
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:52.120]   What are the only two methods to completely disinfect water of all bacteria, viruses, spores?
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:56.120]   [Audience member] Boiling.
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:58.120]   Boiling is one of the two ways.
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:00.120]   What's the other way?
[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:02.120]   [Audience member] Iodine.
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:03.120]   You said iodine.
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:08.120]   You are exactly correct on iodine, and everyone is incorrect on bleach.
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:10.120]   Bleach will not get the spores.
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.120]   It is hard to kill the spores.
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:13.120]   What's a spore?
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:16.120]   It's a hard shell that forms around a bacteria to protect it.
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:19.120]   Anthrax is a spore.
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:21.120]   You use a sporeicide to kill it.
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:23.120]   A sporeicide is iodine.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:24.120]   What type of iodine?
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:25.120]   That's a better question.
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:28.120]   The little iodine tablets you buy at the camping store?
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:29.120]   No.
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:30.120]   No.
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:35.120]   They will not--the little iodine tablets you buy at the camping store, you put in the water?
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:39.120]   The ones that you buy at Walmart in Mexico.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:40.120]   Is it crystalline?
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:42.120]   Do you open it, it smells like iodine, you see the crystals in there?
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:43.120]   I don't know what it says.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:45.120]   Just make sure you don't get this one, Gary.
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:46.120]   QSB.
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:48.120]   No, probably not.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.120]   This is what you want to do.
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:53.120]   Complete disinfection is only done with boiling outside of the laboratory, okay?
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:55.120]   In advance, we reverse osmosis stuff.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:54:02.120]   The only two ways that's available to you is boiling and crystalline iodine treatment.
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:03.120]   Now, the easiest--
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:06.120]   No, you don't need nothing to boil it.
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:07.120]   How do you do that?
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:09.120]   Lots of ways, but we'll get into that.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:10.120]   Handles.
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:15.120]   No, actually, you can--if you bring water up to 160 degrees Fahrenheit for eight minutes,
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:19.120]   you can pasteurize it like you pasteurize milk, and it'll kill a lot of stuff.
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:20.120]   Bring your water up.
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.120]   You don't have to boil it.
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:26.120]   If you can just get it to 160, if all you had was--you couldn't boil it, but you could
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:27.120]   just get it warm, okay?
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:32.120]   If you could bring water up so it's really hot, which is, you know, 160 is actually where
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:36.120]   it is, and leave it set there for 10 minutes, you'd be--and that's all you had, you'd be
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:38.120]   better than if you had nothing, okay?
[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:39.120]   So remember that.
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:41.120]   The hotter you can get it, the better.
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:45.120]   Crystalline iodine, the short story, it's the only stuff you are going to be able to
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:46.120]   get.
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.120]   It's called Polar Pure.
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:48.120]   You can get it at REI.
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:50.120]   And why do I say chocolate store?
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:56.120]   Because in Somerset Mall, there's a camping--there's an outdoor store in Somerset Mall across
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:55:00.120]   from the great Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory.
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:02.120]   You can see why I remember that place.
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:06.120]   So they're right--they're the first level across from the great Rocky Mountain Chocolate
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:08.120]   Factory in the main area.
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:12.120]   Polar Pure, it's $10 to $12 for a little bottle of crystalline iodine.
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:15.120]   It'll treat 2,000 to 3,000 quarts of water, okay?
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:17.120]   Iodine is very toxic.
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:18.120]   It's very potent.
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:19.120]   It's very concentrated.
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:23.120]   But it's a method in this bottle that you can only get small amounts of it into your
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.120]   water.
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:29.120]   You let it sit, and for like 30 minutes to 30 days, however long you want, and it'll
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:30.120]   kill everything in the water.
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:36.120]   If you have a shellfish allergy, if you cannot eat crabs and other shellfish and lobster,
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:41.120]   you cannot use this method for disinfecting your water because you have an iodine allergy.
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:47.120]   You'd have to run this through like a carbon filter quite a few times to get rid of the
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:49.120]   iodine before you could drink it.
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:53.120]   But that would have to come with you independently if you have that problem.
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:57.120]   The other thing is--that's the best thing is Polar Pure.
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:59.120]   You can forget the $200 filters, okay?
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:04.120]   If you've got a Polar Pure and some coffee filters, you're better than if you have a
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:10.120]   $200 catadiene filter, I guarantee you, or even a $600 catadiene filter.
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:12.120]   You can get stuff out with an earth filter.
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:15.120]   That's how the water is filtrated in the ground.
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:20.120]   Sand, clay, gravel, rock, you can make one out of a five-gallon pail.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:21.120]   It'll take out chemicals.
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:24.120]   It'll take out everything but the bacteria.
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:28.120]   You filter it through the earth, and you treat it chemically or with heat.
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:30.120]   And it's called an earth filter.
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:35.120]   If you go get nuclear war survival skills at that website, USAHomelandDefense.com,
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:38.120]   it'll show you how to do that better than I can take 20 minutes and describe here for you.
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:40.120]   Question?
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:44.120]   Those filters that you get like for BRITA, is that worth anything?
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:49.120]   Yes, they're good for taking the iodine out of the water.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:51.120]   Drinking iodine water tastes like pool water.
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:56.120]   Believe me, you'd be happy to drink it if you're sensitive to it, if you didn't want the taste.
[00:56:56.120 --> 00:57:02.120]   You can get it through a BRITA filter, an $8 or $20 filter, will remove that taste.
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:06.120]   So, yeah, if you've got one around, it's a good tool that you already have in your house.
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:07.120]   Question?
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:10.120]   Yes, what is the ratio between the iodine and the water?
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:13.120]   The ratio is approximately 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:16.120]   If you took--see, it comes in a little bottle.
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:17.120]   It talks about cat bowls.
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:19.120]   I send missionaries around the world.
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:21.120]   I need them to hydrate themselves.
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:23.120]   So I talk about cups and gallons.
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:26.120]   One cup of iodine-saturated water.
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:30.120]   Water can only hold so much iodine, okay, like water can only hold so much salt.
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:35.120]   Iodine, water can only hold a very small amount--water can only hold a very small amount of iodine.
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:41.120]   At 70 degrees Fahrenheit, the hotter the water, the more iodine it can hold, okay, the more you can absorb into it.
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:49.120]   So at 70 degrees Fahrenheit, the amount of iodine in one cup of water saturated is what you'd use to treat five gallons of water.
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:53.120]   You'd want to keep it in there for at least 30 minutes, and it's called residence time.
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:55.120]   How long is the iodine in contact with the water?
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:59.120]   I prefer it to be in contact all night, all day, before you drink it.
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:02.120]   About 30 minutes would be the minimum.
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:03.120]   Question?
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:06.120]   Where is the best place to buy water?
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:07.120]   Buy water?
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:09.120]   Right out of your tap.
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:11.120]   The best--what's the best place to buy water?
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:13.120]   It's right out of your tap at home.
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:15.120]   It costs about 20 cents per thousand gallons.
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:20.120]   And our mayor is supposed to try to reduce that price, too.
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:21.120]   Question?
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:26.120]   Can you store other liquids like juice?
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:28.120]   What did I tell you?
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:32.120]   What's the number one thing that makes water harmful to you?
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:34.120]   Bacteria and growth, right?
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:35.120]   What's in juice?
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:41.120]   You think it's--no, the growth medium for juice, the growth medium for the bacteria.
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:43.120]   So you don't want to really store juices.
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:44.120]   Wait, can you store?
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:47.120]   If you want to add some flavor to your water, what would be something good to store?
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:48.120]   Kool-Aid.
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:54.120]   Kool-Aid, yeah, tea mix, Kool-Aid powder, little things just to give--see right here?
[00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:58.120]   This is water with some flavor in it.
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:03.120]   You will drink more water quickly if there's a little bit of flavor into it, like a squeeze of lemon.
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:10.120]   You'll drink that subconsciously a lot more than you will just drink unflavored water.
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:13.120]   It's a trick we use to hydrate people to get them to drink.
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:15.120]   Do you have iced tea?
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:16.120]   Sure, iced tea is okay.
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:17.120]   You've got caffeine.
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:18.120]   What's your question?
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:20.120]   How long would cases of POP last?
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:22.120]   Forever.
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:24.120]   Forever.
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:25.120]   Should we start with this here?
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:26.120]   Sure, sure.
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:27.120]   What's POP?
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:28.120]   Generally, it's sugar.
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:29.120]   It's sterile.
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:30.120]   It's what it comes with.
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:32.120]   They can't have people getting sick.
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:34.120]   No bacteria is going through the can, okay?
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:41.120]   So basically it's water, it's carbonation, it's sugar or a sugar substitute, some flavorings, and caffeine.
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:43.120]   So you can store that forever.
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:50.120]   It's a good question, a really good question.
[00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:52.120]   How often do you have to change your water?
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:53.120]   We covered this.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:54.120]   How old is water?
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:56.120]   No sugars, no organic materials left over.
[00:59:56.120 --> 01:00:01.120]   If you've got a bunch of soda and it's sugared, you want to wash that out real well.
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:04.120]   No soap, just flush it a lot, a couple times, shake it up.
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:08.120]   You don't want any sugar residue in your water because that can be a growth medium.
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:11.120]   Just use city tap water.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:15.120]   Okay, we're going to go on to food and nutrition, what a lot of you came here for.
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:19.120]   But first we're going to let you have a little bit of a break, let's say 10, 15 minutes.
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:26.120]   We'll see you back here, let's say, 10 minutes before the hour.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:33.120]   The bathrooms are down the hall and outside in the main police area by the desk.
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:51.120]   See you back in about 12, 13 minutes.
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:01:03.120]   So as I was saying about what's going to happen with the people who are late, we're going to --
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:09.120]   Okay, first we've got mobile personal shelter, clothing.
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:11.120]   Then we have water.
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:15.120]   Then we have nutrition, which we'll call foods.
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:25.120]   People like water, nutrition is food, stuff to prepare food, stuff to eat it, store it.
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:29.120]   So I get asked this question all the time.
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:43.120]   Steve, in a disaster, a personal food storage, what are we going to eat?
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:50.120]   Corn is too hard for you to prepare right now until I teach you.
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:53.120]   Who said beef jerky?
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.120]   It's too expensive, but yes, you can.
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:58.120]   It's good for like two, three days.
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:00.120]   Spam.
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:09.120]   Spam does last at least six to nine years, okay?
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:13.120]   No, you don't get a car, no vegetables.
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.120]   Beans?
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:18.120]   What type of beans?
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:21.120]   Dried beans, right?
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:27.120]   Nuts in a vacuum container are a very good thing to buy, but they're expensive,
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:32.120]   but they're good for something to have.
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.120]   The lady said raisins.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:39.120]   I want it to be a crime to make raisin cookies because they look like chocolate chip cookies.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.120]   You bite into them and you get this horrible look on your face.
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:45.120]   Okay, what--the cheapest thing, okay?
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:47.120]   What are you going to store?
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:51.120]   Okay, we got another--crackers are acceptable.
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:53.120]   Peanuts are okay, yeah.
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:56.120]   I'm sorry, but you want unsalted if it's a disaster, right?
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:58.120]   You don't want all that salt in your system or do you?
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.120]   Either.
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.120]   Either or.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.120]   Whatever you enjoy eating the most.
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:09.120]   So it's kind of what people--everything people have said except for the thing of beans,
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:14.120]   you're talking about expensive processed foods, all you guys mentioned, okay?
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:17.120]   Vacuum-stored peanuts store for a very, very long time.
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:21.120]   They're excellent source of protein, but they're also a little expensive.
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:23.120]   So what are you going to eat?
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.120]   Donuts!
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:29.120]   And I'm not just saying that because we're in a cop shop.
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:30.120]   What are you going to eat?
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:36.120]   You are--one of the things you are literally going to eat or make is donuts.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:37.120]   Yes.
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.120]   Donuts!
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:39.120]   Not corn?
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:40.120]   No.
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.120]   I told you, you're not going to be making--forget corn.
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:43.120]   You guys aren't going to be using corn.
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:45.120]   That's a 201 level class.
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:46.120]   This is a 101.
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:50.120]   I got to have a whole class just on food just to show you how to do corn.
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:53.120]   It'll actually be another hour, but we're not going to do that today.
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:54.120]   What was your question?
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:58.120]   Eat ruts.
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:01.120]   I'm going to put you on some--I'm going to just let you go on--
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:05.120]   I'm not going to let you go find enough ruts to eat in an entire day, okay?
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.120]   You know what happiness in Sarajevo was like 10 years ago?
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:12.120]   Finding a tree root to burn just to, you know, to be able to cook something.
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.120]   Donuts.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.120]   You're going to eat donuts!
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.120]   Donuts.
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:19.120]   This seems funny now, but it won't.
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:20.120]   Okay.
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:23.120]   The old way of food storage, okay?
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:28.120]   The traditional way, if you talk to Mormons or anyone else or survivalists,
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:35.120]   they're going to tell you wheat is "wheat, milk, and honey," okay?
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:38.120]   You get big bags of wheat, you get grain grinders,
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:42.120]   and you make this horrible wheat bread, which you can hardly stomach
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:44.120]   unless you really like wheat bread.
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:49.120]   And then what it does to your digestive system ain't funny.
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:52.120]   The new way we're going to talk about with the resources that are available to us,
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:54.120]   these are not resources available to you.
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:55.120]   This is expensive.
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:58.120]   This is expensive.
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:02.120]   That is outside--that's outside of your learning curve right now for storage of wheat.
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:05.120]   I know people who say, "I got 1,000 pounds of wheat, and I don't know what to do with it."
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:08.120]   Congratulations, you might as well have nothing, okay?
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:09.120]   And milk won't keep.
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:10.120]   Huh?
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:11.120]   And milk won't keep.
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:12.120]   It's just a narcotic.
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:15.120]   No, you can store--we're talking powdered milk.
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:19.120]   Powdered milk in a Mylar bag will keep 10, 20 years.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:25.120]   So wheat, honey, milk--we're going to replace this with flour, oil, and sugar.
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:28.120]   Why are we going to replace this with flour?
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:29.120]   It's cheap.
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:30.120]   It's cheap.
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:31.120]   It's easy to store.
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:32.120]   It's on the shelf.
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:34.120]   You can go get a bunch of it.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.120]   See this right here?
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:38.120]   Flour is wheat plus energy.
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:42.120]   If you want flour to make bread like wheat flour, you've got to get the wheat,
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:47.120]   then you've got to put the energy into it, okay, to make it into a flour and to cook it.
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:50.120]   What are you missing in a disaster?
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:53.120]   Energy, okay?
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:58.120]   Why don't you just buy your food with energy content already in it, the flour?
[01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:59.120]   Oil.
[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:00.120]   Why do I have oil?
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:01.120]   Cooking.
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:02.120]   Yeah, cooking.
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:03.120]   But why do I have oil?
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:05.120]   What's the big thing about oil?
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:09.120]   Lubrication.
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:12.120]   I'm coming to your house for a disaster, that's for sure.
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:14.120]   It doesn't go around.
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.120]   No bacteria.
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.120]   No.
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:18.120]   What makes oil go rancid?
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:19.120]   It's a good question.
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:20.120]   Yeast.
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:21.120]   No.
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:22.120]   No.
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.120]   Oxygen.
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:25.120]   Air makes oil go rancid.
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:26.120]   Oil.
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:32.120]   If you have a diet rich in oil, fatty oils, what's going to happen to you?
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:34.120]   You're going to fill it up more.
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.120]   Fat.
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:37.120]   It's high in calories.
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:41.120]   What do the Inuits eat in the Arctic?
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.120]   Seal blub, blair blubber.
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:46.120]   Fat, high in calories.
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:49.120]   Do you need nutrients in a disaster?
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:50.120]   No.
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:51.120]   You don't.
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:52.120]   What do you need?
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:54.120]   You need calories.
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:07:00.120]   The stress alone can burn more calories off you than if you were doing physical exertion.
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:02.120]   Stress can burn a lot of calories.
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:07.120]   Let alone, you're going to be sweating if the temperature is higher than 70-something,
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:09.120]   and you're going to be trying to keep warm if it's cold.
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:12.120]   All that takes calories.
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:15.120]   You're going to die of lack of caloric intake.
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:16.120]   Sugar.
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.120]   Why do I have sugar?
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.120]   Energy.
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.120]   Calories again, right?
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:23.120]   All of us have too high of a sugar diet.
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:26.120]   It's going to be a good thing to have for us in a disaster is sugar.
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:28.120]   Sugar stores very well.
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:30.120]   It might get hard, but you can break it up.
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:32.120]   It just gets hard from moisture.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.120]   It's hydroscopic.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:35.120]   It wants to absorb moisture.
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:42.120]   So these three things are mass produced at cheaper prices today than any time in history.
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:48.120]   A friend of mine got the same price for wheat.
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:53.120]   He got more money for wheat in 1952 when he started farming than he did in 2002.
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:55.120]   What's the cost of inflation difference?
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:57.120]   About a factor of 5 to 10.
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:59.120]   We feed the world.
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:03.120]   We make flour, oil, and sugar at world record cheap prices.
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:05.120]   Now that's what we're going to do.
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:10.120]   For your $10 in beef jerky that will last you one day, you can buy an entire week's worth of flour.
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:14.120]   Now it's good to have beef jerky.
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:16.120]   That's called a short-term food supply.
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:18.120]   A couple days.
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:21.120]   You use this for making a base to go weeks or months.
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:24.120]   You see the difference?
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:28.120]   What do people say is wrong with flour if you were in the preparedness community?
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:31.120]   What's the number one thing they'll crinkle their nose?
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:32.120]   You say flour.
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:34.120]   They'll crinkle their nose and look at you and they'll say something.
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.120]   What do they say?
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:37.120]   What's wrong with flour?
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:38.120]   Actually, no.
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.120]   What do they say?
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:40.120]   Huh?
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.120]   Nope.
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:44.120]   Nope.
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.120]   I'm in a whole different community.
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:49.120]   They'll say it ain't got no nutrition.
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:52.120]   Bugs won't even eat it.
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:56.120]   You put a line of flour on the ground, the ants will go around it.
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:00.120]   They won't eat it.
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:04.120]   What's the number one problem with storing wheat and corn and other things?
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:06.120]   Bugs eat it.
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:10.120]   Isn't this an advantage?
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.120]   See?
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.120]   Flour is a wonderful advantage.
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:16.120]   Now that you understand you don't need the nutrition, you need the calories.
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:19.120]   Don't you see flour as being different?
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:22.120]   They say it ain't got no nutrition.
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:25.120]   And they say it ain't got no nutrition, bugs won't eat it.
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.120]   Good.
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.120]   You don't need nutrients, you need calories.
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.120]   Now I say this.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:34.120]   When they say this to me, I say shut up and buy a multivitamin.
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:38.120]   A multivitamin pill is a penny a day at Costco.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:44.120]   There are people in this world who wish they had one a week.
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:49.120]   There are people in this world who die of vitamin deficiency that a penny's worth of vitamins can take care of.
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:56.120]   And we're blessed to have an unlimited supply of them for a penny a piece at Costco or any other pharmaceutical outlet.
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:57.120]   Okay?
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:03.120]   So if you're really worried about nutrition, let's say you have a vitamin deficiency, you've got to have your vitamin A.
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.120]   It's something weird.
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:10.120]   Make sure you have your vitamins and you combine it with your diet that has no vitamins in it.
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.120]   Does that make sense?
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:16.120]   There's nothing you're going to get out of something that's cooked and baked, nutrient-wise,
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:18.120]   that you aren't going to get in that vitamin pill.
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:20.120]   Nothing.
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:25.120]   It has everything you need.
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:35.120]   Again, weather kills in minutes, water in days, food in weeks, months to years for a nutrient deficiency.
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:41.120]   Take everything you know about modern nutrients, health, and throw it out the door in a disaster, okay?
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:44.120]   Take your five food groups, your four food groups, what is it?
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:48.120]   Your four food groups, your balanced diet, throw it out the window.
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:49.120]   Forget about it.
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:52.120]   The majority of the world lives on one staple.
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:55.120]   The majority of the world lives on rice or they live on corn.
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:11:03.120]   Rice in Asia, corn in Mexico, wheat in the United States, wheat in Russia,
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:06.120]   other places in Europe use to live on potatoes as a starch base.
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.120]   That's one staple, okay?
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:09.120]   It's been done for centuries.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:11.120]   You can do the same thing as well.
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:13.120]   Forget your fruits and veggies.
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:16.120]   Oh, boy, I love saying that.
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:20.120]   They're going to be existing in what you can store and put away.
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:24.120]   Now, the question is how do you store bread?
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:26.120]   You asked this, didn't you?
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:32.120]   How do you store bread?
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:35.120]   How do you store bread?
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:36.120]   No.
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:38.120]   How do you store bread?
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.120]   It'll go stale.
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.120]   It'll go stale.
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:45.120]   It'll go moldy.
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:48.120]   Here's another one.
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:52.120]   The thing is, the answer is you can't.
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:54.120]   You can't really store bread.
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.120]   It's very hard.
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:57.120]   Now, I'll show you how to do it, but for all intents and purposes,
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:01.120]   let's show you the best way to do it.
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:05.120]   Who is my complete neophyte here for cooking?
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:08.120]   Who is helpless when it comes to cooking?
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:10.120]   Who -- oh, please, I'd love to pick on you.
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:12.120]   I just got the big wallet just brought in.
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:15.120]   Who?
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:19.120]   Who is the person in here who will say, "I can't do that"?
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:20.120]   You?
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:25.120]   Who's my best cooker?
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:27.120]   Who's my best cooker?
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:29.120]   Who's my best cooker here?
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.120]   Who loves to cook?
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.120]   Who loves to do -- who loves to do it?
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:33.120]   You do?
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:34.120]   You really love to cook?
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.120]   You cook on a regular basis?
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.120]   Good.
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:37.120]   Come on.
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.120]   I need one person to help as well.
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:43.120]   Now, I told you the other day, I'm going to show you something that you will never forget, okay,
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:48.120]   that if you become penniless and poor, you're underneath the overpass, you will never go hungry.
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:52.120]   As long as you eat a couple quarters a day, I guarantee you won't go hungry.
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:56.120]   When things got bad after 9/11 for me financially, the economy took a downturn,
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:13:01.120]   concerns were other words -- other ways, I lived off my food storage, okay.
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:03.120]   I ate my food storage for three, four months.
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:07.120]   When you're in that financial situation, you take every penny you make,
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:09.120]   you make sure you got your mortgage paid for.
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:13.120]   Food storage is one of the best insurance policies you ever have.
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:16.120]   There's people in this world, when they run out of food, they go hungry.
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:20.120]   I got to the point where I had no processed food left in the house.
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:23.120]   I didn't have bags of Cheetos or crackers or anything.
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:26.120]   If I wanted something, I had to go make it.
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:28.120]   I had the stuff to go make it.
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:32.120]   Now, I elected to do that because I wanted to make sure I had my mortgage payment done and taken care of, okay.
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.120]   When I had two mortgage payments in the bank,
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:41.120]   then I started increasing and saving time by buying foods and stuff, and even then it was at a discount.
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:45.120]   So what I'm going to show you is something that you'll remember for a long time.
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.120]   A friend of mine, we're literally going to write a book called
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:50.120]   "How to Live on a Dollar a Day Worth of Food," okay.
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:53.120]   And this is some of the stuff we're going to show you.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:57.120]   Now, some of you -- raise your hand if you asked about you want to know how to store food
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:59.120]   and take care of your family in a disaster.
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:02.120]   How many of you said those -- some of you really said that.
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:05.120]   I'm going to show you a week's worth of food.
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:08.120]   I'm going to show you the prices.
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:10.120]   Here we go.
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:12.120]   Here's a week's worth of food.
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:15.120]   It costs less than $10.
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.120]   What do I have here?
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:19.120]   I have a bag of sugar.
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:23.120]   I have too much salt, but hey, 28 cents.
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:27.120]   I have flour, five pounds.
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:29.120]   I have five pounds of flour.
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:35.120]   I spent more money than I should have, and I got some Just Add Water pancake mix, okay.
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:38.120]   I spent -- this was more than I should have.
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:43.120]   I got four boxes of Jiffy cornbread mix, 25 cents a piece.
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:46.120]   This is for when I get tired of making stuff out of flour.
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.120]   I have a jar of peanut butter.
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:50.120]   I have a jar of jelly.
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:54.120]   I have some more sugar and some maple syrup.
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:57.120]   I imagine you could use this like oil as well.
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:01.120]   I have a jar of oil.
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:04.120]   I have a jar of oil, okay.
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:06.120]   All this stuff is cheap.
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:08.120]   Now, you might say, "I might get bored eating that."
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:12.120]   Yeah, you might get bored eating some of the things you make out of this.
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:14.120]   You can say that again.
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:17.120]   I guarantee you, you will be -- what's that?
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:19.120]   What did you say?
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:21.120]   [ Indistinct ]
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:23.120]   Oh.
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:24.120]   You just need the card.
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:26.120]   You just need a certificate.
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:30.120]   Now, let's see.
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:36.120]   I've got to think about how to do this.
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:39.120]   Oh, no.
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:41.120]   I should light that first.
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:50.120]   [ Indistinct ]
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.120]   No, we ain't making pancakes.
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:54.120]   We're going to store bread.
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:57.120]   We're going to store bread.
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.120]   That's right.
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:01.120]   You don't see a loaf of bread.
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.120]   Hang on.
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.120]   Let me get my stuff.
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.120]   Vodka bottle.
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:07.120]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:08.120]   We're going to use that.
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:09.120]   We're going to use this.
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:10.120]   We're going to use the vodka bottle.
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:11.120]   Hey, look at that.
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:12.120]   Vodka bottles.
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:14.120]   [ Indistinct ]
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:15.120]   No, no.
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:18.120]   My girlfriend was Russian, though, but she didn't drink vodka.
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:21.120]   Okay, we're heating the pan up.
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:23.120]   Let's put this over here.
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:37.120]   Here is the let's open up our flower.
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:40.120]   Okay, we're opening up the bag of flour.
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:53.120]   I'm going to have to wash this table down while I'm done.
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:54.120]   Yeah, so I can blame it on my assistants.
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:55.120]   Okay, now here's what we're going to do.
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:57.120]   This is how you store bread.
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:59.120]   You store bread by storing flour.
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:01.120]   Okay, now what does it take to make bread?
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:03.120]   It's complicated, isn't it?
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:05.120]   How many people have made bread other than the bread maker?
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:08.120]   You've got to get the flour.
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:09.120]   You add things to it.
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:11.120]   Yeast, sugar, egg, milk.
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:13.120]   You make it into a dough.
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:14.120]   You knead it.
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:15.120]   You let it rise.
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:16.120]   You pat it down.
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:17.120]   You let it rise again.
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:18.120]   Then you bake it.
[01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:22.120]   Well, that rising time can take, what, 30 minutes, 40 minutes, 4 hours,
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:24.120]   depending upon how you're making your bread, right?
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:25.120]   What's the baking time?
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:28.120]   20, 30, 40 minutes, depending upon your loaf.
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:30.120]   That's an awful lot of energy.
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:33.120]   Do you know how much energy I have to have to bake a loaf of bread
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:35.120]   or multiple loaves of bread?
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.120]   I've got to have your oven with you, okay?
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:38.120]   That's a lot of energy.
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:41.120]   If you have to store that amount of fuel, it takes a lot.
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:45.120]   We're going to make bread in 30 seconds, okay?
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:48.120]   You're going to make bread in 30 seconds.
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:50.120]   Now, what I want you to do--
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:53.120]   What's that?
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:54.120]   It'll be delicious.
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:57.120]   The fussiest child will eat it, I guarantee you.
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:01.120]   And I'm fussy, and I'm a child.
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:02.120]   Here's the recipe.
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:04.120]   I've got a cup here.
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:05.120]   It happens to be a two-cup cup.
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:08.120]   Would you scoop up about a cup?
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:10.120]   I'll fill this up, okay?
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:13.120]   About a cup.
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:17.120]   Just pour it, scoop it.
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:19.120]   Here's a little--
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:27.120]   You make a mess, you're cleaning it up.
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.120]   Okay, about a cup, half full?
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:30.120]   A little bit less.
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:33.120]   Pour some out, just so we have room in there.
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.120]   Okay, we've got about a cup in here.
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:38.120]   Now, this is a precise measurement, right?
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:40.120]   You know, scoop it, right?
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:43.120]   Did I tell you you've got to have 1.00 cups or anything?
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:45.120]   Just scoop it up, right?
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:54.120]   Now, I want you to put an accurately calibrated, precise one dab of oil.
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:58.120]   Okay, just kind of go boop, just about a tablespoon.
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:18:59.120]   Oh, one tablespoon?
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:00.120]   No, about a dab.
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:02.120]   Just go boop.
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:04.120]   How about a little bit more of a doop in there?
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:05.120]   Just a little bit.
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:06.120]   Stop, that's too much.
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:07.120]   That's okay.
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:08.120]   Okay, well, that--
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:12.120]   Okay, she put a dollop of oil in there, just a--
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:14.120]   of oil into this flour, okay?
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:19.120]   Now, we're going to get real technical.
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:24.120]   I want you to put in a couple of sprinkles of salt into here.
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:28.120]   Oh, maybe half a teaspoon, but a couple of sprinkles, you know, just an amount.
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:32.120]   If you have too much salt in one of your recipes, you'll know it.
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:35.120]   And now--
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:38.120]   Well, I could do.
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:43.120]   And now, we're going to make the bread.
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:45.120]   Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:48.120]   Where is my spatula?
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:53.120]   Okay, I have a turning implement here, the Julia Child Cookbook.
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:58.120]   Would you please, here, mix that up a little bit?
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:04.120]   Keep on mixing.
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:08.120]   Keep thick notes because you're going to make more while we're talking for everyone else to try this.
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:14.120]   Okay.
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:17.120]   This is what not the heater--this is not the source of heat I wanted to bring.
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:24.120]   It was the one I could find real quickly.
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:25.120]   I have lots of choices.
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:29.120]   Now, just keep--and I'll start adding water to this, and you're going to make a dough.
[01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:31.120]   Just keep on adding water.
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:32.120]   Put it on the table and mix it up.
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:35.120]   Just keep on adding water to it until you make a ball of dough.
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:38.120]   It's not half a cup or a cup of water.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:39.120]   There's no recipe.
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:43.120]   Just keep on mixing it together until you make a ball of dough.
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:44.120]   There you go.
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:45.120]   Mix it up really good.
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:48.120]   [Audience member asks question]
[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:50.120]   Walmart.
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:53.120]   Walmart.
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:57.120]   Remember when we had a class and Blaine was here from Consumers Energy?
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:58.120]   I hit him hard.
[01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:02.120]   I cornered him after the meeting and talked to him for a half hour.
[01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:08.120]   Our gas infrastructure is over 100 years old, and it's got 100 years of the best people in the world doing it.
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:10.120]   It ain't going down.
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:14.120]   We talk about smallpox, people not showing up for work, massive power outages.
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:15.120]   Guess what?
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:17.120]   The natural gas system is powered by natural gas.
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:21.120]   All the pumps and the substations have natural gas backup.
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:24.120]   They ain't going--is the dough--
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:25.120]   Add a little more.
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:27.120]   Actually, I want--no, I want--yeah, I do.
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:29.120]   Okay.
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:32.120]   Pick up the dough and start moving it into a ball.
[01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:36.120]   Add a little bit of flour to it so it's sticky, okay?
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:37.120]   There you go, a little bit more.
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:41.120]   Just bring it up into a ball and just knead it in your hands like Play-Doh.
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:42.120]   The gas system's not going down.
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:46.120]   Pretty much, you can rely upon your natural gas stove at home.
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:47.120]   You really can.
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:49.120]   That is such a huge advantage.
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:54.120]   It would be two hours of me talking to you about energy just to tell you how to store enough energy to cook for a year.
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:56.120]   I mean, if you wanted a year's worth of food,
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:59.120]   it's a couple hours for me to tell you how to store the energy to do that.
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:03.120]   So if you can rely on your natural gas stove for a couple weeks or a couple months or more,
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:05.120]   you're doing really good.
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:06.120]   You got a dough yet?
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:07.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:08.120]   Okay, you got a dough.
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:10.120]   Great, great.
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:14.120]   Now, if you're not going to use natural gas, propane is a good cheap alternative.
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:19.120]   I prefer gasoline because I can handle it and I feel comfortable handling it,
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:24.120]   and I'll explain to you in a little bit why I prefer gasoline as a cooking source of heat.
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:29.120]   But if you're comfortable with propane, if you're comfortable with your stove at home, it's fine, okay?
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:32.120]   A few bottles of propane will go a long ways.
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:34.120]   Tyrant, sure, cook on the manifold.
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:40.120]   Okay, just grab off a piece of dough about the size of a golf ball.
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:42.120]   Add some flour so it's a little bit less sticky.
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:45.120]   Here, just take the ball, drop it in there.
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:48.120]   Could you do the same thing if you had charcoal on your gas stove?
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:49.120]   Charcoal is very expensive.
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:53.120]   It's a high dollar value for a very little bit of energy, okay?
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:55.120]   You don't want to rely upon charcoal at all.
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.120]   You don't want to rely upon Dutch ovens or anything.
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:00.120]   It takes an awful lot of energy in the form of fuel.
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:02.120]   Now, if you're already beginning to pad this out,
[01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:06.120]   you can actually work this out by hand into a tortilla, okay?
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:11.120]   You can just continue doing what she's doing and roll it out into a tortilla.
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:13.120]   We're going to show you a little shortcut.
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:16.120]   A little Mexican lady showed me.
[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:22.120]   And that is, here, just use wax paper and fold it in half.
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:27.120]   Put the tortilla dough into there.
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:28.120]   Now, where's my rolling pin?
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:31.120]   Here's my rolling pin, okay?
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:35.120]   Expedient civil defense, stuff that you have around you.
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:39.120]   It can be used for multiple things, beating people, mulled-blue cocktails,
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:42.120]   and it can also be used as a rolling pin.
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:45.120]   Look, okay, she gets a couple cards for this.
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:53.120]   She's using the salt as a rolling pin, and she's rolling out the tortilla dough, okay?
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:58.120]   Now, remember how we made this piece of dough here.
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:02.120]   We scooped up some flour, we put in a dollop of oil,
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:06.120]   sprinkled in some salt, and added enough water to make a dough.
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:09.120]   Technically, this is a little bit thick, but it's okay,
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:11.120]   because you might make the same mistake.
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:13.120]   And here, will you please throw it onto the griddle?
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:16.120]   Just poop.
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:19.120]   Now, depending upon the thickness, it's 10 to 30 seconds on the side.
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.120]   It all depends how hot.
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:24.120]   Tortillas, wide cooking range.
[01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:27.120]   If it's too cool, it just takes longer to bake.
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:29.120]   If it's too hot, it just cooks real quick.
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:33.120]   So you don't have to be precise about having a flame of a certain size.
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:41.120]   Just get the darn thing hot, okay, and throw the dough onto it.
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:43.120]   And if you get really good at making tortillas, you take a wet cloth,
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:47.120]   and you dab it with water, and it puffs up, makes pockets and everything.
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:49.120]   But that's beyond me, okay?
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:54.120]   We're just talking about storing bread in the form of flour.
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:59.120]   If it's burning, and setting off the smoke alarm, it's done.
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:00.120]   Take a look.
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:02.120]   Flip it over real quick.
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:05.120]   Now flip it over on the other side, okay?
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:08.120]   See, hers is a little bit thick, so it might take a minute to cook.
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:12.120]   But, you know, look at this.
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:14.120]   No, I don't have any hot mess, okay.
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:18.120]   Would you start pulling off some more balls and everything,
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:23.120]   so we can cook up some more and roll them out?
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:24.120]   I'll move some stuff over there.
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:25.120]   Okay.
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.120]   You think that's done?
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:27.120]   Yes.
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:28.120]   Okay, pull it off.
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:30.120]   Just put it down.
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:32.120]   Let it -- it's going to have to cool for -- not on the wax paper.
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:33.120]   It's going to melt it.
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:48.120]   Just put it down and put it into your cooler.
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:51.120]   Okay, now here we have some flatbread, okay?
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:52.120]   There's Norwegian flatbread.
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:53.120]   There's tortillas.
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:55.120]   There's everything else, okay?
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:59.120]   Now here we have a flat piece of bread quickly cooked, about 30 seconds, okay?
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:02.120]   What can we -- we can eat this thing raw as it is, right?
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:05.120]   What else can we do with this?
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.120]   Man does not live on bread alone.
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:10.120]   He puts peanut butter and jelly on it.
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:12.120]   So you can put -- very good.
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:15.120]   You can -- if you've got a sweet tooth, you can put some sugar -- some syrup on this.
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:16.120]   What else?
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:20.120]   What other things that might be in our storage we could put with this?
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:24.120]   Butter, cinnamon and sugar, and hot dog.
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:26.120]   No, you don't want to have them.
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:27.120]   Beans, rice can go with this.
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:30.120]   This can be the wrap for beans and rice, which store very well.
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:32.120]   We'll get to that.
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:35.120]   And remember I said donuts?
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:39.120]   You see this dough that she's -- you see this dough that she's making.
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:43.120]   If you take this dough right here -- see this?
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:45.120]   This is hot oil.
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:47.120]   It's at 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:51.120]   Remember I told you about how much energy it takes to bake this and bake a whole loaf of bread?
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:57.120]   Do you think it takes a lot of energy to heat that oil up to 400 degrees compared to baking for a half hour?
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:58.120]   No.
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:00.120]   It doesn't take much, does it?
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:01.120]   See that canning thermometer in there?
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:03.120]   It's a $4 canning thermometer.
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:06.120]   It just lets me know that I'm at 400 degrees.
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:08.120]   So you get oil up to 400 degrees.
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:10.120]   It takes about three, four minutes.
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:16.120]   And then you take the same dough right here and you drop it in there and you start making a fried dough.
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:19.120]   How many have had Indian bread or fried dough, fried Indian bread?
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:20.120]   Do you like it?
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:22.120]   It's what it is.
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:25.120]   If you add a little baking powder to this, it puffs up.
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:27.120]   Okay?
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:28.120]   Elephant ears.
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:30.120]   This is what elephant ears are, okay?
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:32.120]   It is a whole world of fried doughs.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:41.120]   If you add a few more things, if you add some milk and some eggs, like some powdered milk to this and some baking powder --
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:44.120]   I think they're cutting some bread off.
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:45.120]   Flip it over.
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:47.120]   Now it's doing okay.
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:49.120]   See, you're making pockets.
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:52.120]   Okay, if you add some more things, then you start making donuts.
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:55.120]   Do you see what I mean by we're going to be eating donuts?
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:28:02.120]   It's flour, baking powder, oil, salt, sugar, a lot of sugar in donuts.
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:07.120]   There's a world of recipes that are beyond this class that you can make on top of a skillet.
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:13.120]   You take 89 cents for a maple pancake mix, okay?
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:15.120]   You just add water.
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:18.120]   You put it on top of the hot plate.
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:22.120]   You've got something like this, a little thicker, that you can put peanut butter, jelly, and syrup on.
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:24.120]   You're eating something, okay?
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:30.120]   You're eating something quickly in minutes with a minimal amount of food that is flexible.
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:32.120]   You can put multiple things on it.
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:34.120]   It complements what you have.
[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:35.120]   It's giving you something familiar.
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:38.120]   You're not choking down grainy wheat bread.
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:44.120]   You're eating a white flour-based product that we as fussy Americans like to eat and we're used to.
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:51.120]   If you take the pancake mix and add water to it and you drop the dough into hot oil, you know what you get?
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:57.120]   You get some things that are heavenly delicious, especially when you put sugar and cinnamon on it.
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:59.120]   Yeah.
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:01.120]   Eggs.
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:06.120]   About five months out in the open, fresh, okay?
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:11.120]   If you have sugar and flour and stuff stored as your base and something happens, the earth trembles,
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:14.120]   and you're running to the grocery store, you know what you're picking up?
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:19.120]   Butter, milk, eggs, because you want to add them to stuff that you're baking because it makes them richer.
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:21.120]   It makes them more flavorful.
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:24.120]   They're going to spoil, but if you want to get through that month or two months,
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:26.120]   a bunch of eggs will complement your stuff nicely.
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:28.120]   If not, you've got this stuff to eat.
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:32.120]   In fact, here, let me -- sorry, let me tear this up.
[01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:34.120]   Huh?
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:36.120]   He's on an Atkins diet.
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:37.120]   Who wants some?
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:39.120]   Who wants to try this?
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:42.120]   She's making more for all of you to try, okay?
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:43.120]   Yeah, make another batch.
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:55.120]   I really wanted to do the frying of the oil here, but it's just too much time to do it.
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:57.120]   This is plain.
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:00.120]   It's plain, but you can put stuff on it, and it's better than nothing.
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:03.120]   We made it in 30 seconds.
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:05.120]   I want you to remember this.
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:11.120]   We took pennies worth of flour and a little heat, and we made a bread in seconds.
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:17.120]   If you're homeless and you're begging for quarters, you're not taking these quarters and going to McDonald's.
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:19.120]   You're getting a frying pan from Salvation Army.
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:26.120]   You're making a fire out of some junk that you find, and you're taking the flour and oil and salt and maybe some sugar,
[01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:32.120]   if you're splurging because someone gave you a buck, and you're making something that you can eat now, okay?
[01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:35.120]   When I was poor, I told you I had my food storage.
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:36.120]   What's the number one thing I ate?
[01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:37.120]   Biscuits.
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:40.120]   I make some of the meanest biscuits you'd ever taste.
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:42.120]   I took a little bit of money.
[01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:47.120]   I went and got buttermilk, butter, and I used that with my flour, and I made biscuits.
[01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:48.120]   They were my snack.
[01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:49.120]   I was working my rear end off.
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:52.120]   I ate biscuits with jams and jelly.
[01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:56.120]   I can eat the same thing every day for weeks, okay?
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:59.120]   You can make me grilled cheese sandwiches every day for dinner.
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:04.120]   I'll eat them for a month and then eat nothing else, and then switch to something else, okay?
[01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:06.120]   I'm not fussy about my meals.
[01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:10.120]   [Audience member] How long does an unopened bag of flour last?
[01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:14.120]   Forever, which is a question I'll get to about flour.
[01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:15.120]   I'll tell you how to store flour.
[01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:16.120]   It's real easy.
[01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:18.120]   Flour will stay forever.
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:22.120]   As a fun note, they found wheat in some pyramids in Egypt.
[01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:28.120]   Over 4,000 years old, they sprouted it and grew wheat out of it, okay?
[01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:30.120]   Ladies, doing okay?
[01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:32.120]   Who wants some more?
[01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:37.120]   This one's a little thicker and not quite cooked all the way.
[01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:42.120]   It's a little thicker and not quite cooked all the way, but it's delicious.
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:49.120]   Really, you want tortillas to be as thin as possible, but even if you goop up, they're okay.
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:50.120]   It just makes sense.
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:52.120]   Does anyone have--does anyone have questions?
[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:59.120]   [Audience member] How come cheese is not in your own food?
[01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:01.120]   Yeah, it's a growth medium for bacteria.
[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:03.120]   Now, look at this.
[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:08.120]   I was--the keynote for a preparedness fair, for a Mormon preparedness fair.
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:12.120]   Those who don't know, Mormons preach to themselves that they should have a year's worth of food storage.
[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:16.120]   Actually, they preach seven years, but most of them come down to around a year.
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:19.120]   Less than 5% of the community does this.
[01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:25.120]   So they have preparedness fairs and stuff, and they invited me to come in as an outsider, as a speaker.
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:26.120]   This--see this right here?
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:33.120]   This is the same tortilla dough with a little bit of powdered milk added that these ladies are making right here.
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:35.120]   They just put in like a quarter cup of powdered milk, okay?
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:37.120]   It just makes it a little bit richer.
[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:41.120]   And they fried that same tortilla dough in hot oil.
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:43.120]   It took about 20, 30 seconds.
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:45.120]   That pot you saw up there, it was a six-quart pot.
[01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:48.120]   We were feeding 20 people at a time out of that pot.
[01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:52.120]   We were coming up not for seconds and thirds, but fifths and sixths and tenths, okay?
[01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:56.120]   And we had tongs putting it in and pulling it out at the same time.
[01:32:56.120 --> 01:33:00.120]   And they would put cinnamon and sugar and honey,
[01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:07.120]   and the little kids would come up and put the honey on it themselves and eat it.
[01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:16.120]   And this is a picture of a mother giving her 14-month-old daughter flour, water, powdered milk,
[01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:19.120]   a little bit of--might be some sugar in there, fried in oil.
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:22.120]   The 14-month-old girl is eating this, okay?
[01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:25.120]   Most people think of survival food as yuck.
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:27.120]   The stuff made isn't yuck.
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:29.120]   [Audience member]
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:32.120]   Can you give us your address so we can come and get some of this?
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:34.120]   No, you can go to Costco.
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:37.120]   You can get all you want.
[01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:38.120]   I mean, look at this.
[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:40.120]   I got--ouch, ouch.
[01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:42.120]   I got two ladies here.
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:49.120]   I got two ladies here with 5 pounds of flour, okay, with 5 pounds of flour,
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:56.120]   and they're making food that I'm passing out here to you guys at this rate.
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:34:07.120]   One--okay, one burner, one skillet could feed a lot more.
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:09.120]   Who wants more?
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:17.120]   One skillet and one burner is feeding a great deal of people.
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:19.120]   Okay, I think that's probably enough.
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:20.120]   The same thing with this jiffy.
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:24.120]   The jiffy stuff here, it requires an egg and shortening.
[01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:25.120]   You know what happens?
[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:26.120]   The milk.
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:28.120]   If you just add water to this, you know what?
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:29.120]   You can do the same thing.
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:32.120]   If you have some milk, you put it in there, it's a little bit richer.
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:36.120]   You can take the cornmeal mix, put a little water with it, make a ball,
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:40.120]   and you can drop it into the hot oil, or you can do it on the skillet.
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:42.120]   The thing is, I want you to know, you can cook,
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:46.120]   you can feed your family with a source of heat, a burner of some type, okay,
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:52.120]   your gas stove, propane, gasoline, whatever, and a skillet and a pot.
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:58.120]   No big ovens, no Dutch ovens, no camping ovens, okay, skillets, big lots,
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:05.120]   $4 a piece, pots, one quart, two quart, four quarts, big lots, $2, $4, $5, okay?
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:09.120]   This is cheap stock.
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:11.120]   The flour was $0.89.
[01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:17.120]   Everything--I got it all itemized here.
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:22.120]   Okay, milk, when you buy milk, buy it in a Mylar pouch like a Kroger's, not in a box.
[01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:24.120]   It stays good for 10, 20 years.
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:31.120]   The box will go bad quicker because Mylar is a 1970s, '80s technology.
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:34.120]   Wax paper is a 1900s technology, okay?
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:38.120]   Mylar is a much better way to store your powdered milk.
[01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:42.120]   So buy it in the Mylar pouches.
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:47.120]   Flour tortillas, here's the basic recipe, two, one and a half, okay?
[01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:50.120]   Two cups of flour, one cup of water, one--I just wrote two, one and a half.
[01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:55.120]   But see, the way I told you I like better, a scoop of flour, a dollop of oil,
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:57.120]   a sprinkle of salt, water to make a dough.
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:00.120]   That you'll never forget for the rest of your life.
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:07.120]   Biscuits, a basic biscuit is just add baking powder to the same mixture and it puffs up.
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:08.120]   And you can bake it.
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:14.120]   If you have natural gas, you have a natural gas oven, you can now bake biscuits in your oven.
[01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:15.120]   Got it?
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:20.120]   In fact, I got a recipe here.
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:24.120]   You know, what makes things go bad?
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:26.120]   It's the oil and milk and stuff.
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:28.120]   When you bake things, it makes them go bad.
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:30.120]   It's like cakes spoil, right?
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:42.120]   And pancakes will spoil because they got--these biscuits here are flour, water, salt, sugars in here, and that's it.
[01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:43.120]   Baking powder.
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:44.120]   Baking powder.
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:45.120]   Oh, wow.
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:46.120]   So it's a new one.
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:47.120]   You know how old these are?
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:48.120]   No.
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:50.120]   You can bite--who's challenging?
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:52.120]   Who really wants to taste this?
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:54.120]   You really want to try one?
[01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:55.120]   You guys are old here.
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:57.120]   They're three years old.
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:58.120]   Oh, my God.
[01:36:58.120 --> 01:36:59.120]   Taste it.
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:00.120]   Try it.
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:01.120]   Bite into it.
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:02.120]   Your teeth are healthy.
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:03.120]   I'll taste that.
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:05.120]   [laughter]
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:11.120]   [unintelligible]
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:12.120]   You can also--
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:13.120]   [unintelligible]
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:15.120]   Yeah, it's bulletproof.
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:16.120]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:18.120]   You're crunching into it, though, aren't you?
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:19.120]   You're crunching into it.
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:21.120]   You can remix it with some water and everything.
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:22.120]   It's got a lot of calories to it.
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:24.120]   This has been like this in my cupboard.
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:25.120]   It's not even sealed.
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:27.120]   It's in this bag loose like this.
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:32.120]   And, you know, it's stored--this is the age-old recipe for hardtack
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:35.120]   that they used to use in ancient military on ships,
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:38.120]   except when you add the baking powder, it makes it a little bit fluffier
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:40.120]   and easier to crunch through.
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:43.120]   [unintelligible]
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:45.120]   You can eat animal food.
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:48.120]   It might play havoc with your digestive system.
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:49.120]   You can eat your animals.
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:51.120]   It's cheaper to buy a Purina.
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:54.120]   [unintelligible]
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:56.120]   Oh, this stuff, you can feed on the bread.
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:38:00.120]   [unintelligible]
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:01.120]   The heck with that.
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:03.120]   Eat the animal.
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:04.120]   Okay, serious.
[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:05.120]   Let's talk about this.
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:07.120]   We talked about feeding your family.
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:08.120]   Here it is right here.
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:10.120]   Can you build a house out of these?
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:11.120]   Yes.
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:13.120]   You know what holds together the brick and--
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:17.120]   you know what the mortar is for the bricks in many of the big old buildings in Russia?
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:18.120]   Eggs.
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:19.120]   Eggs.
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:22.120]   You make mortar out of eggs.
[01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:23.120]   Here we go.
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:27.120]   This is what--if you ladies so desire to stop or continue, that's fine.
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:28.120]   Okay, look at them rolling.
[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:30.120]   Notice--look, here's something to learn.
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:32.120]   See how quickly they're improving?
[01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:36.120]   See how quickly the tortillas are getting better?
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:38.120]   They're thinner.
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:40.120]   They're getting better, okay?
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:41.120]   It's not hard.
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:42.120]   They're learning very quickly.
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:44.120]   And it's not costing anything.
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:48.120]   You will learn very quickly when you need to.
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:51.120]   This base of stuff I got right here.
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:54.120]   I got two 5-pound bags of flour for $0.79.
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:55.120]   I got these at Aldi's.
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:56.120]   You know what Aldi's is?
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:58.120]   It's just cheaper than Kroger's, okay?
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:01.120]   But I got Aldi's in literally five minutes at Aldi's yesterday.
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:02.120]   I walked right through.
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:04.120]   I think you have the dollar store.
[01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:07.120]   Yes, the dollar store.
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:12.120]   At Aldi's, it's basically as cheap to buy the 5 pounds as it is the 50 pounds of Costco.
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:15.120]   Sometimes the 5 pounds are nice because you can put them in Ziploc bags
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:18.120]   and put them in places, okay?
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:20.120]   50-pound bags, 25-pound bags, sometimes they're harder to work.
[01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:24.120]   I store the larger 25-pound, 50-pound bags.
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:26.120]   Flour, 5 pounds of it, $0.79 each.
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:30.120]   Vegetable oil is the expensive thing, $1.49.
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:37.120]   The oil you want to store, you know what the fry shortening is that you get at Costco in 35-pound boxes?
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:41.120]   It's a box with a jug in it, 4 1/2 gallons, $12.
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:43.120]   It's at Gordon Food Service as well.
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:44.120]   You know what I'm talking about?
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:46.120]   These are the frying fish, okay?
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:48.120]   That's the real oil you want to store.
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:53.120]   You don't want to buy gallons of oil for $6 at Kroger's.
[01:39:53.120 --> 01:40:00.120]   You're better off spending your money on the hydrogenated fry oil for what you're going to be doing.
[01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:03.120]   Keep it sealed and it won't go rancid.
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:04.120]   Vegetable oil, $1.49.
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:06.120]   Salt, $0.23.
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:07.120]   Peanut butter, $1.29.
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:09.120]   Grape jelly, $0.99.
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:13.120]   Sugar, 5 pounds of it, more than I need for $1.69.
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:17.120]   Corn muffin mix, $0.25 a piece.
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:20.120]   Pancake mix, just out of the water, $0.85.
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:21.120]   Syrup was $0.89.
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:27.120]   All of this food costs $10.15.
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:32.120]   Everything, all this food can be made on a skillet.
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:34.120]   Nothing fancy, a skillet.
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:37.120]   You can get it on sale for a buck.
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:39.120]   You understand me?
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:44.120]   Tortillas, flatbread, cornbread, on the skillet and in oil.
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:48.120]   Peanut butter and jelly, pancakes in skillet and in oil, like I was talking.
[01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:52.120]   You can put pancake mix in oil, make a fry dough.
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:55.120]   You can put it on top of the skillet and make pancakes.
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:57.120]   Oil, sugar, water.
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:40:58.120]   You got this.
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:01.120]   You're not doing too bad, are you?
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:03.120]   That's one week for how many people?
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:04.120]   One week for one person.
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:11.120]   The rule of thumb is things that you add water to, like what do you add water to to eat?
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:14.120]   What do you use water to prepare stuff?
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:17.120]   Rice, beans.
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:23.120]   One pound per person per day is about a meal, I mean three meals.
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:28.120]   Things that you bake that you don't add water to, biscuits.
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:35.120]   Flour, corn, something that's biscuits, flatbreads, pancake mix, all those things.
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:41.120]   Two pounds per adult male in America per day.
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:42.120]   Asians are different.
[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:46.120]   They're smaller, okay, and they eat less.
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:50.120]   But for us, it's one pound and two pounds are the approximate amounts.
[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:56.120]   So if you have a 50-pound bag of flour, that's about 25 days for one large adult male.
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:58.120]   Got it?
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:05.120]   So that's how I say what I have up here is about a week, because I got 10 pounds of flour.
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:08.120]   I got a couple pounds of other stuff.
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:12.120]   Got it?
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:14.120]   Thank you, ladies.
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:15.120]   Thank you very much.
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:19.120]   [Applause]
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:21.120]   Really, we have an overflow here.
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:22.120]   It's passing.
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:25.120]   Okay, so here's your base.
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:27.120]   I'm going to look at this.
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:28.120]   I'm going to look at this.
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:30.120]   Who wants more?
[01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:32.120]   Okay, I'm going to look at this.
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:36.120]   Look at this, an American child eating this stuff, okay?
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:38.120]   Okay, here's your base.
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:42.120]   And now I'm looking at this from a Costco perspective or a Sam's Club perspective
[01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:45.120]   or a Gordon Food Service.
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:48.120]   You guys can split this.
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:49.120]   Here, you're a cert director.
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:51.120]   I want you to try this.
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:52.120]   Come on.
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:53.120]   Pass it around.
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:55.120]   Okay, what's rice cost?
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:43:00.120]   A hundred pounds of rice is about $15.
[01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:05.120]   Do you know that the average Asian eats one pound of rice per day?
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:08.120]   Believe me, I asked quite a few Asians, okay?
[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:12.120]   They're happy to eat rice three times a day, every day.
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:18.120]   And a small Asian female eats about--a small loss, average.
[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:21.120]   An Asian female eats about a pound of rice a day.
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:25.120]   You know that's $78 for a year's worth of food for one Asian.
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:26.120]   Think about it.
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:29.120]   I had a friend who took his girlfriend out for a steak dinner.
[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:32.120]   I put this in--I said, "You know, you spent that amount of money on steak dinner
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:35.120]   that could feed one person for a day--I mean for a year."
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:38.120]   Now that there's nothing bad that's going on, spending $70 on steak dinner.
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:44.120]   Just I wanted to put it in perspective as far as food storage goes and opportunity cost.
[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:47.120]   Flour, about $16--I put this in a hundred-pound term.
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:50.120]   $16 for a hundred pounds is about $4 for 25 pounds.
[01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:54.120]   Sugar, $20--$10 for 50.
[01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:58.120]   Oil, like I told you, you don't want the jugs of oil like I had,
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:00.120]   unless you're doing like a week or a month.
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:06.120]   If you're going for a year's worth or six months worth, you know, larger amounts,
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:10.120]   you're looking at the 35-pound--they're called 35-pound jugs,
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:12.120]   but they're liquid and it's 4 1/2 gallons.
[01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:15.120]   It's $12 at Gordon Food Service, about $13 at Costco.
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:18.120]   This is just a large amount of calories for you.
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:25.120]   Here's what I talk about two pounds per day dry, one pound per day wet.
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:27.120]   Now see--and what did I miss up here?
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:31.120]   What's a staple that I've missed that's stored for a long time, years and years, tens of years?
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:32.120]   Beans. I didn't put beans up here.
[01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:35.120]   Beans are about a dollar a pound on sale.
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:39.120]   Your sugar, are you going with the white or the brown sugar?
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:41.120]   White. White sugar.
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:47.120]   Just straight white sugar, the stuff that the nutritionists hate.
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:49.120]   Now this is your base, okay?
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:52.120]   You build a base, then you add to the base.
[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:57.120]   What do you use to augment your base to make the stuff taste better and give you more versatility?
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:59.120]   Butter and eggs.
[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:02.120]   No, you're not doing butter and eggs because you can't store them.
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:03.120]   Powdered milk.
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:05.120]   Powdered milk in a Mylar pouch.
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:06.120]   I've got to get cards out.
[01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:08.120]   Sugar and cinnamon.
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:10.120]   Cinnamon. Sugar's up there.
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:14.120]   But spices. Spices, sugar.
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:15.120]   Pepper.
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:18.120]   Pepper. Some people really like the spices.
[01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:22.120]   I don't, so that's why I don't go bam.
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:23.120]   Yeah, your spices.
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:25.120]   What else can you use to augment to make the--
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:29.120]   But at the same time, though, if this happens, you're going to have all that stuff in your house.
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:30.120]   No, you're not.
[01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:32.120]   No, you're not going to have much peanut butter.
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:35.120]   You don't have a week's worth of peanut butter in your house.
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:39.120]   Unless you're a peanut butter holic.
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:41.120]   Okay, peanut butter hog.
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:45.120]   I'm saying peanut butter lasts a week for me.
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:46.120]   Like I said, a week.
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:50.120]   No, but what I'm saying is if something happens or you've got this as your base--
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:51.120]   This is your base.
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:54.120]   Immediately you'll be able to use egg, whatever you've got in there.
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:58.120]   Right. Now, once you've bought your base, okay, this is not expensive stuff.
[01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:02.120]   You want a month's worth of food, we're talking 20, 30 bucks worth of stuff.
[01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:06.120]   But you want to have a better month's worth of food, okay, a little bit more enjoyable month's worth of food.
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:08.120]   We're talking about adding things to your base.
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:11.120]   We're talking about peanut butters, jellies.
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:13.120]   This is stuff you find--especially when you find it on sale.
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:15.120]   It's what you're keeping out.
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:18.120]   And another guy I like, his name is Clarence.
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:19.120]   There's a Clarence.
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:22.120]   Yeah, and Clarence has a Clarence, and you pick up things.
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:29.120]   So spices, powdered milk, peanut butter, jelly.
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:32.120]   What else can you add to this base so you can make other things?
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:33.120]   Remember, you're making stuff with--
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:35.120]   Powdered jelly.
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:39.120]   You're not going to be in my shelter, lady.
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:42.120]   You say that flour--how do you store the flour?
[01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:45.120]   I forgot flour.
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:47.120]   Well, it's because the bugs are in it to begin with.
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:49.120]   If they're not in it to begin with, you're really not going to get them.
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:51.120]   I have flour that's over 10 years old.
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:52.120]   You can come inspect it any time.
[01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:54.120]   I do. There's nothing in it.
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:56.120]   How do we want to store our flour, okay?
[01:46:56.120 --> 01:47:01.120]   How do we want to store our rice, our sugar, and our--how do we want to store our dry products?
[01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:07.120]   How do we want to--vacuum bags would be the best way, but it's not a resource available to most people.
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:08.120]   Jars.
[01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:10.120]   Jars are a good way, but they're expensive.
[01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:13.120]   It takes a lot of energy to make glass.
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:16.120]   You're paying for that energy content of glass.
[01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:19.120]   Glass is expensive because you've got to get up to about 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit,
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:22.120]   float it over a pool of tin, and then form it.
[01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:24.120]   That's why glass is expensive.
[01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:28.120]   Plastic bags are a good way, but what's the enemy of our food storage?
[01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:31.120]   What degrades our food?
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:32.120]   Oxygen.
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:34.120]   Oxygen, and what else?
[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:36.120]   Moisture.
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:37.120]   Okay?
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:38.120]   We're going to keep the bugs out.
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:39.120]   We know that.
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:43.120]   So one of the best ways--let's say you're going for a month's worth of food or more.
[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:48.120]   I really would love for everyone here to have at least a month's worth of food of these basics.
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:52.120]   Believe me, you just might be using it.
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:54.120]   So we're going to be talking about this type of stuff.
[01:47:54.120 --> 01:48:00.120]   What did I say holds the world record for storage?
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:07.120]   These hold the world record for price as far as the amount of space for the best integrity of material.
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:14.120]   These 18-gallon totes are cheaper than 5-gallon totes, are cheaper than 50-gallon totes,
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:17.120]   are cheaper than 5-gallon pails.
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:18.120]   Okay?
[01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:19.120]   This size right here.
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:22.120]   Plus you can generally--if it's full of flour, it might weigh 100 pounds.
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:29.120]   Two men or two people can still pick it up and move it at least some distance.
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:30.120]   Question?
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:33.120]   What's the cheapest--
[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:34.120]   What's that?
[01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:36.120]   What's the cheapest store?
[01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:38.120]   Store?
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:40.120]   Costco, Sam's Garden Food Service.
[01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:44.120]   Or the smaller quantities at Aldi's or Dollar Store or any other discount.
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:46.120]   Oh, these, the totes.
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:49.120]   It varies from big lots to lows.
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:52.120]   It has very good prices on Rubbermaid.
[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:55.120]   Lows have a great selection of plastics.
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:49:00.120]   When you see them at sale at other places, you see a $4 tote on sale for $2.50.
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:02.120]   Buy $20 worth, okay?
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:03.120]   Now, what do you do?
[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:06.120]   We're not going to talk about vacuum packaging.
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:09.120]   We're not going to talk about using carbon dioxide, dry ice, or anything else.
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:15.120]   That's a more advanced technique that you want to use for grains, wheat, and corn.
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:17.120]   We're not going to cover that in this class.
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:20.120]   What I want you to do is to get--
[01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:24.120]   See, the big thing about storage stuff is the cost of the box that you put stuff into.
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:30.120]   You can spend more money on this container or other containers than on what's going into it.
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:31.120]   Look at gasoline.
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:33.120]   $1.50 a gallon.
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:35.120]   It's going to cost you $5 for the container to put it into.
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:36.120]   That doubles your price.
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:41.120]   You want to store $100, 100 gallons worth of gas, you're talking about $100 in containers, let alone the gasoline.
[01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:43.120]   So you've got a $4 tote.
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:44.120]   Just take your bags of flour.
[01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:47.120]   We call it two or three 25-pound bags that fit in here.
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:48.120]   Put the lid on.
[01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:51.120]   See those two holes here on the bottom?
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:54.120]   I mean on the handles, two holes on each side.
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:57.120]   Tape these up or use silicone and shove them.
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:49:58.120]   Put the lid on.
[01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:02.120]   If you're going to be in and out of it, put duct tape around it or any other type of tape.
[01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:05.120]   If you want to seal it up for years, silicone it.
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:08.120]   If you're not going to use it until you get into it, silicone it.
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:11.120]   That duct tape will work in a pinch.
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:13.120]   And all of that's going to do is keep the moisture out.
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:17.120]   Duct tape degrades over about a year or two and moisture will get in.
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:19.120]   And even then your flour will still be okay.
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:22.120]   I've got flour that was exposed to the atmosphere for five, six years.
[01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:23.120]   It's just fine.
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:27.120]   It's just that in a humid environment like today and other places in the world,
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:31.120]   it would be better if you put it into a plastic container and sealed it.
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:37.120]   Now, if you have nothing else, put it in a clean garbage bag and tie it off shut, your flour,
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:39.120]   because it wants to absorb moisture.
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:41.120]   Put it in a bag and just close it.
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:45.120]   That's a ten-cent option to you for storing your flour.
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:47.120]   If this is better, that will work.
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:48.120]   Same thing for rice.
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:50.120]   The enemy is moisture and oxygen.
[01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:52.120]   Seal it up with something like this.
[01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:54.120]   You don't have to get fancy.
[01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:59.120]   You don't have to-- those seal-a-meal things are ridiculously priced that you get on TV and at Costco.
[01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:05.120]   You're spending-- you can spend more money on the plastic than you do on the steak going into it.
[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:06.120]   So forget that, okay?
[01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:12.120]   You want to use mass-manufactured, cheapest stuff you can to store your stuff.
[01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:17.120]   Any questions on how you're going to store your flour, your rice, your sugar, your oil?
[01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:24.120]   The oil you're just going to store in its original container in as cool and dark of a place as you can, closet or basement.
[01:51:24.120 --> 01:51:30.120]   You have any questions in your mind at all about how you're going to store what you just buy at the store?
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:35.120]   Okay.
[01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:41.120]   Kitty litter is principally dyed--
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:45.120]   Used or new?
[01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:49.120]   You will use the used stuff.
[01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:54.120]   Well, I mean the scoopable containers that they come in, the plastic ones.
[01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:59.120]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, kitty litter and, like, gallon jugs and stuff.
[01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:00.120]   Well, they're big.
[01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:01.120]   You know what?
[01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:02.120]   Oh, yeah, sure.
[01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:03.120]   You know what?
[01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:06.120]   You could even store your flour and your sugar in those little soda bottles, dry them out.
[01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:08.120]   You can store stuff in there as well.
[01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:12.120]   Okay, that's a--I mean, use what you got around you that's free.
[01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:13.120]   Coolers?
[01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:15.120]   No, no coolers.
[01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:17.120]   Before you--
[01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:18.120]   No, I'm saying that you--
[01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:20.120]   Before you throw it away, yeah.
[01:52:20.120 --> 01:52:21.120]   You know the vodka bottles and stuff?
[01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:26.120]   You know how I store in vodka bottles and any type of glass bottle, wine bottle or something?
[01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:29.120]   I put kerosene into them.
[01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:32.120]   Molotov cocktails?
[01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:33.120]   No, I don't do it for Molotov cocktails.
[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:35.120]   See, I don't have any kids.
[01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:39.120]   I know I won't drop it or break it, but the thing is, if you wanted to fill a lantern up,
[01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:44.120]   it's easier to take a bottle and fill up a lantern with kerosene than it is a five-gallon container.
[01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:46.120]   Plus, it's free.
[01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:47.120]   I mean, I wasn't going to throw it out.
[01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:49.120]   I mean, a kerosene container costs $10.
[01:52:49.120 --> 01:52:51.120]   That's $10 for five gallons.
[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:55.120]   That's $2 a gallon on top of the dollar 60 you're paying for kerosene to begin with.
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:53:02.120]   So if I put away five gallons in jars over the period of a year, that's $10 I save that I can put towards something else.
[01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:04.120]   It's just something that I had that I was going to use.
[01:53:04.120 --> 01:53:07.120]   If you're worried about dropping it and breaking it, don't use it.
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:08.120]   Don't do that.
[01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:12.120]   But me, I don't have that concern yet.
[01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:15.120]   Ask, "What else do you buy in the store?
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:17.120]   We cover jam, jelly, peanut butter, anything."
[01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:21.120]   Oh, something else you can buy in the store that's good?
[01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:22.120]   Just add water soups.
[01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:23.120]   They're dehydrated.
[01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:29.120]   Anything dehydrated stores for years and years, decades, okay?
[01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:30.120]   Question?
[01:53:30.120 --> 01:53:32.120]   Tuna?
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:37.120]   If I get some pictures that aren't in here, tuna comes in a very well-sealed can, okay?
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:38.120]   That can store for a long time.
[01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:44.120]   In fact, they've got these really nice Mylar pouches with tuna in it, and they'll store for a very long time.
[01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:47.120]   But what's wrong with buying tuna for long-term storage?
[01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:50.120]   Expensive, okay?
[01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:56.120]   You can store a week's worth of tuna for what you would spend for five months worth of flour.
[01:53:56.120 --> 01:53:59.120]   But you'd use tuna to augment your base.
[01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:01.120]   Once you had a base, you said, "I have two months worth of food.
[01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:05.120]   I'm happy with two months worth of food," and you really love tuna or something,
[01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:10.120]   and you found it on sale, you'd buy it, you'd use it to augment your stores.
[01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:14.120]   I am -- that's a treat -- I am not a big fan of food rotations.
[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:20.120]   Food rotations where you buy ten boxes of something, take one box off, eat your cornflakes,
[01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:24.120]   and you go to the store, you buy another one, you put it back into the back of the queue,
[01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:26.120]   and you keep on moving through.
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:28.120]   Historically, people fail to do this.
[01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:29.120]   They fail to rotate their food.
[01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:31.120]   I won't even recommend it.
[01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:36.120]   I want you to get a bunch of stuff that will store for 20 years,
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:42.120]   and I want you to put it away and forget about it or, you know, add to it so it's there when you need it.
[01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:47.120]   You don't open it up and it's spoiled or it's -- I want you to buy a bunch of stuff that will always be there,
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:50.120]   and that's your base, okay?
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:52.120]   I don't want you to spend a lot of money doing it.
[01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:53.120]   I covered this a bit.
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:57.120]   Natural gas will not go off, pretty much, okay?
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:01.120]   I mean, short of nuclear detonations, large upheavals of the earth and other stuff,
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:04.120]   you can pretty much depend upon your natural gas.
[01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:11.120]   If I was going to tell you how to store stuff for cooking and baking, it would be a class in itself.
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:17.120]   We talk about diesel, kerosene, propane, price advantages and everything.
[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:20.120]   So you can pretty much depend upon your natural gas not going off.
[01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:28.120]   If you don't have natural gas or you want something to augment your natural gas, in case it does go off,
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:31.120]   for short periods of time, months worth of food storage, you can look at propane.
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:37.120]   Little bottles of it or the barbecue jugs are cheap enough.
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:39.120]   They're reasonably priced.
[01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:45.120]   And since we're not talking about baking bread over 45 minutes, we're talking about making tortillas in minutes, okay?
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:49.120]   Propane will work under these situations.
[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:57.120]   Me, I store gasoline in gasoline containers and containers capable of holding gasoline
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:00.120]   because I'm very comfortable with gasoline.
[01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:04.120]   I work with hydrocarbon chemistry, thermal chemistry on a regular basis.
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:09.120]   You don't keep gasoline in your basement where it can leak and get to a pilot light.
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:13.120]   I keep it in my garage that's not attached to my house, okay?
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:17.120]   I keep gasoline because I want just one thing that does a lot.
[01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:19.120]   So I can use gasoline.
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:22.120]   I got a little gasoline Coleman stove.
[01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:27.120]   You can get gasoline Coleman stoves at Walmart for $35 and $55.
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:30.120]   One burner, $35; two burners, $55.
[01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:32.120]   The typical green stove, you know what I'm talking about?
[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:33.120]   It runs on gasoline.
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:41.120]   So if I got gasoline, not only can I move my car if I have to get to places or haul people or move things,
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:46.120]   I'll show you in a minute how you can make electricity off of it without a generator.
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:49.120]   I can run my stove off of it.
[01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:53.120]   So it's one thing for me that does a lot of different things.
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:56.120]   If you're not comfortable with gasoline, don't start.
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:56:59.120]   If you say, "Well, this is no big deal for me," I can do it safely.
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:04.120]   Mark Fournier from the War and Fire Department won't throw a fit.
[01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:06.120]   Then go ahead and use gasoline.
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:09.120]   It's much more flexible.
[01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:12.120]   Gasoline you can store indefinitely.
[01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:16.120]   The enemy of gasoline is oxygen and light, okay?
[01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:20.120]   So you want to have cool, dark, and tightly sealed.
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:26.120]   If you store gasoline in a container you get from the store, a gasoline container, take the spout out.
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:30.120]   Because the spout's down in the fuel, it'll build up vapor pressure on a day like today,
[01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:35.120]   and it'll push down on the gas and force it out the spout no matter how hard you crank it down.
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:36.120]   You'll get gasoline leak.
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:40.120]   So you take the spout out and you crank it down, seal the end very tightly.
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:44.120]   And then when you're in your garage, if you smell gasoline, you know you've got a small leak.
[01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:45.120]   It's leaking out, okay?
[01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:48.120]   So you've got to be diligent and keep an eye on it.
[01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:52.120]   If you store it in metal containers like five-gallon metal tins, be careful.
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:56.120]   You can get condensation on it and it'll rust. If it rusts to the bottom, the gas will leak out.
[01:57:56.120 --> 01:57:58.120]   In your garage, you can just make a mess.
[01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:02.120]   In your house, in your basement where you never put gasoline, you'll find your water heater,
[01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:09.120]   power light, and it'll end your problems with food storage because you won't have a place to store it.
[01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:11.120]   Gasoline, I mentioned, this is me.
[01:58:11.120 --> 01:58:13.120]   This is Rachel Nevada.
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:17.120]   Anyone know what Rachel Nevada's famous for?
[01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:19.120]   It's a desert. No kidding.
[01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:20.120]   What's near Rachel Nevada?
[01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:21.120]   Anyone know?
[01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:25.120]   This is worth three cards.
[01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:26.120]   A test facility.
[01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:28.120]   Whose test facility?
[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:30.120]   Government testing.
[01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:31.120]   What testing?
[01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:34.120]   Area 51.
[01:58:34.120 --> 01:58:36.120]   The lady gets three cards.
[01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:38.120]   One, two, three.
[01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:39.120]   Area 51's out there.
[01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:41.120]   Now, I'm not out there because Area 51.
[01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:44.120]   I'm just going through and I happen to have been close to it.
[01:58:44.120 --> 01:58:45.120]   Nellis is near there, too.
[01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:48.120]   It's called the Nellis Bombing Range, officially, okay?
[01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:53.120]   I guess if you violate the perimeter, you get a ticket for violating the Nellis Air Force Bombing Range.
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:56.120]   No, it doesn't.
[01:58:56.120 --> 01:58:58.120]   Okay, here I am in Rachel Nevada.
[01:58:58.120 --> 01:58:59.120]   Here's the sign.
[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:03.120]   110 miles to the next gasoline, okay?
[01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:06.120]   And the gas station in Rachel closes at 6 p.m.
[01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:07.120]   I'm sitting here.
[01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:14.120]   I've got another 400 miles of range in my truck because I've got two 15-gallon barrels of gasoline in the back of the truck
[01:59:14.120 --> 01:59:18.120]   because I have a 700-mile range when I travel.
[01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:26.120]   Here's actually -- you can see I've got -- underneath the cover I've got two 15-gallon HDPE drums.
[01:59:26.120 --> 01:59:29.120]   These are the same drums you use for storing water.
[01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:30.120]   I've got gasoline in them.
[01:59:30.120 --> 01:59:32.120]   And they're sealed tight.
[01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:36.120]   I've got a siphon hose going down into the gas tank and I'm actually refilling.
[01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:40.120]   I'm very comfortable with high vapor pressure hydrocarbons, okay?
[01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:42.120]   I do this because I understand them very well.
[01:59:42.120 --> 01:59:46.120]   I actually refill as I'm driving down the road.
[01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:48.120]   I thought you'd just find this interesting.
[01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:52.120]   This is actually -- this actually evolved into a concept that I've taught.
[01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:54.120]   It's called an Iditarod vehicle.
[01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:56.120]   You know what the Iditarod race was?
[01:59:56.120 --> 02:00:00.120]   You know, they had to do over 1,000 miles and the dog says go get a vaccine, and then they came back.
[02:00:00.120 --> 02:00:01.120]   That's what most people forget.
[02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:05.120]   They came -- they went back with the vaccine.
[02:00:05.120 --> 02:00:09.120]   This allows -- in emergency services, the Iditarod vehicle allows you to take a vehicle
[02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:12.120]   and to go a very long distance one way and then come back.
[02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:16.120]   Let's say we had a massive outbreak in the United States.
[02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:17.120]   You're quarantined.
[02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:18.120]   You're not leaving the state.
[02:00:18.120 --> 02:00:19.120]   You're not leaving the city.
[02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:25.120]   And we had some dead bodies here, and we had to get them to Samarit or the CDC for analysis.
[02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:26.120]   Let's say it was critical.
[02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:29.120]   Or a police station radio broke down, the only part was in Iowa.
[02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:34.120]   You need a vehicle that can go there and come back without stopping.
[02:00:34.120 --> 02:00:35.120]   And, you know, this is how this evolved.
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:38.120]   It's called the Iditarod vehicle concept.
[02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:40.120]   And this is how I tested it and did it.
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:43.120]   Actually, I'll be leaving tomorrow or the next day.
[02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:48.120]   I'll be gone for a month, and I'll drive 10,000 miles, and I'll have these barrels in the truck.
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:49.120]   They're actually in there now.
[02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:56.120]   I will drive past gasoline in the mountains at two dollars a gallon and fill up at less than about 50 in a major town.
[02:00:56.120 --> 02:00:59.120]   Other than that, I'd only be able to drive 300 miles.
[02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:01.120]   With this, I can drive 700.
[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:03.120]   But that's me.
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:05.120]   Energy.
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:09.120]   Let's see, we stopped at eight.
[02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:12.120]   Anyone need a break, or shall we keep on going?
[02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:14.120]   Energy.
[02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:19.120]   This is something else that you'll find interesting and you won't forget.
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:25.120]   We're going to talk about taking everything, basically everything that you had that was useful
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:30.120]   and now became useless and making it useful again.
[02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:31.120]   Forget your freezer.
[02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:34.120]   Forget your refrigerator, your microwave.
[02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:35.120]   How many people have a freezer full of stuff?
[02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:41.120]   I mean a real freezer full of stuff, like half cows and stuff like that.
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:43.120]   Generators are for thunderstorms.
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:47.120]   You have a generator if your power is going to be out for most of the week.
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:51.120]   I just love when people buy a $500 generator and have five gallons worth of gas for it.
[02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:55.120]   It'll be right out in a couple hours.
[02:01:55.120 --> 02:02:02.120]   But you use a generator to keep your house, your freezer going, if you have a power outage from something short.
[02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:09.120]   We're talking here about major threats to your life that are lasting weeks or months, 9/11 and worse.
[02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:15.120]   And believe me, it's not hard for our enemies to do things to us that are much worse.
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:18.120]   Not--we'll see, what was it?
[02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:22.120]   World Trade Center, that was about $100 million.
[02:02:22.120 --> 02:02:25.120]   We're talking about economic damage.
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:26.120]   It's $100 million?
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:29.120]   No, $100--sorry, we're talking $100 billion.
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:33.120]   $100 billion of economic damage done to us with 9/11.
[02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:37.120]   Disasters that are easy to create and do, we're talking not $100 billion,
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:42.120]   we're talking tens of trillions of dollars of damage to the United States of America.
[02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:48.120]   So generators aren't going to cover it if your power situation is out.
[02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:50.120]   So forget your refrigerator, forget your freezer.
[02:02:50.120 --> 02:02:54.120]   The first thing you're going to do is you're going to eat everything in your freezer and your refrigerator.
[02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:56.120]   It's pretty good eating, too.
[02:02:56.120 --> 02:02:58.120]   I mean you're going to be eating steak for a week.
[02:02:58.120 --> 02:03:03.120]   Your freezer will stay cold if you don't open it much for two, three days at least.
[02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:08.120]   You can put quilts and blankets and other things on top of it and extend that a little bit longer.
[02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:12.120]   The meat will stay good in ambient conditions for a couple days as well.
[02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:19.120]   Or you can put the meat in your cooler.
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:24.120]   So with this energy concept I'm going to show you, forget the big stuff.
[02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:27.120]   You aren't going to be able to use it anyways.
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:32.120]   I mean what do you want to use a refrigerator for when there's no grocery store to get stuff and put it back into it?
[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:34.120]   I mean you can make tortillas in 30 seconds.
[02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:36.120]   You can't refrigerate your tortillas.
[02:03:36.120 --> 02:03:39.120]   You see what I'm talking about?
[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:41.120]   First thing with energy, the most basic thing.
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:52.120]   I loathe many things the government says, especially ready.gov, the Red Cross website, and a few others.
[02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:56.120]   They say make sure you have a flashlight and batteries.
[02:03:56.120 --> 02:04:01.120]   People, it is so darn easy to say what type of batteries.
[02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:11.120]   Do not bet your life and your emergency kit or your illumination on a little penlight flashlight with two AA batteries in it.
[02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:14.120]   It's a very small source of energy.
[02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:24.120]   It's actually 2,400 -- it's 2.4 ampere hours in a AA alkaline.
[02:04:24.120 --> 02:04:31.120]   A D cell is 14 ampere hours, seven times the energy in a D cell battery.
[02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:39.120]   If you have a flashlight, I don't care if it's a dollar EverReady flashlight, you want to have a D cell flashlight.
[02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:43.120]   And in it you want to have D cell alkaline batteries.
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:44.120]   Question?
[02:04:44.120 --> 02:04:48.120]   How good are those real big square batteries?
[02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:50.120]   Oh, the square ones?
[02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:55.120]   The square batteries are actually the same as four D cells put together, exactly the same.
[02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:56.120]   So to answer your question.
[02:04:56.120 --> 02:04:59.120]   So four D cell mag lights are the same as one of those flashlights?
[02:04:59.120 --> 02:05:00.120]   That's right.
[02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:03.120]   But what you really want -- four D cell mag lights, a lot of light.
[02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:05.120]   You want to use that for searching for a lost child.
[02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:08.120]   You want smaller lights for most of your main stuff.
[02:05:08.120 --> 02:05:15.120]   So a $1 cheap flashlight works just fine for -- you've got either one, you're not going to trip over stuff in the house.
[02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:17.120]   So you want the one that draws less energy from around the house.
[02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:20.120]   So you want a D cell flashlight, okay?
[02:05:20.120 --> 02:05:21.120]   You want to have alkaline batteries.
[02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:23.120]   My preference is Duracell.
[02:05:23.120 --> 02:05:25.120]   They have very good chemistry in them.
[02:05:25.120 --> 02:05:28.120]   They handle cold and heat very well.
[02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:31.120]   Speaking of batteries, what does a date on a battery mean?
[02:05:31.120 --> 02:05:33.120]   Who can tell me?
[02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:41.120]   [ Indiscernible ]
[02:05:41.120 --> 02:05:42.120]   What does it mean?
[02:05:42.120 --> 02:05:45.120]   What is -- with the battery, what reaches that date?
[02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:47.120]   It's about five years in the future.
[02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:48.120]   It's expired.
[02:05:48.120 --> 02:05:49.120]   It's expired.
[02:05:49.120 --> 02:05:51.120]   [ Indiscernible ]
[02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:52.120]   No.
[02:05:52.120 --> 02:05:53.120]   Here's all it means.
[02:05:53.120 --> 02:06:00.120]   It means at that date, if the battery is stored at room temperature, ambient conditions of a house, 72 degrees,
[02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:09.120]   if the battery is stored at those temperatures on that date, it has approximately 82 to 84 percent of its original energy when it was made.
[02:06:09.120 --> 02:06:17.120]   So if those batteries would power a radio for 100 hours when you bought them, on that date, five years in the future,
[02:06:17.120 --> 02:06:23.120]   if stored at ambient conditions, it would power your radio for 82 to 84 hours.
[02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:29.120]   Those batteries will have a great deal of their energy even after 10 years of sitting in your drawer.
[02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:34.120]   I have alkalines that are 15 years old, and they still work just fine.
[02:06:34.120 --> 02:06:43.120]   After 10 years, they might only have 45 or 50 percent of their energy in them, but that is a lot better than nothing, isn't it?
[02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:46.120]   [ Indiscernible ]
[02:06:46.120 --> 02:06:48.120]   It's a stupid public point.
[02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:50.120]   It's an ignorant public point, okay?
[02:06:50.120 --> 02:06:53.120]   And it's marketing and other things, but that's what it means.
[02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:56.120]   Now it's a tool for you to look at.
[02:06:56.120 --> 02:06:58.120]   I have batteries dated 1998.
[02:06:58.120 --> 02:07:01.120]   I can bring them out and show you they work just fine.
[02:07:01.120 --> 02:07:06.120]   They're just going to have less power--I mean, less life than a fresh one.
[02:07:06.120 --> 02:07:10.120]   But running for 50, 60 hours is better than running for no hours.
[02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:12.120]   So they store very long times.
[02:07:12.120 --> 02:07:13.120]   True or false?
[02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:17.120]   Do your batteries store better if they're in the refrigerator or freezer?
[02:07:17.120 --> 02:07:19.120]   False.
[02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:25.120]   100 percent, without a doubt, false, directly from the head chemist at Duracell Corporation.
[02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:30.120]   I don't care what popular science, consumer reports, or anything else has told you.
[02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:31.120]   I've done it.
[02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:32.120]   It's false.
[02:07:32.120 --> 02:07:34.120]   Batteries are formulated.
[02:07:34.120 --> 02:07:38.120]   Remember I told you I was an electrical chemical person for Chrysler Corporation?
[02:07:38.120 --> 02:07:39.120]   What are batteries?
[02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:41.120]   They're electrical chemical reaction.
[02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:45.120]   It's actually a redox operation of reduction of metal.
[02:07:45.120 --> 02:07:48.120]   It's a metal chemistry reaction.
[02:07:48.120 --> 02:07:53.120]   They are formulated, the paste, the alkaline paste, and the metal,
[02:07:53.120 --> 02:07:59.120]   especially formulated with alloys and everything, to have its maximum storage and operating ability
[02:07:59.120 --> 02:08:04.120]   at ambient conditions of a house, around 72 degrees Fahrenheit,
[02:08:04.120 --> 02:08:06.120]   because where do people store things?
[02:08:06.120 --> 02:08:07.120]   In their house.
[02:08:07.120 --> 02:08:10.120]   And they want to be able to advertise they've got the best life of anyone else?
[02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:12.120]   That's how it's all developed.
[02:08:12.120 --> 02:08:14.120]   Keep your batteries in your drawer.
[02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:16.120]   Your basement's fine.
[02:08:16.120 --> 02:08:18.120]   If it's 55 or 60, that's in your basement.
[02:08:18.120 --> 02:08:19.120]   That's fine.
[02:08:19.120 --> 02:08:20.120]   Don't freeze them.
[02:08:20.120 --> 02:08:22.120]   Don't put them in your refrigerator.
[02:08:22.120 --> 02:08:24.120]   Don't put your film in your refrigerator, not your batteries.
[02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:27.120]   Who uses film anymore, though?
[02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:29.120]   And you'll get the maximum life on your batteries.
[02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:35.120]   Buying batteries at Costco for less than a buck apiece is a great way to have an immediate source of energy.
[02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:39.120]   If you're going to have an emergency radio, what do you want it to be powered off of?
[02:08:39.120 --> 02:08:40.120]   Batteries.
[02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:44.120]   There's that government side again.
[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:45.120]   Have extra batteries.
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:49.120]   If you're going to put a radio aside, you want it to run off of D cell batteries.
[02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:53.120]   A small of a radio you can get running off of D cells.
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:59.120]   You can get them for $20, $30, $15, $10 a big watch.
[02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:04.120]   I take the little RadioShack $8 AM/FM transistor radios, the ones that have two double As in them,
[02:09:04.120 --> 02:09:06.120]   and I solder on to them a D cell.
[02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:10.120]   You need to get a pack that holds two D cells, a RadioShack, two wires.
[02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:13.120]   I solder on the terminals and I put D cells into it.
[02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:19.120]   You know how long that little AM/FM radio plays 24 hours a day on two D cells?
[02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:21.120]   Three and a half months.
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:22.120]   Okay?
[02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:25.120]   You know those wind-up radios you buy with the springs?
[02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:27.120]   You know what spring life is?
[02:09:27.120 --> 02:09:29.120]   You know everything has spring life?
[02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:34.120]   How many hours do you think before that spring goes boing, it doesn't work anymore?
[02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:35.120]   3,000 hours.
[02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:40.120]   Now, in an emergency, how many hours a day do you think you'd be listening to the radio?
[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:42.120]   12 hours at least.
[02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:47.120]   But Duracell batteries at Costco are a bucket--less than a bucket piece, okay?
[02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:49.120]   So say they're a bucket piece.
[02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:55.120]   Four batteries, two at a time, two batteries in the radio, then you expire them,
[02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:57.120]   you put two more batteries in.
[02:09:57.120 --> 02:10:04.120]   Those $4 worth of batteries in an $8 radio plays for longer than the spring does.
[02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:06.120]   That costs $60, $80.
[02:10:06.120 --> 02:10:07.120]   Okay?
[02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:09.120]   And you don't have to sit there and crank the darn thing either.
[02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:11.120]   You just leave it on.
[02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:19.120]   So, D-Cell batteries are really a marvel of modern material science and modern chemical chemistry.
[02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:23.120]   They are a world different than batteries that were made originally.
[02:10:23.120 --> 02:10:25.120]   Competition has really evolved them.
[02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:27.120]   So D-Cell is a key word.
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:29.120]   Alkaline, I prefer Duracell.
[02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:32.120]   If you're buying batteries that you're using all the time,
[02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:37.120]   the Rayovacs alkalines have the best dollar per energy that you can use.
[02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:39.120]   That is if you're using batteries on a regular basis.
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:42.120]   If you're storing them, I prefer to have you have Duracell.
[02:10:42.120 --> 02:10:47.120]   Rechargeables, don't you dare have a rechargeable battery in anything you're going to bet your life on, okay?
[02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:52.120]   I will get seriously angry and violent with you if I see you doing that.
[02:10:52.120 --> 02:11:02.120]   Rechargeables have a fraction of the energy of an alkaline, one-fourth, one-fifth in general, okay, in a D-Cell market.
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:04.120]   Some of the newer ones are half.
[02:11:04.120 --> 02:11:05.120]   Same with rechargeables.
[02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:08.120]   I told you how long the alkalines last, okay?
[02:11:08.120 --> 02:11:13.120]   Ten years on the date, ten years at least in 15 years that I have.
[02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:17.120]   Nickel metal high-drive batteries lose more than 1% per day.
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:20.120]   That means in 100 days, they're dead.
[02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:22.120]   You can't store them and put them away and use them, but you can't rely upon them.
[02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:23.120]   They'll be dead.
[02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:25.120]   They have their own purpose.
[02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:32.120]   But not in your go bag, not in your cert kit, not in the flashlight that when you go and grab it, it has to work.
[02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:34.120]   Don't ever use rechargeable for any of those.
[02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:36.120]   Rechargeables die after a certain number of years.
[02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:38.120]   They just don't work anymore.
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:44.120]   It could be three years, four years, five years, seven years, depending upon how good and what the technology is of the battery.
[02:11:44.120 --> 02:11:49.120]   Either way, we're talking about things that I want you to get and put away for years and decades.
[02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:54.120]   So when your life is going to depend upon it, it's got to be a good alkaline battery.
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:58.120]   Oklahoma City, the fire department and police department, they have charge sticks.
[02:11:58.120 --> 02:11:59.120]   You know what those are?
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:04.120]   They're rechargeable batteries all put together, so they go into the police flashlights because they use them every day
[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:08.120]   and the police can't take them home and give them to the kids working their toys.
[02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:13.120]   Imagine being a rescue worker, crawling into the aftermath of Oklahoma City.
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:14.120]   It took you three hours to crawl in there.
[02:12:14.120 --> 02:12:17.120]   If you're just getting near the rescue victim, it'll take you three hours to crawl out.
[02:12:17.120 --> 02:12:21.120]   Your battery will go, "Foop."
[02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:29.120]   There were men stuck in there with no light because they were relying upon their mag light flashlight with rechargeable nightcap stick in it.
[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:37.120]   When the World Trade Center happened, I called my buddies at Duracell and I said, "Guys, get trucks down there quickly,"
[02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:39.120]   because I knew this was what happened in Oklahoma City.
[02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:42.120]   And they said, "Steve, the trucks are already there."
[02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:48.120]   They sent semi-trailers full of cases and cases of batteries down to the World Trade Center
[02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:50.120]   because they knew that they were going to need them.
[02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:51.120]   They were going to be in places.
[02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:55.120]   When you're in the dark and your light goes, it's dark.
[02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:56.120]   You're stuck there.
[02:12:56.120 --> 02:12:59.120]   These senses, your eyeballs are gone.
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:02.120]   You're relying on your ears and your fingers.
[02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:05.120]   You don't want to be in the dark and get stuck.
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:09.120]   So there's a good thing to remember to take home with D-cells.
[02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:15.120]   Okay, now this is for some of you guys and this is not for some of you guys.
[02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:20.120]   I'd really like to have the certain members who can have these things have them,
[02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:24.120]   and I'd like some of you to have them in your house as well.
[02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:27.120]   See this? What did I teach you about stuff?
[02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:28.120]   See this? Forget it.
[02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:30.120]   Don't go, "This is a battery pack."
[02:13:30.120 --> 02:13:33.120]   Don't go, "Oh, what's that battery pack he's got? What does it do?"
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:35.120]   This is just a 12-volt battery.
[02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:36.120]   Why do I have this here?
[02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:39.120]   Because I didn't want to haul car battery into the police station.
[02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:40.120]   It's too heavy.
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:42.120]   This is a 12-volt source, just like your car.
[02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:45.120]   It's just 12 volts.
[02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:53.120]   So please ignore just this little pack right here.
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:56.120]   What I'm holding up is an inverter.
[02:13:56.120 --> 02:14:01.120]   Who can tell me what an inverter does?
[02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:02.120]   Supply electricity.
[02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:04.120]   It takes DC and turns it into AC.
[02:14:04.120 --> 02:14:05.120]   That's right.
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:09.120]   It takes DC, and you were going to say the same thing, weren't you?
[02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:16.120]   It takes DC, 12-volt DC, and it turns it into a modified sine wave, 110 to 120-volt AC.
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:20.120]   This is rated at 400 watts, which is a fairly decent amount of power.
[02:14:20.120 --> 02:14:24.120]   And it will run your television set off of your car.
[02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:27.120]   But basically, this takes--you can't store AC.
[02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:31.120]   You have to make it, but you can store DC in the battery.
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:36.120]   So I'm going to clamp it on here, just like I would clamp it onto my car battery.
[02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:42.120]   Open my hood and clamp it on and turn it on.
[02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:54.120]   And I am producing AC voltage.
[02:14:54.120 --> 02:15:05.120]   I'll tell you the real advantage of these things.
[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:06.120]   Come on up here, young man.
[02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:08.120]   Come on up here.
[02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:10.120]   I need you to be my Christmas tree.
[02:15:10.120 --> 02:15:14.120]   Let's hold this up towards the audience.
[02:15:14.120 --> 02:15:16.120]   Okay.
[02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:18.120]   That's a 110-watt bulb.
[02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:27.120]   It's my favorite because this is--all the bulbs I'm going to show you--see these?
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:29.120]   Who can tell me what these are called?
[02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:31.120]   What's their trade name or what class?
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:34.120]   No, no, no.
[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:37.120]   Fluorescent, but it's called a--
[02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:39.120]   Energy saver?
[02:15:39.120 --> 02:15:42.120]   No, it's called a compact fluorescent bulb.
[02:15:42.120 --> 02:15:43.120]   Okay.
[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:44.120]   You've seen these?
[02:15:44.120 --> 02:15:49.120]   In fact, you've seen these sometimes for $15 a piece, sometimes for $2 a piece.
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:51.120]   Okay, I got this one for $2 a piece.
[02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:57.120]   This is--this puts out the light of a 60-watt bulb, and it uses 15 watts of energy.
[02:15:57.120 --> 02:16:01.120]   In fact, this 60-watt equivalent for 15 watts is too big.
[02:16:01.120 --> 02:16:03.120]   You don't even want to use this in an emergency.
[02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:05.120]   It's too much energy.
[02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:08.120]   Okay, this is brighter than a Coleman lantern, most Coleman lanterns.
[02:16:08.120 --> 02:16:09.120]   Okay?
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:14.120]   This is enough light that I would use this to light up this entire area of this room.
[02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:21.120]   For your emergency supplies to run illumination--okay, forget--if you can do this--see that inverter?
[02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:22.120]   400 watts.
[02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:23.120]   How much do you think it costs?
[02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:24.120]   $28.
[02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:26.120]   $28 at Sam's Club.
[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:27.120]   Okay?
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:31.120]   This could be $50 some other places, but I got this for $28 at Sam's Club.
[02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:35.120]   The thing is, I can get 50-watt inverters for $28.
[02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:38.120]   I can get 400-watt inverters for $28.
[02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:40.120]   Each one has their advantage.
[02:16:40.120 --> 02:16:43.120]   This is an awful lot of light for very little energy.
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:46.120]   This is using 3 watts.
[02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:48.120]   You have any idea how much 3 watts is?
[02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:52.120]   It's a very small amount of energy.
[02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:57.120]   If I put an inverter on my car at night and it's a disaster, and I want some light in the house,
[02:16:57.120 --> 02:17:03.120]   I can run, you know, five, six of these things and not ever have to worry about starting the car.
[02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:04.120]   I can run all night.
[02:17:04.120 --> 02:17:07.120]   I can have usable muscle illumination.
[02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:12.120]   If I have this, I have this right here.
[02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:18.120]   Do you have any doubt in your mind that you can do what we just did here with the tortilla maker and everything else?
[02:17:18.120 --> 02:17:20.120]   This is more than enough light, especially with your eyes.
[02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:22.120]   Your eyes will dark adapt.
[02:17:22.120 --> 02:17:24.120]   You go through different levels of night vision.
[02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:25.120]   Here, hold this.
[02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:27.120]   You go through different levels of night vision.
[02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:32.120]   I'll chop it down.
[02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:37.120]   Your eyes get sensitive to light as you're deprived of light and your vision becomes better.
[02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:40.120]   So this little 3 watts, you go, well, it doesn't light up nothing.
[02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:41.120]   Wait five minutes.
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:43.120]   You can see everything in the room very easily.
[02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:50.120]   OK, so if you're going to go get an inverter, the thing is, what does this inverter do?
[02:17:50.120 --> 02:17:57.120]   What can you now power with this inverter now that you've got everything like what?
[02:17:57.120 --> 02:17:59.120]   Your cell phone charger, right?
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:00.120]   What are you going to do when your cell phone runs out of energy?
[02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:03.120]   You don't have a 12-volt thing for your car.
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:04.120]   You can run your cell phone.
[02:18:04.120 --> 02:18:06.120]   You now have communications.
[02:18:06.120 --> 02:18:09.120]   You've got a radio that runs off of 110 volts.
[02:18:09.120 --> 02:18:11.120]   You want to save the batteries.
[02:18:11.120 --> 02:18:13.120]   If you've got an inverter, you can run it off of your car.
[02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:17.120]   Just put this thing in your car, run the extension cord in the house, run your small radios, your small--
[02:18:17.120 --> 02:18:18.120]   Scanner.
[02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:21.120]   Your scanner will run off of this.
[02:18:21.120 --> 02:18:23.120]   Your TV.
[02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:24.120]   This is a 400-watt inverter.
[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:29.120]   How much power does a big TV, like a 20-inch or 25-inch TV, draw generally?
[02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:33.120]   110, 120, sometimes 200 watts, okay?
[02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:35.120]   Look, a car battery has a certain amount of energy in it.
[02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:42.120]   I won't go into all the ratings and numbers, but if you're running 15 watts off your car battery, you can run it 8, 10 hours, okay,
[02:18:42.120 --> 02:18:45.120]   and then go idle your car for a half hour in the morning, okay?
[02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:48.120]   Just bring the--just idle your car for a half hour.
[02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:50.120]   You spent $30,000 for the thing.
[02:18:50.120 --> 02:18:51.120]   It'll sit there and idle forever.
[02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:56.120]   Why don't you use that as your generator to power things in your house that you need?
[02:18:56.120 --> 02:18:57.120]   You don't need a refrigerator or freezer.
[02:18:57.120 --> 02:18:59.120]   You don't need a big generator.
[02:18:59.120 --> 02:19:01.120]   If you want to power a refrigerator or freezer, you need a big generator.
[02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:04.120]   If you're not going to use your refrigerator or freezer, you can use a small energy source.
[02:19:04.120 --> 02:19:13.120]   Why don't you use your car and $1.50-gallon gasoline to run the things that became useless, your cell phone, your scanner, your radio, your television?
[02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:19.120]   In a disaster, you're going to be craving information, and without energy, you're not going to have information and communications.
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:21.120]   Question, young lady.
[02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:34.120]   I don't get it.
[02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:35.120]   That light's on for safety.
[02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:40.120]   That can't go off.
[02:19:40.120 --> 02:19:50.120]   Okay, well, let's plug in--I got a--compact fluorescent bulb.
[02:19:50.120 --> 02:20:03.120]   It's a compact fluorescent.
[02:20:03.120 --> 02:20:05.120]   I got a little extension cord here.
[02:20:05.120 --> 02:20:07.120]   Again, here's a nice extension cord.
[02:20:07.120 --> 02:20:09.120]   It's a bucket big lights.
[02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:11.120]   I love big lights.
[02:20:11.120 --> 02:20:13.120]   Look, this is more light than you need.
[02:20:13.120 --> 02:20:16.120]   This is a 15-watt giving you an equivalent of 60 watts.
[02:20:16.120 --> 02:20:20.120]   And it gets brighter as it warms up.
[02:20:20.120 --> 02:20:22.120]   We've got a few other light sources.
[02:20:22.120 --> 02:20:23.120]   Are you having trouble seeing us?
[02:20:23.120 --> 02:20:25.120]   This is more than you need.
[02:20:25.120 --> 02:20:29.120]   You'd use this for part of an evening in a big room.
[02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:33.120]   You want to have smaller lights and be a little more conservative, you'd use this.
[02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:36.120]   These bulbs right here, the only place you're going to get them, unfortunately, is Costco,
[02:20:36.120 --> 02:20:39.120]   and they're in clearance right now, five of them for $4 apiece.
[02:20:39.120 --> 02:20:41.120]   They're chandelier compact fluorescents.
[02:20:41.120 --> 02:20:46.120]   If you're going out and buying some compact fluorescents for emergency lighting, try to stick with the five,
[02:20:46.120 --> 02:20:48.120]   the seven, and the nine-watt bulbs.
[02:20:48.120 --> 02:20:52.120]   If all you can get is a 15-watters, okay, fine.
[02:20:52.120 --> 02:20:53.120]   It's better than nothing.
[02:20:53.120 --> 02:20:57.120]   But I prefer you to use nine watts or less because you just don't need that amount.
[02:20:57.120 --> 02:20:59.120]   You don't need this amount of light.
[02:20:59.120 --> 02:21:03.120]   And it just makes life easier for you when you're drawing energy off your car.
[02:21:03.120 --> 02:21:05.120]   Again, this is a whole class in itself.
[02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:10.120]   I can show you things in a couple of hours, and you're going to be--if you like energy
[02:21:10.120 --> 02:21:12.120]   and like electricity, you're going to love it.
[02:21:12.120 --> 02:21:13.120]   You'll eat it up.
[02:21:13.120 --> 02:21:18.120]   The reason I think CERT members should have some of these $30 devices in their car is because there's a situation
[02:21:18.120 --> 02:21:22.120]   where the power goes out in a certain couple blocks, and a lady had to be taken to the hospital
[02:21:22.120 --> 02:21:24.120]   because her feeding machine was without power.
[02:21:24.120 --> 02:21:26.120]   You guys remember the story?
[02:21:26.120 --> 02:21:27.120]   Okay.
[02:21:27.120 --> 02:21:33.120]   If one CERT member had one of these things, or the ones who like the stuff, who can handle it,
[02:21:33.120 --> 02:21:35.120]   who have the mentality for it, we're all different.
[02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:36.120]   That's what makes CERT strong.
[02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:41.120]   We have a division of talent and division of labor.
[02:21:41.120 --> 02:21:46.120]   One CERT person can keep someone with emphysema, their oxygen machine, going,
[02:21:46.120 --> 02:21:49.120]   and it can be a difference between them dying and them staying alive.
[02:21:49.120 --> 02:21:52.120]   So you could hook that inverter up to your car battery and run a machine with it.
[02:21:52.120 --> 02:21:53.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:21:53.120 --> 02:21:56.120]   You can run an extension cord in your house, and you can power--
[02:21:56.120 --> 02:21:58.120]   Like if you were responding to an incident.
[02:21:58.120 --> 02:21:59.120]   That's right.
[02:21:59.120 --> 02:22:02.120]   So you pull the car up there, hook it up to your--
[02:22:02.120 --> 02:22:04.120]   Run an extension cord, $6 for 100 feet.
[02:22:04.120 --> 02:22:06.120]   Well, they might have it at the house.
[02:22:06.120 --> 02:22:09.120]   Well, for $6, have your own 100 feet of extension cord with you.
[02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:11.120]   What I'm saying is you hook that up to your car battery--
[02:22:11.120 --> 02:22:12.120]   That's right.
[02:22:12.120 --> 02:22:14.120]   --and you leave the car running.
[02:22:14.120 --> 02:22:17.120]   If it's the high-power drain, like a television or something more than 100 watts--
[02:22:17.120 --> 02:22:19.120]   Don't tell them about something that you use for life.
[02:22:19.120 --> 02:22:21.120]   I'm not talking about a power TV machine.
[02:22:21.120 --> 02:22:24.120]   Well, when I'm talking about higher-power drain, you keep the car idling.
[02:22:24.120 --> 02:22:28.120]   If it's only a dozen watts, you can use the battery overnight.
[02:22:28.120 --> 02:22:31.120]   If you're going to power something larger, you've got to keep the car idling.
[02:22:31.120 --> 02:22:35.120]   You've got to keep the car idling because it's your energy source.
[02:22:35.120 --> 02:22:36.120]   Question?
[02:22:36.120 --> 02:22:41.120]   I was just going to say, the power inverter that I have plugs right into the power--
[02:22:41.120 --> 02:22:42.120]   That's right.
[02:22:42.120 --> 02:22:43.120]   Now, the cigarette--
[02:22:43.120 --> 02:22:46.120]   She asked about the power inverter plugging in the cigarette lighter.
[02:22:46.120 --> 02:22:50.120]   You can only go up to 150 watts through the cigarette lighter.
[02:22:50.120 --> 02:22:53.120]   If you want to go more than 150 watts, you've got to clamp it onto the batteries.
[02:22:53.120 --> 02:22:58.120]   The cigarette lighter can't transfer enough energy to the inverter to do more than 150 watts.
[02:22:58.120 --> 02:23:02.120]   I've got some other smaller ones here.
[02:23:02.120 --> 02:23:11.120]   See, the 400-watt one, you'd use the 400-watt one for running your 25-inch television or bigger.
[02:23:11.120 --> 02:23:13.120]   That's all some people got.
[02:23:13.120 --> 02:23:16.120]   But if you want to power it for an hour or two in the evening, that's good.
[02:23:16.120 --> 02:23:18.120]   This is a 50-watt inverter.
[02:23:18.120 --> 02:23:22.120]   You'd use this for charging your cell phone and running the small lights.
[02:23:22.120 --> 02:23:26.120]   Why would you use the 50-watt inverter instead of the 400-watt inverter for smaller items?
[02:23:26.120 --> 02:23:29.120]   Hey, this was $12 on sale.
[02:23:29.120 --> 02:23:31.120]   You can commonly find them for $20 or $25.
[02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:35.120]   Why would I use this little one if I had a 400?
[02:23:35.120 --> 02:23:37.120]   Less idle current.
[02:23:37.120 --> 02:23:40.120]   Okay, this one, the bigger one has a fan going and more electronics.
[02:23:40.120 --> 02:23:44.120]   This one just draws less energy if it's running a small load.
[02:23:44.120 --> 02:23:48.120]   Again, I'm not advocating you run out and buy these right now,
[02:23:48.120 --> 02:23:53.120]   but it's something for you to keep in mind, especially when you find them on sale.
[02:23:53.120 --> 02:23:58.120]   Sure, what's your question?
[02:23:58.120 --> 02:23:59.120]   Yeah, it runs off a battery, darling.
[02:23:59.120 --> 02:24:01.120]   It runs off your car or a battery.
[02:24:01.120 --> 02:24:08.120]   It takes 12 volts DC and turns it into 120 volts alternating current.
[02:24:08.120 --> 02:24:10.120]   Those lights above you run on alternating current.
[02:24:10.120 --> 02:24:12.120]   Again, your car runs on direct current.
[02:24:12.120 --> 02:24:13.120]   Question?
[02:24:13.120 --> 02:24:17.120]   Does it matter whether it's a cigarette lighter or a 12-volt power outlet?
[02:24:17.120 --> 02:24:18.120]   No, it doesn't.
[02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:22.120]   Cigarette lighter or 12-volt power outlet, just as long as you get 12 volts to it.
[02:24:22.120 --> 02:24:23.120]   That doesn't matter.
[02:24:23.120 --> 02:24:34.120]   In fact, there's -- in fact, you know, they've got little adapters like this.
[02:24:34.120 --> 02:24:35.120]   It's a cigarette lighter.
[02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:37.120]   It's a socket on one end and it has two clamps on the other end.
[02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:41.120]   You use this clamp onto your battery and it gives you a cigarette lighter outlet.
[02:24:41.120 --> 02:24:43.120]   This is a good thing to have.
[02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:49.120]   As CERT members, we all -- the number one -- one of the best tools we have is our cell phones, okay?
[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:53.120]   With a CERT member and our cell phone, we can get ahold of dispatch,
[02:24:53.120 --> 02:24:57.120]   and we can have fire, police, anyone to any location in a couple minutes.
[02:24:57.120 --> 02:25:02.120]   We're trained as first responders to observe certain things and to recognize things
[02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:04.120]   and to treat and to summon help.
[02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:09.120]   The number one thing we do is we bring help and then we treat if we have to.
[02:25:09.120 --> 02:25:11.120]   Your cell phone is your lifelink for that.
[02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:14.120]   You've got to have a 12-volt cord for your cell phone.
[02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:16.120]   You must, okay?
[02:25:16.120 --> 02:25:20.120]   Your battery will die after a certain period of time within the vehicle.
[02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:22.120]   You're not going to get the door prize, so you're leaving.
[02:25:22.120 --> 02:25:23.120]   No, I'll be back.
[02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:24.120]   Okay.
[02:25:24.120 --> 02:25:33.120]   Well, as a CERT member, responding to an incident, all right, because like mine, it lasts three days.
[02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:35.120]   Well, but not on talk.
[02:25:35.120 --> 02:25:39.120]   And what if your battery, that will not talk for three days?
[02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:40.120]   Yes, it does.
[02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:41.120]   I use it every day.
[02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:42.120]   You ask him.
[02:25:42.120 --> 02:25:43.120]   You cannot --
[02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:47.120]   I ask him on this eight hours a day, three days on one charge.
[02:25:47.120 --> 02:25:50.120]   But he's not 72 hours.
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:52.120]   And plus it might be near, who knows, okay?
[02:25:52.120 --> 02:25:55.120]   It could be you could have been out of nothing for two days, you could have been busy,
[02:25:55.120 --> 02:25:58.120]   not had a chance to recharge it, and now, right now, you're called out.
[02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:00.120]   You only have half a day worth of energy in this, okay?
[02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:02.120]   But you still need to have the 12-volt source.
[02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:03.120]   Your car is with you.
[02:26:03.120 --> 02:26:04.120]   It's a fabulous source of energy.
[02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:08.120]   The communications, the number one thing that we can do,
[02:26:08.120 --> 02:26:11.120]   we've got to make sure our cell phones are going to work no matter where we are.
[02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:17.120]   Most of the times we're near a car, so we want to make sure the car is a source of energy for us, okay?
[02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:20.120]   Just hope that you're not in a dead space, no matter how much it's charged.
[02:26:20.120 --> 02:26:21.120]   That's right.
[02:26:21.120 --> 02:26:23.120]   But, you know, we're in a big city.
[02:26:23.120 --> 02:26:25.120]   We're in the third largest city in Michigan.
[02:26:25.120 --> 02:26:29.120]   There aren't really many cell dead spaces around here.
[02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:34.120]   Okay, so --
[02:26:34.120 --> 02:26:36.120]   So what would be a take-home message for you CERT people?
[02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:42.120]   Make sure you've got all the adapters for your cell phones so it doesn't die on you.
[02:26:42.120 --> 02:26:46.120]   I'm caught in my own cables here.
[02:26:46.120 --> 02:26:47.120]   How about battery pack?
[02:26:47.120 --> 02:26:48.120]   Forget it.
[02:26:48.120 --> 02:26:50.120]   It's just 12 volts, okay?
[02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:51.120]   You're not going to find it.
[02:26:51.120 --> 02:26:52.120]   You're not going to get it.
[02:26:52.120 --> 02:26:55.120]   It's something special that I get that I send out with missionaries.
[02:26:55.120 --> 02:26:57.120]   I want you to get what you have available to you.
[02:26:57.120 --> 02:27:01.120]   If you want a battery pack, go buy a marine battery at the store for $60, okay?
[02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:04.120]   It's the best battery pack you're going to get.
[02:27:04.120 --> 02:27:06.120]   Other than that, use your car as a battery pack.
[02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:08.120]   I don't want you to look at this battery pack and say, "I want one.
[02:27:08.120 --> 02:27:09.120]   I should have one."
[02:27:09.120 --> 02:27:10.120]   You don't, okay?
[02:27:10.120 --> 02:27:15.120]   It's a specialized tool that I use, okay?
[02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:20.120]   Don't spend money on these fancy batteries and stuff like this, these sealed and carry-around.
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:23.120]   Go spend less money for more battery.
[02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:25.120]   Go get a marine battery, okay?
[02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:28.120]   The biggest marine battery you can get is about $60 at Walmart.
[02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:30.120]   Get a charger for it.
[02:27:30.120 --> 02:27:32.120]   A marine battery charger costs $30.
[02:27:32.120 --> 02:27:36.120]   That's a lot better than buying anything that you carry around with jumper cables on it.
[02:27:36.120 --> 02:27:41.120]   Go get a pair of jumper cables for $12, some big, long ones.
[02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:46.120]   If you really want a battery you carry around with jumper cables, go do this.
[02:27:46.120 --> 02:27:49.120]   You'll have a much better battery, much more energy,
[02:27:49.120 --> 02:27:54.120]   and you'll have a much better set of cables, and you'll be able to use it as a CERT member.
[02:27:54.120 --> 02:27:58.120]   We're all on CERT because we all have different talents and different things that we can do.
[02:27:58.120 --> 02:28:04.120]   If one of the talents you want to bring to CERT is the ability to have stored energy, jump vehicles, run lights,
[02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:11.120]   run feeding machines, then that's what you should be doing is getting that size battery.
[02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:16.120]   Okay, it's a very detailed subject that I just wanted to cover briefly.
[02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:20.120]   If you want to get technical, you've got this running in your car, you put a voltmeter on it,
[02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:27.120]   I mean like a real voltmeter, get down to 11.5 volts, restart your car, and bring it up above 12 volts, okay?
[02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:30.120]   It's the least something I can tell you as an indication.
[02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:35.120]   The inverter will start squealing around 10.5 volts saying I'm low on voltage.
[02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:38.120]   When you hear it squealing, get out and start your car pretty quickly
[02:28:38.120 --> 02:28:42.120]   or you won't be able to start your car and recharge it.
[02:28:42.120 --> 02:28:48.120]   Okay, we're getting near the end of the presentation.
[02:28:48.120 --> 02:28:50.120]   I'll be doing the Q&A.
[02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:53.120]   Now what did I tell you about AA batteries and such?
[02:28:53.120 --> 02:28:55.120]   Don't trust them.
[02:28:55.120 --> 02:29:03.120]   For what application did I tell you not to trust AA batteries and little cutesy little things?
[02:29:03.120 --> 02:29:06.120]   I told you not to trust them in what situation?
[02:29:06.120 --> 02:29:12.120]   Life and death, you've got to run out, and your emergency kit has got to work, okay?
[02:29:12.120 --> 02:29:16.120]   What I have here, I've got a cutesy little light, right?
[02:29:16.120 --> 02:29:21.120]   Don't you ever have this thing in your cert kit or your emergency kit, okay?
[02:29:21.120 --> 02:29:26.120]   This is a dual LED and a fluorescent light, okay?
[02:29:26.120 --> 02:29:29.120]   I've got another little cutesy little light right here.
[02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:30.120]   See this one?
[02:29:30.120 --> 02:29:31.120]   It comes on.
[02:29:31.120 --> 02:29:32.120]   It's an LED.
[02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:34.120]   It goes a long time clamping on things.
[02:29:34.120 --> 02:29:38.120]   What's this good for?
[02:29:38.120 --> 02:29:42.120]   It's damn good for book reading.
[02:29:42.120 --> 02:29:48.120]   If I had this thing, do you think I'd trip over anything in my house if I was walking around with this?
[02:29:48.120 --> 02:29:52.120]   Do you think I could find my way around my house easily with this in the dark?
[02:29:52.120 --> 02:29:55.120]   Very easily, okay?
[02:29:55.120 --> 02:29:57.120]   A lot of stuff, okay?
[02:29:57.120 --> 02:30:01.120]   This is more useful to you in many cases than your mag light flashlight.
[02:30:01.120 --> 02:30:05.120]   You use a bright light for finding a lost child.
[02:30:05.120 --> 02:30:09.120]   For anything else you do, you want to use the minimal amount of light you can.
[02:30:09.120 --> 02:30:11.120]   This is called the necessary amount of light.
[02:30:11.120 --> 02:30:15.120]   This is all the amount of light that I need to do the task at hand.
[02:30:15.120 --> 02:30:17.120]   You can find anything in your entire house with this.
[02:30:17.120 --> 02:30:19.120]   You can make almost any meal with this.
[02:30:19.120 --> 02:30:21.120]   You can read any book with this.
[02:30:21.120 --> 02:30:25.120]   You can't go find a lost child with this.
[02:30:25.120 --> 02:30:28.120]   You can't even go find your lost dog with it.
[02:30:28.120 --> 02:30:29.120]   Your dog's black anyway.
[02:30:29.120 --> 02:30:31.120]   It's hard to see.
[02:30:31.120 --> 02:30:35.120]   If you've got to go find something that's lost or it's an emergency, you've got to see everything.
[02:30:35.120 --> 02:30:36.120]   You use a lot of light.
[02:30:36.120 --> 02:30:37.120]   You use a bright light.
[02:30:37.120 --> 02:30:38.120]   You use a mag light.
[02:30:38.120 --> 02:30:40.120]   Anything else, you use this little bit of light.
[02:30:40.120 --> 02:30:44.120]   You don't take this little light out with you in your kit, okay?
[02:30:44.120 --> 02:30:50.120]   You can't depend upon it because the energy source is itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny, and it's rechargeable.
[02:30:50.120 --> 02:30:54.120]   See these little AAA rechargeables in here, they're nickel metal hydride.
[02:30:54.120 --> 02:30:57.120]   They'll die real quickly.
[02:30:57.120 --> 02:30:59.120]   But what did I just talk to you about?
[02:30:59.120 --> 02:31:03.120]   I talked to you about using your vehicle as a base of energy, didn't I?
[02:31:03.120 --> 02:31:12.120]   And using gasoline in your car as a cheap generator for making things that were useless useful again, right?
[02:31:12.120 --> 02:31:19.120]   The things we depend upon, which are communications and information, those all become useful again when you have such a small amount of energy.
[02:31:19.120 --> 02:31:25.120]   Even this will bring you out of 1800s technology back into the 21st century.
[02:31:25.120 --> 02:31:32.120]   This will give you the amount of energy you need, this little 50-watt inverter, to run your cell phone, run your scanner, run your radio, run a small TV, right?
[02:31:32.120 --> 02:31:35.120]   That's a lot better than having nothing.
[02:31:35.120 --> 02:31:40.120]   So if you've got your vehicle there as a source of energy, this is just a little trick, okay?
[02:31:40.120 --> 02:31:45.120]   It's something I've developed and played around with a lot.
[02:31:45.120 --> 02:31:48.120]   This is a nickel metal hydride rechargeable, recharger.
[02:31:48.120 --> 02:31:51.120]   It happens to be the rail back that recharges in one hour.
[02:31:51.120 --> 02:31:54.120]   This is what I send with missionaries around the world.
[02:31:54.120 --> 02:31:55.120]   Why do I do this?
[02:31:55.120 --> 02:32:00.120]   Because since it's a one-hour charger, you can go up to a vehicle in the middle of nowhere.
[02:32:00.120 --> 02:32:09.120]   If they happen to have a vehicle and one comes by, they can go clamp on a pair of cables to the battery and recharge a set of batteries in one hour.
[02:32:09.120 --> 02:32:18.120]   And those batteries will run that light, that little light that does everything but search for a lost child, it will run that light for over 100 hours.
[02:32:18.120 --> 02:32:26.120]   So in one hour, for $30 and $10, they can run a $10 light for 100 hours.
[02:32:26.120 --> 02:32:37.120]   Now, if you're in the middle of nowhere helping people and some of the medical people I help in Haiti and Ghana and travel the world, okay, helping people medically,
[02:32:37.120 --> 02:32:41.120]   don't you think 100 hours worth of light is a godsend?
[02:32:41.120 --> 02:32:43.120]   I mean, when it gets dark there, it's dark.
[02:32:43.120 --> 02:32:45.120]   There are no lights.
[02:32:45.120 --> 02:32:46.120]   People are poor.
[02:32:46.120 --> 02:32:49.120]   They have nothing.
[02:32:49.120 --> 02:32:58.120]   So with these little tools, these little tricks, these little principles of harvesting energy off of a larger source, a car, in one or two hours,
[02:32:58.120 --> 02:33:07.120]   and using this stored energy in the form of nickel metal hydride battery and a low-power drain light to give you enough light to do everything but search for a lost child,
[02:33:07.120 --> 02:33:10.120]   this is a principle I want you to understand.
[02:33:10.120 --> 02:33:15.120]   It's what you need to have if you're going to do more than a month's worth of food storage.
[02:33:15.120 --> 02:33:18.120]   It's going to be difficult for you to store a year's worth of Duracell batteries.
[02:33:18.120 --> 02:33:24.120]   You keep your batteries for searching for lost children, and since you're going to be in your house and nothing really threatening, okay,
[02:33:24.120 --> 02:33:30.120]   you're not searching for something, then you can use these tiddly little lights.
[02:33:30.120 --> 02:33:33.120]   Got it?
[02:33:33.120 --> 02:33:34.120]   Careful.
[02:33:34.120 --> 02:33:36.120]   Some chargers out there take 16 hours.
[02:33:36.120 --> 02:33:41.120]   If you've got an inverter in your car all the time and sitting in your driveway running a few lights in your house,
[02:33:41.120 --> 02:33:46.120]   keeping things illuminated, you can recharge over 16 hours, but I prefer the quicker ones.
[02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:49.120]   Any questions on this?
[02:33:49.120 --> 02:33:51.120]   You understand the little principle I'm trying to get to?
[02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:52.120]   It's not for everyone, okay?
[02:33:52.120 --> 02:33:55.120]   I'm an electronic guru.
[02:33:55.120 --> 02:33:58.120]   But for those of you who can use this, I at least want to communicate this to you.
[02:33:58.120 --> 02:34:06.120]   It is a good principle that can help you over a long period of storage.
[02:34:06.120 --> 02:34:09.120]   This is a nine-watt light for us.
[02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:13.120]   I forgot to show you.
[02:34:13.120 --> 02:34:16.120]   Nine watts giving you about 50 watts of equivalent illumination.
[02:34:16.120 --> 02:34:20.120]   This is what I prefer for you to have over this.
[02:34:20.120 --> 02:34:23.120]   See these little lights, the three watt, the nine watt I'm holding?
[02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:29.120]   Why are these better than this spiral one, even if this was lower wattage?
[02:34:29.120 --> 02:34:35.120]   What's good about these?
[02:34:35.120 --> 02:34:36.120]   Yeah, this is sensitive.
[02:34:36.120 --> 02:34:38.120]   This breaks easy.
[02:34:38.120 --> 02:34:40.120]   These have a plastic shell around them.
[02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:42.120]   See the curly?
[02:34:42.120 --> 02:34:43.120]   The curly cue is in there.
[02:34:43.120 --> 02:34:48.120]   There's a plastic shell around it, so when it travels in your luggage and you're traveling the world
[02:34:48.120 --> 02:34:55.120]   or you have children or over-anxious dogs, okay, it's got a high degree of resistance to it.
[02:34:55.120 --> 02:35:00.120]   Now, I actually just broke my shell probably bringing it here, but it's a lot better than this.
[02:35:00.120 --> 02:35:01.120]   It does stand.
[02:35:01.120 --> 02:35:10.120]   It's not super durable, but it does stand up to a lot more breakage than a regular fluorescent or even a regular bulb will.
[02:35:10.120 --> 02:35:11.120]   I'm losing my breath.
[02:35:11.120 --> 02:35:13.120]   Okay.
[02:35:13.120 --> 02:35:17.120]   One of the most important things for all of us to have.
[02:35:17.120 --> 02:35:21.120]   There's an old Chinese curse of may you live in interesting times.
[02:35:21.120 --> 02:35:23.120]   We are going to live in interesting times.
[02:35:23.120 --> 02:35:25.120]   We've had three emerging infections in two years.
[02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:32.120]   We've had $100 billion worth of economic and physical damage done to the continental United States by terrorists on 9/11.
[02:35:32.120 --> 02:35:34.120]   We've lost several thousand people.
[02:35:34.120 --> 02:35:39.120]   We have gone and invaded and conquered Afghanistan and Iraq and who knows what else,
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:43.120]   and there's people out there who totally, truly hate us.
[02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:46.120]   There are diseases out there that you have no concept of.
[02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:55.120]   There are diseases out there in vials, weaponized in hundreds of tons that can make the continental United States no longer the United States of America you and I know.
[02:35:55.120 --> 02:35:59.120]   So we are going to live in challenging times.
[02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:08.120]   The most important thing for us all to have is faith, not just faith in God, but faith in ourselves, faith in our friends,
[02:36:08.120 --> 02:36:18.120]   faith in our friends and neighbors, faith that when the worst happens it will bring out the best in all the people and in us,
[02:36:18.120 --> 02:36:24.120]   that your neighbors will become even closer to you and some of the best friends you've ever known.
[02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:25.120]   That's what happens in a crisis.
[02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:27.120]   That's what happens in a disaster.
[02:36:27.120 --> 02:36:29.120]   People come together.
[02:36:29.120 --> 02:36:32.120]   There are some bad elements out there that will challenge you,
[02:36:32.120 --> 02:36:39.120]   and they will have to be dealt with appropriately by the people who know how to do that or step up and take the responsibility to do so.
[02:36:39.120 --> 02:36:40.120]   So there are some riots.
[02:36:40.120 --> 02:36:44.120]   There are some people who take advantage of the bad situation and try to hurt you.
[02:36:44.120 --> 02:36:51.120]   But overall, 99.9% of the people, this is going to bring out the best in us and the best in them.
[02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:55.120]   We have to have faith in ourselves, have faith in our friends and our neighbors,
[02:36:55.120 --> 02:37:01.120]   and that we're all going to make it through whatever difficulties we're going to have.
[02:37:01.120 --> 02:37:03.120]   Okay, with that, that's it.
[02:37:03.120 --> 02:37:04.120]   Thank you very much.
[02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:07.120]   I'm going to go into questions and answers.
[02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:12.120]   [Applause]
[02:37:12.120 --> 02:37:15.120]   Here's what I did in cover for you.
[02:37:15.120 --> 02:37:18.120]   If you remember anything, please remember the faith message.
[02:37:18.120 --> 02:37:20.120]   So many people buy things and they hoard them.
[02:37:20.120 --> 02:37:21.120]   They don't tell anyone.
[02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:26.120]   I want you to show and tell people that you're doing this, that you think it's right, and you want to help them.
[02:37:26.120 --> 02:37:27.120]   Have faith.
[02:37:27.120 --> 02:37:30.120]   If you take anything away from this, have faith in your friends and your neighbors.
[02:37:30.120 --> 02:37:32.120]   That's what will get us through this.
[02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:36.120]   That's why I want you to come to my house when there's a disaster, because I want your talents.
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:37.120]   Are you a nurse?
[02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:38.120]   Are you a carpenter?
[02:37:38.120 --> 02:37:40.120]   Are you good with children?
[02:37:40.120 --> 02:37:42.120]   Do you have any other talents?
[02:37:42.120 --> 02:37:43.120]   Are you just a strong back?
[02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:45.120]   Are you just a hard worker?
[02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:50.120]   We're all stronger, the more of us that are together than we are independently.
[02:37:50.120 --> 02:37:56.120]   I have whole sections I could cover on medicines, stuff you didn't know, like Benadryl.
[02:37:56.120 --> 02:37:57.120]   What does Benadryl do?
[02:37:57.120 --> 02:38:00.120]   Benadryl is an anti-allergy medicine.
[02:38:00.120 --> 02:38:03.120]   It's an anti-shock medicine, an anti-irritant, an anti-itch.
[02:38:03.120 --> 02:38:04.120]   You can use it for sleep.
[02:38:04.120 --> 02:38:06.120]   It's a mild anti-nausea agent.
[02:38:06.120 --> 02:38:08.120]   It stops nasal drip from colds.
[02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:11.120]   It's a mild anti-cough and a mild anti-anxiety drug.
[02:38:11.120 --> 02:38:14.120]   I've got a whole section on meds I can go through.
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:18.120]   In fact, Dr. Cutt and I are doing a whole special thing on this medicine.
[02:38:18.120 --> 02:38:20.120]   I've got a whole section on SARS.
[02:38:20.120 --> 02:38:24.120]   You can go and listen to about SARS on my website, stevenharriff.net.
[02:38:24.120 --> 02:38:30.120]   I will tell you on there how SARS, monkeypox, anything else gets to you.
[02:38:30.120 --> 02:38:31.120]   It only gets to you.
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:34.120]   What are the routes of infection into the body?
[02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:44.120]   Eyes, nose, mouth, open cuts, and one or two other mucous membranes you might have on your body.
[02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:49.120]   Those are the only routes for infection into the body principally, okay?
[02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:54.120]   If you can wear a mask, cover up things that are cut, and wear goggles.
[02:38:54.120 --> 02:38:58.120]   All these people running around China, you see them wearing masks and gloves and gowns in hospitals.
[02:38:58.120 --> 02:38:59.120]   What's missing?
[02:38:59.120 --> 02:39:01.120]   They're not wearing goggles.
[02:39:01.120 --> 02:39:04.120]   The eyes are a primary route for infection to the body.
[02:39:04.120 --> 02:39:08.120]   I touch something here, cold, flu, I go like this, I'm infected, okay?
[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:11.120]   I talk about that in detail in the audio on the site.
[02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:13.120]   You can download it and listen to it.
[02:39:13.120 --> 02:39:15.120]   You'll stream it to you live.
[02:39:15.120 --> 02:39:17.120]   It's a good class.
[02:39:17.120 --> 02:39:19.120]   There's a whole thing I can do on weapons of mass destruction.
[02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:22.120]   Some of it is covered in the SARS.
[02:39:22.120 --> 02:39:27.120]   The SARS audio talks about protecting the family from weapons of mass destruction, chemical and biological.
[02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:33.120]   Basically, how do you survive a class 5 hurricane like Andrew barreling down on you?
[02:39:33.120 --> 02:39:35.120]   Same way you survive WMD.
[02:39:35.120 --> 02:39:38.120]   How do you survive a hurricane?
[02:39:38.120 --> 02:39:41.120]   No.
[02:39:41.120 --> 02:39:43.120]   Florida, they'll flood you out.
[02:39:43.120 --> 02:39:47.120]   The problem with hurricanes is the water comes in and floods you out.
[02:39:47.120 --> 02:39:49.120]   The tidal surge, 20 feet.
[02:39:49.120 --> 02:39:52.120]   How do you survive a hurricane with 200-mile-per-hour winds?
[02:39:52.120 --> 02:39:54.120]   Go to Miami.
[02:39:54.120 --> 02:39:56.120]   You be where it's not.
[02:39:56.120 --> 02:39:58.120]   Same thing with WMD.
[02:39:58.120 --> 02:39:59.120]   You be where it's not.
[02:39:59.120 --> 02:40:00.120]   That could be in a safe room in a house.
[02:40:00.120 --> 02:40:02.120]   That could be someplace else.
[02:40:02.120 --> 02:40:04.120]   You be where the disease is not.
[02:40:04.120 --> 02:40:09.120]   Being where it's not also means don't let it get to your eyes, nose, mouth, okay?
[02:40:09.120 --> 02:40:11.120]   That's being where it's not.
[02:40:11.120 --> 02:40:13.120]   Forget it. Forget it. You're dead.
[02:40:13.120 --> 02:40:15.120]   Almost for most of the stuff.
[02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:17.120]   I got a whole section on cold weather.
[02:40:17.120 --> 02:40:19.120]   I got a whole section on food I can do.
[02:40:19.120 --> 02:40:22.120]   Some of you had some specific questions in different of these areas.
[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:28.120]   What are some of the specific questions in these areas that you'd like me to answer before we dismiss and all go home?
[02:40:28.120 --> 02:40:29.120]   Safe room.
[02:40:29.120 --> 02:40:31.120]   Safe room and medication.
[02:40:31.120 --> 02:40:32.120]   Duct tape and plastic.
[02:40:32.120 --> 02:40:33.120]   Not a joke.
[02:40:33.120 --> 02:40:35.120]   One of the best things there is, okay?
[02:40:35.120 --> 02:40:36.120]   You be where it's not.
[02:40:36.120 --> 02:40:38.120]   You have a chemical release outside.
[02:40:38.120 --> 02:40:45.120]   Basically, chemicals are going to come to you and get to you through inhalation, ingestion, or through your skin.
[02:40:45.120 --> 02:40:48.120]   What you're doing is you're making it harder for those chemicals to get to you.
[02:40:48.120 --> 02:40:50.120]   You're sealing up your room.
[02:40:50.120 --> 02:40:57.120]   The way you seal a room is you seal the windows and the air conditioners and the vents.
[02:40:57.120 --> 02:40:58.120]   What else do you seal in a room?
[02:40:58.120 --> 02:41:00.120]   What's the other primary entrance?
[02:41:00.120 --> 02:41:01.120]   Not just the door.
[02:41:01.120 --> 02:41:02.120]   Baseboards.
[02:41:02.120 --> 02:41:04.120]   Baseboards.
[02:41:04.120 --> 02:41:05.120]   You get two cards from that.
[02:41:05.120 --> 02:41:07.120]   I told you that.
[02:41:07.120 --> 02:41:08.120]   Baseboards.
[02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:11.120]   Where the carpet meets, okay?
[02:41:11.120 --> 02:41:13.120]   You tape that up.
[02:41:13.120 --> 02:41:15.120]   What you're doing is not going to be 100% effective.
[02:41:15.120 --> 02:41:18.120]   You're just reducing the amount of contaminant that could possibly get to you.
[02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:23.120]   It might have to snake its way down the chimney, come through a hallway, and get to you.
[02:41:23.120 --> 02:41:28.120]   But by the time it does that, it's going to be even more diluted, okay, for a biological or a chemical agent.
[02:41:28.120 --> 02:41:30.120]   That's what you do for safe rooms.
[02:41:30.120 --> 02:41:33.120]   What about the -- because I read it's a woman in Israel.
[02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:35.120]   She suffocated you from safe rooms.
[02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:36.120]   That's stupid.
[02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:38.120]   That's more provocative than even most of the people that the media did.
[02:41:38.120 --> 02:41:40.120]   You know how the woman suffocated in her room?
[02:41:40.120 --> 02:41:42.120]   In a stove or something that she had done.
[02:41:42.120 --> 02:41:43.120]   No kidding.
[02:41:43.120 --> 02:41:44.120]   She lit charcoal.
[02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:46.120]   She carbon monoxide-ed herself to death.
[02:41:46.120 --> 02:41:49.120]   Go close a room and light charcoal.
[02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:51.120]   You'd be dead, okay?
[02:41:51.120 --> 02:41:53.120]   So don't light charcoal.
[02:41:53.120 --> 02:41:54.120]   [Audience member speaking indistinctly]
[02:41:54.120 --> 02:41:55.120]   Huh?
[02:41:55.120 --> 02:41:58.120]   Was that what happened with two cops?
[02:41:58.120 --> 02:41:59.120]   Yeah.
[02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:04.120]   Well, they could have either CO'd themselves to death or CO2.
[02:42:04.120 --> 02:42:08.120]   You can asphyxiate from -- you can poison yourself from carbon monoxide,
[02:42:08.120 --> 02:42:13.120]   or you can poison yourself from carbon dioxide, which is a byproduct of any hydrocarbon combustion.
[02:42:13.120 --> 02:42:17.120]   Yeah, so, yeah, that could have happened to them that way.
[02:42:17.120 --> 02:42:20.120]   But with three people in the room, not a full force of --
[02:42:20.120 --> 02:42:24.120]   Oh, believe me, start shooting stuff, and you'll be opening the door on your own, okay?
[02:42:24.120 --> 02:42:26.120]   How many days was that?
[02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:37.120]   Average person needs five gallons of air per minute, a cubic foot, 7.4 gallons.
[02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:39.120]   You need a little bit less than a cubic feet.
[02:42:39.120 --> 02:42:42.120]   We use three cubic feet per minute as standards in nuclear shelters.
[02:42:42.120 --> 02:42:46.120]   That's the minimum air flow we need because we remove body moisture and everything else.
[02:42:46.120 --> 02:42:59.120]   From an oxygen point of view, you need five gallons a minute.
[02:42:59.120 --> 02:43:00.120]   The trouble is you build up CO2.
[02:43:00.120 --> 02:43:03.120]   If I lock you in a bank vault, you don't die of oxygen deprivation.
[02:43:03.120 --> 02:43:06.120]   You die of carbon dioxide poisoning.
[02:43:06.120 --> 02:43:11.120]   You'll just actually -- you'll die of CO2 poisoning from your own breath before you die of oxygen deprivation.
[02:43:11.120 --> 02:43:12.120]   Houston, we have a problem.
[02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:13.120]   Houston, we have a problem.
[02:43:13.120 --> 02:43:14.120]   That's right.
[02:43:14.120 --> 02:43:16.120]   That's where they've been in Apollo 13.
[02:43:16.120 --> 02:43:21.120]   They had to get the zeolite filters going because zeolite is an absorbent for carbon dioxide.
[02:43:21.120 --> 02:43:26.120]   They would have died of their own CO2 before they died of oxygen deprivation.
[02:43:26.120 --> 02:43:28.120]   So what they did was remove CO2 from the air,
[02:43:28.120 --> 02:43:31.120]   make sure that the oxygen is going to be the limiting factor in killing them.
[02:43:31.120 --> 02:43:35.120]   Medications.
[02:43:35.120 --> 02:43:37.120]   Ladies asking about medications and storing them.
[02:43:37.120 --> 02:43:39.120]   You're going to have to buy them.
[02:43:39.120 --> 02:43:42.120]   You're going to have to get a doctor to overwrite a prescription for you.
[02:43:42.120 --> 02:43:43.120]   You're going to have to go buy them.
[02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:47.120]   It's like if you take two a day, you're going to have to have them change your prescription to four a day
[02:43:47.120 --> 02:43:49.120]   and go buy them and put them away.
[02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:52.120]   The best place to store medications is the freezer.
[02:43:52.120 --> 02:43:56.120]   You freeze them, most medications, and it will extend the shelf life dramatically.
[02:43:56.120 --> 02:43:59.120]   Most medicines are good well beyond the shelf date.
[02:43:59.120 --> 02:44:00.120]   There are exceptions.
[02:44:00.120 --> 02:44:05.120]   The doxycycline, tetracycline family of antibiotics become toxic to the kidney or liver
[02:44:05.120 --> 02:44:08.120]   after a certain period past their expiration date.
[02:44:08.120 --> 02:44:12.120]   There is an easily documented World Health Organization test to test for this
[02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:16.120]   to see if it has gone toxic or not, which you can do in your house.
[02:44:16.120 --> 02:44:19.120]   It's really pretty simple.
[02:44:19.120 --> 02:44:22.120]   Penicillin and other antibiotics just lose potency over time,
[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:24.120]   and you slow that degradation by freezing them.
[02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:27.120]   So you're going to have to get more medicine.
[02:44:27.120 --> 02:44:28.120]   You can always go buy it.
[02:44:28.120 --> 02:44:30.120]   You can go to Canada and buy it.
[02:44:30.120 --> 02:44:32.120]   You can buy some of it off the Internet.
[02:44:32.120 --> 02:44:33.120]   You can have the doctor write your prescription.
[02:44:33.120 --> 02:44:36.120]   You can go to the pharmacy and pay that long dollar for it.
[02:44:36.120 --> 02:44:40.120]   Costco has cheaper medication prices.
[02:44:40.120 --> 02:44:43.120]   If your life is dependent upon a medication, you must have it,
[02:44:43.120 --> 02:44:45.120]   like high blood pressure medication.
[02:44:45.120 --> 02:44:48.120]   Stop taking your high blood pressure medication, or alternative to it,
[02:44:48.120 --> 02:44:50.120]   pretty much you're going to die.
[02:44:50.120 --> 02:44:52.120]   So you've got to get your medication.
[02:44:52.120 --> 02:44:54.120]   You've got to talk to your doctor about it.
[02:44:54.120 --> 02:44:56.120]   If your doctor does not want to address the issues,
[02:44:56.120 --> 02:44:58.120]   the doctor says you're stupid, you're crazy, it's not going to happen,
[02:44:58.120 --> 02:45:02.120]   kick him in the ass and leave and go find one that will take care of your health.
[02:45:02.120 --> 02:45:06.120]   You being concerned about your health or anyone else over one, two, three months
[02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:08.120]   in disaster is a medical issue.
[02:45:08.120 --> 02:45:11.120]   Your doctor damn well better address that medical issue with the same level of
[02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:14.120]   professionalism as if you come in with a broken arm.
[02:45:14.120 --> 02:45:19.120]   If you don't, you're dealing with a doctor who's not doing what he swore to do.
[02:45:19.120 --> 02:45:21.120]   Okay?
[02:45:21.120 --> 02:45:23.120]   But you've got to take care of it.
[02:45:23.120 --> 02:45:27.120]   It's very important.
[02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:29.120]   Any other questions?
[02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:35.120]   WMD, SARS, anything like that?
[02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:38.120]   Cold weather, food.
[02:45:38.120 --> 02:45:42.120]   Would you consider doing a cold weather like for our group?
[02:45:42.120 --> 02:45:43.120]   Yeah.
[02:45:43.120 --> 02:45:47.120]   Believe me, I can wear my stuff, which I didn't even pay $50 for,
[02:45:47.120 --> 02:45:52.120]   and I can stand out there in below zero weather doing traffic and be just fine.
[02:45:52.120 --> 02:45:55.120]   You know, these police officers seem to be a rite of passage saying,
[02:45:55.120 --> 02:45:58.120]   "Well, I was outside for eight hours and there was a minus 30 wind chill,
[02:45:58.120 --> 02:46:00.120]   and we froze our butts off."
[02:46:00.120 --> 02:46:01.120]   No need to.
[02:46:01.120 --> 02:46:03.120]   It's real easy not to freeze your butts off.
[02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:05.120]   Okay, we've got a bunch of cards here.
[02:46:05.120 --> 02:46:07.120]   Door prize time.
[02:46:07.120 --> 02:46:15.120]   Everyone make sure they've got their names on the cards.
[02:46:15.120 --> 02:46:22.120]   Throw the cards in here.
[02:46:22.120 --> 02:46:37.120]   It's like church.
[02:46:37.120 --> 02:46:42.120]   I'm not telling you what the prize is yet.
[02:46:42.120 --> 02:46:59.120]   Any cards?
[02:46:59.120 --> 02:47:02.120]   Where did you get this one at, Andy?
[02:47:02.120 --> 02:47:08.120]   $30 Target or Wal-Mart.
[02:47:08.120 --> 02:47:11.120]   Yeah, I like big lots the best.
[02:47:11.120 --> 02:47:13.120]   I'm a fair and impartial person.
[02:47:13.120 --> 02:47:17.120]   Young lady, would you please reach your hand into the -- and pick out a card
[02:47:17.120 --> 02:47:21.120]   and see who is the next person who's going to vote for Tim.
[02:47:21.120 --> 02:47:27.120]   The next person is the first winner of behind door number one.
[02:47:27.120 --> 02:47:29.120]   Where's Lisa?
[02:47:29.120 --> 02:47:31.120]   You win.
[02:47:31.120 --> 02:47:37.120]   Oh, what, you win.
[02:47:37.120 --> 02:47:43.120]   I am leaving for a tour of the west and the southwest on a one-month trip, 10,000 miles.
[02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:46.120]   You get to accompany me in my RV on the trip.
[02:47:46.120 --> 02:47:49.120]   Okay, no.
[02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:51.120]   Sure.
[02:47:51.120 --> 02:47:57.120]   You won.
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:48:01.120]   You won a week's worth of food.
[02:48:01.120 --> 02:48:07.120]   And you won one bonafide marathon emergency light with 2D cell batteries.
[02:48:07.120 --> 02:48:10.120]   This light will stay on for, guess how long?
[02:48:10.120 --> 02:48:12.120]   Four months.
[02:48:12.120 --> 02:48:15.120]   Two batteries in this thing will stay on for four months.
[02:48:15.120 --> 02:48:26.120]   So you have food for a week and light for four months.
[02:48:26.120 --> 02:48:27.120]   Congratulations.
[02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:28.120]   Thank you.
[02:48:28.120 --> 02:48:30.120]   Thank you for coming.
[02:48:30.120 --> 02:48:32.120]   Make sure my other stuff isn't in here.
[02:48:32.120 --> 02:48:34.120]   Wait a minute.
[02:48:34.120 --> 02:48:35.120]   I don't need tongs.
[02:48:35.120 --> 02:48:40.120]   You don't get the tongs, the butter knives.
[02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:45.120]   Look through there real quickly and make sure.
[02:48:45.120 --> 02:48:47.120]   Okay, you're dismissed.
[02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:50.120]   Thank you for coming very much.
[02:48:50.120 --> 02:48:52.120]   Any volunteers who want to help me?
[02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:54.120]   Oh, wait, speech, speech.
[02:48:54.120 --> 02:48:56.120]   Civilian emergency response team needs you.
[02:48:56.120 --> 02:49:01.120]   Okay, we need capable volunteers to help us in times of emergency and non-emergency.
[02:49:01.120 --> 02:49:08.120]   You will get first aid training, CPR training, automatic defibrillation training, traffic,
[02:49:08.120 --> 02:49:11.120]   weapons of mass destruction, hazardous materials,
[02:49:11.120 --> 02:49:13.120]   and work with some of the best people you've ever met.
[02:49:13.120 --> 02:49:17.120]   If you'd like to sign up, we've got the forms here.
[02:49:17.120 --> 02:49:20.120]   And I need someone to help me pack.
[02:49:20.120 --> 02:49:22.120]   Any other people with questions, feel free to come up and ask me.
[02:49:22.120 --> 02:49:29.120]   I need a volunteer to help me pack up and leave.
[02:49:29.120 --> 02:49:30.120]   Did I leave anything else in here?
[02:49:30.120 --> 02:49:37.120]   I don't think so.
[02:49:37.120 --> 02:49:40.120]   Does anybody need their certification?
[02:49:40.120 --> 02:49:42.120]   I'm leaving tomorrow or Saturday.
[02:49:42.120 --> 02:49:46.120]   So do you want the second part of your price?
[02:49:46.120 --> 02:49:48.120]   You know what?
[02:49:48.120 --> 02:49:50.120]   It was a joy listening to you tonight.
[02:49:50.120 --> 02:49:52.120]   You're always so serious and straight-faced.
[02:49:52.120 --> 02:49:57.120]   I wonder what is this going to be like for the staff here.
[02:49:57.120 --> 02:49:58.120]   Thank you.
[02:49:58.120 --> 02:50:01.120]   I'm glad I got the opportunity.
[02:50:01.120 --> 02:50:03.120]   And I'd love all of those.
[02:50:03.120 --> 02:50:07.120]   But because we have so many power outages and I have a heart disease and a pulmonary disease,
[02:50:07.120 --> 02:50:09.120]   I have a real hard time taking care of it.
[02:50:09.120 --> 02:50:10.120]   Oh, and pulmonary disease.
[02:50:10.120 --> 02:50:11.120]   Okay.
[02:50:11.120 --> 02:50:13.120]   You're going to have to address that medical issue.
[02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:14.120]   Yes.
[02:50:14.120 --> 02:50:15.120]   You're going to have to address it.
[02:50:15.120 --> 02:50:25.120]   I'm just going to tell you now, he takes around $900 to the hospital.
[02:50:25.120 --> 02:50:26.120]   Sam.
[02:50:26.120 --> 02:50:28.120]   So we can go over and see if he loves me or anything.
[02:50:28.120 --> 02:50:29.120]   No, Sam, that's it.
[02:50:29.120 --> 02:50:32.120]   That's all.
[02:50:32.120 --> 02:50:35.120]   I expect a report on what -- oh, never mind.
[02:50:35.120 --> 02:50:37.120]   Make sure there's nothing else in there of mine, okay?
[02:50:37.120 --> 02:50:38.120]   Yes, there is.
[02:50:38.120 --> 02:50:39.120]   I'll give it back.
[02:50:39.120 --> 02:50:40.120]   You'll give it back.
[02:50:40.120 --> 02:50:41.120]   Why?
[02:50:41.120 --> 02:50:42.120]   You're not a CERT member.
[02:50:42.120 --> 02:50:43.120]   They're not going to see you again.
[02:50:43.120 --> 02:50:44.120]   I filled out the form.
[02:50:44.120 --> 02:50:45.120]   Oh, she's back in class.
[02:50:45.120 --> 02:50:46.120]   She wants to come out.
[02:50:46.120 --> 02:50:47.120]   Oh, I'm your only student.
[02:50:47.120 --> 02:50:48.120]   No, I don't get paid for this.
[02:50:48.120 --> 02:50:49.120]   This is wonderful.
[02:50:49.120 --> 02:50:50.120]   This is excellent.
[02:50:50.120 --> 02:50:51.120]   I love it a lot.
[02:50:51.120 --> 02:50:52.120]   Very wonderful.
[02:50:52.120 --> 02:50:53.120]   Yeah.
[02:50:53.120 --> 02:50:54.120]   I mean, I would love to do the whole thing, especially the cold one with the cold light.
[02:50:54.120 --> 02:50:55.120]   And I think there should be a committee for it.
[02:50:55.120 --> 02:50:56.120]   Thank you.
[02:50:56.120 --> 02:50:57.120]   Well, I do too.
[02:50:57.120 --> 02:50:58.120]   There's a lot of things that I can do.
[02:50:58.120 --> 02:50:59.120]   I can do a lot of things.
[02:50:59.120 --> 02:51:00.120]   I can do a lot of things.
[02:51:00.120 --> 02:51:01.120]   I can do a lot of things.
[02:51:01.120 --> 02:51:02.120]   I can do a lot of things.
[02:51:02.120 --> 02:51:03.120]   I can do a lot of things.
[02:51:03.120 --> 02:51:04.120]   I can do a lot of things.
[02:51:04.120 --> 02:51:05.120]   I can do a lot of things.
[02:51:05.120 --> 02:51:06.120]   I can do a lot of things.
[02:51:06.120 --> 02:51:27.120]   I can do a lot of things.
[02:51:27.120 --> 02:51:51.120]   I can do a lot of things.
[02:51:51.120 --> 02:52:04.400]   I can do a lot of things.
