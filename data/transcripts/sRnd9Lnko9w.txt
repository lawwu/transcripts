[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.940]   We received an email from Scotty, he asks, "Jesus said when the Holy Spirit comes we
[00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.940]   will do greater works than Jesus himself did. What does he mean, and how should
[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.020]   these greater things be manifesting themselves in the lives of us as
[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:27.220]   followers of Christ?" That is such a perennially good and important and hard
[00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.280]   question. Let me just read the verse because you left out part of it and it
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.400]   might be the hardest part. "Truly, truly," this is John 14 12, "truly, truly I say to
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:48.520]   you whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do," not just greater, but
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.480]   that I do, which is mind-blowing enough, "and greater works than these will he do
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.400]   because I am going to the Father." That's the verse. And so here's several
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.240]   things to observe. Number one, this is not a statement that certain
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.160]   charismatically gifted people would do greater works. This says every single
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:18.000]   believer, every single believer, whoever believes in me will do my works and
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.480]   greater ones, okay? Everybody. Nobody's off the hook here and we can't say, "Oh
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.720]   well there's a miracle happening over in China or something. Somebody got raised from the
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.480]   dead and maybe there's four of those and Jesus only did three." Baloney. That's just
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.800]   absolutely ridiculous. It's not what the verse is talking about. And so the first
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.960]   thing we have to do is realize it says every believer will do my work. So Jesus
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.160]   turned water into wine, he blew the mind and read the mind of the woman at Samaria,
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.840]   he healed the official son, he healed a man crippled for 38 years, he turned a
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.760]   little tiny group of loaves and fishes into enough to feed 5,000. He walked on
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.760]   water, he opened a blind man's eyes and he raised Lazarus from the dead. Every
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:10.360]   believer will do that, right? Well, no. We know that's not true and not just
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.080]   from experience. We know it from 1 Corinthians 12. 1 Corinthians 12 says, "Do
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:26.440]   all work miracles?" Answer, "No." Okay, so he clearly doesn't mean everybody will turn
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.640]   water into wine and everybody will heal the lame and everybody will feed 5,000.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.920]   He just doesn't mean that. Because not only wasn't it true for his
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.760]   disciples and it isn't true for us and it isn't biblically true according to
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.240]   1 Corinthians 12. Here's what I think he means in that first half of the verse.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:56.920]   All of them will do the works of Jesus in the sense that all the works of Jesus
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:04.920]   testified to his truth and his deity. Every Christian will do these works.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.680]   Every Christian will let his light so shine before men that they may see his
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.000]   good works and give glory to the Father and good glory to the Son and the risen
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.280]   Christ. We are the aroma of Christ. We are the light of the world. So the common
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.600]   denominator between Jesus' works and our works is that all of his works were
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.680]   works of love that pointed to his reality. All of our works should be works
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.360]   of love that point to his reality. And in fact, all of our works are more or less
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.480]   as born-again Christians pointing to the reality of Jesus. So we are, all of us,
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.200]   doing the works of Jesus. Not the precise ones like feeding the 5,000, but the kind
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.360]   of works that validate Jesus, point to Jesus, glorify Jesus. So that's
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.160]   the first half of the verse. There is another part to that verse, and that's
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.880]   the one that people really stumble over, even though I think they should stumble
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.680]   over the first one that we just talked about. It says, "And greater works than
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.720]   these will he do." So what can be greater than raising the dead, walking on water,
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:20.440]   feeding 5,000, turning water into wine? What in the world did Jesus mean? And we
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.560]   know that, according to 1 Corinthians 12, God doesn't intend for all of his people
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:33.840]   to work miracles. And so it can't be that every believer will do more stunning,
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.800]   supernatural miracles, because the verse does say every believer, and later in the
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:47.520]   New Testament, every believer is not promised to do that. So here's my best
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.720]   take. I've got a sermon on this, if you want to go and just find it in the sermon
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.920]   on John 14, but I think there are a couple of clues that point in the right
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:05.960]   direction. One clue is, at the end of the verse, it says, "When I go to be with the
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.320]   Father, then this will happen, when I ascend to the Father," because it has
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.200]   something to do with his death, his resurrection, his ascension, the pouring
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.460]   out of the Holy Spirit is what makes this possible. Second clue, in John 20, 21
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:25.680]   to 23, "As the Father has sent me," he says to them, "I'm sending you," and when he said
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.180]   this, he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit," I think an
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.320]   acted-out parable of what the Holy Spirit's going to mean, when you get it,
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.720]   when I'm risen, "If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven. If you withhold
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.440]   the sin of any, they are withheld." Now that's amazing. I'm going to give
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.320]   you the Holy Spirit, you disciples, you followers of me, every one of you, and the
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:55.040]   effect of this is going to be that you are going to witness to the crucified
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:02.400]   and risen Christ with such effectiveness that sins will be forgiven or withheld
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.120]   according to your message of the crucified and risen Christ in the power
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.880]   of the Holy Spirit. Now, that had never been done before in the history of the
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:15.720]   world. Jesus himself had never done that, because he hadn't been crucified yet, he
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.640]   hadn't been raised yet, he hadn't ascended yet, he hadn't poured out the
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:25.200]   Holy Spirit in fullness yet on these people as the Spirit of the risen Christ.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.040]   And so my answer to the question, "What's new? What are the greater works?"
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:40.640]   The greater works are the normal living and speaking of the new people of God in
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:47.040]   the fullness of the Holy Spirit in the name of the crucified and risen Jesus in
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:54.880]   such a way that sins are forgiven in his name, the crucified and risen one. That
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:01.440]   shift in redemptive history, Jesus says, puts his people in a category of
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:08.560]   doing greater works in the sense of proclaiming a finished work of salvation
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.600]   that had not been finished even in his own life, and that in that sense is
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:19.320]   greater than even what he had done. Thank you, Pastor John. The sermon on John 14
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:24.520]   mentioned earlier is titled "Doing the Works of Jesus and Greater Works." You can
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.960]   find it at DesiringGod.org. I'm your host Tony Reinke, thanks for listening.
