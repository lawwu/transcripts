[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.400]   - Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John Podcast.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.400]   We are putting the finishing touches up
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.600]   on our 2015 Conference for Pastors,
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.480]   which begins here soon in Minneapolis.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.580]   It actually runs next Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday,
[00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.720]   and your prayers would be appreciated.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.280]   But for the next several episodes,
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.520]   we're gonna be joined by Matt Chandler,
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.240]   the lead pastor at the Village Church in Dallas.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.720]   Matt is the author of several books,
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.920]   including his newest title, "The Mingling of Souls,
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.000]   "God's Design for Love, Marriage, Sex, and Redemption."
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.520]   And he joins us on the phone from Dallas.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.000]   Matt, thank you for joining us.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.400]   - Oh, it's my pleasure, brother.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.920]   - I actually want to take this time
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.680]   to focus in on relationship questions
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.360]   faced by young Christian men and women in particular
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.680]   who are single or dating and who are not yet married.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.840]   This is a season of life that awakens a lot of desires,
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.200]   a lot of hopes, and it brings with it
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.400]   a vast array of tricky pastoral questions.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.160]   And we get emails from listeners
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.960]   in this season of life every single day,
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.040]   and I'm grateful for three single friends,
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.520]   especially, who helped me write and sharpen these questions
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.600]   to maximize our time together.
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.680]   Special thanks to Lori Ferguson, Paul Maxwell,
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.240]   and of course, to our very own Marshall Siegel.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.680]   So Matt, with this list of 10 questions,
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.400]   we will just start working through them,
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.240]   and here is question number one.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.480]   The Bible, of course, commands Christians
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.040]   to marry in the Lord, that is, other Christians.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.400]   But in a day when there's so much nominalism
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.920]   that passes for authentic maturity,
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.600]   give us a few simple marks of spiritual growth
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.040]   that a man or a woman should be looking for
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.760]   in a potential spouse.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.680]   - Well, I think what you're looking for
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.680]   is a seriousness about growing in the person's faith.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.560]   And so I think the way the church really serves
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.200]   and helps Christian singles consider marriage
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.720]   and consider dating is that in the covenant community
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.840]   of faith, a person should be known,
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.680]   and there should be those around them
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.560]   that can speak of their reputation,
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.080]   whether they're growing in the Lord,
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.860]   whether they're serious about growing in the Lord,
[00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.760]   whether they're putting sin to death in their life.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.760]   And really, that's what you're looking for.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.480]   You're looking for, is there a seriousness in this person
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.520]   to grow in their relationship and understanding
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.840]   with the Lord?
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.240]   Because what I've found that's so tragic
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.720]   is that Christian singles,
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.720]   they'll hit this area of desperation,
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.320]   particularly young women, and they'll go,
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.440]   "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, he's a Christian.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.360]   "He comes to church."
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.900]   And really what they're saying is they come to church
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.060]   a couple of times a month,
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.600]   but outside of attending a service,
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.520]   there's no real seriousness about growing
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.920]   in their understanding of the Lord,
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.240]   growing in an understanding of the Bible,
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.160]   being a prayerful person.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.040]   There's no real vivification or mortification
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.240]   that can be spotted,
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.900]   and no one who really knows them enough
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.620]   to speak to the growth in their character.
[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.220]   And so I think that's what you're looking for.
[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.300]   Is there a seriousness to grow in the things of the Lord?
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.360]   Now, practically, I think that's gonna look like
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.400]   they're involved in the life of the church,
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.700]   they have sought out people to speak into their lives,
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.360]   they're being discipled,
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.460]   whether that be organically or organizationally,
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.660]   so they're a part of a church's systems for discipleship,
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.740]   or they've just found an older man or an older woman
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.480]   and invited that person to speak into their lives.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.020]   And I think if those pieces are there,
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.520]   those are a much safer gauge than just say
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.000]   they highlight passages in their Bible
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   or you see them at service every week.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.680]   - Very good, and I wanna come back to this
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.400]   and have you speak to ladies who think that these standards
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.200]   rule out every guy in her life.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.640]   And I also wanna hear more about how the Village Church
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.180]   corporately seeks to cultivate solid marriages,
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.200]   but we are gonna have to take a break for the weekend now.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.080]   We return on Monday, and I'll ask you, Matt,
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.000]   if Facebook has ruined dating.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.280]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, we'll see you on Monday.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:29.440]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
