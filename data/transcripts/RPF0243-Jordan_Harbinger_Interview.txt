[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.480]   Well, I am out of town and
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.680]   Working with my family. I am playing a bunch of really cool interviews
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.520]   Check back in October for the more normal flow of the show, but right now I'm gonna bring you an interview with Jordan Harbinger
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.240]   founder of the
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.240]   very excellent website and
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:44.360]   Podcast called the art of charm. We're gonna talk about how social skills can influence your life and
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.240]   your career
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.240]   Basically help you rock it
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:01:08.720]   Welcome to the radical personal finance podcast. My name is Joshua sheets, and I'm your host. Thank you for being with me today today
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.920]   Let's talk about social skills. When's the last time you sat down and studied how to act?
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.760]   Perhaps you were blessed with excellent social skills
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.640]   Perhaps you were blessed with excellent parents who sat you down and instructed you on the fine art of manners the fine art of charm
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.080]   Fine art of how to network effectively, but a lot of us didn't have that
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.520]   That means we got to study it because that is an important life skill. I
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:44.560]   Often think about this type of subject and I think man what an important what an important important important important aspect of life
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.120]   but for most of us unless you've either been proactive about recognizing a deficiency in your own comportment and
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.160]   Decided to go out and rectify that by study and practice
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.380]   or unless you've had a parent or a mentor or a boss or a friend who took you all under their wing and
[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.600]   Said hey, let me teach you a thing or two. Most of us just kind of slid past these aspects of life
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.120]   We didn't really study and learn about the things that we need to learn about especially how do you beat charming?
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.120]   How do you be persuasive? How do you become influential?
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.000]   How do you ingratiate yourself with other people
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.240]   now
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.840]   Before we get to the interview. I just want to mention to you. It's up to you
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.720]   How you use these skills some people take skills and use them for evil?
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.680]   Some people take skills and use them for good and that choice is up to you
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.360]   but
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.200]   There are very few things in life that will make a bigger impact on
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.880]   Your ability to succeed than your overall social skills
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.960]   So it's worth studying and I've invited Jordan on the show to share with us some of his experience and some of his wisdom
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.200]   So let's get to it
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.920]   Jordan welcome to radical personal finance. I appreciate being with me today. Thanks, man. Yeah, I appreciate the invite
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.920]   I brought you on to talk about
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.600]   Personal effectiveness and personal skills and with radical personal finance kind of the core mission is to help people
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.280]   Build a lifestyle of financial independence
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.760]   I come from a background as being a former financial planner and one of the things that I noticed was a lot of what financial
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.800]   Planners talk about is useful, but it's not the most useful. Yeah, because you can put money in an IRA
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.800]   But if you're just an idiot and everyone hates you
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.200]   It's not gonna work. So I wanted to bring you on to talk about
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.120]   Social skills social dynamics and ways that people can improve their interpersonal relationships
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.520]   But first give us a quick intro as to your background with the art of charm
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.360]   Sure, so I used to be a financial attorney actually on Wall Street. So speaking of bad financial advice
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.840]   I know a lot about that stuff and I
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.160]   Had a quote-unquote mentor there. His name was Dave and by mentor
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.280]   I don't mean like Matthew McConaughey meet we're doing the oyster shooters on the roof on Wall Street
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.280]   I mean he was never there didn't care
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.880]   not that he didn't care about me or anything he just had other things to do and
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.440]   So one day I caught up with them because they were like, how's your mentorship program going? I was like it
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.920]   What are you talking about? We don't have that, you know, everybody else went to Blue Man Group and I haven't done squat
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.920]   So they made him take me out for coffee
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.200]   Just like the saddest summer associate thing and I said, how come you're you're never here in the office
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.200]   Even though we're supposed to bill hours. Like that's the point of being a lawyer, right? It's make money for the firm and
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.200]   He's like, oh, well, I'm bringing in the deals, you know, I'm bringing in all the business
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.280]   So I don't care about billing hours. I don't care about
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.600]   worrying about
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.600]   how often I'm in the office I don't need to put in FaceTime or any of that crap because I
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.320]   I don't need the money. I get money from bringing in deals and I was like, wait a second
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.640]   So you this is a guy from Brooklyn with a tan, right? So I'm like this guy knows what he's talking about
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.000]   So I go I dive headfirst into this because I'm thinking wait a second
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.040]   There's guys sleeping under their desk here and you don't even show up on Tuesdays or or most of the week for that matter
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.040]   And he's he's like, yeah, I'm golfing. I do jujitsu
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.200]   I go on charity events and cruises and I do dinners and all this stuff
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:13.440]   I'm like, so you're just a pro schmoozer, but but it's not just like being seen it's like you're getting business from
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.360]   this this activity these deals somehow you're and
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.140]   and that threw everything in the face about what I knew about networking because I thought
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.960]   You you work your way to the top and then like there's some you know
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.280]   Country Club that you join and all the other top guys are there and then you become friends and that's how your network gets
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.840]   Formed it's actually the other way around
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.320]   Yeah
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.960]   you build the network before you get to the top the reason you're at the top is because your network brings you there and
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.600]   And that was like my you know, my mind exploded right that right. I was like, holy crap
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.680]   This is this this is the hack and he was the first person that taught you that right?
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.560]   He taught me that but he taught me that indirectly. He wasn't like listen man. Here's what you got to do
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:59.000]   He was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever and because he didn't really I don't think he even thought about in retrospect
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.760]   I don't think he was like listen if you know people and you bring in deals, you'll get to the top faster
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.880]   I think he was just like whatever. You're another summer associate who's not even gonna be here next year. He's right about that though
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.720]   So what'd you do from there
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:19.400]   So I dedicated myself to learning about the networking process and the relationship development process because I thought wait a minute
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.600]   this is I
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.280]   Can't sleep under my desk. I'm not gonna I'm never gonna be hard-working and like I have a good work ethic
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.200]   But I'm never gonna be able to outwork these people who are like, they don't need sleep. They don't like their drones
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.920]   Yeah
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.720]   They're my robot drones some people to be fair like
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.560]   Probably them like some of them were immigrants from other countries that were like my family's not here
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.160]   I I'm just here to work my butt off and make money and bring over like ten relatives and I'm like, hey if you're gonna
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.680]   Do that cool, but I don't have that kind of motivation right? Like I'm I need a life, you know, I'm not first-generation
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.000]   and
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.920]   Again, like props to that props to those people, but I was not gonna do that
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.560]   I needed like a life and I wanted to get married and have kids and so
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:06.360]   There was this other group of people that were just friggin geniuses and I am NOT in that camp
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.840]   Anybody's heard the art of charm podcast is like yeah, you're not gonna could think you didn't bet on that one. So
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.640]   So I thought okay. Here's what I'm gonna do the third invisible
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.160]   What do you call like the third invisible path?
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.680]   That no one knows about is building a network and it's not like oh, I I know this guy
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.560]   So I get something that I don't deserve it's wait a minute
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.320]   I'm making myself visible
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:37.320]   Through not through working super hard and outworking everyone and being that all-star and not through being the smartest guy in the room
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:43.120]   But by connecting other people so it's not just knowing people and getting favors. That's why people hate networking
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.120]   They're like, I don't just want to get something. I don't deserve shame on you
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.440]   It's not that you're connecting other people and that's valuable, right?
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.800]   So it's different than just being like well, my dad owns the company. So I got this promotion
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.440]   So, you know go fly a kite. It's like no
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.760]   No, I know these guys who needed to know those guys who needed to know us to make that transaction happen
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:08.320]   Thus we got the business there's real value there. And in fact that value is so rare
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:14.360]   The skill set of bringing that value I should say is so rare that if you are a master of it
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:20.680]   you can write your own ticket in terms of like corporate stuff because the the fact of the matter is
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.000]   It's like baseball players
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.920]   The reason they get paid a ton is because there's not a it's not like you and I can go I can hit that ball
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:33.760]   Over that fence we can't right and it takes years and years and years and there's talent involved and all this other stuff
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.640]   So since it's so rare that made Dave the most valuable guy in the firm
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:44.860]   Which was a skill set that I now realize applies to everything not just law it applies to literally any industry anywhere
[00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.080]   If you can be the connector
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:52.900]   You don't have to be the smartest guy in the room and you don't have to outwork everyone and that's good news for like
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.280]   Ninety nine point nine percent of the population. I'm fascinated by watching
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:02.120]   The venture capitalist investors, you know the one in Silicon Valley. Yeah, one of the things I notice is
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:06.020]   The investors have to work they almost have to fight with each other
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.600]   - when there's a good firm that has a good perspective future
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:15.640]   the investors have to fight with each other in order to get noticed by the owners of the company and
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:21.960]   They not only can't just throw money at the company because a good founder who knows they've got a good thing
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:28.400]   They need money. Yes, but they all also need connections and many times the most effective successful
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.380]   the most effective successful
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.900]   Investors are the ones who are able to bring the connections and I just finished a book
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:41.480]   Called you only have to be right once and it was written by a fortune magazine editor and he covered basically a story of I think
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.280]   It was 12 or 13 different
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:49.740]   of these stories of the founder of Instagram and the founder of snapchat and these different, you know people who went from nothing to
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.000]   billionaires in
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.160]   Almost no time right, but one of the stories in there was about an amazing guy
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:02.480]   He was a Persian rug merchant first-generation immigrant came to the country from Iran knew
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:07.720]   Nobody got a job selling rugs and no stereotype. Right, right exactly
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.000]   But as he was selling rugs
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.920]   He recognized where to sell his rugs and he would start working with rich people and that was where he was targeting
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.160]   He would go out and he would always try to sell a rug in somebody's house
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:25.720]   And one of the things that he started doing as he was selling rugs was asking questions about what do you do and taking an interest?
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.700]   in other people
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:33.600]   He became one of the most connected and influential people in Silicon Valley and there are several I forget the names
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:40.600]   But there were several of these big kind of multi billionaire the founders of these these hot firms that got their start
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.800]   Sitting in the back of his rug shop drinking tea while he would connect them in Silicon Valley
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:53.200]   Unbelievable and he transformed himself from a penniless immigrant selling rugs to a multi multi million dollar
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.960]   investor extremely wealthy
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:03.000]   Purely based on his ability to connect people and to this day. He doesn't have the largest venture capital fund. He doesn't have the largest
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.320]   bank book
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.880]   but he's got the connections and he's always diligent about going and helping and making the connections and making the connections and
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.240]   People will send them pieces of the deals just because he's so valuable for connections
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:19.700]   Well now he's probably like hey if this pans out throw me a point or two exactly. Yeah, whatever
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:26.120]   Okay, if it works, it's papers pays for itself instantly. So he's probably got points on like a hundred two hundred exactly
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:31.200]   Ventures that are profitable. Yeah at this point. It's an amazing story. Yeah, that's brilliant
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.800]   And that's exactly what we're talking about
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.200]   You don't have to be a rug salesman to really knock this out of the park either
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.000]   Because one of the exercises that I give we have a networking class
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.360]   That's all online at the art of charm comm that we just released this month and one of the exercises that we give there
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.720]   In social capital is what it's called
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:54.740]   One of the exercises is write down everyone, you know, and and obviously that's like an impossible task, right?
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:58.200]   So you start making you it takes like an hour and a half two hours
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.600]   You make this sheet of everyone that you know
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:05.940]   And I'm talking about like your mom's hairdresser to like your dentist and it's you won't finish it
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.960]   it's not designed to be completed because you'd know literally tens of thousands of people and
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:16.160]   what happens when you do that is you start to think about who you can help without thinking about anything that that person can do
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.160]   for you and
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:24.120]   the it starts it forces you to think of your relationships in a completely different way and
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:29.080]   the reason that I came up with this is because what happened to me once was I got a
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:35.760]   Toothache when I moved to Los Angeles, I was there for like a week. I just moved to LA and I got a toothache
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.880]   It was terrible and I thought man
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:44.760]   I'm I'm never gonna be able to find a dentist because I called like five and they're like, yeah go to the ER
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.900]   I'm like, dude, I know what happens in the ER. They tie a string around your tooth and slam the door
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:54.880]   That's how they cure your toothache in an ER like with no insurance. So I put it on I put on Facebook
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.460]   I was like desperate need dentist in LA
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:03.640]   Does anyone know who can see me on short notice? I have a serious toothache. It's driving me crazy. Can't sleep can't do anything
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.720]   This guy writes back and he's like my aunt's a dentist
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.160]   Let me call her and I'll see if she can slot you in on a short notice, right?
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.840]   He called and I don't know this guy
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.600]   Just like a random guy follows me on Facebook or there's a friend of a friend or something
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.660]   You know, I said that was to public everybody, please
[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:23.920]   So I get a message like in two or three hours and the guys like my aunt will see you
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.440]   She's you know, she'll charge you fairly like thanks for everything that you do as your show
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.480]   My cousin introduced me to it blah blah blah
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:36.280]   So I go to this dentist I get my tooth taken care of and I'm like, hey man, thank you so much for this
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.520]   I really appreciate you hooking me up with the dentist. That's really great
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:46.560]   I'm super thankful like I was dying. He's like cool. I'm like anything I can do for you. He's like well, I don't know
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.120]   I mean if you ever need a graphic designer, let me know and I'm like, okay, whatever
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.360]   I don't need a graphic designer, but I'll keep my ear to the ground for you and
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:14:00.640]   Like two days later. I get an email. That's like hey, I love your website. I'm looking to redo mine who does your site?
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.120]   I'm like, well this guy does the site but you need a graphic designer
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:08.160]   Here's a portfolio from a random guy. Let me know if you want an intro
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:14.080]   She's like actually this looks good. And my other designers totally flaky. So can you introduce me to that guy?
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.280]   They work together on a few projects later on he gets a full-time job
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:23.880]   80 grand a year full-time graphic design with like a friend of hers and I'm like you do realize that
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:29.100]   You got that job because you hooked me up with a dentist right on Facebook
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:32.600]   And that's why so you can't plan for this type of
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:37.360]   Serendipitous success and that's why when you network for transactional purposes
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.160]   It's it's the wrong way to do it
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:44.920]   like if you're going to somebody you're like I need to meet this guy because this guy does this and he's the only guy who
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:50.360]   Can help me with this and so I need to meet that person for that reason that works to a certain extent
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.960]   But if you're ignoring everything else
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:58.440]   You're you're leaving it all like 90% of it on the table because you can't plan for the guy who helps you with a dentist on
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:03.360]   Facebook that then you then get a job at a graphic design and and then if I ever need to do business with his new
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.180]   Employer I just have to call him right and he'll be like yeah
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:08.060]   I'll fast-track you and be like this guy's cool
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:14.660]   He helped me get this job indirectly and that employer is now thankful that I got him that guy that guy's thankful for his job
[00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:21.380]   The other girls thankful for the website. I'm thankful for the dentist. So there's wins on all sides like everybody in that
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:26.440]   Interaction one and if I had just gone I need a dentist
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:32.500]   Who's can find me a dentist and I only message dentist or if he was like I need a graphic design job
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.060]   And he only message people
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:34.560]   Hey
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.380]   Do you need a graphic designer that would never have happened like none of those?
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:42.600]   Transactions or interactions would ever have happened because we would have been aiming at totally different targets
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:48.040]   Do you have a way to look for somebody to look at their own skill set and be able to?
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:52.640]   Identify their level of effectiveness to kind of say yeah
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:56.960]   I'm I'm really terrible at this or I'm really good because one of the things that frustrates me is
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.640]   I observe a lot of people and just keep my observations to myself
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:05.520]   But I noticed many people that I observe is they don't perceive themselves. We always have a tough times
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:10.860]   Perceiving how we actually are. That's why when we watch a video of ourselves like wait a second. That's not me
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.240]   I don't look like that. Yeah, you do. Yeah, I know and unfortunate
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:18.160]   It's never like wow, I look like that. It's like oh man, I look like that
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:24.480]   So is there a way that you have for somebody to kind of look at their own situation and say how effective am I at?
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.820]   Networking at bringing value to other people. Yeah, I mean, it's it's very
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:33.540]   Unsystematic, but if how often do you feel like you have to sell yourself?
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.420]   How often are you calling people and asking for things?
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:40.840]   Versus how often are you being introduced to exactly the right people that you need?
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.420]   essentially without you having to ask and
[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:49.820]   the percentage of course of you just having quote-unquote having things fall in your lap in air quotes is
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:54.900]   The is is a good estimator of how how good you are at this for example
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:17:00.660]   When I want to when I wanted to speak a lot this year and next year around the world
[00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:06.500]   I just told like two people and I put it on my show like hey, I'm interested in speaking stuff, especially international
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.300]   I am I now I booked out like a
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:14.340]   18 months of speaking gigs probably like in the next like 60 not even 60 days
[00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:17.480]   Because I just got a ton of offers that were like you want to speak
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:23.860]   Why didn't you say so come to India come to Australia come to California Las Vegas, Florida, New York, Maryland
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:29.500]   That happened instantly because I just sort of put it out to a couple of folks that I knew were really well
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:35.080]   Connected in that area who are like world famous speaker types and they're like, yeah
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:39.220]   Come to this event and speak with me at this and that's that's a result of not me going
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:43.140]   Hi, I'd like to speak at this event. Hi. Can I speak at your event? Can I speak at that event?
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.540]   I don't have to do that and it's not because oh, I'm so cool
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:52.900]   It's because the network has set up such that people are actively looking for ways to help me because I keep helping them on other
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.820]   things all the time
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:59.580]   What's the process and I assume this is why you write a course so feel free to write to mention that but what's the process?
[00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:06.100]   Of learning these skills very practically sure. So one of the things that we have people do is
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:10.280]   Aside that you start off with that list of like everyone, you know
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:14.860]   Quote-unquote and you just start to look for people that you can help every single day and by help
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:17.180]   I don't mean like Oh Josh is moving
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:21.180]   Let me go over there and help him lift crap out of his garage like you can do that
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.620]   But you don't have to do that
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:29.020]   The highest leverage point for people is going to be connecting other people together because I know what people are thinking right now
[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:35.460]   They're like, yeah, I'm not a professional speaker. I'm not a technical person. Not a graphic designer. How can me a
[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:40.940]   Random fight let's say financial planner. How can I help like a technical person?
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:45.500]   I can't the answer is not what you can do with your own skills
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:51.480]   In terms of your professional skills the answer lies in what you can do
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:58.300]   To connect people inside your own network. So if you're a financial planner and I'm like, oh, well, sorry
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:02.260]   I invest my money with another guy then our transaction quote-unquote is over
[00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:07.540]   But if you're like man, you know, I'm really looking for ways to get new clients. I'm like, well, okay
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.660]   Who do you need to meet and you tell me what client kind of clients you get?
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:15.620]   I might have ideas for that but I might be like well, where do most of your clients come from?
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:20.620]   Well, you know I get them a lot when I do consulting for nonprofits just randomly but humor me on right?
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:25.460]   I'm like, oh, well, I know a ton of people that run nonprofits you do consulting for nonprofits
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:29.240]   Why don't I introduce you to those people now? I'm introducing you to them
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:34.340]   So it doesn't matter that I don't know how to find you nonprofit
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.980]   Clients or whatever. I'm just introducing you to people in that world
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:43.220]   I can do that via email and I could do I could do 50 a day before lunch, right?
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.980]   So people because people go well, I don't have time to help like a hundred people a day
[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:52.380]   I got a job or I don't know enough people if you start to look at your relationships as who can I connect?
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.380]   to help each other
[00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:59.300]   That's a massive. There's so much leverage there because you can know 50 100 people
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:04.660]   Which is nothing compared to how many people you actually know right and you can start plugging them all into each other
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:11.060]   And you'd be surprised what people need like that guy didn't think I'm just waiting till Jordan needs a dentist and I'm gonna get that
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:14.100]   Graphic design job, right that wasn't in his head at all
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:21.380]   So just constantly be looking for ways to help other people and usually the way that you do that is by connecting people who are already
[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:24.660]   Inside your network once you get really good at that
[00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:30.060]   Then you can start reaching out on behalf of other people and on behalf of yourself
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:35.580]   So for example, if I knew that you needed to meet nonprofit founders, I might go well cool
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:39.740]   I know one guy who's a nonprofit founder, but he's got to know some others
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:46.420]   So I might reach out to him on your behalf and say who else do you know that might be able to help Josh?
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:52.340]   now you've got access to a person who's well connected in the circle that you need specifically and
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:58.300]   It's via me, but I'm not doing any of the work other than sending a couple emails here and there
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:04.380]   I'm brokering the deal, but I'm you know, quote-unquote, but I'm not getting anything other than goodwill out of it
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:10.460]   But if I ever needed anything from you or any of those nonprofit people who you help after that they're gonna be like, oh sure
[00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.700]   Yeah, what can I do for you? Because I basically
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:16.620]   Sold them your skills for free and vice versa, right?
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:22.620]   the thing I love about networking as a skill set and as a practice is
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.460]   that
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:31.700]   Done properly and done effectively. It's a hundred percent ethical and and appropriate because
[00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.660]   professional networking is not
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:41.620]   Going around and flinging business cards people and telling what you are professional networking is constantly thinking
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:46.700]   Who is this person? What are they working toward and how can I help them?
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.980]   Exactly. It's it's it's the whole idea
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:54.580]   And of course, we have like scripts for everything that I'm talking about because people are like wait back up, right?
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:22:01.740]   It's a you know, I should have actually written this down, but it's the art of charm.com slash social - capital
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:05.380]   But if you just go to the art of charm and you click on networking or products, it's in there
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:09.300]   And maybe I can send you a link you can throw in the show notes or something
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:14.340]   Yeah, but it's all about giving authentically and giving generously
[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:19.340]   So you don't think about what you can get out of it because then you go if you do that
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:22.780]   You're going back to that transactional thing where you're like, okay
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:26.740]   Well, what do I get out of it? If I hook Jordan up with a dentist? The answer is nothing, right?
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:32.420]   Right, so then that wouldn't have worked. So if I'm just looking at giving authentically and generously
[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:39.380]   I I'm gonna stand out from the so-called professional networkers who are like smarmy business card slingers who are like
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:44.820]   Hey next time you need a financial planner. Here's my card and I'm like, I'm not ever I don't who are you?
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:49.020]   Why would I call you? I don't know you I don't trust you with all my money. Are you crazy?
[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.820]   Right, why would that ever work?
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:56.060]   But that's how most people network and that's why most normal nice people hate networking, right?
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:00.140]   Because their vision of it is like hard selling yourself on
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:03.660]   Strangers which they hate when that happens to them
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:09.380]   so one of the largest criticisms are like people go oh man this Jordan guy is gonna be so annoying if I meet him in
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:13.220]   Person cuz he's gonna be like hey, whatever if you need this call me and it's not like that
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:17.780]   It's like what can I do for you? It's so much easier because nobody's like
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.420]   Wait a minute. What can you do for me?
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:23.660]   Nothing go away like only the most skeptical
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:28.180]   Cynical sob would do that and and there are still people that do that
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:31.780]   But those people when you look at sort of their lifestyle, they're very unsuccessful
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:37.100]   Generally, because if you're living your life going hmm, you're helping me that's suspicious
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:43.180]   There's a good chance that you're you're not operating at your potential because you've built a wall around you
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:47.340]   Which is not how successful people live and work the skills of networking are
[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:53.880]   Specifically in and of themselves as you mentioned in the early part of this discussion. They are a financially valuable skill and my
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:59.740]   Example of this and a resource also years ago when I was beginning financial plan. I read a book by dr
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:05.220]   Thomas Stanley who is the author of the millionaire next door and this book was entitled networking with the affluent and
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:12.420]   He actually did a lot of studies of affluent people to try to figure out what is what are the common?
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:19.260]   Themes now some of that research that he talked about was featured in millionaire next door millionaire mind those types of books
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:24.200]   But this one was all about how do you actually do it and in networking with the affluent?
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:30.420]   He specifically identifies certain services that you can provide to your clients that will be incredibly helpful
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:34.660]   but one of the most helpful that he emphasized on is being a connector and
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:41.860]   He profiled in that book a CPA and this CPA was one of the most effective most successful
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:48.620]   CPAs in the area had a massive client base of very wealthy clients and he's interviewing the CPA and he's trying to figure out
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:49.660]   What is the CPA doing?
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:57.180]   he realized that what one of the major values that this person brought was connecting his clients with other people and
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:01.460]   So and then he took it to another level and here's the specific example
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:04.460]   I'm gonna draw out if he had a client who wanted to
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.860]   Who wanted to buy a car?
[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:14.020]   He was also connected with the owners of the local car dealerships and he behind his desk
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:18.800]   He would have stacks and stacks and stacks of business cards of different people that he knew and that he trusted
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:23.980]   so he would connect the client the wealthy business owner with the owner of the
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:29.060]   Car dealership and he would make an introduction so that person could be treated. Well, well over time
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:34.180]   He developed a technique of actually going above and beyond and so what he started doing was
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:40.940]   Negotiating the acquisition of the cars for his clients. He was a CPA. He was an impartial person
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.180]   He he was well schooled in money
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:48.380]   So he could actually negotiate the deal and he would go a step beyond and actually negotiate and the person
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.740]   He didn't get paid for that. He didn't charge his clients for it
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.740]   It was a simple thing that he did that added value
[00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:54.260]   But he had a massive
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:26:01.700]   bustling accounting practice with clients that were incredibly loyal because of everything else that they got right and this accountant was the one who okay
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:07.200]   I'm trying to get my daughter into Harvard. Let me call my accountant and see who he knows that went to Harvard
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.700]   Maybe they could give her some help
[00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:15.500]   That's how the world works is helping people and connecting people and that's a skill set that you can practice and develop and that guy
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:21.440]   Never lost a client never and even if he wasn't the greatest accountant. Oh, yeah, and he probably was pretty good
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:26.180]   But even if he wasn't the person would say well, I get so much value from him
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:32.140]   I still get a key and if anybody ever needs an accountant ever among all of their wealthy well-to-do friends
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:38.140]   They're like the only choice exactly. He helped Julie get into Harvard. He helped Monica buy her car, right?
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.540]   He helped build, you know with his other issue here
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:46.240]   I mean, this is the only guy that you can use and yes, his fees are 3x what normally you'd pay
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:51.100]   But it's totally worth right and even though and so on top of that the other resource that really helped me
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:54.060]   Was I read when I was in the beginning of college?
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:57.360]   I read a book by an author named Keith for Ozzy called never eat a light
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:57.700]   Yeah
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:03.500]   probably one of the most well-known networking books and what that taught me is just because networking is ethical and
[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:08.940]   Filled with integrity and just because you're going about it right the way if you don't do it proactively
[00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:10.660]   You're not gonna reap the full results, right?
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:15.940]   So you can sit around and help the two or three people that are in your life, and that's a great place to start
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:21.540]   But if you can go out and proactively bring more people into your life and then focus on helping them
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.700]   Now all of a sudden you start to compound your returns talk about that
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:30.780]   Yeah, sure. So a lot of people treat networking as like a passive thing where it's for example
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:36.020]   You say well, I say I need a dentist. You're like, well, I know a dentist right? That's great
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:42.020]   But what if I know what your business needs to go to the next level? Like what if you're saying?
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:46.020]   People well, I'll give you a real-life example people come up to me all the time
[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.420]   They're like I want to start a show, you know, they might be an author
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.100]   What can I do to?
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:58.300]   Launch a successful show get people listening to it get some visibility in iTunes and I'll give them I can give them that if they ask
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:01.180]   But what I can also do is say actually, you know
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:07.620]   What you really need to do is not just start this podcast and put it up in iTunes and let it fly and make it really
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:11.080]   Successful you should also be connecting with other authors
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:15.580]   You guys should have each other on each other shows because people who buy books they don't just buy one book
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:20.940]   It's not a car, you know, you buy tons of books and if they're in the same niche you buy all the books
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:23.940]   And you read all the books so you guys got to be exchanging this
[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:28.860]   I happen to know the other ten authors that contacted me this month that are also bestsellers. Do you know them?
[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:32.020]   Oh, you know two of them. All right. Well, let's reach out to the other eight
[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:39.220]   I'll do that for you. And so I'm actually in a better position to find out what they need because of my experience
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.180]   You can also
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:45.580]   Proactively ask people what they want if nobody's coming to you because I know people are going yeah
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:50.180]   That's great. If you have something everyone's asking you for what if you don't you can start saying?
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:51.580]   What are you working on right now?
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:53.380]   See there's this weird thing where people go
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:58.260]   How can I help you and you're like, I don't know exactly and and that's that's kind of amateurish
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:03.620]   I know it's like trendy right now to good place to start but if you if that's all you can but you can make it
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:07.780]   A little more elegant it yeah people do that because it's it's like I don't know
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:12.780]   I've got a whole tirade that I'll spare you but I feel like it's fake generosity like tirades bring it on
[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:17.980]   But yeah people go how can I help you and usually they they're so vague that right?
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:22.260]   They're not really planning to help you. It's just they want to show like how helpful they are
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:26.740]   So they say how can I help you and really they're just kind of not gonna do anything
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:31.900]   Knowing that it's gonna be vague enough that you're not gonna be able to ask for anything and then you know
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.020]   Knowing that most of the time they're gonna get away with it
[00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:38.980]   But if you look proactively for ways you can help people and then ask them if they need that
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.340]   That's super super helpful
[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:48.180]   One of the things my friend Michael port wrote a book called book yourself salad and he's coming out with a new book in October
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.340]   It's awesome. And I'm like, you know what you need to do
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:53.860]   you need to go on some of these these different shows because
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:59.660]   These are the types of shows that have audiences that are gonna buy your book and podcasts and move books and he's like, okay cool
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:03.780]   So I just I said, do you know this person this person this person in this person?
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:07.340]   He's like no, so I made interest all those people but he wasn't gonna go
[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:07.780]   Hey
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:11.540]   Can you introduce me to a bunch of people who have a podcast that might move my book?
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:17.940]   Because he didn't necessarily think about that and the top in the moment. So if you're able to make those introductions
[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:27.100]   Proactively or help people by asking them specifically or even frankly telling them what maybe they need to do and then
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.420]   Doing 90% of that for them. They'll be super thankful
[00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:35.180]   Yeah, of course you still have to get their permission because he might be like no I have no time for additional media
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:38.180]   then don't make 20 intros that he then can't use but
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:44.420]   Definitely do ask people what they need. Like if somebody moves to town and they're moving to my area
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:48.700]   I'll say hey, listen, I know you're probably looking for
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:53.060]   Places to go that have good food good gin
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:57.020]   Maybe some cool like loungy places to grab a drink
[00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:02.300]   Here's some places to avoid that look really promising but are totally annoying. Here's where the worst traffic is
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:05.220]   You know and we'll send them an email like that
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:10.580]   I'll have Jen my assistant like send that to people who move into San Francisco or whatever and they're like, holy crap
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:15.700]   This is so awesome. Thank you so much. And it's not because I'm like, yes, I'm gonna ask you for something later
[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.180]   It's like no, no problem
[00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:21.420]   I know that this is what you need because this is what we ran into headfirst when we moved here
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:26.900]   So you can avoid all those headaches and it's just it's looking for those little proactive things that you frankly
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:32.140]   You already know that people need you're just not doing anything about it because you feel like oh
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:37.460]   It's not my place or it would be weird if I wrote them that or it'd be weird if I sent them this
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:42.620]   It's not and you should do it, but people don't do it. They you know, they're either shy or
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:47.340]   It's not habit. I would say one thing that's helpful to me
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:53.980]   It is weird if you do it if it's immediately connected to a request. Yes, that's when that's when it's weird
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:32:00.680]   That's when it's weird and that's when it becomes transactional and that's why you give generously and authentically with without the agenda
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.600]   Because expect expect this
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:08.540]   Nine out of ten people that you help you'll never get anything helpful from them ever again in your whole life
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:12.860]   If once you sort of accept that and you're still cool with helping other people
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.260]   Then when somebody doesn't help you back
[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:20.700]   You're not like what a jerk right because that's the problem is people that's a problem is what people do is they go?
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:25.180]   Oh, yeah, Josh, you know you live it. Oh you live in Minneapolis. Oh, you should try this
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:29.020]   My cousin's got a restaurant there. You should go here for dinner. Don't worry. I'll take care of it
[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:32.900]   And then I'm like, hey Josh, can you have me on your podcast? You're like, that's not really a good fit
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:36.980]   And I'm like this guy sucks. What a jerk right? I helped him get a free lunch
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:42.620]   Then he didn't have me on a show this guy's he's such an a-hole right like that's not cool
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:45.620]   Because that's what I call a covert contract
[00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:51.420]   And what that is is I'm saying if I help you you're gonna help me and what you hear is hey
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.340]   This guy helped me is so nice
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:58.180]   But really I'm like, where is it in return and people do this in their relationships, too
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:03.180]   like you've all we all have like the guy friend who who like drives women to the airport and is like if
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:07.620]   If I drive her to and from the airport in that time, she's gonna find out I'm the I'm the one
[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:14.540]   I'm the guy her dream guys been right here the whole time because he watched like say anything way too many times
[00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.740]   Right and and so if once you get that
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:24.820]   Transactional BS idea out of your head the industry realized most people won't help you back and that's totally okay
[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:26.700]   And that's how it's supposed to be
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:30.180]   Then you start running into like this really clean
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:35.540]   Authentic area of networking where you're just helping people out like you're and I hate the word networking
[00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:37.860]   But we have to call it that so people know what we're talking about
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:43.260]   But then you're just you're just helping people and it's Zig Ziglar who's now
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:47.940]   Has passed is he said I actually this all right, and I might have butchered this
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:49.020]   I might be like Brian Tracy
[00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:52.580]   But it's it's if you you'll you'll always get what you want
[00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:55.500]   If you just help enough other people get what they want Ziggler, right?
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:34:00.220]   I have everything in life you want if you just help enough. Thank you. Yes, exactly and it's true and
[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:02.860]   That sounds it sounds so hippie-dippie
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:07.460]   But where it comes in really handy is when you realize oh, wait a minute
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:13.300]   All he's talking about is getting emotionally invested in other people helping them achieve their goals
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:17.460]   And and just helping other people in any way shape or form
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:24.940]   He's not talking about like throw away all your dreams and ambitions and help other people achieve and dot dot dot profit, right?
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.140]   He's this is a very practical tip
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:32.740]   It's just that people are afraid to do it because they don't think it'll work quote-unquote for them
[00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:38.100]   Because they're not gonna get something in return right away, but when you stop thinking about that
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:44.140]   And you stop keeping we call it keeping score if you stop keeping score then it becomes much nicer
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:46.380]   like I might help someone ten times and
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:53.180]   They might do nothing for me and then on the 11th time I show up at their car dealership and they're like, hey, man
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:57.540]   I know exactly what's wrong with your car. I'm just gonna fix this for free. You've done a lot for me that
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:02.660]   Then I'm like, oh cool. But if I'm keeping score, I'm like, well, you got to do nine more things for me, dude
[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:07.020]   right, you know, I mean and that's not a good way to live because then you just resent everyone you interact with and
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:12.540]   That will stop you from helping other people who you think well this guy's never gonna be able to do anything for me
[00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:18.040]   So I'm not gonna help him. That's toxic. That's when you run into the whole well
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.820]   I can't help this guy
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:24.380]   So I'm not going to like the guy on Facebook if he was like, well sure
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:26.140]   I'll hook you up with a dentist if you get me a job
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:29.540]   You think you would have hooked me up with a dentist that would never would have happened never
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:35.580]   In my mind you could sum it all some much of it up and the title of Harvey McKay's book
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:42.740]   Which was dig your well before you're thirsty and you've got to do it in advance. Yes, but if you've got a well
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:45.980]   When you are thirsty and you have a need
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:50.500]   My thought and you can comment on this it's no problem to ask for help
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:54.340]   and so specifically one of the pieces of advice that I've given to other people is
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:58.180]   And this is where you have to have done it in advance, but I get so
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:03.940]   Frustrated when I see people who are out of work. They've lost a job and they can't get work and
[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:06.700]   What my advice to people is?
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:11.840]   Hopefully if you've done a good job along the way of building a network building a well
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:18.940]   And then when you're thirsty pick up the phone and call every single person and say I have a need I'm looking for help
[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:23.920]   Here's specifically what I'm looking for. And if you know of anything, please help me
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:29.460]   Yeah, if you've done the back work and you've developed a deep level of relationship with many people
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:36.220]   You'd have a job in no time. And so if you have a need like that something specific you can ask for help
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:40.820]   But you must have a deep well so that when you're thirsty you can go to it for water
[00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:48.180]   Exactly. It's that that book title is so money and we use that also in the social capital product and teach people how to dig
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:52.620]   The well because of course people go dig the well. Yeah, okay dot dot dot how do I do that?
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:55.440]   and so the whole course that we teach is
[00:36:55.540 --> 00:37:01.420]   How to dig the well how to maintain the well how to make sure the well is deep enough to to butcher this analogy to
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:04.220]   beat this analogy that the metaphor to death and
[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:12.260]   The the reason that this is so key is because everybody and everyone's experienced this. Oh crap. I need a job
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:14.260]   Hey, Josh, what's going on over?
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:20.500]   Sheets management LLC, buddy. You need any help and you're like GTFO man. I don't want to talk to you right now
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:24.380]   I've already heard from seven people that your job hunting. I'll keep my ear to the ground
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:28.180]   I don't need anybody to you know to come through but if this is like
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:32.740]   Your your boy that's helped you like meet your wife or like the guy who?
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:38.320]   Negotiated your car like that CPA or the guy that's like done other stuff for you and friends around you
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:42.820]   Then you're like, oh crap man, Jordan lost his job. Wait a minute. Who do I know?
[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:46.600]   I know a couple people that might be able to help now
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:51.780]   You're reaching out to those people because you you can't wait to help somebody that's done a ton of stuff for you, right?
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:56.420]   But if somebody is like just hey old buddy old pal, you're like, er, stop right there
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:38:00.020]   I know you're gonna ask me for something because that's the only time I ever talked to you
[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:08.540]   Just spare me right right and and nobody digs the well and that's why people it's another reason why people are like
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:11.460]   Networking doesn't work. It's a boys club
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:17.700]   Well, it's a boys club, but you can build it around you if you don't want to be in if you don't think that's a problem
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:19.980]   you know you build this around you and
[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:26.660]   Whether or not you choose to build a strong network around you or you choose to ignore this because you're fed and fat and happy
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.140]   right now
[00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:29.780]   That's that's your choice
[00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:33.660]   But don't cry when like the world comes crashing down and nobody has your back
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:37.020]   because you need to be building those strong relationships and and
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:41.260]   That's why we go we favor depth of relationship over
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:45.020]   Breadth if you had to if you had to choose one, which you actually don't
[00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:50.060]   So instead of trying to help seven million people and having those people in your network
[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:53.740]   It's much better to have like really close friends
[00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:58.340]   That also have large networks if you if that's the way that you guys are gonna roll
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.820]   so like a lot of my really good friends I
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:05.700]   I've invested a lot of time with them because they're great people and we have a lot of fun
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:10.060]   But also I know that they have my back and so if I ever need anything
[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:15.820]   I can also reach out to them and and their network or their business and their team and they can help as well
[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:21.900]   So it's really nice to be able to have that very it and it's again. It's not transactional
[00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:25.820]   It's not hey if I hang out with this guy long enough. He'll help me out if I ever need it
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:28.820]   It's just helping other people as much as possible
[00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:34.660]   But spending more time developing quality relationships than just trying to like pepper it around everywhere
[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:38.220]   To people who you don't even know their name, you know, you have sense
[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:45.340]   Yeah, do you have any regular practices ongoing disciplines ways that you remind yourself or tools that you use to remind yourself to?
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:47.540]   Be working to help other people
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:47.780]   yeah
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:52.180]   I mean it used to be something that I kind of had to manually do and I would use things like
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:56.100]   Contactually to be like email Josh and say hello, right?
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:40:00.020]   Facebook does a decent job of just telling you whose birthday it is
[00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:04.180]   So you can write people on their birthday and be like, hey man long time to talk. Happy birthday
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:08.100]   What are you working on this year? What are your goals and stuff like that?
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:13.700]   And sometimes people don't answer but other times people are like, yeah, man, you know, it's been a tough year
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:19.660]   You know, my wife had a baby and we're like we're trying to move but her dad is sick and you know
[00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:24.460]   I've got a back issue and it's just I'm getting no relief from it and I'm like, well, huh?
[00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:27.620]   What can I do to me? This is tough. Like these are a lot of personal issues
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:32.660]   What can I do to help in any way shape or form and I'm like, oh you live in Minneapolis
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:36.620]   Well, you just had a baby. Do you have is child care an issue?
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:40.460]   Cuz I know like I have a cousin there who's very responsible. She's really cool
[00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:43.220]   She you know, if you ever need like an emergency babysitter
[00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:50.780]   Maybe I can help and also I've got a great chiropractor that I can recommend that deals like specifically with back issues
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:53.660]   So, you know if you want to come out to San Francisco
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:59.860]   I can even I can introduce you to this guy and maybe there's an experimental treatment that can like help with your back issue or
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:04.300]   Whatever like you just look for any way shape or form that you can help that person
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:07.780]   Even if the only help you can give them is emotional support
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:12.660]   Sometimes you you just you have nothing and you just go that sounds really hard
[00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:14.700]   But if you ever just want to vent, you know
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:18.940]   Just holler at me feel free to write me a three-page email about something and I will just you know
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:22.660]   Just bounce it off me, right and if you're friends with that person, it's not weird
[00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:28.300]   If it's a stranger on the Internet, it's freaking weird. But like if you have a real relationship with those people, right?
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:35.100]   Sometimes just letting someone vent and going, you know what though like here's this awful thing that happened to me three years ago
[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:38.060]   And I'm fine now. So there is light at the end of the tunnel
[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.540]   Let me know how I can ever help sometimes people go
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:44.720]   Damn that felt good because they can't complain to their family their families relying on them
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:48.740]   Their friends have already heard every complaint in the book or they have worse troubles, you know
[00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:52.020]   So being able to vent sometimes is just that's support enough
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:58.020]   So there's there's like tactical support where it's like I come over and help you move. There's emotional support where I'm like, oh
[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:03.980]   Man, you're moving. What a pain. I've moved like 18 times. It's the worst let you vent about it. Get back to work
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.980]   and then there's sort of like
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:08.020]   actual
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:14.620]   Sort of network based support where I'm like, oh you're moving. I've got movers that don't steal. They're insured they show up on time
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:19.660]   Do you want to use them? Are you having trouble finding somebody that type of thing is all
[00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:27.820]   That is all helpful, right and people only think about the one which is well crap you're moving. Don't call me now
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:29.460]   I pick up a
[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:35.260]   Refrigerator, you know so that if you start if you stop looking at it in those limited constraints of what can this person do for?
[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:36.900]   Me and what do I have to do for them directly?
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:40.980]   but instead you're thinking of how can I help them and you know full stop and
[00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:46.080]   Who do I know that can aid that it doesn't have to be me now
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:51.220]   you're you're your whole horizon is massively broadened for what you can do for other people and
[00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:53.340]   Then it will come back to you
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:56.740]   And I know a lot of people who are like kind of new to this stuff might not believe that
[00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:01.860]   But if you just think about the way that you behave as a human you want to help other reciprocity
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:08.860]   So you want to help people that help you and this isn't some like the universe provides like no the universe doesn't give it to
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:12.180]   Craps about you, but reciprocity is a human trait, right?
[00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:16.860]   And so if I help you with a bunch of stuff and you happen to know how you can help me back
[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:22.300]   You will literally do it to make yourself feel better. Yeah, unless you're a sociopath in which case, you know, right?
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:25.180]   Yeah, you can't fake it. All this stuff is costly
[00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:28.020]   It takes time to think about other people it takes time to think about
[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:32.580]   What you can do it takes time to write an email of introduction takes time to make a call
[00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:37.420]   It takes time to love your wife and to wash the dishes and rub her back
[00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:41.380]   It takes time to play with your children. All this stuff takes time
[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:47.020]   You cannot fake it, but if you look at people and you watch their trajectory of success
[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:52.460]   There are some very simple habits and practices and those who do them consistently
[00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:59.780]   It's costly but over time the trajectory of their lives is very very different exactly. Yeah, so
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:02.500]   Art of charm. What do you talk about?
[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:07.420]   Who's it a good fit for go over your courses kind of your social this this course that you just develop
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:11.140]   It's not the only thing that you guys are doing. It's not yet social capital is brand new
[00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:15.180]   It's about exactly what we just discussed networking relationship development
[00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:19.540]   How to create strong networks around you digging that well before you're thirsty, etc
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:25.500]   We also teach the the skill sets of like body language nonverbal communication
[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:29.800]   How to get people to trust and like you we have our live programs in LA
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:34.100]   So right now guys flying from all over the world. So we have guys literally this week from like
[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:40.220]   Denmark Germany the you all over the US and Canada and like a dude from Israel which you know
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:43.900]   It's super far and even Australia and that's this this month
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:47.560]   Not just this week and we do them every week in Los Angeles
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:50.260]   They're sold out a few months in advance and guys come in for five days
[00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:53.100]   They live at the school during this period of time
[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:58.920]   We change the way you sit stand walk talk how you network how you develop relationships how you talk with people
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:05.520]   Everything from like your eye contact to the way that you interact with others follow up communication
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:12.140]   Very nuanced personal stuff like we videotape you interacting with people and we're like see how you're leaning in like that
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:17.100]   Okay, we want a little bit less intensity. We want to add some humor here. Here's how you do that
[00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:20.120]   And other people it's the opposite right other people were like, whoa, whoa
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:24.940]   Whoa, you need to get in there and you know, right be less crazy because you're scaring everybody
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:28.360]   So we really tailor it we really tweak it and classes are really small
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:32.320]   And that's that's also the info for that is at the art of charm calm
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:35.540]   But mostly like you're listening to a podcast right now. You don't have to buy anything from me
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:39.240]   You can listen to the art of charm podcast. We've got like I think
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:41.160]   431
