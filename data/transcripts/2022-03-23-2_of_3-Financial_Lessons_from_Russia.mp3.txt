[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.180]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we talk about the financial lessons that you and I
[00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:25.360]   must learn from Russia.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.200]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.360]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.120]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.120]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.120]   I am your host.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.600]   And today we continue with part two of our three-part series on Russia.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.360]   Part one was talking about the financial lessons from Ukraine.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.160]   Part two is the financial lessons from Russia.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:57.200]   Part three, well, wait and see.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.200]   I won't make you wait too long.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.600]   I just was hearing my cue with the music and I needed to finish.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.080]   Part three is going to be the financial lessons from the United States.
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.200]   We're going to talk about the current situation in the United States.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:16.080]   I am proud to announce that today's podcast is brought to you by InternationalEscapePlan.com.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.800]   InternationalEscapePlan.com is my newest project, how to create a sensible international bug
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.080]   out plan to protect you against economic collapse, tyranny, war or anything else.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.360]   And as we talk about Russia, you're going to hear how relevant this is.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.360]   In fact, I was spending this last week launching our brand new Bitcoin Privacy Course at BitcoinPrivacyCourse.com.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.360]   Why not get a double out of my ad, right?
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.640]   Which has been a phenomenal reception and a wonderful part of the course.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.840]   If you haven't checked that out, make sure you go and check that out at BitcoinPrivacyCourse.com.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.080]   But I was planning to release this episode last week, but I had to get the course finished.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.160]   And so a bunch of you actually jumped into the course already.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.600]   But it is phenomenal.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.920]   And you're going to hear me talk about how it's why I created this after watching the
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.480]   situation is what I've been watching for years all around the world.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.640]   But in today's episode, we're going to talk about the lessons from Russia, not just about
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.720]   leaving.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.480]   But if you're interested in having a practical and sensible plan in case you ever had to
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.760]   get out of your country, a la Ukraine, a la Russia, a la United States, then I would encourage
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.400]   you to go to InternationalEscapePlan.com and take my newest course.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.960]   InternationalEscapePlan.com guaranteed massive value.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.000]   More on that in a little bit.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.360]   We're talking about this series of collapses, these series of crises, because I believe
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.400]   that they give us good lessons from each one.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.980]   Part one was Ukraine.
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.840]   And Ukraine is a war zone.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.760]   Now, I'm trying not to overstate how much of Ukraine is at war.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.120]   Of course, there is a lot of it, meaning, of course, the whole nation's at war, but
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.400]   where the actual action is.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.560]   I know people in Ukraine right now and I'm getting kind of on the ground reports.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.360]   And you can be even in big cities in Ukraine and things are still working.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.020]   But the point that I made in part one is that when you're dealing with the potential loss
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.160]   of life due to an active war, it's not a risk worth taking.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.500]   You must get out.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.120]   But what about Russia?
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.400]   Russia is extremely different than Ukraine because of what's actually happening.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.800]   And I am coming to think that for those of us who think about carefully the concept of
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.760]   disaster preparedness, for those of us who advise people on their money and diversification,
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.880]   etc., I'm coming to think that the situation in Russia is going to be our most important
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.940]   lesson because there are a lot of lessons for you and for me.
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.440]   The challenge that we have, and I say we because most of the Radical Personal Finance listening
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.760]   audience is from the West.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.200]   By far, the vast majority of us in the audience are Americans, followed by Canadians, and
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.000]   then it's people from the UK and from Germany, a little bit of us and Australia.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.880]   Those are the top five countries that are represented.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:08.920]   And so for most of us, the problem with thinking about big scale disaster scenarios is often
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.600]   we look and say, "It can't happen here.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.400]   It's not going to happen here."
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.240]   After all, places with hyperinflation are always either very old, like Weimar, Germany,
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.280]   or very foreign to us, like Zimbabwe.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.640]   So we say, "Even though it was recent, it's not going to happen here."
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.520]   And I think there's good reasons to believe that this makes those examples not real great
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.560]   examples that we should look to.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.280]   You don't hear me talk a lot about the hyperinflation in Zimbabwe because I don't in any way compare
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.680]   Zimbabwe and the Zimbabwean currency to something like the US dollar.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.920]   It's just a very poor comparison in my estimation.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.680]   But Russia is different.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.200]   Russia is very, very different.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.200]   And I think you see that in terms of the way that Russia has captured the world's attention
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.020]   and this current war in Ukraine has captured the world's attention.
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.520]   It's not that there haven't been lots of other wars, right?
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.520]   Tons of them over the last year.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.560]   It's active right now, but this one is different because of the scale.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.320]   So I want to begin by making two points that will seem like a paradox, but I believe it's
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.720]   important to consider both of them.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:23.680]   Number one, Russia is worth paying attention to because it is one of the clearest examples
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.680]   of what is going through.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.880]   It's one of the clearest examples that you and I have of a large modern nation state
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.860]   going through massive stress.
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.720]   Many people don't understand just how large Russia is.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.280]   You may be familiar with the idea that Russia is the largest country in terms of geographic
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.400]   territory in the world, which is true.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:51.880]   I think pretty sure continental Russia crosses 10 time zones, which is just enormously large.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.000]   So we know that Russia is geographically large, but Russia is very large in terms of its population
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.360]   as well.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:07.900]   Russia has something like 145 million people in its overall population, which is huge.
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:14.260]   In terms of population size, that would put Russia ninth in the world, right between Bangladesh
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.260]   and Mexico.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.980]   The largest population in the world, of course, is China with 1.4 billion people, India 1.3
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:20.980]   billion.
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:26.060]   They're the two huge winners in population by a factor of three, followed by the United
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.700]   States with about 332 million people.
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.540]   Indonesia is in number four place with 272 million people.
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:40.980]   Pakistan 225 million, Brazil 214 million, Nigeria 211 million, Bangladesh 172 million,
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:48.580]   followed by Russia with 145 million people, Mexico 126, Japan 125.
[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.380]   So Russia is on the top 10 in terms of population.
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:07:02.500]   A very large country geographically, a very large country measured by population as well.
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:08.300]   In addition, Russia has the capital city of Moscow, which is certainly the largest city
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:16.060]   in Russia, but more importantly, it is the most populated city in Europe by a very good
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:24.620]   margin, and it is really the only true mega city in Europe.
[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.060]   The city population is a little bit harder to estimate because you have to talk about
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:35.900]   the city limits or the urban area or the metropolitan area, but Moscow, Russia has something like
[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:43.380]   17 million people in the overall city population, which of course is not nearly as large as
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:50.420]   Tokyo with 40 million or Guangzhou with over 40 million or Shanghai or Jakarta, etc.
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:56.780]   Delhi is of course a huge city, but it is very comparable in some ways to New York City
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:05.140]   in the United States or to Osaka, Japan, Los Angeles, almost very similar to Los Angeles,
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.940]   a little bigger than Buenos Aires, a little bigger than Istanbul.
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:17.060]   So a huge world city and the only true mega city in Europe, which is I think extremely
[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.980]   important by context.
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:26.380]   If we go with the official population and city limits, Moscow has 12.6 million people
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.380]   in city limits.
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.340]   The city of London in the UK has 9 million people, so a very large city.
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:35.460]   And what's more important is that it's a very advanced city, beautiful skyline, sparkling
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:40.780]   skyscrapers, highways, malls, everything.
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.780]   From a cultural perspective, Russia of course has such an ancient culture.
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.100]   Good friend of mine, a Canadian who travels all over the world, used to work for the United
[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.100]   Nations.
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:54.340]   His comment to me, his son was, I almost went to Russia last year to see his son's, among
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:58.900]   other things, using it as an excuse, his son was graduating with a PhD from the Tchaikovsky
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:07.180]   Conservatory in Russia, which is a quite star-studded music conservatory.
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:12.700]   His son actually had gone from, had declined a scholarship to Juilliard in order to study
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.200]   at the Tchaikovsky Conservatory.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.580]   And so we were talking about it and his comment to me, after traveling all around the world,
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:23.100]   all around Europe, he said, "I think that Moscow is the most cultured city in Europe."
[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.340]   He says, "Of every city, it's the most cultured, the best city in every way."
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:31.140]   And of course that's one person's opinion, totally subjective.
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:36.220]   But to give you an idea that we're not talking here about the kind of culture or the kind
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.820]   of city that's foreign to you and me.
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.660]   We're talking about a huge city and a huge country.
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:42.660]   Now that's the strong case.
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:47.220]   And I want you to recognize this because this is something that we often don't think enough
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.620]   about when it comes to collapse.
[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.500]   I've made this point again and again with regard to Venezuela.
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:57.980]   When I was in college, my leftist college professors were continually trumpeting Venezuela
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:04.140]   as the paragon of success, pointing out how this is the richest country in South America.
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:09.300]   And look, they've been able to balance progressive values of caring for people with business
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.940]   success, et cetera.
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.820]   And so I was very clued into Venezuela early on and then watching Venezuela collapse utterly
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:22.260]   over the last 15 years and become a nightmarish place to be has shown me that, "Hey, if it
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.380]   can happen there, it can happen here."
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.660]   Similar thing with Moscow, right?
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:31.060]   We're dealing with a huge country and a huge city, very modern, advanced, the kind of society
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:35.980]   that you and I would probably be very comfortable in, if we had some language proficiency at
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.560]   least.
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.840]   We're not dealing with a grimy 1960s Soviet Union.
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:45.820]   We're dealing with a modern, well-developed city and infrastructure.
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.660]   Now that's the strong case.
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.540]   The flip side is important to comment on.
[00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:57.420]   I think that while sometimes we underestimate Russia and Moscow, et cetera, I think we often
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:04.860]   overestimate Russia and Moscow with regard to their overall economic situation.
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:14.220]   Now when we look at the... try to find comparisons of Russian economic strength to other countries
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:21.020]   in the world, it's a much more sobering picture.
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:28.220]   Because of the massiveness of the Second World associated with the Soviet Union, because
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:34.360]   the Soviet Union was truly a superpower for so long, and because Russia has inherited
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:40.540]   some of the legacy of the Soviet Union, some of that reputation, we often, I think, overestimate
[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:41.900]   the size of the Russian economy.
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:46.820]   After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia was completely decimated and extremely poor.
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:54.060]   To put it into context, Russia has an annual gross domestic product of something like 1.6
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.380]   trillion.
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:12:02.620]   That's certainly about 20 times smaller than the US gross domestic product, with about
[00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.180]   23 trillion of gross domestic product.
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:12.060]   And it's comparable in some ways to Canada, 2 trillion dollars of gross domestic product,
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:18.460]   Korea 1.8 trillion, Russia 1.6 trillion, I think Spain would come next.
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:25.620]   So in some ways, economically, from a total GDP perspective, Russia is analogous in size
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:31.180]   and strength to Brazil, Canada, Korea, et cetera.
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:38.780]   However, if we divide that into Russia GDP per capita, meaning how much per person, Russia
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:47.780]   is extremely low on the list, with friends like Malaysia, Bulgaria, China, just extremely
[00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.100]   low with the GDP per capita.
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:54.500]   Let's see, the UN estimate is about $10,000 per year.
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:13:00.100]   The IMF estimate is about $11,200 per year.
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:06.620]   So much, much less prosperous per capita than any of the leading wealthiest countries in
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:07.720]   the world.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.300]   So let's not overestimate Russia, but let's not underestimate Russia.
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:17.460]   As we go through this current crisis, I hope that you see that while Russia is not a perfect
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:23.340]   parallel for necessarily what you and I could theoretically face in the United States or
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:29.100]   in Germany or Russia, it's a pretty good place for us to learn our lessons.
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:34.500]   In the next episode in this series, I'll talk specifically about the United States, but
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.300]   we can learn something from Russia.
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:41.460]   So let's talk about what has worked and what is happening in Russia.
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:48.140]   First of all, what Russia is experiencing is all out economic warfare.
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:55.500]   The sanctions levied against Russia by so many of the leading countries in the world
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:01.260]   are the heaviest that I have ever seen of any country in my lifetime.
[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:10.900]   And those sanctions have been made even stronger by the voluntary actions of many companies
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:18.500]   to simply withdraw or shut down their operations or personally boycott Russia, even if they
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.720]   weren't officially sanctioned by a government.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:27.460]   This is something that is going to bear very careful study in the years to come.
[00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:33.860]   The Russian invasion of Ukraine is so universally condemned on a global basis that individual
[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:38.100]   companies are taking actions beyond what is required of them by their government.
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:46.140]   And these individual actions are potentially in some ways way worse than anything done
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.300]   by government.
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:52.620]   Let me give two examples that I think are going to prove to be devastating in the days
[00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.120]   and months to come.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:01.540]   Many countries around the world have completely closed their airspace to Russian airlines
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.700]   and airplanes.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:09.200]   That's devastating to the ability of these airlines to run various routes.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.860]   For example, you can no longer fly directly from Moscow to London.
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:13.860]   That's a big deal, right?
[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:18.180]   Because I would imagine that a lot of these big international flights were very significant
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.060]   in terms of profit centers for Russian airlines.
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.700]   The loss of airspace is a big deal.
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:29.500]   There used to be a flight from Moscow to Cuba, to Havana.
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:35.540]   But of course, that flight now, if it were to happen at all, has to take such a circuitous
[00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:41.020]   route to avoid all of the closed airspace that is just not really profitable and not
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.300]   feasible anymore.
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:49.620]   To have that aeroflot flight from Havana to Moscow.
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.060]   That's just the start of it, though.
[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:57.660]   There's all the other news with countries around the world repossessing airliners, actual
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:00.900]   airplanes that release to Russian airlines.
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:05.460]   What Russia has done, if my memory is right on the figures, they have something like 700
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:11.100]   to 800 airplanes that are registered to Russian airlines.
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:14.660]   But about 400 or 500 of them are leased.
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:19.100]   In order to keep their airplanes from being repossessed internationally, they've had to
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:26.840]   readjust all of their airplane fleets and designate those specific airplanes to domestic
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:31.700]   routes instead of international routes so that there's no danger of the airliners being
[00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:37.980]   repossessed by the leasing company due to that leasing company facing either government
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.980]   sanctions or facing an internal decision simply to not do business with Russian companies
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:42.980]   anymore.
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.940]   So, this is a big deal.
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:50.980]   But what's a bigger deal is that it's my understanding that Boeing has not only said,
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.580]   "We're not going to supply spare parts.
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.620]   We're not going to support these things."
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:17:05.720]   But they've even taken an action such as closing Russian access to the Boeing repair manuals.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.980]   When I saw the news of it, I thought, "Wow, I had never even considered that."
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.860]   But it makes all the sense in the world.
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:16.820]   If you think of an airplane, you have an extremely complex piece of machinery that will have
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:23.980]   a very detailed repair manual, a very detailed system for going through and fixing it.
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:31.900]   That repair manual can of course be more efficiently delivered and delivered at a higher quality
[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:37.860]   if it is electronic in nature rather than a physical paper book because then it can
[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:44.940]   be updated from a central source and the information in it can be more easily accessed.
[00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:51.140]   I've never been in an aircraft repair manual hanger or seen those systems, but it makes
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.220]   all the sense in the world to me that Boeing would say, "If you're going to be a mechanic
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:58.260]   working on our airplanes, this is the system," and they would charge some kind of licensing
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:03.460]   fee to keep it up to date, make sure that people have the best information, and that
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:08.140]   each airplane, each individual aircraft would have its own maintenance schedule, its own
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:11.300]   logs, everything maintained there in the system.
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.300]   That makes all the sense in the world to me.
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:19.500]   But then there's a massive vulnerability where now Boeing has cut off the Russian airlines
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:23.500]   and the Russian airplanes from access to that system.
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:30.600]   Some analysts posit that within a period of months, most of Russia's air fleet will simply
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:36.940]   be inoperable or at least it won't be able to be operated safely.
[00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:41.820]   That's a staggering impact when you think about it, not being able to gain access to
[00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:46.900]   parts, not being able to gain access to a repair manual.
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.500]   I want you to think about a situation in the West.
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:54.820]   Think about the car shortage that has happened over the last year and a half because of not
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:58.460]   being able to gain access to computer chips.
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:03.940]   Think about how massive the impacts of that have been on your ability to buy a new car,
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.580]   used cars, et cetera.
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.380]   The whole market has been changed.
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:10.940]   That market that has been changed in many other industries as well.
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:15.300]   Now crank that up by about five or 10, and of course I'm just making those numbers up,
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:19.540]   but much, much more severe, and that's the market that virtually every industry in Russia
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:23.740]   is going to be facing, meaning a complete disruption because of the inability to get
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:26.420]   spare parts, keep things going, et cetera.
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:27.900]   That's a big deal.
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:33.420]   The other one was that there are a lot of companies that produce equipment needed for
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:37.100]   the maintenance and repair of pipelines.
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:42.460]   Russia's primary source of income right now is selling energy products to the world, especially
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:43.460]   to Europe.
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:49.940]   Well, those pipelines are still flowing in order to supply Europe with gas, but they
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:56.500]   may cease to function simply due to lack of spare parts, or they may be severely hampered
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.980]   because you see this kind of dual fold set of sanctions.
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:05.100]   You see the official sanctions, and then you see all of the unofficial voluntary sanctions
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:09.180]   being exercised by individual companies.
[00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.820]   Now why am I laboring this point?
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:18.620]   It's because I think that when we consider situations that can affect us, in some ways
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.180]   we need to be more creative than we often are.
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:26.340]   I have a hard time being an American, talking from an American perspective and saying, "Oh
[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:30.340]   yeah, there's going to be economic crisis in the United States on a severe level," because
[00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:34.260]   of the economic powerhouse that is the United States.
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:42.060]   It's just a world of different economy versus any other place in the world.
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:45.660]   And so I have a hard time being a doom and gloomer and saying, "Hey, there's going to
[00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.980]   be massive levels of disruption."
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:53.540]   But what's interesting to me is observing how it's not just nation state actors who
[00:20:53.540 --> 00:21:02.500]   have power now, that if a country develops a bad reputation, that country can face significant
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:07.860]   problems by the private sector as well as by governments.
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:11.700]   I think this is important because, and I'm not going to labor on the United States, but
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:17.500]   when I think about the United States, I often wonder, okay, you have this mega power that
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:21.260]   basically in some ways controls the whole world.
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:26.500]   What will happen when other countries that are often embittered about what the United
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:32.260]   States does, how it throws its weight around, et cetera, what could happen if some of those
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:38.180]   countries start responding in a similar way to the United States or to Canada or to smaller
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.860]   countries that you and I might live in?
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.780]   It's interesting to think about.
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:46.500]   And I think that this will be a long-term trend as we're going to see more nationalism
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.620]   expressed.
[00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:53.780]   It seems to me that countries all around the world, or at least if I were the emperor of
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:58.980]   a middle-tier country, I would be looking at what's happening to Russia right now and
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.860]   say, this very well could happen to me.
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:07.440]   And we've got to make sure that we build our own national companies that aren't so dependent
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:12.860]   on the global markets, because if Boeing can cut them off, Boeing can cut us off.
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:19.420]   And since the way that this is done is not very predictable, we see these political winds
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:24.300]   changing frequently, the issues changing, we're in a kind of an unstable environment,
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:29.500]   I think there's going to be a rise of nationalism and people building companies and things that
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:35.460]   are more nationalistic, focused on the domestic market for national sovereignty and security.
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:39.820]   So we'll see if that comes to fruition or not, but I think it will probably happen.
[00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:44.060]   Let's now pivot and say, what is happening to you and your money if you are living in
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.060]   Russia?
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.260]   Because that will teach you and me what to do.
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:55.180]   So first of all, you're living in a society where things are not collapsing precipitously,
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:59.800]   but yet the long-term trend is not great.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:09.500]   It's very important to note that the current crisis in Russia is not in any way a total
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:10.500]   collapse.
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.520]   It's not a total economic collapse.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.260]   It's not Mad Max in any way.
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:19.300]   It's severe, but it's not riding around and shooting people in the streets and stealing
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.300]   what they have.
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:26.340]   And this is important to me because to me, what you see in Russia is a much more realistic
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:30.300]   disaster scenario that can happen in so many places.
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:36.220]   I have a fondness for dystopian fiction, apocalyptic dystopian fiction.
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.220]   I enjoy it.
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:43.500]   One of my favorite books is James Wesley Rawls' Patriots novel, a novel of the coming collapse.
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.580]   I enjoy a lot of the modern prepper novels that people write about.
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:51.740]   I find them interesting and enjoyable to read.
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:24:00.740]   But what I realized so clearly in the COVID, the economic crisis associated with COVID,
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:06.660]   the current crisis in Russia, the crisis in Venezuela, and studying more and more historical
[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:12.580]   accounts is that you cannot take your expectations of reality from a novel.
[00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:17.420]   It sounds silly to say it outright, like of course you can't, but you've probably done
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.580]   it just like I've done it.
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:27.500]   In order to keep a novel or a movie interesting, the writer of that story has to keep the plot
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.120]   moving.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:36.380]   Reality is much more mundane, much more banal, much more dreary and boring.
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.820]   And the collapse is not instantaneous.
[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:42.420]   The collapse takes a long amount of time to happen.
[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:47.300]   I point this out because in my experience, some people have a strange idea that they're
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:51.740]   going to know that the collapse is definitely here and they're going to race out and stock
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:56.460]   up at the last minute.
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:01.180]   There was a number of years ago, James Rawls, the author of that novel, he's been on the
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.740]   show a couple of times and I like Rawls.
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:09.060]   He wrote a course just basically designed around the idea of, hey, if you knew the collapse
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:12.900]   was happening tomorrow, what would be your last day shopping trip?
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.780]   Where you'd rush to the store and you'd stock up on, what would you do?
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:19.140]   And I thought it was a great, it's a great idea.
[00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.960]   If you knew there was a collapse happening tomorrow and you just had to go to Costco
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.180]   for one last trip, what would you do?
[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.180]   What would you get?
[00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:31.480]   And it's fun to think about, but I don't think it's realistic that it actually happens.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.900]   It does happen when there's a natural disaster or something like that.
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:37.220]   But an economic crisis, you're never quite sure that the crisis is happening.
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.340]   You're never quite sure that the collapse is actually coming on.
[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:41.740]   And that's what you see in Russia.
[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:46.420]   I've been following closely a number of Russian vloggers and YouTubers who are showing the
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.940]   situation.
[00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:51.120]   And from the outside, you're reading the news and you're saying, this is a collapse.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:55.100]   But from the inside, you're looking at it and saying, well, it's not so bad.
[00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:58.460]   And the reality is it's not so bad.
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:59.900]   Similar things with COVID, right?
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.820]   You're looking at the news and saying, oh, it's bad.
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:05.020]   But then you go to your local store, you're like, it's not so bad.
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.780]   Things are happening, but it's not so bad.
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:12.180]   And it's important because I view this as a lesson to say, you're probably never going
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:16.980]   to be quite sure that the collapse is here until it's gone.
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:20.260]   And then when you're in it so deep that you're sure it's there, it's probably too late to
[00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:22.420]   do much of anything.
[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:25.380]   So the Russian collapse is not a total collapse.
[00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:27.880]   Even something like Venezuela.
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.300]   This really sobered me when I started looking at Venezuela.
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:35.780]   You had a country that had a million percent inflation in a year, hyperinflation.
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:41.260]   And everything fell apart, except everything didn't totally fall apart.
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:44.140]   People lost weight, stuff became unavailable.
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:47.860]   They lost all the value of their money, but it didn't totally fall apart.
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.960]   And so recognize that you're always going to face this problem.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.380]   The vast majority of Russians have not fled their country.
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.140]   In my newest course, I talk a lot about this.
[00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.400]   Why don't people leave when they should?
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:05.180]   As we'll talk about, every single asset in Russia is imploding in value.
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.420]   You say, well, why didn't people leave?
[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:07.620]   Why don't they leave?
[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:11.340]   Well, because it's hard to know for sure if the collapse is coming.
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:15.620]   Just like prior to the Ukraine invasion, it was hard to know for sure if the army was
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.380]   going to invade.
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:22.420]   There was a long point where the world's intelligence, the US intelligence agencies and others were
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:23.900]   saying, they're going to invade.
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:24.900]   They're going to invade.
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.260]   We watched the news stories.
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:27.580]   All of the insight was there.
[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:28.580]   They're going to invade.
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.220]   They're going to be pulling up for weeks at a time.
[00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:31.700]   And then we're not sure.
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:38.260]   And very smart, well, you know, smart thinking analysts up until the very last minute were
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:41.860]   predicting that, no, they're not going to invade.
[00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:44.020]   And all that changed when they invaded.
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:50.100]   And then within a couple of days, it was illegal for men, fighting age men to leave the country.
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.940]   Everything started to shut down, et cetera.
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:59.700]   So recognize that here we are watching a collapse of Russia.
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:03.460]   But you can go on YouTube and you watch people showing the videos that it's not a collapse
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.520]   like in the movies.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:09.980]   Don't expect a collapse to be like what's in the movies.
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:12.380]   It's not going to be like that.
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.180]   The roads are still working.
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:16.100]   People are still going to work.
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:18.740]   Nobody's having all their credit card debt canceled in Russia.
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.940]   You know, you got these preppers who go out and say, well, I'm just going to take up hundreds
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:24.880]   of thousands of dollars of credit card debt, and then I'm just going to not pay my debts
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:25.880]   in the collapse.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:26.880]   It's not happening.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.980]   It's not going to happen.
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:32.780]   So it's not a total collapse, but it is severe.
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:35.060]   Now, what is being affected?
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:40.420]   I would say all financial assets in Russia are being affected.
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:46.420]   So if you were a Russian and you were a wealthy Russian, let's not go to the level of an oligarch,
[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:50.460]   somebody who was a billionaire who had built wealth after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:58.460]   Let's just say you were a hardworking, upper class, upwardly mobile Russian citizen.
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:03.500]   Tell me what plan worked for you.
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.500]   Was it money in the bank?
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:11.420]   Well, what we see is an absolute collapse in the value of the ruble as measured against
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.860]   other currencies around the world.
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:19.100]   So money in the bank has not worked.
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:22.660]   And when you needed to go and get the money out of the bank, it's very hard to get out.
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:26.380]   You have a very significant loss of value.
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:32.180]   Not a total loss of value, but a very significant loss of value.
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:35.580]   You've had long lines at banks, ATMs.
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:36.580]   I was going to play a clip.
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:37.580]   Maybe I'll do it at the end.
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:38.580]   We'll see.
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:44.020]   But I was going to play a clip from a news story, and it's showing on the PBS news story
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:47.420]   from a few days ago, showing a line at a city bank.
[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:49.860]   And then here they are in the middle of the day, and they have to come out and close the
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:51.660]   bank because they ran out of cash.
[00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.780]   So you can't even get your rubles out of the bank in that situation.
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:58.940]   And those rubles have massively devalued compared to other things.
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:01.700]   So the money itself is not stable.
[00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:02.700]   What about the stock market?
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.980]   Is the stock market in Russia a good source of value?
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:08.780]   Well, the answer is no.
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:14.340]   Obviously, depending on what company, you had a complete collapse in the value of shares.
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:16.660]   You go and you look at the value of the shares, you get a complete collapse.
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:18.620]   Then the market was closed.
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:20.780]   So the market has been closed for weeks now.
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:22.940]   There's no clear plan of it reopening.
[00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:25.140]   We'll see if and when it does reopen.
[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.100]   But your shares are not saleable.
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.660]   You might have an account statement that says you still own these shares, but the market
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:36.660]   is closed and your shares are worthless.
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:37.660]   What else?
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:38.660]   What about hard assets?
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:44.100]   Well, real estate is something that many people would think would protect them.
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:49.340]   One of the things that I observe about real estate is, although it's a better store of
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:55.140]   value, it's still not great in the current environment, at least in the short term.
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:56.140]   Why?
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:00.540]   Well, number one, there's a massive increase in the supply of houses for sale all across
[00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:06.480]   Russia because many people are trying to liquidate their Russian assets and get out.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:14.480]   In addition, this is driving a decline in demand.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:18.140]   Russia has a major demographic problem.
[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:25.300]   Like many countries that we're from, Russia's population is shrinking and it's predicted
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.460]   to shrink significantly.
[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:32.940]   This is one of the reasons why I think President Putin had to act now if he was going to accomplish
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:38.820]   his ambitions of expanding and rebuilding and fortifying the Russian empire, is that
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.460]   he's facing a demographic crisis.
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:45.580]   And if he waits much longer, he's not going to have enough soldiers to populate his armed
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:50.180]   forces to go and successfully invade his neighbors.
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:54.140]   But what this is also showing is that there is a decreasing demand in housing because
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:32:00.140]   you have a country that is difficult to immigrate to, not friendly to immigrants, has not tried
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:06.940]   to attract immigrants outside of the Eurasian economic zone anyway, and a declining population.
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:13.180]   And so the actual fundamental demand for real estate is significantly lower.
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:17.660]   Another reason the demand is low is, as I said, that people are leaving now.
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:23.660]   And now the prospects for success in Russia have massively diminished.
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:29.000]   Thus, in the long run, there's going to be even lower of a demand for real estate.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.260]   If people wanted to immigrate to Russia before, which was not unknown, I've known people who
[00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:38.980]   I myself have thought about moving to Russia, not taking serious action on it.
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:40.180]   They've got a great tax program.
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:43.340]   They had a 13% flat tax.
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:48.380]   They've got a lot of things, as I said, cultured city, lots of opportunities, reasonable prices,
[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:55.520]   nice people, lots of good reasons to consider immigrating to Russia and using it as a base
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.600]   to be based from.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:02.240]   But now, based upon the Russian actions, the vast majority of people who ever considered
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.460]   it will simply not consider it now for very good reason.
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:09.120]   They're not going to go to Russia.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.620]   Other problems with the real estate.
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:18.420]   Well, in the middle of the crisis, you have an absolute collapse in the employment market.
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:23.780]   As the country, as the companies pull out, you have tens of thousands and tens of thousands
[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:28.180]   and tens of thousands of people who are now out of work.
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.180]   What do those people do?
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:32.780]   Well, they don't have any money, which means they're going to be spending less money.
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:34.940]   The economy is going to shrink down.
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:40.260]   They're going to be depending more on family members to support them in their time of need.
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:45.380]   So those family members, previous luxury spending that they would have given is now going to
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:49.780]   be dedicated to more essentials to support their family members.
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:53.940]   And you're going to continue to have a massive contraction of the economy, which means that
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:57.820]   in and of itself, you're going to have less demand for real estate.
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:02.980]   People are going to be sharing more housing, moving in together, trying to cut costs in
[00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:04.900]   every way possible.
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.720]   And part of that is going to mean not having your own apartment.
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:14.180]   So even real estate, though it's a hard, tangible asset, even real estate in and of itself is
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:17.460]   still not, it's not performing.
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:21.460]   It may preserve some wealth, but it's not performing.
[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:24.020]   So what can work?
[00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:27.700]   What is working right now in Russia?
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:33.860]   The first thing that is working is geographic diversification.
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:41.140]   Any Russian who didn't have all of his chips in Russia has been able to keep his assets
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:45.180]   that were outside of Russia pretty much as things were.
[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:52.660]   So any Russian that had a bank account in the United States, in Switzerland, in London,
[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:57.780]   in the Caribbean, any Russian who had a bank account, especially and most importantly,
[00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:04.180]   a bank account in foreign currency, has been able to maintain his bank balances because
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.340]   of his foreign currency exposure.
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:12.340]   As long as he hasn't been targeted by an oligarch and had his stuff forcibly taken, any normal
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:20.460]   Russian has been able to maintain at least the value of his wealth in bank accounts abroad.
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:24.660]   Notice that there have been sanctions on Russians.
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:29.100]   And most of these sanctions at the moment have been kind of high level targets, but
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:33.900]   there have been major new restrictions imposed on ordinary Russians, ordinary Russians with
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:40.740]   nothing to do with the Russian government, with the oligarchy, etc.
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:47.100]   So if you can avoid that, which is a big if, if you can avoid that, then you have been
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:53.460]   able to maintain some of your assets held abroad.
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:57.220]   So bank accounts in other countries have been fine.
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:04.020]   Notice that it hasn't really mattered what country your bank accounts were in.
[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:13.740]   So it's not like, as the Russian ruble has collapsed, there has been no knock on contagion
[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:16.380]   that has affected every other European country.
[00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:21.460]   A bank account in Jersey or in Switzerland has been just as, or in Portugal, has been
[00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:24.900]   just as good as a bank account in the United States or in any other place.
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:26.700]   It's just a bank account.
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:32.500]   And if any other foreign currency has been fine, it's just the ruble that has collapsed.
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:37.540]   So people often get bent out of shape and they say, well, Joshua, what country has the
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:38.540]   best banking in the world?
[00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:42.980]   Well, you can answer that objectively, but depending on where you are, it really doesn't
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:43.980]   matter.
[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:44.980]   Almost any other country.
[00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:50.380]   You just need some diversification from your home country where you work, where you live,
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:54.660]   where you make your money, and you need some, a bank account in some other country and you
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.900]   need some other currency.
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:00.540]   So that's the first thing is bank accounts abroad have sort of worked.
[00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:02.180]   What hasn't worked about those bank accounts abroad?
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:04.540]   Well, getting the money back in.
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:10.820]   So your debit card from a foreign bank faces serious problems being used in Russia.
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:14.660]   It's my understanding, although it's been hard for me to verify all the details, Russians
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:19.580]   are doing fine in terms of using their cards inside of Russia.
[00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:21.620]   They've had to adjust and change the systems.
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:26.580]   They're bringing in a Chinese system, but the internal systems are still working for
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.380]   digital bank management.
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:32.020]   But Russia is being cut off and isolated from the rest of the world.
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:41.300]   So by the way, forgive me if this is pedantic or too long, but I want to show you as I've
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.660]   been working on this stuff, none of this is new.
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:46.460]   I've been talking about this the entire history of radical personal finance and I've worked
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:47.620]   through these problems.
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:51.060]   I want to show you the problems and show you the solutions and why I'm more convinced than
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:57.060]   ever that the solutions that I've been telling you about for years and that I teach at internationalskateplan.com,
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.220]   these solutions work.
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.340]   They're working right now for Russians.
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:04.540]   So a Russian who had a bank account abroad was able to retain his wealth and the Russian
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:10.620]   who was able to leave Russia and use his debit card from his bank account abroad has been
[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:13.720]   able to use, maintain his spending power.
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.380]   What about investments?
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:21.500]   Well once again, investments in markets outside of Russia, those investments have held their
[00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:24.100]   power.
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:28.260]   Russian who has an investment account in the US stock market doing the same as all the
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:30.380]   rest of the people with an account in the stock market.
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:37.340]   A Russian who has stock accounts on other markets has been doing fine.
[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:39.080]   So no problems there.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:40.260]   Everything works.
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:44.540]   And if he can get the money in and out, which is difficult, it works.
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:47.380]   Third thing that has worked, physical assets.
[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:52.020]   Importantly, physical assets such as precious metals.
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:57.380]   Now here's where I think we see the problem with precious metals.
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:04.580]   In my understanding, there aren't any Russians who are currently going out and using gold
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:10.380]   and silver coins to buy and sell loaves of bread.
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:14.180]   The ruble is still the currency of choice.
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:27.060]   But precious metals will maintain their value if the Russian can find a suitable buyer.
[00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:34.740]   So here, you're not really going to see precious metals used as daily currency.
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:39.060]   That is not happening and did not happen in Venezuela.
[00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:44.340]   It hasn't happened in any economic collapse that I've been able to find.
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:45.500]   That's not the world that we live in.
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.940]   You still need the electronic money and you still wind up using the currency.
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:53.360]   In Venezuela, even though the boulevard has completely collapsed, they still use it in
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:57.940]   bundles and bundles, packed in backpacks, but you still use it or use a Colombian peso
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:03.700]   or the Brazilian real or US dollars, small denomination US dollars.
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:05.260]   Nobody's doing business with gold and silver.
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:10.100]   But what the gold and silver can do is they can maintain value because the gold and silver
[00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:13.780]   can still be converted either for valuable local items.
[00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:17.540]   And if you're working with wealthy people, that still has value.
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:22.420]   And if you're working abroad and your gold and silver is abroad, then you can convert
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:26.060]   that into foreign currency, which is spendable when you need it.
[00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:31.140]   And so I think precious metals in terms of protecting some wealth and serving as an insurance
[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:37.960]   hedge for some wealth, I think they are really working and are good for the long term.
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:42.060]   They're not subject to the same stress that real estate is.
[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:46.980]   And because they're much more portable, they can potentially be more flexible.
[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:52.020]   Now, again, as I point out, the best place for those precious metals to be is not inside
[00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:53.100]   Russia.
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:58.780]   The best place for those precious metals to be is stored in a vault in another country
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:01.220]   outside of the primary country.
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:07.620]   That's why I teach in my newest course, internationalskateplan.com, we go extensively over precious metals.
[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:11.420]   And you should have some precious metals close to you.
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:15.020]   But the majority of your precious metals, if they're large holdings, should be held
[00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:19.540]   in a foreign vault.
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:22.960]   What's the next thing that is working right now?
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:29.300]   What's working right now for Russians is Bitcoin.
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:33.880]   Any Bitcoin holdings, even though the Russian government has placed restriction, the Bitcoin
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:38.380]   marketplace has not collapsed because the ruble collapsed.
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:44.060]   And yet the Bitcoin marketplace is solving the problem for getting money back and forth,
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:47.860]   especially in a time of financial sanctions.
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:51.940]   All over the world, you have the Russian diaspora.
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:56.020]   You have Russians all around the world trying to figure out how do I send money to mom and
[00:41:56.020 --> 00:42:01.000]   dad, or grandma and grandpa, or my distant cousin so and so.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.500]   If Western Union won't get you the money, and I can't transfer it into their bank account
[00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:10.260]   because all the banks are cut off, what remains?
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:15.860]   Either your mailing dollars, or euros, or francs, or rubles or something, which isn't
[00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:18.540]   going to work across borders.
[00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:21.100]   Mailing money works great inside of a country.
[00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:24.540]   It does not work across international borders.
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:26.020]   Or you're finding electronic system.
[00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:30.700]   But how do you find an electronic system that allows you to transact when you're cut off
[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:33.300]   from dollars and dollars can't flow to Russia?
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:41.300]   Well, thus you see the rise of Bitcoin, and it's working.
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:44.340]   Very important point there.
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:48.220]   And privacycourse.com, of course, will teach you how to own it anonymously.
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:52.660]   Hope you don't mind the excessive advertisements, but I'm building out a suite of courses, which
[00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:56.020]   I've been planning to do for a long time, but it's solving these problems in a systematic
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:57.380]   way that I can't do in a podcast.
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:02.740]   And I'm showing you why I'm teaching you how to do it this way.
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:03.980]   What else is working?
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:09.900]   Well, if you can maintain your business, and you can maintain your job, then you're in
[00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:14.620]   good shape, or at least you're in better shape.
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:17.780]   If you can't maintain your business, and you can't maintain your job, then you have to
[00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:24.220]   go somewhere where you can maintain your business and where you can maintain your job.
[00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:28.980]   The biggest, when we get past financial assets, these are the ways that I see the financial
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:32.900]   assets being maintained.
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:34.900]   I don't see any big growth anywhere.
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:36.220]   I'm not aware of anybody.
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:40.420]   Maybe there'll be some big investment story, but we're just trying to preserve your wealth.
[00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:45.340]   The way you preserve your wealth is through diversification, and especially through international
[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:46.660]   diversification.
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:50.540]   So that if the country that you live in, and you work in, and you earn your money in, if
[00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:57.580]   that country implodes on some kind of national level, at least you're not entirely run by
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:58.580]   that country.
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:07.740]   At least you have some foreign currency abroad, some gold abroad, some Bitcoin held in a way
[00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:14.660]   that is safe, kind of sort of abroad, some assets abroad, et cetera.
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:19.060]   But then fundamentally at its core, you want to be able to create income.
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:23.900]   So all over Russia, there are people who are having their income cut off.
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:29.140]   This ranges from people making their living online, cut off from Patreon, cut off from
[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:30.140]   AdSense revenue.
[00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:34.540]   They're being cut off, and so all of their online money that they were making is being
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:37.740]   cut off, and they can't get it into themselves.
[00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:42.700]   In some cases, they can still get it into a bank account in another country, but they
[00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.740]   can't really get it into Russia.
[00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:45.740]   That's a major problem.
[00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:48.900]   You have a guy who says, "Hey, I've built this great YouTube channel showing videos
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:51.020]   of Russia, and now my income is cut off.
[00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:53.500]   I can't get it into the country."
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:58.900]   There may be solutions in the days to come, but it's difficult right now.
[00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:01.620]   So it's a disaster for people earning money outside the country.
[00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:06.220]   Then there are lots of people who are more normal situations.
[00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:08.140]   You got a guy who works as a programmer.
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:10.540]   I've seen and followed people who just lost their jobs.
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:13.620]   "Yeah, we don't want to employ Russians right now," because you're in Russia.
[00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:15.780]   It doesn't matter that you have nothing to do with the government.
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:16.780]   You're a programmer in Russia.
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.740]   We don't want to employ you.
[00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:21.380]   And so you have people losing their jobs there.
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:25.940]   And then you have the total economic crisis of a more, what I'll call run-of-the-mill
[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:28.080]   but severe economic crisis.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:34.860]   All the stuff that we're accustomed to, high unemployment, recession, people not having
[00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:39.300]   work, economic malaise, no growth, too many people applying for every job, decline in
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:45.100]   the value of wages because employers have low revenue, low profitability, and they have
[00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:49.080]   lots of people applying for jobs, et cetera, just that general economic malaise.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:51.900]   So what is the best solution for that?
[00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:57.980]   The best solution there is to leave where the crisis is and go to a place where the
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:45:59.980]   crisis is not.
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:07.920]   So any Russian who has a work permit in Canada or a green card in the United States or a
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:16.500]   dual citizenship in Panama or anything else, if that Russian can go to another country
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:23.560]   that's not experiencing the severe economic crisis, then there's possibly a better opportunity
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:29.480]   to be able to earn money to support himself, to support his family, both with him and back
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:34.160]   in Russia through figuring out how to get remittances back.
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:36.320]   But you have to have that work permission.
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:40.980]   And so that's where we get into the concept of residencies, having a residency that offers
[00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:46.900]   work permission in another country, multiple citizenships, having work rights due to citizenship
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:48.740]   in another country, et cetera.
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:54.520]   And what I think is so important to observe is that right now, all of the trends that
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:47:03.040]   I talked about where countries are opening up for Ukrainian refugees, all those same
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:10.240]   countries and all those same trends are going exactly against Russian refugees.
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:13.800]   In the show that I did on Ukraine, I talked about how the neighboring countries of Ukraine
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:18.760]   have opened their doors just beautifully to the fleeing refugees, both at the national
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:24.160]   level with government policy, as well as even at the local level, people in a Berlin train
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:28.180]   station going down to meet the trains and holding signs saying, "I can take a mother
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:29.640]   and two babies home with me."
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:36.560]   It's a beautiful outflowing of love towards the Ukrainian refugees, and rightly so.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:41.120]   All of those trends are exactly against Russian refugees.
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:48.920]   Because Russia is in this context so clearly the aggressor, and Ukraine is so clearly in
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:48:00.880]   this context the victim, all of the same sympathy for Ukrainians is galvanized into hostility
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.960]   against Russians.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:12.560]   Regardless of any individual actions on the behalf of any Ukrainian or any Russian.
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:16.520]   Individual Ukrainian citizens and Russian citizens have nothing to say about the doings
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:17.840]   of their government, right?
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:20.560]   They have nothing to do with the war.
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:21.840]   War is a racket.
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:22.840]   It's a racket.
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:28.000]   It's a game that rich men play with the blood of poor people's children.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.520]   The average Russian and the average Ukrainian have nothing to do whatsoever with the war
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:36.040]   in any sense, and they want nothing to do with any of it.
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:45.000]   But if you are unfortunate enough to be associated or allied with that government that is currently
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:50.600]   not in favor, then your life can be affected dramatically.
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:55.520]   And so in the same way that the European Union is opening up new programs to allow temporary
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:49:00.040]   residents with working rights for Ukrainian refugees, et cetera, all of those same doors
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:04.160]   are slamming shut for ordinary Russians.
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:08.640]   You've had a significant number of countries that have come out and said, "We're not giving
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:13.960]   any kind of tourist visas to Russians," which is to be expected, right?
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:19.520]   Countries don't want people coming in as tourists and then choosing to squat and overstay their
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.880]   tourist visas.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:28.960]   And so you have ideological closure of visa programs for tourists as well as official
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:30.560]   closure.
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:32.600]   What I mean is some countries...
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:33.600]   I saw that...
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:34.600]   What was it?
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:35.600]   Croatia...
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:36.600]   Not Croatia.
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:37.600]   Yeah, no, it was Czech Republic.
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:40.960]   Czech Republic said, "We're not issuing any visas to Russian citizens at all on tourist
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:41.960]   visas."
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:43.720]   So that's an administrative point.
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:45.600]   There's other countries as well.
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:50.360]   But then practically speaking, a Russian who wants to go into another country will face
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:52.960]   much more serious scrutiny.
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:54.040]   Do you have the money?
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:55.480]   Do you have the money to support yourself?
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:56.880]   Are you sure you're not here working?
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:58.760]   Are you sure you're going to leave?
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:02.280]   Because anybody looking at that individual citizen would say, "Well, there's a much higher
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:08.200]   chance that a Russian tourist coming in now is possibly going to overstay his tourist
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:10.680]   visa and stay and squat in our country."
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:13.520]   And so you have much bigger hurdles.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:19.000]   And then you have a complete closing of all the doors to Russians of various immigration
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   programs.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.200]   It's my understanding that all of the Caribbean citizenship by investment programs are now
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:25.160]   said we're not currently taking Russians.
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:29.040]   Many of the residency by investment programs or residency programs said we're not taking
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:30.040]   Russians.
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:35.480]   You had many countries that have been friendly to Russians among other as well as on the
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:41.960]   same level as anyone else specifically saying we are no longer working with Russian people.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:48.380]   And this is really unfortunate if you wind up being a person who is from that country
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.960]   that's currently not in favor.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:57.000]   Again, don't look at Russians and think that, "Well, those Russians, of course they're in
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   favor.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.080]   They voted for Putin."
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:00.600]   Don't look at Russians that way.
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:03.120]   That's you and me.
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:06.240]   That's you and me.
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:11.800]   I find it very much within the realm of possibility that the actions of my own government, the
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:17.200]   American government, which are just horrifically immoral, more war crimes committed and more
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:21.960]   bloodshed around the world over the last couple of decades than any other country in the world,
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:26.480]   I find it very reasonable to think that I would be judged just like a Russian based
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:28.360]   upon the actions of my government.
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:31.760]   At the moment, it just so happens that the places where all that bloodshed has, no one
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:33.000]   really cares about.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.400]   And it just so happens that the United States is so big and so powerful that it's a big
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:42.200]   price for countries to discriminate against Americans.
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:47.560]   Although there certainly are certain countries that do, as is their perfect right to do so.
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:55.480]   My point to you is, if you're that Russian and you have the misfortune of being embroiled
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:52:05.120]   or entangled in this unpleasant association, now everything is much more difficult.
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:10.480]   And so this is where you need multiple nationalities.
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:14.800]   You need multiple places you can go to work.
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:18.480]   And you need multiple skill sets that can be applied in different places so that you
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:21.980]   can still earn money to support your family.
[00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:30.160]   Notice again that it doesn't have to be necessarily in the same way that the Russian could protect
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:35.680]   his income or his bank accounts by their being in another country, as long as they weren't
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:41.760]   confiscated, in the same way that it was almost any country was good.
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:48.320]   You have the same basic expression where for the Russian citizen, almost any other second
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:49.320]   citizenship is good.
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:52.160]   It doesn't have to be the world's greatest citizenship.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:59.000]   It doesn't have to be Canadian or American or German or UK.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   Obviously there's benefits of those big, fancy, powerful countries.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.160]   But really it could be any other citizenship.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.960]   Belarus.
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:18.000]   Belarus is certainly very much entangled with the Russian situation.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:23.480]   But any person who held dual citizenship with Russia and Belarus, which was much easier
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:24.720]   than many other nations.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:31.440]   Belarusians, it's my understanding that Belarusians had a very fast access to Russian citizenship
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:34.960]   and a lot of cooperation.
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:42.760]   Any person who had both of those under the Belarus identity, they could escape less scrutiny.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:47.520]   Very few people, very few employers, very few banks have a clue even where Belarus is
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:49.280]   or anything about it.
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:54.000]   And so although the geopolitical class certainly understands that Belarus and Moscow have a
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:59.780]   very close relationship, that's not common knowledge globally.
[00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:06.120]   So if you had a Russian and a Belarusian passport or nationality identification, that would
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:07.640]   be pretty good.
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:18.120]   Or there's any number of other countries where there's a high degree of connection with Russian
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:24.640]   culture or friendlier to Moscow, and any one of those countries is as good as any other
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:28.380]   for a Russian who needed a second nationality.
[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:34.680]   So you don't have to just be from the UAE or Singapore or one of these from Luxembourg,
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:37.300]   right, a rich, successful country.
[00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:43.820]   It's almost any other country is good to minimize the stigma of that nationality.
[00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:46.480]   We often don't appreciate how important this is.
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:51.200]   Go back to the apartheid era in South Africa.
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:57.440]   And the way that that came about is basically South Africa became a global pariah on the
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:03.980]   world stage, and South Africans faced severe opposition and discrimination based upon the
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:07.040]   system of apartheid that was in the country.
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:13.280]   In the same way, it didn't really matter if they had the world's best second nationality,
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:16.360]   it just mattered that they had something else.
[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:23.720]   So if you don't have a second citizenship, a second nationality, you see now why it matters.
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:28.040]   More importantly, I think for most people, or at least more accessibly, not more importantly,
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:32.900]   but more accessibly, notice again, residency visa.
[00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:37.900]   Residency visa with right of employment and the skills to go to another place and earn
[00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:38.900]   a living.
[00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:44.960]   Today, you and your country, as long as it's not Russia, you have the world's options available
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:45.960]   to you.
[00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:49.100]   So many places that you can go, you can get a residency visa, you can have the right to
[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:54.420]   work there, you can establish connections to the country, etc.
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:57.980]   And even if you never used it, knowing that you could go to another place and legally
[00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:01.340]   earn a living for your family is such a valuable thing.
[00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:03.660]   That's what I want you to see is how it works.
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:08.940]   Even if your whole wealth was destroyed in Russia, if you have the ability to go somewhere
[00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:12.380]   else and work, then you are in pretty good shape.
[00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:16.020]   Or if you had skills that you could figure out how to market, then you can get through
[00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:17.020]   this thing okay.
[00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:25.860]   The third and final thing that I want to point out is that prepping works in Russia.
[00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:28.260]   All of the basic preparedness system, it works.
[00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:32.820]   I don't think it works as well as the idea of going to another place, but I think it
[00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:34.180]   does work.
[00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:44.380]   My favorite pithy example of this comes from a YouTube channel that I have started watching
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:47.380]   to try to get an idea of what's happening in Russia.
[00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:53.740]   The channel and the host of it is named Dan Shekoz.
[00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:55.860]   He seems like an ordinary everyday Russian guy.
[00:56:55.860 --> 00:57:00.740]   He says I'm just an ordinary Russian guy and that he learned English from watching American
[00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:03.780]   movies and so he and his wife speak English.
[00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:07.540]   And soon after the imposition of sanctions, he posted a video.
[00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:09.380]   And the video title was called this.
[00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:15.260]   It said how are Russians going to survive under sanctions.
[00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:22.540]   The basic plot of the video was him driving to his parents-in-law's, wife's parents' house
[00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:27.540]   in a more rural country town and they spent a couple of days planting potatoes.
[00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:29.220]   I thought isn't that a perfect example?
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:32.260]   We're going to go plant potatoes.
[00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:37.900]   Potato is a miracle food, a miracle food that you can live basically exclusively on potatoes.
[00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:38.900]   It's amazing.
[00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:39.900]   It's easy to grow.
[00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:42.620]   You basically just pop potatoes in the ground and if the conditions are right, they grow,
[00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:43.900]   you harvest them, they store.
[00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:45.820]   It's just a wonderful food.
[00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:49.340]   And it was the perfect example of how are Russians going to survive.
[00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:50.940]   We're going to plant potatoes.
[00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:59.740]   The idea is if you have a house that doesn't have a mortgage on it that you can't pay because
[00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:00.740]   you lost your job.
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:03.940]   If you have a house.
[00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:08.740]   If you have the things in the house that you need to be comfortable, furniture, source
[00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:12.820]   of heat, source of cool, source of light, etc.
[00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:18.320]   You can probably figure out a way to make it even in a collapse.
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:22.940]   You can figure out a way to pay the power bill and if you got a little backup battery,
[00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:27.020]   a little kind of a secondary power system, you're in pretty good shape.
[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:31.380]   If you've got a way to cook some food, you're in pretty good shape.
[00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:32.860]   You can find food.
[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:38.020]   It can be grown in perhaps your backyard or there's somebody who will start growing it.
[00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:42.740]   And so that's where practical preparedness, meaning having things that are not connected
[00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:48.260]   to the financial system, can allow you to come through a crisis, a financial crisis
[00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:52.020]   and collapse in pretty good comfort.
[00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:59.260]   Although the value from a financial perspective of your real estate might decline due to the
[00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:03.660]   sanctions, due to the people leaving, etc.
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:05.140]   Meaning measured in financial terms.
[00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:07.620]   Again, I want to repeat so you understand exactly what I'm saying.
[00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:12.300]   Although the value of your real estate that you own might decline in dollar terms, in
[00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:16.840]   ruble terms, in euro terms, in whatever, peso terms, whatever.
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:21.900]   The value of your house that you live in does not decline just because fewer people want
[00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:25.300]   to buy it.
[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:30.300]   You can have a complete evaporation of your currency value today.
[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:37.380]   And the house that you live in will be just as valuable in terms of sheltering your family,
[00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:43.700]   keeping your family warm, keeping your family cool, keeping your family safe as it would
[00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:46.900]   be yesterday.
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:52.700]   So when I talk about preparedness, I always position it in this way.
[00:59:52.700 --> 01:00:00.560]   Financial preparedness is usually your best way because money works in all situations
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:03.420]   up until money doesn't work.
[01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:06.340]   And I know it sounds silly, but I mean something by it.
[01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:08.140]   That money works until money doesn't work.
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:11.960]   A financial collapse is not a societal collapse.
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:14.500]   It's a financial collapse.
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:19.220]   A financial collapse doesn't have to mean that your marriage collapses.
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:22.900]   Your marriage and your finances are two separate things.
[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:25.200]   They're certainly correlated and interrelated.
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:31.940]   You might have more difficult marital discussions if your finances are collapsing, but they
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:34.780]   don't have to be.
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:42.460]   You can have a financial collapse and come out the other side with a stronger marriage.
[01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:47.360]   So look at the world not just through a financial lens.
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:51.060]   How is this Russian family going to survive under sanctions?
[01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:53.420]   Well they're going to plant potatoes.
[01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:59.380]   And in that video they went to his in-laws house and it's just so funny because it's
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:05.860]   just a beautiful domestic scene of this elderly grandmother and grandfather and they're sitting
[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:14.980]   at the table having their breakfast and their tea and then they go out and grandpa is drinking
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:18.940]   and then they go out and start planting potatoes and grandpa does what he can but then he has
[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:26.540]   to stand back and watch and so you have this, Dan, you have him being the younger, healthier
[01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:30.300]   guy out planting and his wife is taking care of the baby and basically the point is that
[01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:33.260]   life goes back to the way it's always been.
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:38.380]   That even if there's a financial collapse, if you're prepared for that financial collapse
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:39.780]   then you don't have to flee.
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:42.340]   You don't have to go and try to figure out how to get out.
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:43.700]   That might be the best plan.
[01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:49.780]   I think in many cases it will be the best plan for many people but it's not necessary.
[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:51.780]   You can stay put.
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:57.900]   And what's so amazing about the world that we live in, more and more every day, you can
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:07.660]   take money of which its value is unstable, unpredictable, subject to international sanctions,
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:17.020]   subject to foreign currency risk, etc. and you can turn that money into useful goods.
[01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:23.020]   You can turn that money into sticks and bricks that keep your family warm and sheltered from
[01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:29.400]   the storms and you can pay off those sticks and bricks with the exception of your taxes.
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:32.780]   You can take your money and you can turn it into light.
[01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:38.260]   You can do that of course by paying your power bill but you can also do it by purchasing
[01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:40.140]   some things that run on batteries.
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:45.980]   I'm an aficionado of cool gear and we're living in a time in which you can get just amazing
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:52.020]   lighting systems with amazing batteries that last for years and are just wonderful.
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:58.660]   I have a backup lighting system in my house that means that if the lights go out and there's
[01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:08.560]   no electricity, we can live not quite as bright as we live on a daily basis but pretty close
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:11.460]   to it just on battery power.
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:15.580]   You can buy these nifty little things called solar panels that recharge those batteries
[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:22.060]   from the sun that falls on your house and it's not that expensive to do.
[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:24.980]   You can have a way to put water in your house.
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:28.100]   You can put a tank up so that you can fill up the tank and you have a water source and
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:32.380]   have a filtration system so your house can still work even if the grid goes down.
[01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:35.540]   It's pretty uncommon that a water grid goes down.
[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:39.780]   You go through the list and you can put in place the systems so that your family can
[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:48.620]   be well fed, food storage, gardening ability, maybe some animals for those who wish to take
[01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:50.660]   on that responsibility.
[01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:55.300]   You can make sure that your family is warm, backup sources of heat, etc.
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:04:00.620]   Your life can continue on even if there is a financial collapse.
[01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:02.300]   I think this is what most of us want.
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:09.360]   We want a life that is limited, where we don't have just constant worry.
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:12.700]   My emphasis here is to say that all of these things are accessible to you.
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:26.980]   If you look at Russia, I think you see a perfect example of how a financial collapse is simultaneously
[01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:34.660]   totally shocking and a big deal and not as big of a deal as I feared.
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:37.060]   It's a paradox.
[01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:45.460]   The sanctions and the effects on Russia right now are huge from an economic perspective.
[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:50.940]   For those who have wealth and are trying to preserve the value of their wealth, I've tried
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:53.140]   to show you how you do it.
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:58.300]   But then for those who don't have wealth, you can still preserve your living ability
[01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:06.460]   by recognizing that you need to diversify out of exclusively financial assets by building
[01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:14.180]   in local community, having relationships, by building in terms of physical structures,
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:20.660]   and then by making sure that you're insulated against the worst-case scenario.
[01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:24.580]   I don't rush out to tell people they should pay off their mortgages quickly because as
[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:28.580]   a financial advisor, when you've got mortgage rates at 3%, it's kind of hard to believe
[01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:32.540]   that you should rush to pay that off.
[01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:38.100]   On the other hand, when someone says I want to pay off my house, I've almost never told
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:52.940]   someone not to pay off a house because you can build more stability in your life and
[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:56.860]   that stability can be very valuable in good times and in bad times.
[01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:59.220]   I can't put that into an interest rate.
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:05.940]   The financial world should work the way that it is now, but if it doesn't, think about
[01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:08.540]   how to protect these other things.
[01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:22.060]   In closing, I would say that I've tried to point out what I see working in Russia, what
[01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:23.580]   I see not working.
[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:29.860]   If you would like to be prepared for a situation like you have right now in Russia, I've spent
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:35.900]   the last week putting all of this into a very careful, systematic, organized structure which
[01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:38.900]   is now available for you to buy.
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:43.940]   If you would like to do that, go to www.internationalscapeplan.com and let me explain to you what I have built
[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:45.020]   there.
[01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:48.220]   Most of the time when I do these ads, I'll make them fairly short, but I want you to
[01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:50.060]   know what's there.
[01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:54.940]   First thing I put is a very careful, phased approach into a plan.
[01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:58.260]   I've taken all the stuff that I've taught and that I've done for years and I've said,
[01:06:58.260 --> 01:07:02.700]   what is the most accessible way to do this with a minimum amount of time and a minimum
[01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:04.140]   amount of effort?
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:08.500]   Genuinely, I believe that the first step that you need is just to be able to walk out your
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:11.340]   door with a passport, a credit card, and a cell phone.
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:12.700]   That's phase one.
[01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:15.780]   The idea is you're going to walk out your door with a passport, credit card, and a cell
[01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:19.980]   phone and you're going to board a train to the next country or a flight to the next country
[01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:22.620]   and you're going to get out from a time of trouble.
[01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:27.940]   You see when I talked about Ukraine, you see how much of a big deal that is to make sure
[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:31.820]   that you're protected so that if the bombs start falling or the tanks start coming in,
[01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:35.900]   you can say, "Guys, we got to get out and get out fast."
[01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:38.860]   You don't need much, a passport, a credit card, and a cell phone.
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:40.940]   That's phase one.
[01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:45.180]   I give you some more detail of some other ways to make it better and more comfortable,
[01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:49.940]   but there's nothing more necessary than a passport, a cell phone, and a credit card.
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:53.500]   Then I say, "Well, let me tell you about that I think this will work in the most situations,
[01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:56.700]   but let me tell you about the times when I think this might not work and how you can
[01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:58.620]   make it more robust."
[01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:02.180]   Phase two, we talk about things like having a foreign residency.
[01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:05.380]   Instead of being a tourist in another country, you have a country that you can go and you
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:08.740]   have the legal right to live in, to work in.
[01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:11.260]   We talk about setting up bank accounts abroad.
[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:15.180]   You can go with a credit card, but if your credit card is drawn on a Russian bank and
[01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:19.340]   you're a fleeing Russian citizen, your Russian credit card is now going to have trouble working
[01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:20.540]   in the global financial system.
[01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:25.500]   It would be a lot better for you if in addition to your Russian credit card, you had a debit
[01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:30.860]   card or a credit card from a UK bank or from a Canadian bank or from some other country
[01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:32.140]   in the world.
[01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:34.580]   Then we go through about how to make it more robust.
[01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:39.380]   In phase two, I'm still not going to ask you to go abroad or to move or to leave or anything
[01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:40.380]   like that.
[01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:43.980]   It's just a matter of how can you put more redundancy in place.
[01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:50.780]   Then in phase three, we talk about how could you actually have another home.
[01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:55.420]   Because one of the things you can do if you're willing to invest the money and the time into
[01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:58.420]   it is go ahead and set up another home.
[01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:02.740]   I think right now, if you look at the world, you can see how nice it would be to have a
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:06.020]   home in another country that you could go to.
[01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:09.820]   Imagine you were a Canadian, you got sick and tired of living under these draconian
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:16.140]   COVID stuff that the Canadian government did because of their own incapacity and lack of
[01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:21.700]   hospital capacity and the collapsing medical system.
[01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:27.140]   Wouldn't it be nice if you had a second home in the Bahamas and you could go and live with
[01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:30.740]   relative freedom as a Canadian abroad?
[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:36.140]   Wouldn't it be nice if you were in a scenario where you said, "Hey, I'm not so sure if the
[01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:38.060]   Russians are going to invade or not.
[01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:42.180]   But I'll tell you what, let's go to our vacation house and let's just be out for a while, maybe
[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:46.380]   go for a couple of months and let's wait and see so we don't get caught in some kind of
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:49.980]   back last minute thing."
[01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:52.860]   Phase three is all about setting up a second home abroad.
[01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:56.500]   I think this is one of the best things that you can do for those with money.
[01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:58.500]   You can start to put it together in different ways.
[01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:01.540]   Now you have a second home, a place that you like to go.
[01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:04.140]   You can use the second home to get your residency permissions.
[01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:06.460]   You can use a second home to get your citizenships.
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:10.340]   You can use a second home as a base of operations for your financial infrastructure.
[01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:12.540]   This allows you to get out and go to another place.
[01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:16.740]   I always remember years ago, I used to love listening to talk radio.
[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:20.900]   I think the best example of this would be when you've got a job where you've got to
[01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:23.260]   keep going, you need to get out of a disaster zone.
[01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:24.420]   I used to listen to Rush Limbaugh.
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:31.000]   Rush Limbaugh had his famous Southern Command down in Palm Beach, Florida where I lived.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.380]   When there'd be a hurricane coming, Rush would never stay in the hurricane zone because he's
[01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:37.460]   got to be on the air.
[01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:42.540]   You get on an airplane and you leave and you have a second studio set up and another place
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:46.780]   that you can just go to and you can work and you have a second home set up.
[01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:51.860]   Although you or I might not be Rush Limbaugh, I think that should be our basic idea of how
[01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:52.860]   to approach things.
[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:59.420]   If we have the money and are willing to dedicate the money, big if, then we should put ourselves
[01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:04.620]   in a situation where we can live and work and function relatively seamlessly in multiple
[01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:05.620]   countries.
[01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:08.140]   Then the fourth phase is, "All right, I'm going to be an expat.
[01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:10.180]   I'm actually going to get out."
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:13.940]   That's a step that I think most people should not do, but I explained to you how to do it
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:16.460]   if you think it is and how to really profit from it.
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:18.660]   The course is just under eight hours.
[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:21.340]   It might be more than eight hours if I add more bonus content in the future, but right
[01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:23.040]   now it's just under eight hours.
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:28.900]   Very carefully presented, tight video presentation, audio is available as well, and careful notes,
[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:33.040]   working it through in a phase-by-phase approach with detailed action steps, laying it out
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:34.040]   to you.
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:37.300]   What I want to do is that I have done every single one of these.
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:43.700]   I have spent the last years of my life testing this stuff, proving this stuff out, systematically
[01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:44.700]   putting it in place.
[01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:49.620]   It started for me when I looked at the situation in the United States and I said, "I'm not
[01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:54.420]   going to say that there's a big risk right now, but I think that there could be risk
[01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:57.860]   in the future and I don't have a plan B."
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:02.380]   I started putting in place the plan B. I have gone through every single one of these phases,
[01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:08.620]   one, two, three, and four, tested them, learned what works, what doesn't work, and put that
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:12.260]   knowledge into a course for you.
[01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:13.260]   That's interesting to you.
[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:14.260]   Go to internationalescapeplan.com.
[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:15.260]   Thank you so much.
[01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:22.720]   I'll see you back soon for part three of this series where we talk about financial lessons
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:28.580]   from the current situation/crisis in the United States.
