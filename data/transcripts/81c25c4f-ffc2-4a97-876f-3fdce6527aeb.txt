[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.620]   I am James Hong and welcome to the Surpassing Value Podcast.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.740]   The fuel and desire for this podcast was born out of a compulsion to flesh out what's
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600]   been going on in the midst of an ocean of megaphones that may not actually withstand
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.620]   the test of scrutiny.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.320]   As a signpost theologian, I will do my best to filter out the impurities and point people
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.120]   in the right direction.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:46.460]   For this episode, I wanted to talk about the reliability of the New Testament documents.
[00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.780]   For some people, when you hear this, you might think that such talk somehow becomes an impediment
[00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.340]   to faith that a robust discussion into the empirical evidence surrounding the New Testament
[00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.420]   documents shouldn't be a conversation to be had because it will somehow add on to faith
[00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.900]   or perhaps take away from the faith we should have.
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.720]   Although I agree faith shouldn't be subject to the whims of the intellectual priesthood
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.420]   or external circumstances, that doesn't mean that truth doesn't withstand the test
[00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.420]   of scrutiny.
[00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.780]   Moreover, I flatly reject the claim that empirical evidence is somehow contrary to Christianity
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.860]   and/or genuine faith.
[00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.020]   I'll comment more on that at the closing of this episode.
[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.740]   With that said, let me begin by telling you that the New Testament documents have unparalleled
[00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.900]   textual reliability.
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.860]   The New Testament documents have unparalleled textual reliability.
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:55.240]   The three reasons the New Testament documents have unparalleled textual reliability are
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.580]   due to the number of existing manuscripts, the span of time between the originals and
[00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.860]   the copies, and the internal consistency among the existing copies.
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.900]   Let me explain.
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:14.500]   When you study works of antiquity, for good reason and for reasons which I join in, we
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.740]   rightly state that Homer wrote the Iliad, Sophocles wrote Oedipus Rex, and the various
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.740]   works of Aristotle, commonly referred to as the Corpus Aristotelicum, were written by
[00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.060]   Aristotle.
[00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.740]   The primary reason we do so is because of the reasons I just stated, namely, the number
[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.140]   of existing manuscripts, the span of time between the originals and the copies, and
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.100]   the internal consistency among the existing copies.
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:52.100]   The number of existing manuscripts for the New Testament stands at about 6,000, whereas
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:59.660]   for the Iliad it is about 650, and for the various works of Sophocles it is about 200.
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:06.600]   The New Testament manuscript stands completely alone in that category, which is a prong that
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:13.100]   academicians use in corroborating the validity of the work itself.
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:20.320]   The span of time between the originals and the copies is also well within two generations,
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.460]   and this same fact cannot be said for any other work of antiquity if we are talking
[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:32.180]   about the magnitude of the same and the magnitude of the time.
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.140]   Let me elaborate why it is so crucial that the New Testament documents are written within
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.100]   two generations.
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.860]   Academies will tell you that in order for a myth to develop, you need at least two generations
[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.180]   from the fabricated event.
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.020]   The logic behind that is pretty simple.
[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.020]   Let me illustrate.
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:57.740]   Suppose you and I and a bunch of unsavory wicked fellows decide to start a cult.
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:04.140]   In this cult, we decide to make you the ultimate demigod, and the lie has its roots in that
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:12.200]   you are able to lift cars and fly like Superman.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.880]   If we decided to perpetrate this myth in the midst of the contemporary generation, what
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.340]   do you think will be the logical reaction to people who are interested in our newly
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.000]   invented cult?
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.500]   People will want verification.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.740]   People will want empirical proof of our claims.
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.740]   They will want that because we are making extraordinary claims about our cult and if
[00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:45.780]   true would lend credibility to an otherwise outlandish statement.
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.980]   The problem is we are lying and you are not able to lift cars, you are not able to fly
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.740]   like Superman, so the cult should not gather any esteem.
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:02.140]   However, if the cult has its roots in making claims about irrefutable matters, then at
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.500]   least it has a chance.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.260]   Notice I didn't say lies, I said irrefutable matters.
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.540]   So what's an irrefutable matter?
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.420]   Instead of stating that a person alive is able to lift cars and fly like Superman, we
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:21.980]   state that a person who was no longer alive was able to accomplish such miraculous feats.
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.240]   If the handful of future adherents want to fact check the claims, they will not be able
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.820]   to fact check because that person is dead.
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.280]   The next step would then be to see if there is anyone alive who knew that dead person
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.180]   who could lift cars and fly like Superman to see if they could corroborate the outlandish
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.940]   statements, the miraculous claims.
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:53.560]   The more people you have who are brought in to propagate the lie and perhaps have other
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.820]   pieces of evidence to back up those claims, the greater the chance this lie will perpetuate.
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:05.220]   Of course, if people alive who are not privy to the lie come in in droves stating that
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:13.780]   they knew this person and they could accomplish no such feat, you're going to encounter resistance.
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.720]   Which is why I stated earlier that historians will typically tell you it takes at least
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.540]   two generations, but many times more.
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:28.420]   How does this relate to the claims made in the New Testament and the New Testament itself?
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.980]   The New Testament claims that its central figure, Jesus of Nazareth, came on the scene
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:41.360]   and began publicly teaching about the kingdom of God and accomplishing miraculous works.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:47.020]   These miraculous works included, but are not limited to, making the mute speak, the deaf
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:53.080]   to hear, the lame to walk, the blind to see, cleansing lepers instantaneously, healing
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.660]   terminally ill people, and even raising the dead.
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:03.100]   The relevant detail here is that much of the New Testament documents claim that Jesus of
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:09.860]   Nazareth performed these acts and that people who witnessed these events were still alive.
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:17.980]   There was a high likelihood that one saw these events themselves or heard from a living eyewitness.
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:24.500]   The New Testament documents also claim that Jesus of Nazareth was executed but rose bodily
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:30.740]   three days later and appeared not just to a fringe group of people, but to large chunks
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.640]   of people at the same time.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.460]   After 40 days, the New Testament states that he ascended, or to put it in less religious
[00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:44.060]   terms, he vanished and was never seen bodily again.
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:50.180]   The New Testament claims that Christians began to multiply while suffering under heavy persecution
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:56.180]   from the outside world because they could not deny these claims, while dealing with
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:02.500]   those at times within the church taught an aberrant version of Christianity.
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:10.820]   The renowned church historian, Philip Schafe, stated it like this, "The persecutions of
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:17.860]   Christianity during the first three centuries appear like a long tragedy, first foreboding
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:24.820]   signs, then a succession of bloody assaults of heathenism upon the religion of the cross.
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:30.300]   Amidst the dark scenes of fiendish hatred and cruelty, the bright exhibitions of suffering
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:37.060]   virtue, now and then a short pause, at least a fearful and desperate struggle of the old
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:42.900]   pagan empire for life and death, ending in the abiding victory of the Christian religion.
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:48.980]   Thus, this bloody baptism of the church resulted in the birth of a Christian world.
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:58.180]   It was a repetition and prolongation of the crucifixion, but followed by a resurrection."
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:03.300]   Schafe further remarks on the first four centuries of the church, under Roman rule, stating it
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:10.300]   like this, "From the fifth century it has been customary to reckon ten great persecutions,
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:18.780]   under Nero, Domitian, Trajan, Marcus Aurelius, Septimius Severus, Maximus, Decius Valerian,
[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.380]   Aurelian, and Diocletian.
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:26.060]   This number was suggested by the ten plagues of Egypt, taken as types, which however befell
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:31.740]   the enemies of Israel, and present a contrast rather than a parallel, and by the ten horns
[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.900]   of the Roman beast making war with the lamb, taken for so many emperors.
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.900]   But the number is too great for the general persecutions, and too small for the provincial
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.260]   and local.
[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:48.820]   Only two imperial persecutions, those of Decius and Diocletian, extended over the empire,
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:56.740]   but Christianity was always an illegal religion from Trajan to Constantine, and subject to
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.700]   annoyance and violence everywhere.
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:05.540]   Some persecuting members, Nero, Domitian, Galerius, were monstrous tyrants, but others,
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:12.660]   Trajan, Marcus Aurelius, Decius, Diocletian, were among the best and most energetic emperors,
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:17.540]   and were prompted not so much by hatred of Christianity, as by zeal for the maintenance
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.620]   of the laws and the power of the government.
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:29.260]   On the other hand, some of the most worthless emperors, Commodus, Caracalla, and Heliogabalus,
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:33.460]   were rather favorable to Christians from sheer caprice.
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:37.140]   All were equally ignorant of the true character of the new religion.
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:42.780]   The long and bloody war of heathen Rome against the Church, which is built upon a rock, utterly
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.020]   failed.
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.080]   It began in Rome under Nero.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:51.780]   It ended near Rome at the Milvian Bridge under Constantine.
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.760]   Aiming to exterminate, it purified.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:11:01.940]   It called forth the virtues of Christian heroism, and resulted in the consolidation and triumph
[00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.500]   of the new religion.
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:10.540]   The philosophy of persecution is best expressed by the terse word of Tertullian, who lived
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.860]   in the midst of them, but did not see the end.
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:20.460]   "The blood of the Christians is the seed of the church."
[00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:25.480]   Let's begin to piece what we have together so far.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:31.900]   The claims made in the New Testament are that its central figure, performed and taught publicly
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:39.020]   and the verification of who he was, lied in the miracles that he performed and the substance
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.900]   of what he taught.
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:45.820]   Of high importance was that he claimed to be God.
[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:52.260]   To prove his claims, instead of exacting his power upon what the eye could see, he came
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:59.140]   to offer his own life as a substitution for the required life of all who do not live perfectly,
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.500]   which is everyone that has ever lived.
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:08.860]   Upon this, he stated that even death would not be able to hold him, and substantiated
[00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.200]   this claim by rising bodily.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:18.120]   His adherents would spread this message, but were met with great hostility.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:24.660]   If all of this is indeed true, it would stand to reason that there would be outside records
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:31.420]   of all this taking place in some shape or form, and indeed there was.
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:35.420]   Listen to what Josephus, a Jewish historian commissioned by Rome, wrote.
[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:40.220]   Mind you, Josephus was compelled to be objective and trustworthy since he was commissioned
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.220]   by Rome.
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.740]   He wasn't a Christian.
[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:48.900]   Josephus states this, "Now some of the Jews thought the destruction of Herod's army came
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:54.500]   from God, and that very justly, as punishment of what he did against John, that was called
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.580]   the Baptist.
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:01.060]   For Herod slew him, who was a good man, and commanded the Jews to exercise virtue, both
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:08.740]   as to righteousness towards one another and piety towards God, and so to come to baptism."
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:15.580]   If you are unfamiliar with the New Testament, Josephus here is validating claims made in
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.620]   the New Testament.
[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:26.340]   This is an outside record validating what is contained within the New Testament.
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:32.020]   Josephus elsewhere states, "Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:37.660]   lawful to call him a man, for he was a doer of wonderful works, a teacher of such men
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.900]   as received the truth with pleasure.
[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.980]   He drew over to him both many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles.
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:49.980]   He was Christ, and when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:54.920]   him to the cross, those that loved him at first did not forsake him, for he appeared
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:14:02.100]   to them alive again the third day, and the tribe of Christians so named from him are
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:07.380]   not extinct at this day."
[00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:11.900]   Here are some more outside records validating the claims of the New Testament from people
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.780]   who are no friends of Christians.
[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:17.300]   Tacitus writes this, again, no friend of Christians.
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:24.020]   He writes, "Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted
[00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:29.420]   the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abomination, called Christians by
[00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.420]   the populace.
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:35.440]   Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:40.780]   of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilate."
[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:47.640]   Lucian, a Greek writer, writes this, "The Christians, you know, worship a man to this
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:54.000]   day, the distinguished personage who introduced their novel rites and was crucified on the
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.220]   account.
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:15:01.880]   You see, these misguided creatures start with the general conviction that they are immortal
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:08.600]   for all time, which explains the contempt of death and voluntary self-devotion which
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:14.040]   are so common among them, and then it was impressed on them by their original lawgiver
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:19.020]   that they are all brothers from the moment that they are converted and deny the gods
[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:23.920]   of Greece and worship the crucified sage and live after his laws.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:30.300]   All this they take quite on faith, with the result that they despise all worldly goods
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:37.360]   alike, regarding them as merely common property."
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:43.800]   Earlier I mentioned that the New Testament documents exhibited a remarkable consistency
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.680]   among the existing copies.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.680]   That was the second prong.
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.700]   I just finished the first prong.
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.480]   Now on to the second prong.
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:56.960]   The New Testament documents exhibited a remarkable consistency among existing copies.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:05.120]   The textual agreement between the existing copies stands at about 99.5% and the 0.5%
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:09.920]   is merely Scrivener error that does not change anything of substance.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:17.560]   To put that into perspective, no other work of antiquity exhibits anything close to this.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:23.400]   Yet we still claim, with good reason, that Homer wrote the Iliad, Sophocles wrote Oedipus
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.840]   Rex and so on, which I join in.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:33.120]   But my point is, if we're going to be logically consistent, then we also have to claim that
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:40.800]   the New Testament documents also should be taken for what they are stating not based
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:49.800]   upon the documents themselves necessarily, but also based upon the corroborating evidence
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.360]   that we see from outside.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:17:01.020]   There is also remarkable touchpoint corroboration of the times and places mentioned in the New
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.020]   Testament.
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:06.120]   That's important because, again, it would stand to reason that if the claims made in
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:12.360]   the New Testament of our actual times and places, those times and places should exist
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:19.440]   outside the documents in the New Testament and indeed they do.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:30.520]   I'll be quoting from J. Warner Wallace who wrote a book called Cold Case Christianity.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.760]   He is a former homicide detective and lifelong atheist.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:40.600]   Before his conversion, he examined the empirical claims of Christianity at the age of 35, applying
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:45.800]   his detective skills when undertaking his own personal investigation.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:54.200]   J. Warner Wallace writes, "Luke's narratives include detailed and specific descriptions
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:59.480]   related to the locations, people, offices, and titles within the Roman Empire.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:05.340]   In fact, many of Luke's claims were eventually confirmed by archaeological discoveries.
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:12.520]   Related to Quirinius, Luke wrote that Joseph and Mary returned to Bethlehem because a Syrian
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:19.120]   governor named Quirinius was conducting a census.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:24.440]   Archaeological discoveries in the 19th century revealed Quirinius for someone with the same
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:31.200]   name was also a pro-consul of Syria and Cilicia from 11 B.C. to the death of Herod.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.960]   Quirinius' name has been discovered on a coin from this period of time and on the base
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:40.000]   of a statue erected in Sidon, Antioch.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.480]   Related to Erastus, in Romans 16.23, Paul wrote, "Erastus, the city treasurer, greets
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.480]   you.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:52.360]   A piece of pavement was discovered in Corinth in 1929 confirming his existence."
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:57.800]   Related to Lysanias, Luke discovered a tetrarch named Lysanias and wrote that this man reigned
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:02.640]   over Abilene when John the Baptist began his ministry (Luke 3.1).
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:06.960]   Two inscriptions have been discovered that mention Lysanias by name.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:17.040]   One of these, dated from A.D. 1437, identifies Lysanias as a tetrarch in Abila near Damascus.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:22.000]   There were many other examples, but I thought a sample would suffice if this topic interests
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   you.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.840]   Feel free to get his book, "Cold Case Christianity."
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:31.200]   Another book I would recommend on this issue is "Jesus Under Fire" edited by Michael
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.800]   Wilkins.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:38.200]   That book is a collection of essays from multiple different academicians in response to the
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:44.440]   Jesus Seminar, where another group of academicians came together in an attempt to reinvent the
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.440]   historical Jesus.
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:53.920]   The final book I would recommend is Craig Blomberg's "The Historical Reliability
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:20:00.080]   of the New Testament."
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:05.640]   In an essay he wrote, responding to questions regarding the reliability of the New Testament,
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:14.840]   he makes two important points regarding the historicity of Acts and the questions of miracles.
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.840]   This is Craig Blomberg regarding the historicity of Acts.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:26.320]   He writes, "The New Testament contains only one book with the genre or contents of Acts
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.640]   of the Apostles.
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:32.280]   This is a theologically rich and artistically refined work of history.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.800]   The number of characters and places in this selective account of key events in the first
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:41.260]   generation of church history that have been confirmed is staggering.
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:47.440]   From non-Christian works alone, we know of Annas, Claudius, Gamaliel, Caiaphas, James,
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:56.540]   Galileo, Agrippa I and II, Sergius Paulus, Felix Drusilla, Festus, Bernas, and others.
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:02.960]   Every city and location which has been excavated has been shown to be as Acts describes them,
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:10.560]   complete with specific synagogues, theaters, ports, roads, rivers, and more, particularly
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:17.480]   significant is how Luke gets right the names of the rulers in the various locations especially
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:24.360]   since in some instances they varied quite a bit in a given region or from one period
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.780]   to the next.
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:33.200]   These include the Sanhedrin, the Italian Regiment, Tetrarchs, Pro-Councils, Magistrates, Politarchs,
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.860]   the Areopagus, City Clerk, and the Chief Man on the Island of Malta.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:43.860]   The very fact that one can mesh Acts with more fragmentary and sometimes called incidental
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:49.520]   allusions to Paul's life in his letters sets Acts off from historical novels, modern
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.240]   and ancient.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:57.240]   That one can generate a plausible detailed chronology of the events depicted in Acts,
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:02.400]   again especially in comparison with Paul's letters, and chart his missionary journeys
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:13.960]   as coherent and sensible travels further suggests Acts is historical."
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:27.280]   The book of Acts in the New Testament contains all the hallmarks of reliability and trustworthiness.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:33.400]   Regarding the question of miracles, Blomberg writes "Can we believe in documents as filled
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.200]   with miracles as the New Testament is?
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:43.440]   If one a priori postulates an anti-supernatural worldview then no, but then one is no longer
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.300]   engaging in historical investigation.
[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:51.760]   The claim that natural explanations are always more probable even if one does not rule out
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:58.240]   supernatural explanations up front is itself a belief that cannot be demonstrated empirically
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:06.080]   and that unduly denigrates the role of trustworthy testimony as the bedrock of historiography.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:11.800]   It also flies in the face of thousands of modern day experiences of ordinary people
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:18.660]   all around the globe who have witnessed instantaneous healings and similar events after public concerted
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.400]   Christian prayer.
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:25.480]   Claims about miracles should neither be written off a priori nor uncritically accepted.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:29.560]   They should be tested like any other historical affirmations.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:34.560]   What sets the New Testament miracles off from accounts in many other kinds of literature
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:40.680]   is their consistent link to the arrival or inauguration of God's reign in the person
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:44.080]   of Jesus and the movement he began.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:50.200]   Claims about similarities with other ancient miracle stories break down on careful inspection.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:55.160]   The closest parallels are all post-Christian, too late to have influenced the New Testament
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.160]   writers.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:02.400]   Partially, similar pre-Christian parallels usually cluster around gods or goddesses or
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:12.320]   heroes from some dim, mythical past and are not attached to recent people known to have
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.960]   lived real human lives.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:19.840]   This is especially the case when one examines the resurrection of Jesus.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:30.800]   The most spectacular and significant of the foundational Christian miracles."
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:39.160]   If you reject the New Testament claims prior to the investigation of the New Testament
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:53.400]   claims, because the New Testament claims miracles, then what you've done is you've stated before
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:59.520]   even looking into the claims that it must be false.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:08.160]   But wouldn't something as incredible, as uncommon, as outlandish as miracles be the
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:19.920]   exact source of confirming something that is other-worldly true, that is supernatural?
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:28.840]   Doesn't it stand to reason that if there is indeed a supernatural realm, the way to confirm
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:34.360]   that would be something akin to miracles?
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:44.480]   The question is whether or not miracles are actually the source of the confirmation of
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.400]   these claims.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:53.600]   The question is, did these miracles actually happen?
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.120]   Did those miracles actually happen?
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.960]   Is there evidence for such miracles?
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:07.960]   In conclusion, I want to comment on the nature of what I articulated in the beginning of
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:13.840]   this episode as it relates to genuine faith, as if somehow they should be held in exclusion.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:22.800]   Remember, I'm not advocating that anything I said in this episode is salvific or necessary
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:27.320]   for salvation, that's not what I'm advocating.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:31.040]   I'm advocating for something a lot more narrow.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:36.080]   What I'm advocating is that interest in the substance of what was articulated in this
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:45.040]   episode or an investigation into these claims or even a desire to do that further research
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:50.960]   somehow is contrary or is detrimental to faith.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.480]   Just a few comments on that narrow point.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:27:01.000]   In the last episode, we talked about John 10, 37-38, but let me read this passage again
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.040]   and comment on why it's relevant here.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:07.880]   "If I do not do the works of my Father, do not believe me.
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:13.200]   But if I do do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, so that you
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:19.600]   may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father."
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:24.400]   That is Jesus in John 10 verses 37-38.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:31.200]   Christ himself pointed at works as proof of who he was.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:35.920]   He didn't come on the scene, preach, and then state "believe or else."
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:41.080]   He absolutely could have in one sentence, but my point is that even Christ used empirical
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:47.680]   evidence as validation that he was indeed the promised Messiah and pointed towards that
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:56.040]   evidence as proof of who he was, which was reflective of Isaiah 61 and Isaiah 35.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:02.720]   When God sent Moses to free Israel from Pharaoh, God used Moses to perform many miracles as
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:09.120]   validation that God was the one true God of the universe and not the gods of Egypt.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:16.080]   You also see this same pattern with Elijah, that miracles accompanied his message as proof
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:19.740]   of the substance of what Elijah was testifying to.
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:28.880]   By God's grace, God has left a trail of breadcrumbs that corroborates the claims made in the New
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:33.920]   Testament and also to the validity of the New Testament itself.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:41.480]   I want to make this point clear because this same point also applies to how you think about
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.340]   the canon of scripture.
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:51.520]   I'm not saying that our reasoning, our minds, and our external evidence should be catapulted
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.880]   to a level that's higher than scripture.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.480]   That's not what I'm saying.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.520]   The greater confirms the lesser.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:01.240]   Revelation is greater than reason.
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:07.000]   I am in no way advocating for an elevated Rene Descartes line of reasoning here.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.060]   I think therefore I am.
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:14.240]   To advocate for that would then be advocating that anything we could prove physically is
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:19.440]   what is true, or that the greatest form of validation is empirical, which would be essentially
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.740]   arguing for a form of naturalism.
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:29.620]   What I am advocating, though, is that the scriptures themselves speak to a validity
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:34.300]   contained within empirical proofs.
[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:40.400]   This is usually coordinated with future prophecies, and they were also used to even shut the mouths
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:47.200]   of people who state that, had there actually been a miracle, they wouldn't be entangled
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.200]   in unbelief.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:55.840]   God's not going to jump and dance for you every time you ask him to at the same time.
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:07.440]   He has left a vast body of evidence that corroborates and eliminates excuses even for the most hardest
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:10.320]   of skeptics.
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:20.640]   It is absolutely true that God saves those whom he foreknew, however, what is also true
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:26.360]   is that the empirical evidence for the claims of the New Testament are at the very least
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:32.040]   adequate and, in my humble opinion, compelling.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:41.360]   It's almost as if there is this mountain of evidence that demands a verdict, a la Josh
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:51.280]   McDowell, and to look over it, you would have to forcefully ignore that and the evidence
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:56.480]   of creation.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:03.280]   Thanks for making it to the end, I'll continue to try to make the journey worth it.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:18.160]   To him be honor, glory, and eternal dominion, James Allnell.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:31.080]   Amen.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:38.320]   Amen.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.900]   (upbeat music)
