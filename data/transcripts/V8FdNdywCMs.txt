[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   The percentage returns get really crazy when you're willing to move your direct deposit.
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.400]   So I looked at what I thought was kind of the eight best offers, similar
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.880]   institutions, but also included SoFi, Chase, PNC, Bank of America.
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.680]   And the bonuses were similar, $200 to $900, but you only needed to deposit $1,000 to $15,000.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.640]   And so if you look, most of the time, the range was 90 to 120 days.
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.640]   The actual bonus APY was crazy.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.640]   It was from 24 to 200%.
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:35.960]   And so the top bonus was Axios Bank, $500 for depositing $3,000 for just 30 days.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.280]   So that's how you get to 200% return because you get $500 on $3,000,
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.480]   which is about 16% return in just 30 days.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.540]   So if you annualize that, multiply it by 12, it's just wild and way
[00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.360]   more APY than you'll get anywhere else.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.800]   It did require that you have at least $1,500 of direct deposit.
