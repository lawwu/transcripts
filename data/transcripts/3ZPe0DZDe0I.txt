[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   It's one of the most important questions that can ever be asked.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   What must I believe to be saved?
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   It was asked of Pastor John a few years back in a Q&A setting.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Here's how Pastor John answered the question.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Well, Paul says, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved."
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   He says, "If you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   and in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   So I take text like that, and I would say, "You begin at this core of the death of Jesus.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   He died for our sins, which means I must believe I'm a sinner."
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   A person that doesn't believe he's a sinner can't be saved.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   If there's nothing to forgive, He didn't do anything for me.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   If He didn't do anything for me, I'm not believing Him for salvation.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   If I'm not believing Him for salvation, I'm not saved.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   So you must believe that you are a sinner.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   You must believe that there's a God who has created the possibility for sin.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   That is, sin only has meaning as the falling short of the expectations of your Creator.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   So there has to be a Creator God out there who has expectations of humans
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   that they trust Him, love Him, live for Him, and we fail, and therefore we're under His--
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   that'd be the third thing now--we're under His holy--call it different things--judgment, wrath.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   You've got to believe that.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   If you're a sinner, and there's a holy God, and you're defining sin as a falling short of that God,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   then in order to understand what He's doing to solve that,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   you've got to understand that He's angry about that.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   He's just. He's a good judge.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   So what has He now done to solve the problem of our alienation from Him?
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   He has sent His Son into the world.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   You've got to believe in the deity of Jesus.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   It says in Psalm 49 that no man can pay a ransom for another man.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And then a few verses later, I think it's verse 15, it says God will pay the ransom.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   So He couldn't have used John or Peter or Paul to die for us.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   He had to have the God-man die for us.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   So the deity of Jesus is essential.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   And then what did He do? What did He do?
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Well, He lived a perfect life.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   You can't believe that Jesus sinned and be saved, I don't think,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   because then the sacrifice made for you was not what was required,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   and you're not believing in what God did for you.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   So He's a sinless Son of God, and now He gives Himself up to die in my place.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   So the substitutional dimension of the death of Christ for my sins,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   and there's lots of ways to talk about that in the Bible,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   and I think you can be very confused about some of those and be saved.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I don't want to start listing off all the ways the Bible talks about that
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   and how confused a person can be about them and still be saved.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Let's just say at the core of the gospel of how this is all remedied is
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who never sinned, got in my place
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   and took the wrath of God for me and died in my place.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   If He had stayed dead, we would still be in our sins,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   so we must believe He rose from the dead.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   So now He's risen from the dead, and I would say that's the cluster.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I'm willing to kind of stop there.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   You might be able to bring to my mind some things that would be
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   so theologically closely attached to those that I would say,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   "Okay, yeah, that's got to be included as well."
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   But if somebody asked me, "What do I have to believe?"
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   I'd say, "There's the cluster of things that you've got to know about yourself,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   know about God, know about the cross."
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I guess maybe one other thing.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   I'm sort of assuming faith here because they said, "What do I have to believe?"
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   But you have to believe something about belief, meaning that it's required.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   If you say, "Oh, I get all that. I get all that.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Now I'm going to work so that God will let all that count for me.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   I'm going to keep the law 85% so that all this redemptive work will count for me."
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   You've missed it. You're not saved.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   What salvation requires that you believe is that you must believe
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   instead of working for this salvation, that He has done what needs to be done.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   We receive it.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   As many as received Him who believed in His name,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   He gave them the right to become the children of God.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   So I think sin, God, cross, faith.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   To summarize the core, it would be truths around those four things.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Pastor John was then asked a follow-up question.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   "In order to be saved, must someone understand the Trinity?"
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Here's what he said.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   They surely wouldn't have to know that word.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   They wouldn't have to be able to articulate it very well.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   But what they need to do is not deny essential things about it.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   So a person may never have heard of such things as the Trinity and be saved.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   But if you said to them, "Now, the Jesus you're believing in,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   is He divine or just a man?"
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   If they said, "He's not divine," I think that's a major problem.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   So I'm saying the implications and pieces of the Trinity.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Now, I don't think a person has to have ever heard of the Holy Spirit to be saved.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Is that radical? I don't think so.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   If you get taught about the Holy Spirit and what He's done for you
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   and say, "Oh, no, no, no, no. I don't believe any of that.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   I don't believe it took the Holy Spirit to save me,"
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   then I'm going to question your salvation.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   But goodness, I just spent five minutes unpacking the gospel,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   and I didn't mention Him.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   And that's not because He's not essential.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   We would never believe without Him.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   But because I think knowing the details of how God got you to believe
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   is not essential.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   But denying it once you know it would undermine essential things.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   That was Pastor John answering questions a few years ago.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   And as a follow-up to this very important discussion,

[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   We return tomorrow to hear Pastor John's concerns
