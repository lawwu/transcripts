[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.680]   "Aunt Jo's Scrapbag," an old-fashioned Thanksgiving.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.340]   Sixty years ago, up among the New Hampshire hills, lived Farmer Bassett, with a house
[00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.060]   full of sturdy sons and daughters growing up about him.
[00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.680]   They were poor in money, but rich in land and love.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.620]   For the wide acres of wood, corn, and pasture land fed, warmed, and clothed the flock, while
[00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.840]   mutual patience, affection, and courage made the old farmhouse a very happy home.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.120]   November had come.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.780]   The crops were in, and barn, buttery, and bin were overflowing with the harvest that
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.980]   rewarded the summer's hard work.
[00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.960]   The big kitchen was a jolly place just now, for in the great fireplace roared a cheerful
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:02.960]   fire.
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.600]   On the walls hung garlands of dried apples, onions, and corn.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.200]   Up aloft from the beams shone crook-necked squashes, juicy hams, and dried venison.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.760]   For in those days, deer still haunted the deep forests, and hunters flourished.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.000]   Savory smells were in the air.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.720]   On the crane hung steaming kettles, and down among the red embers copper saucepans simmered,
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.600]   all suggestive of some approaching feast.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.760]   A white-headed baby lay in the old blue cradle that had rocked seven other babies, now and
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.940]   then lifting his head to look out like a round full moon, then subsided to kick and crow
[00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.000]   contentedly, and suck the rosy apple he had no teeth to bite.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.740]   Two small boys sat on the wooden settle, shelling corn for popping, and picking out the biggest
[00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.220]   nuts from the goodly store their own hands had gathered in October.
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.520]   Four young girls stood at the long dresser, busily chopping meat, pounding spice, and
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.680]   slicing apples, and the tongues of Tilly, Prue, Roxy, and Rhodey went as fast as their
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.680]   hands.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.160]   Farmer Bassett and F, the oldest boy, were "chorin' round outside," for Thanksgiving
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.680]   was at hand, and all must be in order for that time-honored day.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.800]   To and fro from table to hearth bustled buxom Mrs. Bassett, flushed and flowery, but busy
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.640]   and blithe as the queen bee of this busy little hive should be.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.180]   "I do like to begin seasonable and have things to my mind.
[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.080]   Thanksgiving dinners can't be drove, and it does take a side of victuals to fill all
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.680]   these hungry stomachs," said the good woman, as she gave a vigorous stir to the great kettle
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.240]   of cider applesauce and cast a glance of housewifely pride at the fine array of pies set forth
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.840]   on the buttery shelves.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.920]   "Only one more day, and then it'll be the time to eat.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.480]   I didn't take but one bowl of hasty pudding this morning, so I shall have plenty of room
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.320]   when the nice things come," confided Seth to Soul as he cracked a large hazelnut as
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.840]   easily as a squirrel.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.520]   "No need of my starvin' beforehand.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.400]   I always have room enough, and I'd like to have Thanksgiving every day," answered
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.600]   Solomon, gloating like a young ogre over the little pig that lay nearby, ready for roasting.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.280]   "Sakes alive, I don't, boys.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.560]   It's a mercy it don't come but once a year.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.200]   I should be worn to a thread paper with all this extra work atop of my winter weavin'
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.920]   and spinnin'," laughed their mother, as she plunged her plump arms into the long bread
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.520]   trough and began to knead the dough as if a famine were at hand.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:51.720]   Tilly, the oldest girl, a red-cheeked, black-eyed lass of fourteen, was grinding briskly at
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.280]   the mortar, for spices were costly and not a grain must be wasted.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.920]   Prue kept time with the chopper, and the twins sliced away at the apples till their little
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.520]   brown arms ached, for all knew how to work, and did so now with a will.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.840]   "I think it's real fun to have Thanksgiving at home.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.760]   I'm sorry Grandma's sick, so we can't go there as usual, but I like to mess around
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.240]   here, don't you, girls?" asked Tilly, pausing to take a sniff at the spicy pestle.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.120]   "It will be kind of lonesome with only our own folks.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.640]   I like to see all the cousins and aunts and have games and sing," cried the twins, who
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.680]   were regular little romps and could run, swim, coast, and shout as well as their brothers.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.600]   "I don't care a mite for all that.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.920]   It will be so nice to eat dinner together, warm and comfortable at home," said quiet
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.840]   Prue, who loved her own cozy nooks like a cat.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.800]   "Come, girls, fly round and get your chores done, so we can clear away for dinner just
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.760]   as soon as I clap my bread into the oven," called Mrs. Bassett presently, as she rounded
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.960]   off the last loaf of brown bread, which was to feed the hungry mouths that seldom tasted
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.960]   any other.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.120]   "Hear a man coming up the hill lively?
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.120]   Guess it's Gad Hopkins.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.880]   Pa told him to bring a dozen oranges if they weren't too high," shouted Sol and Seth,
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.600]   running to the door, while the girls smacked their lips at the thought of this rare treat,
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.840]   and Baby threw his apple overboard as if getting ready for a new cargo.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:28.180]   But all were doomed to disappointment, for it was not Gad with the much-desired fruit.
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.400]   It was a stranger who threw himself off his horse and hurried up to Mr. Bassett in the
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.640]   yard with some brief message that made the farmer drop his axe, and looked so sober that
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.920]   his wife guessed at once some bad news had come, and crying, "Mother's wuss, I know
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.360]   she is," outran the good woman, forgetful of the flour on her arms and the oven waiting
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.560]   for its most important batch.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.320]   The man said, "Old Mr. Chadwick, down to Keene, stopped him as he passed and told him
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.240]   to tell Mrs. Bassett her mother was failin' fast and she'd better come today."
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.360]   He knew no more, and having delivered his errand, he rode away, saying it looked like
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.520]   snow and he must be jogging or he wouldn't get home till night.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.600]   "We must go right off, Eldad.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.480]   Hitch up and I'll be ready in less'n no time," said Mrs. Bassett, wasting not a
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:18.160]   minute in tears and lamentations, but pulling off her apron as she went in, with her mind
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:25.360]   in a sad jumble of bread, anxiety, turkey, sorrow, haste, and cider applesauce.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.840]   A few words told the story, and the children left their work to help her get ready, mingling
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.080]   their grief for Grandma with regrets for the lost dinner.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.880]   "I'm dreadful sorry, dears, but it can't be helped.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.800]   I couldn't cook nor eat no way now, and if that blessed woman gets better sudden as
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.120]   she has before, we'll have cause for Thanksgiving, and I'll give you a dinner you won't forget
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.480]   in a hurry," said Mrs. Bassett, as she tied on her brown silk pumpkin hood, with a sob
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.860]   for the good old mother who had made it for her.
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.540]   Not a child complained after that, but ran about helpfully, bringing moccasins, heating
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.180]   the footstone and getting ready for a long drive, because Grandma lived twenty miles
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.560]   away, and there were no railroads in those parts to whisk people to and fro like magic.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.780]   By the time the old yellow sleigh was at the door, the bread was in the oven, and Mrs.
[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:17.020]   Bassett was waiting, with her camlet cloak on, and the baby done up like a small bale
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.020]   of blankets.
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.860]   "Now, F, you must look after the cattle like a man, and keep up the fires, for there's
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:27.380]   a storm brewing, and neither the children nor dumb critters must suffer," said Mr.
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.940]   Bassett, as he turned up the collar of his rough coat and put on his blue mittens, while
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.780]   the old mare shook her bells as if she preferred a trip to Keene to Hollingwood all day.
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.000]   "Tilly, put extra comfortables on the beds tonight.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.120]   The wind is so searching up chamber.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.340]   Have the baked beans and Injun pudding for dinner, and whatever you do, don't let the
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.340]   boys get at the mince pies, or you'll have them down sick.
[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.020]   I shall come back the minute I can leave, Mother.
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.820]   Paul will come tomorrow anyway, so keep snug and be good.
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.820]   I depend on you, my daughter.
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.500]   Use your judgment and don't let nothing happen while Mother's away."
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.620]   "Yes, um, yes, um, goodbye, goodbye," called the children, as Mrs. Bassett was packed
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:10.380]   into the sleigh and driven away, leaving a stream of directions behind her.
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:16.620]   F., the sixteen-year-old boy, immediately put on his biggest boots, assumed a sober,
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:22.060]   responsible manner, and surveyed his little responsibilities with a paternal air, drolly
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.660]   like his father's.
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:28.700]   Tilly tied on her mother's bunch of keys, rolled up the sleeves of her homespun gown,
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.180]   and began to order about the younger girls.
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:35.580]   They soon forgot poor Granny and found it great fun to keep house all alone, for Mother
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:40.580]   seldom left home, but ruled her family in the good, old-fashioned way.
[00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:45.460]   There were no servants, for the little daughters were Mrs. Bassett's only maids, and the stout
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:51.180]   boys helped their father, all working happily together with no wages but love, learning
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:55.680]   in the best manner the use of the heads and hands with which they were to make their own
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.460]   way in the world.
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:04.040]   The few flakes that caused the farmer to predict bad weather soon increased to a regular snowstorm,
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:09.700]   with gusts of wind, for up among the hills winter came early and lingered long.
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:14.940]   But the children were busy, gay, and warm indoors, and never minded the rising gale
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.580]   nor the whirling white storm outside.
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.700]   Tilly got them a good dinner, and when it was over the two elder girls went to their
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:27.620]   spinning, for in the kitchen stood the big and little wheels, and baskets of wool rolls
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:32.740]   ready to be twisted into yarn for the winter's knitting, and each day brought its stint of
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:37.660]   work to the daughters, who hoped to be as thrifty as their mother.
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:43.220]   F. kept up a glorious fire, and superintended the small boys, who popped corn and whittled
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:49.500]   boats on the hearth, while Roxy and Rhodey dressed corncob dolls in the settled corner,
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:57.020]   and Boze, the brindled mastiff, lay on the braided mat, luxuriously warming his old legs.
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:02.140]   Thus employed they made a pretty picture, these rosy boys and girls in their homespun
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:09.380]   suits with the rustic toys or tasks which most children nowadays would find very poor
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.100]   or tiresome.
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:16.380]   Tilly and Prue sang as they stepped to and fro, drawing out the smoothly twisted threads
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.580]   to the musical hum of the great spinning wheels.
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.620]   The little girls chattered like magpies over their dolls and the new bedspread they were
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:29.420]   planning to make, all white dimity stars on a blue calico ground, as a Christmas present
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.420]   to Ma.
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:36.260]   The boys roared at F.s jokes, and had rough and tumble games over Boze, who didn't mind
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.900]   them in the least, and so the afternoon wore pleasantly away.
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:45.740]   At sunset the boys went out to feed the cattle, bringing in heaps of wood and lockup for the
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:51.060]   night, as the lonely farmhouse seldom had visitors after dark.
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:56.620]   The girls got the simple supper of brown bread and milk, baked apples, and a donut all round
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.020]   as a treat.
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:03.640]   Then they sat before the fire, the sisters knitting, the brothers with books or games,
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:09.240]   for F. loved reading, and Sol and Seth never failed to play a few games of Morris with
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.300]   barleycorns on the little board they had made themselves at one corner of the dresser.
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:18.600]   "Read out a piece," said Tilly from Mother's Chair, where she sat in state, finishing off
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.660]   the sixth woolen sock she had knit that month.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:25.900]   "It's the old history book, but here's a bit you may like, since it's about our
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.260]   folks," answered F.
[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:31.860]   Turning the yellow page to look at a picture of two quaintly dressed children in some ancient
[00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:32.860]   castle.
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.140]   "Yes, read that.
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:42.460]   I always liked to hear about the Lady Matilda I was named for, and Lord Basset, Pa's great-great-great-grandpa.
[00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:46.660]   He's only a farmer now, but it's nice to know that we were somebody two or three hundred
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:52.740]   years ago," said Tilly, bridling and tossing her curly head as she fancied the "Lady
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.460]   Matilda" might have done.
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.580]   "Don't read the queer words, 'cause we don't understand 'em.
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:02.620]   Tell it," commanded Roxy from the cradle, where she was drowsily cuddled with Rhody.
[00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:09.260]   "Well, a long time ago, when Charles I was in prison, Lord Basset was a true friend to
[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:13.220]   him," began F, plunging into his story without delay.
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:17.240]   The Lord had some papers that would have hung a lot of people if the king's enemies got
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.420]   hold of him.
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:22.620]   So when he heard one day, all of a sudden, that soldiers were at the castle gate to carry
[00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:29.300]   him off, he had just time to call his girl to him and say, "I may be going to my death,
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.700]   but I won't betray my master.
[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:35.660]   There is no time to burn the papers, and I cannot take them with me.
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:39.000]   They are hidden in the old leathern chair where I sit.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.260]   No one knows this but you, and you must guard them till I come, or send you a safe messenger
[00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.220]   to take them away.
[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:52.060]   Promise me to be brave and silent, and I can go without fear."
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:56.700]   You see, he wasn't afraid to die, but he was to seem a traitor.
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:01.400]   Lady Matilde promised solemnly, and the words were hardly out of her mouth when the men
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:07.140]   came in and her father was carried away a prisoner and sent off to the tower.
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.640]   "But she didn't cry.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.860]   She just called her brother and sat down in that chair with her head leaning back on those
[00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:16.820]   papers like a queen and waited while the soldiers hunted the house over for him.
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.300]   Wasn't that a smart girl?"
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:24.340]   cried Tilly, beaming with pride, for she was named for this ancestress and knew the story
[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.340]   by heart.
[00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:28.980]   "I reckon she was scared though when the men came swearing in and asked her if she
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.460]   knew anything about it.
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:36.300]   The boy did his part then, for he didn't know, and fired up and stood before his sister,
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:41.260]   and he says," says he, as bold as a lion, "if my lord had told us where the papers
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.140]   be, we would die before we would betray him.
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:48.360]   But we are children and know nothing, and it is cowardly of you to try to fright us
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.540]   with oaths and drawn swords."
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:57.020]   As F quoted from the book, Seth planted himself before Tilly with the long poker in his hand,
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:01.420]   saying as he flourished it valiantly, "Why didn't the boy take his father's sword
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.420]   and lay about him?
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.460]   I would, if anyone was harsh to Tilly."
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:06.700]   "You bantam.
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.460]   He was only a bit of a boy and couldn't do anything.
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:13.740]   Sit down and hear the rest of it," commanded Tilly, with a pat on the yellow head and a
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:19.420]   private resolve that Seth should have the largest piece of pie at dinner next day as
[00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.700]   reward for his chivalry.
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:26.540]   Well, the men went off after turning the castle out of window, but they said they should come
[00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:31.220]   again, so faithful Matilda was full of trouble and hardly dared to leave the room where the
[00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.820]   chair stood.
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:37.700]   All day she sat there, and at night her sleep was so full of fear about it that she often
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.280]   got up and went to see that all was safe.
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:45.380]   The servants thought the fright had hurt her wits and let her be, but Rupert, the boy,
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:49.100]   stood by her and never was afraid of her queer ways.
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:54.240]   She was a pious maid, the book says, and often spent the long evenings reading the Bible
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.980]   with her brother by her, all alone in the great room, with no one to help her bear her
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.120]   secret and no good news of her father.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:07.340]   At last word came that the king was dead and his friends banished out of England.
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:11.900]   Then the poor children were in a sad plight, for they had no mother, and the servants all
[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:16.180]   ran away, leaving only one faithful old man to help them.
[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:19.340]   "But the father did come," cried Roxy eagerly.
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:24.340]   "You'll see," continued F., half telling, half reading.
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:29.120]   Matilda was sure he would, so she sat on in the big chair, guarding the papers, and no
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:34.260]   one could get her away, till one day a man came with her father's ring and told her
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.140]   to give up the secret.
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:40.500]   She knew the ring, but would not tell until she had asked many questions, so as to be
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:45.460]   very sure, and while the man answered all about her father and the king, she looked
[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.000]   at him sharply.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.180]   Then she stood up and said, in a tremble, for there was something strange about the
[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:56.600]   man, "Sir, I doubt you in spite of the ring, and I will not answer till you pull off the
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:01.580]   false beard you wear, that I may see your face and know if you are my father's friend
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.420]   or foe."
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:08.460]   Off came the disguise, and Matilda found it was my lord himself come to take them with
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.000]   him out of England.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.780]   He was very proud of that faithful girl, I guess, for the old chair still stands in the
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.780]   castle and the name keeps in the family.
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:23.260]   Pa says, even over here, where some of the Bassets came along with the pilgrims.
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:28.420]   "Our Tilly would have been as brave, I know, and she looks like the old picture down to
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:34.260]   grandma's, don't she, F?" cried Prue, who admired her bold, bright sister very much.
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.660]   "Well, I think you'd do the setting part best, Prue.
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.220]   You are so patient.
[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:43.780]   Till would fight like a wild cat, but she can't hold her tongue worth a cent," answered
[00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:48.940]   F, whereat Tilly pulled his hair and the story ended with a general frolic.
[00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:53.020]   When the moon-faced clock behind the door struck nine, Tilly tucked up the children
[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:58.900]   under the "extra comfortables" and, having kissed them all around as mother did, crept
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:05.100]   into her own nest, never minding the little drifts of snow that sifted in upon her coverlet
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:09.820]   between the shingles of the roof, nor the storm that raged without.
[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:16.260]   As if he felt the need of unusual vigilance, old Bose lay down on the mat before the door,
[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.280]   and Pussy had the warm hearth all to herself.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:23.940]   If any late wanderer had looked in at midnight, he would have seen the fire blazing up again,
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:30.380]   and in the cheerful glow the old cat blinking her yellow eyes as she sat bolt upright beside
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:36.580]   the spinning wheel, like some sort of household goblin, guarding the children while they slept.
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:41.580]   When they woke, like early birds, it still snowed, but up the little bassets jumped,
[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:46.580]   broke the ice in their pitchers, and went down with cheeks glowing like winter apples,
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.000]   after a brisk scrub and scramble into their clothes.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   F was off to the barn, and Tilly soon had a great kettle of mush ready, which, with
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.760]   milk warm from the cows, made a wholesome breakfast for the seven hardy children.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:05.040]   "Now, about dinner," said the young housekeeper as the pewter spoons stopped clattering and
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.980]   the earthen bowls stood empty.
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:12.700]   Ma said, "Have what we like," but she didn't expect us to have a real Thanksgiving
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:18.740]   dinner because she won't be here to cook it and we don't know how, began Prue doubtfully.
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:23.000]   "I can roast a turkey and make a pudding as well as anybody, I guess.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.460]   The pies are all ready, and if we can't boil vegetables and so on, we don't deserve
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:34.100]   any dinner," cried Tilly, burning to distinguish herself and bound to enjoy to the utmost her
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.100]   brief authority.
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:39.100]   "Yes, yes," cried all the boys, "let's have a dinner anyway.
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:43.380]   Ma won't care and the good victuals will spoil if they ain't eaten right up."
[00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.900]   "Pa is coming tonight, so we won't have dinner till late.
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:53.320]   That will be real genteel and give us plenty of time," added Tilly, suddenly realizing
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.300]   the novelty of the tasks she had undertaken.
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:01.100]   "Did you ever roast a turkey?" asked Roxy with an air of deep interest.
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:05.860]   "Should you darest to try?" said Rhodie in an awestricken tone.
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.940]   "You will see what I can do.
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.900]   Ma said I was to use my judgment about things and I'm going to.
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:16.260]   All you children have got to do is keep out of the way and let Prue and me work.
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:20.640]   F, I wish you'd put a fire in the best room so the little ones can play in there.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.060]   We shall want the setting room for the table, and I won't have 'em picking round when
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:29.860]   we get things fixed," commanded Tilly, bound to make her short reign a brilliant one.
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.020]   "I don't know about that.
[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:38.580]   Ma didn't tell us to," began cautious F, who felt that this invasion of the sacred
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.620]   best parlor was a daring step.
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.340]   "Don't we always do it Sundays and Thanksgivings?
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:48.060]   Wouldn't Ma wish the children kept safe and warm anyhow?
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.860]   Can I get up a nice dinner with four rascals under my feet all the time?
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:55.940]   Come now, if you want roast turkey and onions, plum pudding and mince pie, you'll have
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:59.100]   to do as I tell you and be lively about it."
[00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:05.340]   Tilly spoke with such spirit, and her suggestion was so irresistible that F gave in and, laughing
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:10.900]   good-naturedly, tramped away to heat up the best room, devoutly hoping that nothing serious
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:14.100]   would happen to punish such audacity.
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:18.620]   The young folks delightedly trooped in to destroy the order of that prim apartment with
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:24.260]   housekeeping under the black horsehair sofa, horseback riders on the arms of the best rocking
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:30.420]   chair, and an Indian war dance all over the well-waxed furniture.
[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:37.420]   F, finding the society of peaceful sheep and cows more to his mind than that of two excited
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:43.100]   sisters, lingered over his chores in the barn as long as possible, and left the girls in
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.100]   peace.
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:49.100]   Now, Tilly and Prue were in their glory, and as soon as the breakfast things were out of
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:53.140]   the way, they prepared for a grand cooking time.
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:57.420]   They were handy girls, though they had never heard of a cooking school, never touched a
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:02.620]   piano and knew nothing of embroidery beyond the samplers which hung framed in the parlor,
[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:08.500]   one ornamented with a pink mortar under a blue weeping willow, the other with this pleasing
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:14.220]   verse, each word being done in a different color, which gave the effect of a distracted
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.220]   rainbow.
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:23.980]   "This sampler neat was worked by me in my twelfth year, Prudence B."
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:28.660]   Both rolled up their sleeves, put on their largest aprons, and got out all the spoons,
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:34.100]   dishes, pots, and pans they could find, so as to have everything handy, as Prue said.
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.020]   "Now, sister, we'll have dinner at five.
[00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:41.820]   Pa will be here by that time, if he is coming tonight, and be so surprised to find us all
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:46.980]   ready, for he won't have had any very nice victuals if Grandma is so sick," said Tilly
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:47.980]   importantly.
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.420]   "I shall give the children a piece at noon."
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:51.580]   Tilly meant luncheon.
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:55.340]   "Donuts and cheese, with apple pie and cider will please him.
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:59.380]   There's beans for F. He likes cold pork, so we won't stop to warm it up, for there's
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:04.620]   lots to do, and I don't mind saying to you, I'm dreadful dubious about the turkey.
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:08.180]   It's all ready but the stuffing, and roasting is as easy as can be.
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.180]   I can baste first rate.
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:11.700]   Ma always likes to have me.
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:16.540]   I'm so patient and steady," she says, answered Prue, for the responsibility of this great
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:20.940]   undertaking did not rest upon her, so she took a cheerful view of things.
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:25.620]   "I know, but it's the stuffing that troubles me," said Tilly, rubbing her round elbows
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:29.220]   as she eyed the immense fowl laid out on a platter before her.
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:33.660]   "I don't know how much I want, nor what sort of herbs to put in, and he's so awful
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.740]   big I'm kind of afraid of him."
[00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:36.740]   "I ain't.
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:40.220]   I fed him all summer and he never gobbled at me.
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:44.900]   I feel real mean to be thinking of gobbling him, poor old chap," laughed Prue, patting
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.900]   her departed pet with an air of mingled affection and appetite.
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:53.580]   "Well, I'll get the pudding off my mind first, throw it out to bile all day, put the
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:57.220]   big kettle on and see that the spit is clean while I get ready."
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:02.500]   Prue obediently tugged away at the crane with its black hooks from which hung the iron tea
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.500]   kettle and three-legged pot.
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:10.500]   Then she settled the long spit in the grooves made for it in the tall andirons and put the
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:15.620]   dripping pan underneath, for in those days meat was roasted as it should be, not baked
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:16.620]   in ovens.
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.420]   Meantime, Tilly attacked the plum pudding.
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:24.260]   She felt pretty sure of coming out right here, for she had seen her mother do it so many
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.740]   times it looked very easy.
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:33.540]   So in went suet and fruit, all sorts of spice, to be sure she got the right ones, and brandy
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:35.060]   instead of wine.
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:39.780]   But she forgot both sugar and salt and tied it in the cloth so tightly that it had no
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:44.860]   room to swell, so it would come out as heavy as lead and as hard as a cannonball if the
[00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:47.660]   bag did not burst and spoil it all.
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:52.540]   Happily unconscious of these mistakes, Tilly popped it into the pot and proudly watched
[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:56.340]   it bobbing about before she put the cover on and left it to its fate.
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:01.060]   "I can't remember what flavor in ma puts in," she said when she had got her bread
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.220]   well soaked for the stuffing.
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:08.120]   "Sage and onions and applesauce go with goose, but I can't feel sure of anything
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.500]   but pepper and salt for a turkey."
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:16.300]   "Ma puts in some kind of mint, I know, but I forget whether it is spearmint, peppermint,
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:20.620]   or pennyroyal," answered Prue in a tone of doubt, but trying to show her knowledge
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.500]   of herbs, or at least of their names.
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:27.980]   "Seems to me it's sweet marjoram, or some are savory.
[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:31.180]   I guess we'll put both in, and then we're sure to be right.
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:35.700]   The best is up, Garrett, you run and get some while I mash the bread," commanded Tilly,
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.500]   diving into the mess.
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:44.660]   Away trotted Prue, but in her haste she got catnip and wormwood, for the Garrett was darkish
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:49.940]   and Prue's little nose was so full of the smell of the onions she had been peeling that
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.060]   everything smelt of them.
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:56.440]   Eager to be of use, she pounded up the herbs and scattered the mixture with a liberal hand
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.260]   into the bowl.
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:02.760]   "It doesn't smell just right, but I suppose it will when it is cooked," said Tilly,
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:07.700]   as she filled the empty stomach that seemed aching for food, and sewed it up with the
[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.020]   blue yarn which happened to be handy.
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:15.140]   She forgot to tie down his legs and wings, but she set him by till his hour came, well
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:16.860]   satisfied with her work.
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.940]   "Shall we roast the little pig too?
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:23.940]   I think he'd look nice with a necklace of sausages as Ma fixed one last Christmas,"
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:26.140]   asked Prue, elated with their success.
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:27.820]   "I couldn't do it.
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.820]   I loved that little pig and cried when he was killed.
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:36.220]   I should feel as if I was roasting the baby," answered Tilly, glancing toward the buttery
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:42.260]   where Piggy hung, looking so pink and pretty it certainly did seem cruel to eat him.
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:46.980]   It took a long time to get all the vegetables ready, for, as the cellar was full, the girls
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.260]   thought they would have every sort.
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:54.500]   F helped and by noon all was ready for cooking, and the cranberry sauce, a good deal scorched,
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.940]   was cooking in the lean-to.
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:01.380]   Luncheon was a lively meal, and donuts and cheese vanished in such quantities that Tilly
[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:05.700]   feared no one would have an appetite for her sumptuous dinner.
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:10.520]   The boys assured her they would be starving by five o'clock, and soul mourned bitterly
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.300]   over the little pig that was not to be served up.
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:18.380]   "Now, you all go and coast while Prue and I set the table and get out the best chiny,"
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:23.420]   said Tilly, bent on having her dinner look well, no matter what its other failings might
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:24.480]   be.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:30.660]   Out came the rough sleds, on went the round hoods, old hats, red cloaks and moccasins,
[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:35.840]   and away trudged the four younger Bassets to disport themselves in the snow and try
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:41.060]   the ice down by the old mill, where the great wheel turned and splashed so merrily in the
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.060]   summertime.
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:46.620]   F took his fiddle and scraped away to his heart's content in the parlor, while the
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:51.420]   girls, after a short rest, set the table and made all ready to dish up the dinner when
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.480]   that exciting moment came.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:59.660]   It was not at all the sort of table we see now, but would look very plain and countrified
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:07.300]   to us, with its green-handled knives and two-pronged steel forks, its red and white china and pewter
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:13.180]   platters scoured till they shone, with mugs and spoons to match, and a brown jug for the
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.380]   cider.
[00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:20.100]   The cloth was coarse but white as snow, and the little maids had seen the blue-eyed flax
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:25.140]   grow out of which their mother wove the linen they had watched and watered while it bleached
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:26.880]   in the green meadow.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:32.620]   They had no napkins and little silver, but the best-tinkered and maws few wedding spoons
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:35.140]   were set forth in state.
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:38.980]   Nuts and apples at the corners gave an air, and a place of honour was left in the middle
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:40.540]   for the oranges yet to come.
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:46.260]   "Don't it look beautiful?" said Prue, when they paused to admire the general effect.
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.340]   "Pretty nice, I think.
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:53.420]   I wish Ma could see how well we can do it," began Tilly, when a loud howling startled
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:56.080]   both girls and sent them flying to the window.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:00.180]   The short afternoon had passed so quickly that twilight had come before they knew it,
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:04.820]   and now as they looked out through the gathering dusk, they saw four small black figures tearing
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:08.540]   up the road to come bursting in, all screaming at once, "The bear!
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:09.540]   The bear!
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:10.540]   F, get the gun!
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:11.540]   He's coming!
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:12.540]   He's coming!"
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:14.880]   F had dropped his fiddle and got down his gun before the girls could calm the children
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.620]   enough to tell their story, which they did in a somewhat incoherent manner.
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:22.700]   "Down in the holler coasting we heard a growl," began Sol, with his eyes as big
[00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:23.700]   as saucers.
[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:27.700]   "I see him first looking over the wall," roared Seth, eager to get his share of honour.
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:32.340]   "Awful big and shaggy," quavered Roxy, clinging to Tilly while Rhodey hid in Prue's
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:33.580]   skirts and piped out.
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:39.100]   "His great paws kept clawing at us, and I was so scared my legs would hardly go.
[00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:42.540]   We ran away as fast as we could go, and he came growling after us.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:46.700]   'He's awful hungry, and he'll eat every one of us if he gets in,' continued Sol,
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.340]   looking about him for a safe retreat.
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:52.660]   'Oh, F, don't let him eat us!' cried both little girls, flying upstairs to hide
[00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:55.180]   under their mother's bed as their surest shelter.
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:57.380]   'No danger of that, you little geese.
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.140]   I'll shoot him as soon as he comes.
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.460]   Get out of the way, boys!' and F raised the window to get good aim.
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.460]   'There he is!
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:07.900]   Fire away and don't miss!' cried Seth, hastily following Sol, who had climbed to
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:11.900]   the top of the dresser as a good perch from which to view the approaching fray.
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:16.700]   Prue retired to the hearth as if bent on dying at her post rather than desert the turkey,
[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:22.420]   now 'browning beautiful,' as she expressed it, but Tillie stood boldly at the open window,
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:28.700]   ready to lend a hand if the enemy proved too much for F. All had seen bears, but none had
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:36.260]   ever come so near before, and even brave F felt that the big brown beast slowly trotting
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:40.740]   up the dooryard was an unusually formidable specimen.
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:46.140]   He was growling horribly and stopped now and then as if to rest and shake himself.
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:51.580]   'Get the axe, Tillie, and if I should miss, stand ready to keep him off while I load again,'
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:56.460]   said F, anxious to kill his first bear in style and alone.
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.540]   A girl's help didn't count.
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:02.200]   Tillie flew for the axe and was at her brother's side by the time the bear was near enough
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.460]   to be dangerous.
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:10.580]   He stood on his hind legs and seemed to sniff with relish the savory odors that poured out
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.580]   of the window.
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.660]   'Fire, F!' cried Tillie firmly.
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:15.220]   'Wait till he rears again.
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:19.420]   I'll get a better shot then,' answered the boy, while Prue covered her ears to shut
[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:25.500]   out the bang, and the small boys cheered from their dusty refuge among the pumpkins.
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:30.780]   But a very singular thing happened next, and all who saw it stood amazed.
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:34.660]   For suddenly Tillie threw down the axe, flung open the door, and ran straight into the arms
[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:40.220]   of the bear, who stood erect to receive her, while his growlings changed to a loud 'Ha,
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:44.060]   ha!' that startled the children more than the report of a gun.
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:49.660]   'It's Gad Hopkins trying to fool us!' cried F, much disgusted at the loss of his
[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:55.260]   prey, for these hardy boys loved to hunt and prided themselves on the number of wild animals
[00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:57.420]   and birds they could shoot in a year.
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:03.540]   'Oh Gad, how could you scare us so?' laughed Tillie, still held fast in one shaggy arm
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:08.260]   of the bear, while the other drew a dozen oranges from some deep pocket in the buffalo
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:13.980]   skin coat, and fired them into the kitchen with such good aim that F ducked, Prue screamed,
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:17.220]   and Sol and Seth came down much quicker than they went up.
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:22.060]   'Well, you see I got up,' sighed Over yonder, 'and the old horse went home while
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.220]   I was floundering in a drift.
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:28.860]   So I tied on the buffalers to tote 'em easy and come along till I see the children playing
[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:29.860]   in the holler.
[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:33.500]   I just meant to give 'em a little scare, but they run like partridges, and I kept up
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:38.300]   the joke to see how F would like this sort of company, and God ha ha'd again.'
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:41.820]   'You'd have had a warm welcome if we hadn't found you out.
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:46.100]   I'd have put a bullet through you in a jiffy, old chap,' said F, coming out to shake hands
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:49.700]   with the young giant, who was only a year or two older than himself.
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.900]   'Come in and set up to dinner with us.
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:56.260]   Prue and I have done it all ourselves, and Pa will be along soon, I reckon,' cried Tillie,
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:57.260]   trying to escape.
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:59.100]   'Couldn't no ways.
[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:03.500]   My folks will think I'm dead if I don't get along home, since the horse and sleigh
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:04.940]   have gone ahead empty.
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:09.740]   I've done my errant, and I had my joke, and now I want my pay, Tillie.'
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:14.940]   And Gad took a hearty kiss from the rosy cheeks of his little sweetheart, as he called her.
[00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:19.420]   His own cheeks tingled with the smart slap she gave him as she ran away, calling out
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:22.340]   that she hated bears and would bring her axe next time.
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:24.380]   'I ain't afeard.
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:29.780]   Your sharp eyes found me out, and if you run into a bear's arms, you must expect a hug,'
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:33.660]   answered Gad, as he pushed back the robe and settled his fur cap more becomingly.
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:38.660]   'I should have known you in a minute, if I hadn't been asleep when the girls squalled.
[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:41.900]   You did it well, though, and I advise you not to try it again in a hurry, or you'll
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.700]   get shot,' said F, as they parted.
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:48.780]   He rather crestfallen, and Gad in high glee.
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.260]   'My sake's alive.
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:54.260]   The turkey is burnt one side, and the kettles have biled over, so the pies I put to warm
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:59.420]   are all ashes,' scolded Tilly, as the flurry subsided and she remembered her dinner.
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:00.820]   'I can't help it.
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:05.300]   I couldn't think of victuals when I expected to be eaten alive myself, could I?'
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:10.420]   pleaded poor Prue, who had tumbled into the cradle when the rain of oranges began.
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:12.500]   Tilly laughed, and all the rest joined in.
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:18.020]   So good humor was restored, and the spirits of the younger ones were revived by sucks
[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:22.660]   from the one orange which passed from hand to hand with great rapidity while the older
[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:24.500]   girls dished up the dinner.
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:28.900]   They were just struggling to get the pudding out of the cloth when Roxy called out, 'Here's
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:29.900]   Pa!'
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:31.500]   'There's folks with him,' added Rhodey.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.500]   'Lots of 'em.
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:36.620]   I see two big sleighs, chock full!' shouted Seth, peering through the dusk.
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.140]   'It looks like a cemetery.
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:44.020]   Guess Grandma's dead and come up to be buried here,' said Saul in a solemn tone.
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:48.740]   This startling suggestion made Tilly, Prue, and F. hasten to look out, full of dismay
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.060]   at such an ending of their festival.
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:57.420]   'If that is a funeral, the mourners are uncommon jolly,' said F. dryly, as merry
[00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:00.860]   voices and loud laughter broke the white silence without.
[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:05.620]   'I see Aunt Cynthia and Cousin Hetty, and there's Moes and Amos.
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:09.340]   I do declare Pa's bringing 'em all home to have some fun here!' cried Prue as she
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:11.940]   recognized one familiar face after another.
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.540]   'Oh, my patience!
[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:17.620]   Ain't I glad I got dinner, and don't I hope it will turn out good!' exclaimed
[00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:23.100]   Tilly, while the twins pranced with delight and the small boys roared, 'Hooray for Pa!
[00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:25.300]   Hooray for Thanksgiving!'
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:30.020]   The cheer was answered heartily, and in came father, mother, baby, aunts and cousins, all
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:35.180]   in great spirits, and all much surprised to find such a festive welcome awaiting them.
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:40.020]   'Ain't Grandma dead at all?' asked Saul in the midst of the kissing and handshaking.
[00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:42.060]   'Bless your heart, no.
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:44.340]   It was all a mistake of old Mr. Chadwick's.
[00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:49.100]   He's as deaf as an adder, and when Mrs. Brooks told him Mother was mendin' fast and she
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:53.940]   wanted me to come down today, certain sure, he got the message all wrong and give it to
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:57.700]   the first person passin' in such a way as to scare me most to death and send us down
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:59.000]   in a hurry.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.180]   Mother was sittin' up as cherk as you please and dreadful, sorry you didn't all come.'
[00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:07.940]   'So to keep the house quiet for her and give you a taste of the fun, your Pa fetched us
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:12.220]   all up to spend the evening, and we are going to have a jolly time, aren't ya, judged by
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:16.820]   the look of things?' said Aunt Cynthia, briskly finishing the tale when Mrs. Bassett paused
[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:18.060]   for want of breath.
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:22.060]   'What in the world put into your head we was comin' and set you to gettin' up such
[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:26.660]   a supper?' asked Mr. Bassett, lookin' about him, well pleased and much surprised at the
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:28.500]   plentiful table.
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:32.980]   Tilly modestly began to tell, but the others broke in and sang her praises in a sort of
[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:38.300]   chorus in which bears, pigs, pies, and oranges were oddly mixed.
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:43.220]   Great satisfaction was expressed by all, and Tilly and Prue were so elated by the commendation
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:48.880]   of Ma and the aunts that they set forth their dinner, sure everything was perfect.
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:53.440]   But when the eating began, which it did the moment wraps were off, then their pride got
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:59.060]   a fall, for the first person who tasted the stuffing (it was big cousin Moe's and that
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:03.620]   made it harder to bear) nearly choked over the bitter morsel.
[00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:08.260]   'Tilly Bassett, whatever made you put wormwood and catnip in your stuffin'?'
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:13.140]   demanded Ma, trying not to be severe, for all the rest were laughing and Tilly looked
[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:14.140]   ready to cry.
[00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:19.700]   'I did it,' said Prue, nobly taking all the blame, which caused Pa to kiss her on
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:23.940]   the spot and declare that it didn't do a mite of harm, for the turkey was all right.
[00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:26.500]   'I never see onions cooked better.
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:31.020]   All the vegetables is well done, and the dinner a credit to you, my dears,' declared Aunt
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:35.380]   Cynthia with her mouth full of the fragrant vegetables she praised.
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:41.260]   The pudding was an utter failure, in spite of the blazing brandy in which it lay, as
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:46.740]   hard and heavy as one of the stone balls on Squire Duncan's great gate.
[00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:52.540]   It was speedily whisked out of sight, and all fell upon the pies, which were perfect.
[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:56.940]   But Tilly and Prue were much depressed, and didn't recover their spirits till the dinner
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:00.620]   was over and the evening fun well underway.
[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:06.700]   Blind Man's Bluff, Hunt the Slipper, Come, Philander, and other lively games soon set
[00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:13.620]   every one bubbling over with jollity, and when F. struck up Money Musk on his fiddle,
[00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:16.700]   old and young fell into their places for a dance.
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:21.020]   All down the long kitchen they stood, Mr. and Mrs. Bassett at the top, the twins at
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:26.180]   the bottom, and then away they went, heeling and toeing, cutting pigeon wings and taking
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:31.820]   their steps in a way that would convulse modern children with their new-fangled romps called
[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:33.020]   dancing.
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:37.740]   Mose and Tilly covered themselves with glory by the vigor with which they kept it up, till
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:43.500]   Fat Aunt Cynthia fell into a chair, breathlessly declaring that a very little of such exercise
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:46.860]   was enough for a woman of her heft.
[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:51.540]   Apples and cider, chat and singing finished the evening, and after a grand kissing all
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:56.620]   around, the guests drove away in the clear moonlight which came out just in time to cheer
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:58.740]   their long drive.
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:03.160]   When the jingle of the last bell had died away, Mr. Bassett said soberly as they stood
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:08.700]   together on the hearth, "Children, we have special cause to be thankful that the sorrow
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:11.620]   we expected was changed into joy.
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:17.100]   So we'll read a chapter before we go to bed and give thanks where thanks is due."
[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:21.700]   Then Tilly set out the lightstand with the big Bible on it and a candle on each side,
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:26.500]   and all sat quietly in the firelight, smiling as they listened with happy hearts to the
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:31.860]   sweet old words that fit all times and seasons so beautifully.
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:36.620]   When the good nights were over and the children in bed, Prue put her arm around Tilly and
[00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:42.380]   whispered tenderly, for she felt her shake and was sure she was crying, "Don't mind
[00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:44.540]   about the old stuffin' and puttin', dearie.
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:45.820]   Nobody cared."
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:50.420]   And Ma said, "We really did no surprisein' well for such young girls."
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:56.340]   The laughter Tilly was trying to smother broke out then, and was so infectious, Prue could
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:39:00.540]   not help joining her, even before she knew the cause of the merriment.
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:04.260]   "I was mad about the mistakes, but don't care enough to cry.
[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:07.940]   I'm laughing to think how Gad fooled F and I found him out.
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:12.460]   I thought Moes and Amos would have died over it when I told them it was so funny," explained
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.140]   Tilly when she got her breath.
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:18.660]   "I was so scared that when the first orange hit me I thought it was a bullet and scrabbled
[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:20.980]   into the cradle as fast as I could.
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:26.420]   It was real mean to frighten the little ones so," laughed Prue, as Tilly gave a growl.
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:31.820]   Here a smart rap on the wall of the next bedroom caused a sudden lull in the fun, and Mrs.
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:36.540]   Bassett's voice was heard, saying warningly, "Girls, go to sleep immediate or you'll
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:37.540]   wake the baby."
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:41.020]   "Yes, mam," answered two meek voices.
[00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:47.700]   And after a few irrepressible giggles, silence reigned, broken only by an occasional snore
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:53.580]   from the boys, or the soft scurry of mice in the buttery, taking their part in this
[00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:55.660]   old-fashioned Thanksgiving.
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:40:05.660]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
