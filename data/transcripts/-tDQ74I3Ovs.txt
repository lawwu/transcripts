[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   The following is a conversation with Sarah Walker,
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.000]   an astrobiologist and theoretical physicist
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.620]   at Arizona State University and the Santa Fe Institute.
[00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.960]   She's interested in the origin of life,
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.540]   how to find life on other worlds,
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.880]   and in general, the more fundamental question
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.160]   of what even life is.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.280]   She seeks to discover the universal laws
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.420]   that describe living systems on earth and elsewhere
[00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.440]   using physics, biology, and computation.
[00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.360]   Quick mention of our sponsors, Athletic Greens,
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.360]   NetSuite, Blinkist, and Magic Spoon.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.260]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.380]   As a side note, let me say that my hope for this podcast
[00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.060]   is to try and alternate between technical
[00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.000]   and non-technical discussions,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.680]   to jump from the big picture
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.000]   down to specific detailed research
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.800]   and back to the big picture,
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.680]   and to do so with scientists and non-scientists.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.340]   Long-term, I hope to alternate between discussions
[00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.920]   of cutting-edge research in AI, physics, biology,
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.280]   to topics of music, sport, and history,
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.360]   and then back to AI.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.680]   AI is home.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.260]   I hope you come along with me
[00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.520]   for that wild, oscillating journey.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.340]   Some people message me saying to slow down
[00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.040]   since they're falling behind on the episodes
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.760]   of this podcast.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.960]   To their disappointment, I have to say
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.560]   that I'll probably do more episodes, not less,
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.600]   but you really don't need to listen to every episode.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.540]   Just listen to the ones that spark your curiosity.
[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.720]   Think about it like a party full of strangers.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.760]   You don't have to talk to everyone.
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.840]   Just walk over to the ones who look interesting
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.320]   and get to know them.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.420]   And if you're lucky, that one conversation with a stranger
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.680]   might change the direction of your life.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.280]   And it's a short life, so be picky with the strangers
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.560]   you talk to at this metaphorical party.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.560]   This is the Lux Friedman Podcast,
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.580]   and here is my conversation with Sarah Walker.
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.680]   How did life originate on Earth?
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.520]   What are the various hypotheses
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.040]   for how life originated on Earth?
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.160]   - Yeah, so I guess you're asking a historical question,
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.060]   which is always a good place to start thinking about life.
[00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.680]   So there's a lot of ideas about how life started on Earth.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.640]   Probably the most popular is what's called
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.560]   the RNA world scenario.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.960]   So this idea is probably the one
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.080]   that you'll see most reported in the news,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.960]   and is based on the idea that there are
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.420]   molecules in our bodies that relay genetic information,
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.460]   and we know those as DNA, obviously,
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.980]   but there's also sort of an intermediary
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.940]   called RNA, ribonucleic acid,
[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.260]   that also plays the role of proteins.
[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.780]   And people came up with this idea in the '80s
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.220]   that maybe that was the first genetic material
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.620]   because it could play both roles
[00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.420]   of being genetic and performing catalysis.
[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.780]   And then somehow that idea got reduced
[00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.580]   to this idea that there was a molecule
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.300]   that emerged on early Earth
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.660]   and underwent Darwinian evolution,
[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.380]   and that was the start of life.
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.420]   So there's a lot of assumptions packed in there
[00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.360]   that we could unpack,
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.260]   but that's sort of the leading hypothesis.
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.300]   There's also other ideas about life starting as metabolism,
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.700]   and so that's more connected
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.420]   to the geochemistry of early Earth,
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.580]   and would be kind of more focused on this idea
[00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.980]   that you get some kind of catalytic cycle
[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.100]   of molecules that can reproduce themselves
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.900]   and form some kind of metabolism,
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.340]   and then life starts basically as self-organization,
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.340]   and then you have to explain how evolution comes later.
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.740]   - Right, so that's the difference
[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.740]   between sort of energy and genetic code?
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.500]   So like energy and information,
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.660]   are those the two kind of things there?
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.260]   - Yeah, I think that's a good way of putting it.
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.380]   It's kind of funny 'cause I think most of the people
[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.820]   that think about these things are really disciplinary biased,
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.540]   so the people that tend to think about genetics
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.820]   come from a biology background
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.660]   and they're really evolution-focused,
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.980]   and so they're worried about
[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.620]   where does the information come from
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.860]   and how does it change over time,
[00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.920]   but they're talking about information in a really narrow way
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.460]   where they're talking about a genetic sequence,
[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.060]   and then most of the people that think about metabolism,
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.500]   origins of life scenarios,
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.980]   tend to be people like physicists or geochemists
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.620]   that are worried about what are the energy sources
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.940]   and what kinds of organization
[00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.140]   can you get out of those energy sources.
[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.900]   - Okay, so which one's your favorite?
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.500]   - I don't like either.
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.260]   - Okay, can we talk about them
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.380]   for a little bit longer though?
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.580]   - Yeah, no, that's fine.
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.740]   (laughing)
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.060]   - So okay, so there's early Earth.
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.060]   What was that like?
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.240]   Was there just mostly covered by oceans?
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.740]   Was there heat sources, energy sources?
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.300]   So if we talk about the metabolism view
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.420]   of the origin of life, where was the source of energy?
[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.740]   - Probably the most popular view
[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.260]   for where the origin of life happened on Earth
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.540]   is hydrothermal vents because they had sufficient energy,
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.220]   and so we don't really know a lot about early Earth.
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.460]   We have some ideas about when oceans first formed
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.460]   and things like that, but the time of the origin of life
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.140]   is kind of not well understood or pinned down,
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.280]   and the conditions on Earth at that time are not well known.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.620]   But a lot of people do think
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.620]   that there was probably hydrothermal vents,
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.060]   which are really hot, chemically active regions,
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.680]   say on the sea floor in modern times,
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.740]   which also would have been present on early Earth,
[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.980]   and they would have provided energy and organics
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.180]   and basically all of the right conditions
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.220]   for the origins of life, which is one of the reasons
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.820]   that we look for these hydrothermal systems
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.300]   when we're talking about life elsewhere too.
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.020]   - Okay, and for the genetic code,
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.180]   the idea is that the RNA is the first,
[00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.180]   like why would RNA be the first moment you can say it's life?
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.460]   I guess the idea is it could both
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.920]   have persistent information,
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.320]   and then it can also do some of the work of like, what,
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.080]   creating a self-sustaining organism?
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.900]   - Yeah, that's the basic idea.
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.560]   So the idea is you have, in an RNA molecule,
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.280]   you have a sequence of characters, say,
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.760]   so you can treat it like a string in a computer,
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.740]   and it can be copied, so information can be propagated,
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.960]   which is important for evolution,
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.340]   because evolution happens
[00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.540]   by having inheritance of information.
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.580]   So for example, like my eyes are brown
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.880]   because my mother's eyes were brown.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.180]   So you need that copying of information,
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.180]   but then you also have the ability to perform catalysis,
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.400]   which means that that RNA molecule
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.040]   is not inert in that environment,
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.980]   but it actually interacts with something
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.280]   and could potentially mediate, say, a metabolism
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.000]   that could then fuel the actual reproduction
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.420]   of that molecule.
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:40.220]   So in some ways, people think that RNA gives you,
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.520]   you know, the most bang for your buck in a single molecule,
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.220]   and therefore, you know, it gives you all the features
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.940]   that you might think are life.
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.360]   And so this is sort of where this RNA world conjecture
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.600]   came from, is because of those two properties.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.120]   - Isn't it amazing that RNA came to be in general?
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.140]   Isn't it? - Yes, that is amazing.
[00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.680]   - Okay, so we're not talking down about RNA.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.840]   - No, no, I love RNA.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.200]   It's one of my favorite molecules.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.760]   I think it's beautiful. - It's just not step one.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.860]   - Yeah, I think the issue,
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.020]   it's not even the RNA world is a problem.
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.860]   And actually, if you really dig into it,
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.380]   the RNA world is not one hypothesis.
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.220]   It is a set of hypotheses.
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:27.340]   And they range from a molecule of RNA spontaneously emerged
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.740]   on the early Earth and started evolving,
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.840]   which is kind of like the hardest RNA world scenario,
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:32.820]   which is the one I cited,
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.620]   and I get a little animated about
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.340]   'cause it seems so blatantly wrong to me,
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.740]   but that's a separate story.
[00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.140]   And then the other one is actually something I agree with,
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.500]   which is that you can say there was an RNA world
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.180]   because RNA was the first genetic material
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.340]   for life on Earth.
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:54.740]   So an RNA world could just be the earliest organisms
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.540]   that had genetics in a modern sense,
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.040]   didn't have DNA evolved yet, they had RNA.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.820]   Right, and so that's sort of a softer RNA world scenario
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.220]   in the sense that it doesn't mean
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.180]   it was the first thing that happened,
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.460]   but it was a thing that definitely was part
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.820]   of the lineage of events that led to us.
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:16.300]   - So if life was like a best of album,
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.860]   it would be one of the songs on there.
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:19.900]   - Yes. - One of the early songs.
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:20.740]   Okay.
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.700]   - It's on the greatest hits.
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.760]   - Greatest hits, that's the word I was looking for.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.760]   Okay, did life, do you think, originate once, twice,
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.780]   three times on Earth, multiple times?
[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:31.800]   What do you think?
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.340]   - I think that's a really difficult question.
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:35.540]   - Is it an important question?
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:37.260]   - It's a super important question, no.
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.100]   No, it's a really important question.
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:45.540]   There's a lot of questions in that question.
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.620]   So one of the first ones that I think needs to be addressed
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.040]   is is the original life a continuous process on our planet?
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.420]   So we think about the original life as something
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.200]   that happened on Earth, say, almost four billion years ago,
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.080]   because we have evidence of life emerging
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.520]   very early on our planet.
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.140]   And then an original life event, quote unquote,
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.660]   a singular event, whatever that was, happened.
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.420]   And then all life on Earth that we know
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.800]   is a descendant of that particular event
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.820]   in our universe, right?
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:19.820]   And so, but we don't have any idea one way or the other
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:25.060]   if the original life is happening repeatedly,
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.340]   and maybe it's just not taking off
[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:27.700]   because life is already established.
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.580]   That's an argument that people will make.
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.180]   Or maybe there are alternative forms of life on Earth
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.380]   that we don't even recognize.
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.900]   So this is the idea of a shadow biosphere,
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.100]   that there actually might just be
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.540]   completely other life on Earth,
[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.980]   but it's so alien that we don't even know what it is.
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.460]   - I'm gonna have to talk to you about the shadow biosphere.
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.460]   - Yeah, that's a fun one.
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.980]   - In a second, but first, let me ask for the other
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.460]   alternative, which is panspermia.
[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:52.280]   - Right.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.340]   - So that's the idea, the hypothesis that life exists
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.340]   elsewhere in the universe and got to us
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.860]   in like an asteroid or a planetoid or some,
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.660]   according to Wikipedia, space dust,
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:03.960]   whatever the heck that is.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.420]   It sounds fun, but basically it rode along
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.820]   whatever kind of rock and got to us.
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.020]   Do you think that's at all a possibility?
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.540]   - Sure, so I think the reason that most
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.700]   original life scientists are interested
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.700]   in the original life on Earth and say not the original life
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.820]   on Mars and then panspermia, the exchange of life
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.380]   between planets being the explanation,
[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.020]   is once you start removing the original life from Earth,
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.840]   you know even less about it than you do
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.060]   if you study it on Earth.
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.780]   Although I think there are ways of reformulating the problem.
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.580]   This is why I said earlier, oh, you mean the historical
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.860]   original life problem, you don't mean the problem
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.900]   of how does life arise in the universe
[00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.340]   and what the universal principles are,
[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.780]   because there's this historic problem,
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.420]   how did it happen on early Earth?
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.140]   And there's a more tractable general problem
[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.260]   of how does it happen?
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.580]   And how does it happen is something
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:57.980]   we can actually ask in the lab.
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.740]   How did it happen on early Earth
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.220]   is a much more detailed and nuanced question.
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.500]   It requires detailed knowledge of what was happening
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.980]   on early Earth that we don't have.
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.380]   And I'm personally more interested in general mechanisms,
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.180]   so to me it doesn't matter if it happened on Earth
[00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.180]   or it happened on Mars.
[00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.700]   It just matters that it happened.
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.520]   We have evidence it happened.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.220]   The question is, did it happen more than once
[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.340]   in our universe?
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.300]   And so the reason I don't find panspermia
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:28.780]   as a particularly, I think it's a fascinating hypothesis.
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.020]   I definitely think it's possible.
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.860]   And I in particular think it's possible
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.180]   once you get to the stage of life where you have technology
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:40.280]   because then you obviously can spread out into the cosmos.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.980]   But it's also possible for microbes
[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.460]   because we know that certain microorganisms
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.060]   can survive the journey in space
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:50.980]   and they can live in a rock and go between Mars and Earth.
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:51.980]   Like people have done experiments
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.140]   to try to prove that could work.
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.100]   So in that scenario, it's super cool
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.340]   'cause then you get planetary exchange.
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.560]   But say we go look for life on Mars
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.780]   and it ends up being exactly the same life we have on Earth,
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.360]   biochemically speaking,
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.740]   then we haven't really discovered something new
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:06.980]   about the universe.
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.580]   What kind of aliens are possible?
[00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.780]   Were there other original life events?
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:12.980]   If all the life we ever find
[00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.740]   is the same original life event in the universe,
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.580]   it doesn't help me solve my problem.
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.380]   - But it's possible that that would be a sign
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:22.260]   that you could separate the environment
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.780]   from the basic ingredients.
[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:25.860]   - Yes, that's true.
[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.860]   - You can have like a life gun
[00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.140]   that you shoot throughout the universe.
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:33.180]   And then like once you shoot it,
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.900]   it's like the Simpsons with a make-up gun.
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.300]   That was a great episode.
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:40.860]   When you shoot this life gun, it'll find the Earth's.
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.340]   It'll like get sticky.
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.140]   It'll stick to the Earth's.
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.820]   And that kind of reduces the barrier
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.580]   of like the time it takes,
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.860]   the luck it takes to actually from nothing,
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.620]   from the basic chemistry,
[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.260]   from the basic physics of the universe
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.500]   for the life to spring up.
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.740]   - Yeah, I think this is actually super important
[00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.100]   to just think about like does life
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.500]   getting seated on a planet
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.820]   have to be geochemically compatible with that planet?
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.340]   So you're suggesting like we could just shoot guns in space
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.140]   and like life could go to Mars
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:16.500]   and then it would just live there and be happy there.
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.420]   But that's actually an open question.
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:19.500]   So one of the things I was gonna say
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.820]   in response to your question
[00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.180]   about whether the origin of life happened once
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.860]   or multiple times is for me personally right now
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.420]   in my thinking, although this changes on a weekly basis,
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:31.780]   but is that I think of life more as a planetary phenomena.
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:32.780]   So I think the origin of life
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:37.420]   because life is so intimately tied to planetary cycles
[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:38.940]   and planetary processes.
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.020]   And this goes all the way back
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.580]   through the history of our planet
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.260]   that the origin of life itself grew out of geochemistry
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.340]   and became coupled and controlled geochemistry.
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.220]   And when we start to talk about life existing on the planet
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.260]   is when we have evidence of life
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.180]   actually influencing properties of the planet.
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:59.260]   And so if life is a planetary property,
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.700]   then going to Mars is not a trivial thing
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:05.540]   because you basically have to make Mars more Earth-like.
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.620]   And so in some sense,
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.500]   like when I think about sort of long-term vision
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.740]   of humans in space, for example,
[00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.060]   really what you're talking about when you're saying
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.660]   let's send our civilization to Mars
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.700]   is you're not saying let's send our civilization to Mars,
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.940]   you're saying let's reproduce our planet on Mars.
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.260]   Like the information from our planet
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.220]   actually has to go to Mars and make Mars more Earth-like,
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.600]   which means that you're now having a reproduction process,
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.980]   like a cell reproduces itself
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.580]   to propagate information in the future.
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.320]   Planets have to figure out how to reproduce their conditions
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.020]   including geochemical conditions on other planets
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.400]   in order to actually reproduce life in the universe,
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.740]   which is kind of a little bit radical.
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.380]   But I think for long-term sustainability
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:47.300]   of life on a planet, that's absolutely essential.
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:50.380]   - Okay, so if we were to think about
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.800]   life as a planetary phenomena,
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.100]   and so life on Mars would be best
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.580]   if it's way different than life on Earth,
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:02.580]   we have to ask the very basic question of what is life?
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:06.180]   - I actually don't think that's the right question to ask.
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:07.700]   It took me a long time to get there, right?
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:08.780]   - You cross it out?
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.660]   - Yeah, you cross it off your list, it's wrong.
[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.020]   - Next question.
[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.220]   - No, no, no, I mean, I think it has an answer,
[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.100]   but I think part of the problem is,
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.060]   most of the places in science where we get really stuck
[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.260]   is because we don't know what questions to ask.
[00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.020]   And so you can't answer a question
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.860]   if you're asking the wrong question.
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.380]   And I think the way I think about it
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.180]   is obviously I'm interested in what life is,
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.500]   so I'm being a little cheeky when I say
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.580]   that's the wrong question to ask.
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.420]   That's exactly the question
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.140]   that's the core of my existence.
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:41.300]   But I think the way of framing that is
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.940]   what is it about our universe that allows features
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.460]   that we associate life to be there?
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.340]   And so really what I guess when I'm asking that question,
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.660]   what I'm after is an explanatory framework
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.380]   for what life is, right?
[00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.420]   And so most people, they try to go in and define life
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.700]   and they say, well, life is, say,
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.700]   a self-reproducing chemical system
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.020]   capable of Darwinian evolution.
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.460]   That's a very popular definition for life.
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.380]   Or life is something that metabolizes and eats.
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.100]   That is not how I think about life.
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:13.300]   What I think about life is there are principles
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.660]   and laws that govern our universe
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.020]   that we don't understand yet
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:22.380]   that have something to do with how information interacts
[00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:23.700]   with the physical world.
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.340]   I don't know exactly what I mean even when I say that
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.500]   because we don't know these rules.
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:32.220]   But it's a little bit like, I like to use analogies.
[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.540]   You'll give me time to be like a little long-winded
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:36.740]   for a second, even in essay.
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.580]   But sort of like if you look at the history of physics,
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:40.780]   for example, this is like,
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.620]   so we are in the period of the development
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.180]   of thought on our planet
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.140]   where we don't understand what we are yet, right?
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.700]   There was a period of thought in the history of our planet
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.860]   where we didn't understand what gravity was.
[00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.740]   And we didn't understand, for example,
[00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:59.340]   that the planets in the heavens were actually planets
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:02.060]   or that they operated by the same laws that we did.
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.140]   And so there has been this sort of progression
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.460]   of getting a deeper understanding
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.580]   of explaining basic phenomena like,
[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:11.340]   I'm not gonna drop the cup, I'll drop the water bottle.
[00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:12.180]   There you go.
[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.140]   Okay, that fell, right?
[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:14.300]   But why did that fall?
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:19.220]   This is why I'm a theorist, not an experimentalist.
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.820]   - That could have gone wrong in so many ways.
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:21.660]   - I know, it could have,
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.660]   especially if I did the cup and it smashed.
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.500]   Anyway.
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.700]   So if you think, you take this view
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.460]   that there's sort of some missing principles,
[00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.700]   I associate them to information.
[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.380]   And what the sort of feeling there is,
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:39.060]   there's some missing explanatory framework
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.420]   for how our universe works.
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.380]   And if we understood that physics,
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.540]   it would explain what we are.
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.220]   It might also explain a lot of other features
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.580]   we don't associate to life.
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:51.740]   And so it's a little like people accept the fact
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.300]   that gravity is a universal phenomena.
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.500]   But when we wanna study gravity,
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.380]   we study things like large scale,
[00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:02.700]   galactic structures or black holes or planets.
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.340]   If we wanna understand information
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:05.820]   and how it operates in the physical world,
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:08.340]   we study intelligent systems or living systems
[00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.940]   because they are the manifestation of that physics.
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.860]   And the fact that we can't see that clearly yet,
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.660]   or we don't have that explanatory framework,
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.380]   I think it's just because we haven't been thinking
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:18.660]   about the problem deeply enough.
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.460]   But I feel like if you're explaining something,
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:24.100]   you're deriving it from some more fundamental property.
[00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:28.740]   And of course, I have to say I'm wearing my physicist hat.
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:31.700]   So I have a huge bias of liking simple,
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.820]   elegant explanations of the universe
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.340]   that really are compelling.
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.940]   But I think one of the things that I've sort of,
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.540]   maybe in some ways rejected my training as a physicist
[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:44.580]   is that most of the elegant explanations
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.220]   that we have so far don't include us in the universe.
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.740]   And I can't help but think there's something really special
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:50.580]   about what we are,
[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.900]   and there have to be some deep principles at play there.
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:57.420]   And so that's sort of my perspective on it.
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.460]   Now, when you ask me what life is,
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.060]   I have some ideas of what I think it is.
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.820]   But I think that we haven't gotten there yet
[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.420]   because we haven't been able to see that structure.
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.300]   And just to go back to the gravity example,
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:12.380]   it's a little like, in ancient times, they didn't know,
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.540]   I was talking about stars and heavens and things,
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:16.780]   they didn't know those were governed
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.260]   by the same principles as that starting to experiment.
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:20.900]   Here's where I was going with it.
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.900]   Once you realize, like Newton did,
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.780]   that heavenly motions and earthly motions
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:27.100]   are governed by the same principles
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.060]   and you unify terrestrial and celestial motion,
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.220]   you get these more powerful ideas.
[00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.940]   And I think where life is,
[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:36.380]   is somehow unifying these abstract ideas
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.500]   of computation and information
[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.660]   with the physical world, with matter,
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:43.700]   and realizing that there's some explanatory framework
[00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.900]   that's not physics and it's not computation,
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.580]   but it's something that's deeper.
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.060]   - So answering the question of what is life
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.900]   requires deeply understanding something about the universe
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.860]   as information processing, the universe as computation.
[00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.620]   - Sort of. - It's something about,
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.500]   like, would, once you come up with an answer
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.380]   to what is life, will the words information
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.460]   and computation be in the paragraph?
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.460]   - No, I don't think so. - God damn it, okay.
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:11.780]   - I know, it doesn't help, does it?
[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.980]   I know, I hate, actually, I hate this about what I do
[00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.380]   because it's so hard to communicate, right, with words.
[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:20.500]   Like, when you have words that are ideas
[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.700]   that have historically described one thing
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.200]   and you're trying to describe something
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.900]   people haven't seen yet, and the words just don't fit.
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.420]   - So what's wrong, is it too ambiguous?
[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:31.540]   The word information?
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.380]   We could switch to binary if you want.
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.220]   - Yeah, no, I don't think it's binary either.
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.980]   I think information's just loaded.
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.260]   I use it, so the other way I might talk about it
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.980]   is the physics of causation, but I think that's worse
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:43.940]   because causation is an even more loaded word
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.740]   than information.
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.780]   - So causation is fundamental, you think?
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:52.220]   - I do, yeah, and in some sense, I think the physics,
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:53.780]   so this is the really radical part.
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:55.500]   Some sense, like, when I really think about it
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.460]   sort of most deeply, what I think life is
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.140]   is actually the physics of existence.
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.900]   What gets to exist and why?
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.780]   And for simple elementary particles,
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:05.820]   that's not very complicated
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:06.980]   'cause the interactions are simple,
[00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:11.060]   but for things like you and me and human civilizations,
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.500]   what comes next in the universe
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.660]   is really dependent on what came before,
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.340]   and there's a huge space of possibilities
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:19.820]   of things that can exist, and when I say information
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.740]   and causation, what I mean is,
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.900]   why is it that cups evolved in the universe
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.540]   and not some other object that could deliver water
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:28.580]   and not spill it?
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:31.540]   I don't know what you would call it.
[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.940]   Maybe it wouldn't be a cup, but it's a huge,
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:38.940]   people talk about the space of things that could exist
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.820]   as being actually infinitely large, right?
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.420]   I don't know if I believe in infinity,
[00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:47.380]   but I do think that there is something very interesting
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:51.980]   about the problem of what exists
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.260]   in its relationship to life.
[00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.700]   - So do you think the set of things
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.780]   that could exist is finite?
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.700]   So it's very large, but if we were to think
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.660]   about the physics of existence,
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:06.900]   like how many shapes of mugs can there be?
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:10.020]   Like is, in the initial programming--
[00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:13.020]   - I should go to the math department for that.
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.700]   - So that's not a topology question.
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.780]   I just mean, maybe another way to ask is,
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:20.340]   what do you think is fundamental to the universe
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.660]   and what is emergent?
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.780]   So if existence, are we supposed to think of that
[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.900]   as somehow fundamental, you think?
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.660]   - So there's a couple of problems in physics
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:29.820]   that I think this is related to.
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.380]   One is, why does mathematics work
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.300]   at describing reality so well?
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.620]   And then there is this problem of,
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.660]   we don't understand why the laws of physics
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.660]   are the way they are, or why certain things get to exist,
[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:44.060]   or what put in place the initial condition of our universe.
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.420]   There's all of these sort of really deep and big problems,
[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:51.900]   and they all indirectly are related, I think,
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.040]   to the same kind of thing that,
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:56.900]   our physics is really good
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:58.660]   if you specify the initial condition
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.060]   at specifying a certain sequence of events,
[00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.220]   but it doesn't deal with the fact
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:05.020]   that other things could have happened,
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:06.660]   which is kind of an informational property,
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.340]   like a counterfactual property.
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:12.220]   And it's not good at explaining
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.860]   this conversation right now.
[00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:17.700]   There are certain things that are outside
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.660]   the explanatory reach of current physics,
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.940]   and I think they require looking at it
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.100]   from a completely different direction.
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.980]   And so I don't wanna have to fine tune
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:28.860]   the initial condition of the universe
[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:30.740]   to specify precisely all the information
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:31.580]   in this conversation.
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:33.620]   I think that's a ridiculous assertion.
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.620]   But that's sort of how people wanna frame it
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:36.920]   when they're talking about,
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.580]   the standard model is sufficient
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.900]   if we had computing power to basically explain
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:44.660]   all of life and our existence.
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.260]   - An interesting thing you said is,
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.620]   the way we think about information computation
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:53.380]   is by observing a particular kind of systems on Earth
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.860]   that exhibits something we think of as intelligence.
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.980]   But that's like looking at, I guess,
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.060]   the tip of an iceberg,
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.060]   and we should be really looking at the fundamentals
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:08.060]   of the iceberg, like what makes water and ice
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:12.740]   and the chemistry from which intelligence emerges.
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:14.700]   - Yes, yes. - Essentially.
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.140]   - We can't just couple the information from the physics,
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:19.300]   and I think that's what we've gotten really good at doing,
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:23.540]   especially with sort of the modern age
[00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:28.540]   where software is so abstracted from hardware.
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:31.780]   But the entire process of biological evolution
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.300]   has basically been built,
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.700]   like been building layers of increasing abstraction.
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.300]   And so it's really hard to see that physics in us,
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:42.540]   but it's much clearer to see it in molecules.
[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:44.820]   - Yeah, but I guess I'm trying to figure out,
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.700]   what do you think are the best tools to look at it?
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:49.500]   What do you think?
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.700]   - An open mind?
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.500]   Is that a tool? (laughs)
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.300]   - What's the physics of an open mind?
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.580]   - I think if we solve that, we'll solve everything.
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:24:59.660]   I'm saying an open mind
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.500]   because I think the biggest stumbling block
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:05.900]   to understanding sort of the things
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.260]   I've been trying to articulate,
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.020]   or, and when I talk also with colleagues
[00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:11.660]   that are thinking deeply about these same issues,
[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:15.420]   is none of it is inconsistent with what we know.
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:18.260]   It's just such a radically different perception
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:19.700]   of the way we understand things now
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.340]   that it's hard for people to get there.
[00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:23.140]   And in some ways you have to almost forget
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.900]   what you've learned in order to learn something new, right?
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.900]   So I feel like most of my career
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.900]   trying to understand the problem of life
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:33.860]   has been variously forgetting and then relearning
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:35.620]   things that I learned in physics.
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:40.620]   And I think you have to have a capacity to learn things,
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:44.460]   but then accept that things that you learned
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.620]   might not be true.
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.900]   Or might need refinement or reframing.
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.340]   And the best way I can say that
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:54.700]   is just like with a physics education,
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.940]   there are just certain things you're told in undergrad
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.980]   that are like facts about the world.
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.300]   And your physics professors never tell you
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.300]   that those facts actually emerge from a human mind, right?
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.500]   So we're taught to think about,
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.420]   say the laws of physics, for example,
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.460]   as this like autonomous thing
[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:10.780]   that exists outside of our universe
[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.580]   and tells our universe how it works.
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:15.500]   But the laws of physics were invented by human minds
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.460]   to describe things that are regularities
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.420]   in our everyday experience.
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.620]   They don't exist autonomous to the universe.
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:23.940]   - Right, so it's like turtles on top of turtles,
[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.380]   but eventually it gets to the human mind
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.460]   and then you have to explain the human mind
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:29.300]   with the turtles.
[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:30.140]   - Yes.
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:32.660]   - So you have to, it comes from humans,
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.780]   this understanding, this simplification of the universe,
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:36.380]   these models.
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:38.300]   There's a guy named Stephen Wolfram,
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:42.060]   there's a concept called cellular automata.
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:47.060]   So there's some mysteries in these systems
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.460]   that are computational in nature
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:54.060]   that have maybe echoes of the kind of mysteries
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:57.840]   we should need to solve to understand what is life.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:04.100]   So if we could talk, take a computational view of things,
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.260]   do you think there's something compelling
[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:09.900]   to reducing everything down to computation,
[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.060]   like the universe is computation,
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:15.280]   and then trying to understand life.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.900]   So throw away the biology, throw away the chemistry,
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.240]   throw away even the physics that you learn
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.940]   undergrad and graduate school,
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.980]   and more look at these simple little systems,
[00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.100]   whether it's cellular automata
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.660]   or whatever the heck kind of computational systems
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.580]   that operate on simple local rules
[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:35.280]   and then create complexity as they evolve.
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.500]   Is it at all, do you think, productive
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.140]   to focus on those kinds of systems
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.260]   to get an inkling of what is life?
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:48.780]   And if it is, do you think it's possible
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.620]   to come up with some kind of laws and principles
[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:56.140]   about what makes life in those computational systems?
[00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:57.420]   - So I like cellular automata,
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.580]   I think they're good toy models,
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.620]   but mostly where I've thought about them and used them
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:07.620]   is to actually, let's say, poke at
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:10.900]   sort of the current conceptual framework that we have
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:12.260]   and see where the flaws are.
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:15.660]   So I think the part that you're talking about
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.260]   that people find intriguing is that
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.660]   if you have a fairly simple rule
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:21.600]   and you specify some initial condition
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.500]   and you run that rule on that initial condition,
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.500]   you could get really complex patterns emerging.
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.400]   And ooh, doesn't that look lifelike?
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:32.460]   - Well, it's like really surprising,
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.820]   isn't it really surprising? - It is really surprising.
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.260]   And they're beautiful.
[00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:37.800]   And I think they have a lot of nice features
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.740]   associated to them.
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:42.340]   I think the things that I find,
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:46.500]   yeah, so I do think as a proof of principle
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.740]   that you can get complex things
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.500]   emerging from simple rules, they're great.
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.580]   As a sort of proof of principle
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:56.780]   about some of the ways that we might think of computation
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:59.480]   as being sort of a fundamental principle
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.020]   for dynamical systems and maybe the evolution
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:03.300]   of the universe as a whole,
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:05.720]   they're a great model system.
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.880]   As an explanatory framework for life,
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.940]   I think they're a bit problematic
[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:14.140]   for the same reason that the laws of physics
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:16.340]   are a bit problematic.
[00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:19.340]   And the clearest way I can articulate that
[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:22.480]   is like cellular automata are actually cast
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.900]   in sort of a conceptual framework
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:26.580]   for how the universe should be described
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.660]   that goes all the way back to Newton, in fact,
[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:33.740]   with this idea that we can have a fixed law of motion,
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.120]   which exists sort of, it's given to you.
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:40.500]   The great programmer in the sky gave you this equation
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.420]   or this rule, and then you just run with it.
[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:45.100]   And the rule doesn't have,
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:46.620]   so a good feature of the rule
[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.200]   is it doesn't have specified in the rule
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.100]   information about the patterns it generates.
[00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.860]   So you wouldn't want, for example,
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:57.020]   my cup or my water bottle or me sitting here
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:58.660]   to be specified in the laws of physics.
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.000]   That would be ridiculous 'cause it wouldn't be
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.020]   a very simple explanation of all the things happening.
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:03.620]   It'd have to explain everything.
[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:06.220]   So, and cellular automata have that feature,
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.480]   and the laws of physics have that feature.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:13.140]   But you also need to specify the initial condition.
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:17.100]   And it also, it basically means that everything that happens
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.860]   is sort of a consequence of that initial condition.
[00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:21.820]   And I think this kind of framework
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:25.100]   is just not the right one for biology.
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.300]   And part of the way that it's easiest to see this
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.900]   is a lot of people talk about self-reference
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:33.500]   being important in life.
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.900]   The fact that, you know, like the genome
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:39.300]   has information encoded in it.
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.740]   That information gets read out.
[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:45.180]   It specifies something about the architecture of a cell.
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:47.140]   The architecture of the cell includes the genome.
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:49.900]   So the genome has basically self-referential information.
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:53.060]   Self-reference obviously comes up in computational law
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:56.740]   because it's kind of foundational to Turing's work
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.980]   and what Gödel did with the incompleteness theorems
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:30:59.820]   and things.
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.620]   So there's a lot of parallels there,
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:05.500]   and people have talked about that at depth.
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.860]   But the other way of kind of thinking about it
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:10.180]   in terms of like a more physics-y way of talking about it
[00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:12.340]   is that what it looks like in biology
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:15.960]   is that the rules or the laws depend on the state.
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.380]   This is typical in computer science.
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:18.580]   This is obvious to you.
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:19.900]   You know, the update rule depends
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:21.020]   on the state of the machine, right?
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:24.880]   But you know, you don't think about, you know,
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.620]   that being sort of the dynamic in physics.
[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:29.020]   It's, you know, the rules given to you,
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:31.740]   and then it, you know, it's a very special subclass,
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:33.820]   say, of computations if, you know,
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:36.660]   you don't ever change the update.
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:38.420]   But in biology, it seems to be that the state
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:41.060]   and the law change together as a function of time,
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.820]   and we don't have that as a paradigm in physics.
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.700]   And so a lot of people have talked about this
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.620]   as being kind of a perplexing feature
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:49.820]   that maybe there are certain scenarios
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:51.740]   where the laws of physics or the laws
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.060]   that govern a particular system
[00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:56.620]   actually change as a function of state of that system.
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:57.460]   - That's trippy.
[00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:58.300]   - Yeah.
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.260]   - So yeah, the hope of physics,
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:03.260]   it's a hope, I guess, but often stated
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:08.260]   as a underlying assumption is that the law is static.
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.140]   - Right.
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:10.980]   - Okay.
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:12.820]   - And even having laws that vary in time,
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:14.220]   not even as a function of the state,
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:16.900]   is very radical when you--
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:17.940]   - The time in general.
[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:18.780]   - Yeah.
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:21.060]   - Like, you wanna remove time from the equation
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:22.060]   as much as possible.
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:24.260]   - Yeah, I do.
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.620]   There's some interesting things in this,
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:29.160]   like when we think more deeply about the actual physics
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.700]   that we're trying to propose governs life,
[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.680]   me with collaborators, and then also other people
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.200]   that think about similar things,
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.800]   that time might actually be fundamental,
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.900]   and there really is an ordering to time.
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:41.060]   And that events in the universe are unique
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:44.000]   because they have a particular, they happen,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.700]   like an object in the universe requires
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:48.320]   a certain history of events in order to exist,
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.680]   which therefore suggests that time
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.600]   really does have an ordering.
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.680]   I'm not talking about the flow of time
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.520]   and our perception of time,
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:53.700]   just the ordering of events.
[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:54.540]   - Causation of things.
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:56.680]   - Yes, causation, there's that word again.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.680]   - So causation, that's when you say time,
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:32:59.520]   you mean causation.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.800]   - Yes.
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:05.400]   - In your proposed model of the physics of life,
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.320]   the fundamental thing would be causation.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.600]   If you were to bet your money on one particular horse
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:12.440]   or whatever.
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.280]   - Yes.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.480]   - And then space is emergent?
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.320]   - Yes.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.260]   - So everything's emergent except time.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.080]   - Kind of, yeah, or causation.
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.720]   - And laws change all the time.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.800]   Why does it look like laws are the same?
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.960]   - Well, because, well one way,
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.000]   and I actually, this idea comes from Lee Cronin
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.840]   'cause I work with him very closely on these things,
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.760]   is that the laws of physics look the way they do
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.560]   because they're low memory laws.
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.820]   So they don't require a lot of information to specify them.
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.720]   They're very easy for the universe to implement.
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.080]   But if you get something like me, for example,
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.600]   I require a four billion year history
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.520]   to exist in the universe.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:47.080]   I come with a lot of historical baggage.
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.360]   And that's part of what I am as a set of causes
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.720]   that exist in the universe.
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:55.240]   So I have local rules that apply to me
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.040]   that are associated with sort of the information
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:59.240]   in my history that aren't universal
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.040]   to every object in the universe.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.880]   And there are some things that are very easy
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.040]   to implement, low memory rules,
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.840]   that apply to everything in the universe.
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.600]   - So there's no shortcuts to you.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:11.440]   - No.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.600]   So yeah, I don't believe in things like Boltzmann brains
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:17.280]   or fluctuations out of the vacuum
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.780]   that can produce things like your desk ornaments.
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:24.520]   I actually think they require a particular causal chain
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:25.640]   of events to exist.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:28.600]   - Well, I appreciate the togetherness of that.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:32.160]   But so how does that, if we have to simulate
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:35.240]   the entire universe to create the ornaments
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.080]   in the two of us, how are we supposed
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.080]   to create engineer life in a lab?
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:44.680]   - Yeah, that's, this goes back to sort of the critique
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:45.520]   of the RNA world.
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:46.920]   I think one of the problems,
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.360]   and I'll get to answering your question,
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.320]   but I think this is kind of relevant here.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.840]   One of the problems of the RNA world,
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.280]   when we test it in the laboratory,
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.320]   is how much information we're putting into the experiment.
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:00.080]   We specify the flask, we make pure reagents,
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.880]   we mix them, we take them out,
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:04.440]   we put them in the next flask, we change the pH,
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:07.120]   we change the UV light, and then we get a molecule.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.080]   And it's not even an RNA molecule necessarily,
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.160]   it might just be a base, right?
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.720]   And so people don't usually think about the fact
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:17.880]   that we're agents in the universe making that experiment,
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:19.480]   and therefore we put a little bit of life
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.560]   into that experiment.
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:23.760]   Because it's part of our biological lineage,
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:24.960]   in the same sense that a cup,
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:26.840]   or I am a part of the biological lineage.
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:31.160]   The experiment is-- - Our ideas are injecting life.
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.000]   - Yes. - To the experiment.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.160]   - And the constraints that we put on the experiments.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:36.760]   Because those conditions wouldn't exist in the universe,
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.560]   on planet Earth at that time,
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.400]   without us as the boundary condition, right?
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.400]   So-- - Even though we're not actually
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.120]   adding any actual chemistry or biology
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.600]   that could be identified as life,
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.800]   are the constraints we're adding to the experiment,
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.240]   the design of the experiment.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.560]   - Yeah, you can think of the design of the experiment
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.280]   as a program, you put information in.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:55.760]   It's an algorithmic procedure
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.160]   that you design the experiment.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:01.000]   And so the origin of life problem becomes one
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.880]   of minimizing the information we put into physics,
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.120]   to actually watch the spontaneous origin of life.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.840]   - Can we have, so can, is it possible in the lab
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.200]   to have an information vacuum then?
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.760]   So like-- - If we could, we would,
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.440]   that would be amazing, I don't know.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.680]   That's a good question for, more for Lee.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:18.680]   - Yeah, you guys, by the way,
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:20.160]   for people who don't know Lee Cronin,
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:23.160]   is, you guys are colleagues. - Yeah.
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.720]   - And I've gotten the chance to listen
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:26.960]   to the two of you talking.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.280]   There's great chemistry,
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.560]   and you're brilliant at brainstorming together.
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:34.400]   And there's a really exciting community here
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.880]   of brilliant people from different disciplines
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.360]   working on the problem. - Yeah.
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:42.400]   - Of life, of complexity, of, I don't know, whatever.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.200]   The words fail us to describe the exact problem
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.600]   we're trying to actually-- - Right.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:50.120]   - Understand here, intelligence, all those kinds of things.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:55.120]   Okay, so what, from a lab perspective,
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:57.820]   so Lee, I guess, would you call him a chemist?
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:59.360]   No, what is he? - I think by training,
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.000]   he's a chemist, but I think most of the people
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.400]   that work in the field we do have lost their discipline.
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.800]   (laughing)
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.920]   That's why I couldn't answer your question earlier.
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.360]   - Okay. - I don't know what you call him.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.200]   - Yeah. - I don't know
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.020]   what I call myself.
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.880]   I don't know what I call any of my friends.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.840]   - So why is it so hard to create,
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.920]   and it's an interesting question,
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:19.400]   to create biological life in the lab?
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:21.800]   Like, from your perspective,
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.980]   is that an important problem to work on,
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:28.980]   to try to recreate the historical origin of life on Earth,
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:31.120]   or echoes of the historical origin?
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.760]   - I think echoes is more appropriate.
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.920]   I don't think asking the question
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.680]   of what was the exact historical sequence of events,
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.440]   and engineering every step in the process
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.960]   to make exactly the chemistry of life on Earth
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.340]   as we know it is a meaningful way of asking the question.
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:47.800]   And it's a little bit like,
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.980]   you know, since you're in computer science,
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:53.440]   like if you know the answer to a problem,
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:56.020]   it's easier to find a program to specify the output, right?
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:58.080]   But if you don't know the answer a priori,
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.720]   you know, finding an algorithm for,
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:01.040]   like say finding a prime or something,
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:05.000]   it's easy to, you know, verify it's a prime number.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.480]   It's hard to find the next prime.
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.960]   And the way the original life is structured right now,
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.040]   and the historical problem is,
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:15.640]   you know the answer, and you're trying to retrodict it
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:17.600]   by breaking it down into the set of procedures
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.480]   where you're putting a lot of information in.
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:22.520]   And what we need to do is ask the question of,
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:26.200]   how is it that the rules of how our universe is structured
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.120]   permit things like life to exist,
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:29.800]   and what is the phenomena of life?
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.440]   And those questions are obviously
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.140]   essentially the same question.
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:37.880]   And so you're looking essentially for this missing physics,
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.760]   this missing explanation for what we are,
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.760]   and you need to set up proper experiments
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.560]   that are gonna allow you to probe
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:47.500]   the vast complexity of chemistry in an unconstrained way
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:50.240]   with as little information put in as possible
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.980]   to see when things, when does information actually emerge?
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:55.400]   How does it emerge?
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.240]   What is it?
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:01.080]   And part of the sort of conjecture we have is
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.200]   that this physics only becomes relevant,
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.840]   or at least this is my personal conjecture,
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:09.400]   and it's sort of validated by this kind of theory
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:14.400]   experiment collaboration that we have working in this area.
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:17.160]   That this, you know, sort of,
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.080]   I made the point about like gravity existing everywhere,
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:22.300]   right, but when you study an atomic nucleus,
[00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:23.400]   you don't care about gravity.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.960]   It's not relevant physics there, right?
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.860]   It's weak, it doesn't matter.
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:31.660]   And so this idea that there's kind of a physics
[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.820]   associated with information,
[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:37.340]   for me, it's very evident that that physics
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:39.960]   doesn't become relevant until you need information
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.540]   to specify the existence of a particular object.
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:46.060]   And the scale of reality where that happens is in chemistry
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:49.780]   because of the combinatorial diversity of chemical objects
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:52.740]   that can exist far out exceeds
[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:54.740]   the amount of resources in our universe.
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:57.620]   So if you want it, you can't make every possible protein
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:00.380]   of length, you know, 200 amino acids,
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.940]   there's not enough resources.
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:05.100]   So in order for this particular protein to exist,
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:07.580]   and this protein to exist in high abundance,
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:10.660]   means that you have to have a system that has knowledge
[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:12.940]   of the existence of that protein and can build it.
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:15.620]   - So existence comes to be at the chemical level.
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:17.820]   So existence is most,
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:20.740]   is best understood at the chemical level.
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:22.100]   - It's most evident.
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:23.100]   It's a little bit like,
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:24.900]   nobody argues that gravity doesn't exist
[00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.860]   in an atomic nucleus, it's just not relevant physics there.
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.860]   - So the physics of information--
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.500]   - Is everywhere, it exists at every combinatorial scale,
[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:34.220]   but it becomes more and more relevant
[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:36.740]   the more set of possibilities that could exist.
[00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:39.380]   Because you have to specify more and more
[00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:41.820]   about why this thing exists and not the infinite,
[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:43.340]   it's not an infinite set, but you know,
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:46.180]   the set of, undefined set of other things that could exist.
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:49.340]   - So can I ask a weird question?
[00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:52.300]   Which is, so let's look into the future.
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:55.260]   - I try that every day, it never works.
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:41:00.140]   - So say a Nobel Prize is given in physics,
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:05.140]   maybe chemistry, for discovering the origin of life.
[00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:09.180]   No, but not the historical origin.
[00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:11.440]   Some kind of thing that we're talking about.
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:15.660]   What exactly would,
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:20.700]   what do you think that,
[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:22.500]   what do you think that person,
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.740]   maybe you, did to get that Nobel Prize?
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:26.260]   Like what would they have to have done?
[00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:27.780]   'Cause you could do a bunch of experiments
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:30.660]   that go like with an aha moment.
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:33.760]   Like you rarely get the Nobel Prize
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:37.100]   for like, you've solved everything, we're done.
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.900]   It's like some inkling of some deep truth.
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.260]   Like what do you think that would actually look like?
[00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.180]   Would it be an experimental result?
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:48.860]   I mean, it will have to have some kind of experimental,
[00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:50.340]   maybe validation component.
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.300]   So what would that look like?
[00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:54.660]   - This is an excellent question.
[00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:57.260]   I wanna, sorry, I'm gonna make a quick point,
[00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:58.740]   which is just a slight tangent.
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:01.260]   But you know, like when people ask about the origin of mass
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:03.280]   and like looking for the Higgs mechanism and things,
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.020]   they never are like, we need to find the historical origins
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:06.940]   of life in the early,
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:08.420]   although those things are related, right?
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:11.460]   So this problem of origins of life in the lab,
[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:12.620]   I think is really important.
[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:14.540]   But the Higgs is a good example
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:15.980]   because you had theory to guide it.
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:19.380]   So somehow you need to have an explanatory framework
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:24.820]   that can say that we should be looking for these features
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:27.900]   and explain why they might be there
[00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:29.540]   and then be able to do the experiment
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:31.580]   and demonstrate that it matches with the theory.
[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:34.300]   But it has to be something that is outside
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:36.320]   sort of the paradigm of what we might expect
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:37.500]   based on what we know, right?
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:40.420]   So this is a really sort of tall order.
[00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:42.580]   And I think,
[00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:46.300]   I mean, I guess the way people would think about it
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:48.000]   is like, you know, if you had a bacteria
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.820]   that climbed out of your test tube or something,
[00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:51.660]   and it was like, you know, moving around on the surface,
[00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:53.020]   that would be ultimate validation.
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:55.120]   You saw the original life in an experiment.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:57.440]   But I don't think that's quite what we're looking for.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:01.960]   I think what we're looking for is evidence
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:06.020]   of when information that originated
[00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:08.400]   within the bounds of your experiment,
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.980]   and you can demonstrably prove emerged spontaneously
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:14.620]   in your experiment, wasn't put in by you,
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:17.720]   actually started to govern the future dynamics
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:20.120]   of that system and specify it.
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:23.520]   And you could somehow relate those two features directly.
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.260]   So you know that the program specifying
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:27.560]   what's happening in that system
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.700]   is actually internal to that system.
[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:32.080]   Like say you have a chemical thing in a box.
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:36.340]   - Well, so that's one Nobel Prize winning experiment,
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:39.920]   which is like information in some fundamental way
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.880]   originated within the constraints of the system
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:44.600]   without you injecting anything.
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:49.040]   But another experiment is you injected something
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:52.720]   and got out information.
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.760]   So like you injected, I don't know,
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:59.960]   like some sugar and like something
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:03.400]   that doesn't necessarily feel like it should be information.
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:07.140]   - Yeah, so actually no, I mean, sugar is information, right?
[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:10.120]   So part of the argument here is that every physical object
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:12.920]   is, well, it's information,
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:14.620]   but it's a set of causal histories
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:16.680]   and also a set of possible futures.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:20.520]   So there is an experiment that I've talked a lot about
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:22.120]   with Lee Cronin, but also with Michael Lachman
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.900]   and Chris Kempis who are at Santa Fe,
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:25.800]   about this idea that sometimes we talk about
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.880]   as like seeding assembly,
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:30.560]   which is you take a high complexity,
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.880]   like an object that exists in the universe
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:34.880]   because of a long causal history,
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:38.640]   and you seed it into a system of lower causal history.
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.840]   And then suddenly you see all of this complexity
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:41.960]   being generated.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.960]   So I think another validation of the physics would be,
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:46.960]   say you engineer an organism
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.760]   by purposefully introducing something
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.240]   where you understand the relationship
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:54.080]   between the causal history of the organism
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.560]   and the say very complex chemical set of ingredients
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:58.920]   you're adding to it.
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:02.000]   And then you can predict the future evolution of that system
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.880]   to some statistical set of constraints
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:10.100]   and possibilities for what it will look like in the future.
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.520]   You know, I'm a physical structure,
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:15.240]   obviously like I'm composed of atoms,
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:16.680]   the configuration of them
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:19.400]   and the fact that they happen to be me
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:22.080]   is because I'm not actually my atoms,
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:24.680]   I am a informational pattern
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:28.960]   that keeps repatterning those atoms into Sarah.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:31.960]   And I have also associated to me
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.240]   like a space of possible things that could exist
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.200]   that I can help mediate come into existence
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:41.240]   because of the information in my history.
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:45.760]   And so when you understand sort of that
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:49.180]   time is a real thing embedded in a physical object,
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:52.960]   then it becomes possible to talk about
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:57.000]   how histories when they interact,
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.460]   and a history is not a unique thing,
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:45:59.920]   it's a set of possibilities.
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:00.760]   When they interact,
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:03.240]   how do they specify what's coming next?
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.320]   And then where does the novelty come from in that structure?
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:06.640]   'Cause some of it is kind of things
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.960]   that haven't existed in the past can exist in the future.
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:12.840]   - Let me ask about this entity that you call Sarah.
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.180]   - Yes.
[00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:16.880]   I talk to myself, put myself in third person sometimes,
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:17.720]   I don't know why.
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:22.440]   - So maybe this is a good time to bring up consciousness.
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:23.280]   - Sure.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:26.600]   It's been here all along.
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:28.240]   - Well, has it?
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:29.080]   So that's--
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:30.560]   - At least in this conversation,
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:31.920]   I think I've been conscious most of it,
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:32.760]   but maybe I haven't.
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.800]   - Well, yeah, so speak for yourself.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.960]   You're projecting your consciousness onto me.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:39.760]   You don't know if I'm conscious or not.
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.080]   - No, I don't.
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:41.920]   You're right.
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:45.140]   - Is that, you talked about the physics of existence,
[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:50.140]   you talked about the emergence of causality,
[00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:52.720]   sorry, you talked about causality and time
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:54.560]   being fundamental to the universe.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:58.460]   Where does consciousness fit into all of this?
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:03.460]   Like, do you draw any kind of inspiration or value
[00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:05.440]   with the idea of panpsychism
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:09.720]   that maybe one of the things that we ought to understand
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:12.040]   is the physics of consciousness?
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:15.200]   Like, one of the missing pieces
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.440]   in the physics view of the world
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:20.440]   is understanding the physics of consciousness.
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:24.860]   Or like that word has so many concepts underneath it,
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:25.920]   but let's put it,
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:30.700]   let's put consciousness as a label on a black box of mystery
[00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:32.340]   that we don't understand.
[00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:36.580]   Do you think that black box holds the key
[00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:40.780]   to finally answering the question of the physics of life?
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:42.260]   - The problems are absolutely related.
[00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:44.720]   I think most, and I'm interested in both
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.340]   because I'm just interested in what we are.
[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:48.140]   And to me, the most interesting feature
[00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:49.460]   of what we are is our minds
[00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:51.300]   and the way they interact with other minds.
[00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:52.660]   Like minds are the most beautiful thing
[00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:53.560]   that exists in the universe.
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:55.340]   So how did they come to be?
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:56.220]   - Sorry to interrupt.
[00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:58.460]   So when you say we, you mean humans.
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:47:59.580]   - I mean humans right now,
[00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:02.460]   but that's because I'm a human, or at least I think I am.
[00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:05.060]   - You think there's something special to this particular?
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:06.500]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:11.300]   No, I don't, I'm not a human-centric thinker.
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:12.580]   - But are you one entity?
[00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:15.420]   You said a bunch of stuff came together to make a Sarah.
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:18.180]   Like, do you think of yourself as one entity
[00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:20.780]   or are you just a bunch of different components?
[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:23.740]   Like, is there any value to understand the physics of Sarah?
[00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:26.340]   Like, or are you just a bunch of different things
[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:30.100]   that are like a nice little temporary side effect?
[00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:33.060]   - Yeah, you could think of me as a bundle of information
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:35.940]   that just became temporarily aggregated into your individual.
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:37.300]   Yeah, that's fine.
[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:38.460]   I agree with that view.
[00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:40.540]   (laughing)
[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:42.540]   I'll take that as a compliment, actually.
[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:46.540]   - But nevertheless, that bundle of information
[00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:47.860]   has become conscious,
[00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:50.980]   or at least keeps calling herself conscious.
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:52.600]   - Yeah, I think I'm conscious right now,
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:55.100]   but I might not be, but that's okay.
[00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:56.380]   Or you wouldn't know.
[00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:57.700]   So yeah, so this is the problem.
[00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:59.060]   So yeah, usually people,
[00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:00.380]   when they are talking about consciousness,
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:02.300]   are worried about the subjective experience.
[00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:04.140]   And so I think that's why you're saying,
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:05.100]   I don't know if you're conscious
[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:06.900]   because I don't know if you're experiencing
[00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:08.300]   this conversation right now.
[00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:11.460]   And nor do you know if I'm experiencing
[00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:12.960]   the conversation right now.
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:14.300]   And so this is why this is called
[00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:15.400]   the hard problem of consciousness,
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:17.540]   because it seems impenetrable from the outside
[00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:20.540]   to know if something's having a conscious experience.
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:24.780]   And I really like the idea of also
[00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:26.220]   the hard problem of matter,
[00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:28.940]   which is related to the hard problem of consciousness,
[00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:31.620]   which is you don't know the intrinsic properties
[00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:33.300]   of an electron not interacting,
[00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:35.260]   say for example, with anything else in the universe.
[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:38.200]   All the properties of anything that exists in the universe
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:39.500]   are defined by its interaction,
[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:40.900]   because you have to interact with it
[00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:42.420]   in order to be able to observe it.
[00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:44.500]   So we can only actually know the things
[00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:46.260]   that are observable from the outside.
[00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:47.700]   And so this is one of the reasons
[00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:49.400]   that consciousness is hard for science,
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:51.980]   because you're asking questions about something
[00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:54.160]   that's subjective and supposed to be intrinsic
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:56.340]   to what that thing is as it exists
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:57.980]   and how it feels about existing.
[00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:02.580]   And so I have thought a lot about this problem
[00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:05.460]   and its relationship to the problem of life.
[00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:07.180]   And the only thing I can come up with
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:12.180]   to try to make that problem scientifically tractable
[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:17.980]   and also relate it to how I think about the physics of life
[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:20.360]   is to ask the question,
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:23.500]   are there things that can only happen in the universe
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:26.260]   because there are physical systems
[00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:28.800]   that have subjective experience?
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:32.040]   So does subjective experience have different causes,
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:35.060]   things that it can cause to occur
[00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:38.640]   that would happen in the absence of that?
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:40.120]   I don't know the answer to that question,
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:42.100]   but I think that's a meaningful way
[00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:43.660]   of asking the question of consciousness.
[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:46.620]   I can't ask if you're having experience right now,
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:49.180]   but I can ask if you having experience right now
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:50.860]   changes something about you
[00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:52.780]   and the way you interact with the world.
[00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:56.940]   - So does stuff happen?
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:57.780]   It's a good question to ask,
[00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:00.380]   does stuff happen if consciousness is--
[00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:03.180]   - Then it's a real physical thing, right?
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:04.460]   It has physical consequences.
[00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:06.900]   I'm a physicist, I'm biased, so I don't, you know,
[00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:08.260]   I can't get rid of that bias.
[00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:10.340]   It's really deeply ingrained.
[00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:12.180]   I've tried, but it's hard.
[00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:14.700]   - But I mean, you're saying information is physical too.
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:16.420]   So like virtual reality and simulation,
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:18.340]   all that program is physical too.
[00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:19.420]   - Yes, everything's physical.
[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:22.940]   It's just not physical the way it's represented in our minds
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:25.580]   - Right, so you, I love your Twitter.
[00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:29.740]   So you tweet these like deep thoughts, deep thoughts.
[00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:30.740]   - That's what a theorist does
[00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:32.340]   when she's trying to experiment.
[00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:34.220]   - Is tweet?
[00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:35.420]   - Yes.
[00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:37.900]   - Sitting there, I mean, I can just imagine
[00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:39.140]   you sitting there for like hours
[00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:41.460]   and all of a sudden just like this thought comes out
[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:46.460]   and you get a little like inkling into the thought process.
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:48.860]   - Yeah, usually it's like when I'm running between things
[00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:50.980]   and I'm like, I've got deep thoughts.
[00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:52.300]   - Well, yeah, so you--
[00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:53.660]   - Deep thoughts are hard to articulate.
[00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:56.580]   - One of the things you tweet is ideologically,
[00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:58.700]   there are many parallels between the search
[00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:01.620]   for neural correlates of consciousness
[00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:04.260]   and for chemical correlates of life.
[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:07.500]   How the neuroscience and astrobiology communities
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:10.460]   treat those correlates is entirely different.
[00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:14.660]   Can you elaborate against this kind of the parallels?
[00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:16.500]   It has to do a little bit with the consciousness
[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:20.060]   and the matter thing you're talking about.
[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:20.940]   - Yeah, it does.
[00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:23.020]   And I can't remember what state of mind I was
[00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:24.420]   when I was actually thinking about that.
[00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:27.100]   But I think part of it is--
[00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:28.940]   - I bet you never thought you're gonna have to
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:29.940]   analyze your own tweets.
[00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:31.020]   - No, I didn't.
[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:34.860]   It's an interesting historical juxtaposition of thinking.
[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:35.700]   So yeah.
[00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:37.860]   - So the tweet is a historical--
[00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:40.140]   - Hey, you're doing an assembly experiment right now
[00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:41.620]   'cause you're bringing a thought from the past
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:43.300]   into the present and trying to actually--
[00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:44.220]   - In the lab.
[00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:45.060]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:47.660]   This is experimental science right here
[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:48.860]   on the podcast live.
[00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:53.780]   - So go, let's see how the consciousness evolves on this one.
[00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:57.700]   - Yeah, so in neuroscience, it's kind of accepted
[00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:01.580]   that we can't get at the subjective aspect of consciousness.
[00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:04.620]   So people are very interested in what would be
[00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:06.300]   a correlate of consciousness.
[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:09.580]   - What's a correlate?
[00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:13.260]   - A correlate is a feature that relates
[00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:14.460]   to conscious activity.
[00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:18.700]   So for example, a verbal report is a correlate
[00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:22.900]   of consciousness because I can tell you when I'm conscious.
[00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:25.020]   And then when I'm sleeping, for example,
[00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:26.220]   I can't tell you I'm conscious.
[00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:28.700]   So we have this assumption that you're not conscious
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:31.820]   when you're sleeping and you're conscious when you're awake.
[00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:35.500]   And so that's sort of like a very obvious example.
[00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:38.820]   But neuroscientists, which I'm no neuroscientist
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:41.100]   and I'm not an expert in this field.
[00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:44.100]   But they have very sophisticated ways of measuring activity
[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:47.620]   in our brain and trying to relate that to verbal report
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:49.580]   and other proxies for whether someone
[00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:51.260]   is experiencing something.
[00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:54.780]   And that's what is meant by neural correlates.
[00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:58.260]   And then so when people are trying to think about
[00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:02.420]   studying consciousness or developing theories
[00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:06.180]   for consciousness, they often are trying to build
[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:09.820]   an experimental bridge to these neural correlates.
[00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:11.980]   Recognizing the fact that a neural correlate
[00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:15.140]   may or may not correspond to consciousness
[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:17.100]   because that problem's hard
[00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:19.840]   and there's all these associated issues to it.
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:22.180]   - So that's from a neuroscience perspective,
[00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:23.580]   it's like fake it till you make it.
[00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:24.780]   So you-- - Pretty much, yeah.
[00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:26.500]   - You fake whatever the correlates are
[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:31.180]   and hopefully that's going to summon
[00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:32.660]   the thing that is consciousness.
[00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:33.500]   - Yeah, something like that.
[00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:37.940]   - And so the same thing on the chemical correlates of life.
[00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:39.860]   That sounds like, that's an awesome concept.
[00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:41.220]   Is that something that people--
[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:42.260]   - No, I just made that up.
[00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:43.100]   - Okay.
[00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:43.980]   - That was original to that tweet.
[00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:45.620]   You can cite the tweet.
[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:48.300]   Maybe I'll write it in a paper someday.
[00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:50.580]   - Chemical correlates of life, that's a good title.
[00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:52.900]   I mean, first of all, your paper is true
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:55.540]   that people should check out, have great titles.
[00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:56.500]   - Thank you.
[00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:58.140]   - Papers you're involved with.
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:01.340]   So your tweets and titles are stellar
[00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:02.620]   and also your ideas,
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:04.940]   but the tweets and titles are much more important.
[00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:05.780]   - Of course.
[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:06.620]   - So--
[00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:07.620]   - Ideas will live longer.
[00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:09.980]   - Yeah.
[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:12.260]   - They're much more diffuse though.
[00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:15.340]   - Well, yeah, the tweet is the Trojan horse
[00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:18.020]   for the idea that sticks on for a long time.
[00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:19.380]   Okay, so is there anything to say
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:20.860]   about the chemical correlates of life?
[00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:24.180]   You're saying they're similar kind of ways
[00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:25.700]   of thinking about it,
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:30.620]   but you mentioned about the communities.
[00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:32.700]   - Yeah, so I think in astrobiology,
[00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:37.820]   there's no concept of chemical correlates of life.
[00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:38.980]   We don't think about it that way.
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:40.780]   We think if we find molecules
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:44.500]   that are involved in biology, we found life.
[00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:48.020]   So I think one of my motivations there
[00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:49.260]   was just to separate the fact
[00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:53.180]   that life has abstract properties associated to it.
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:56.460]   They become imprinted in material substrates
[00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:59.540]   and those substrates are correlates for that thing,
[00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:01.220]   but they are not necessarily the thing
[00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:02.060]   we're actually looking for.
[00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:03.380]   The thing that we're looking for
[00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:05.860]   is the physics that's organizing that system to begin with,
[00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:07.340]   not the particular molecules.
[00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:10.900]   In the same sense that your consciousness
[00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:12.460]   is not your brain.
[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:17.060]   It's instantiated in your brain.
[00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:18.820]   It has to have a physical substrate,
[00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:22.340]   but the matter is not the thing that you're looking at.
[00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:24.340]   It's some other, at least not in the way
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:27.020]   that we have come to look at matter
[00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:28.340]   with traditional physics and things.
[00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:29.620]   There's something else there
[00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:31.820]   and it might be this feature of history I was talking about
[00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:35.900]   or time being actually physically represented there.
[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:38.620]   - Do you think consciousness can be engineered?
[00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:40.100]   - Yes.
[00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:41.460]   - In the same way that life can be engineered?
[00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:42.420]   - Wow, that was a fast answer.
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:43.380]   I didn't even think about that.
[00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:44.700]   That's interesting.
[00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:46.300]   - You don't have a free will.
[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:48.300]   - No, I do have free will, but it's interesting
[00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:49.500]   'cause I mean--
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:51.980]   - Now you're backtracking.
[00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:52.820]   - No, no, I do--
[00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:53.740]   - And that was predestined.
[00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:55.780]   - Yeah, no, no.
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:56.980]   No, I do believe in free will,
[00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:59.740]   but I also think that there's kind of an interesting,
[00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:03.300]   speaking about consciousness,
[00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:04.580]   what are you consciously aware of
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:07.580]   versus what is your subconscious brain
[00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:08.900]   actually processing and doing?
[00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:10.540]   And sometimes there's conflict
[00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:13.140]   between your consciousness and your subconsciousness
[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:14.900]   or your consciousness is a little slower
[00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:16.220]   than your subconscious.
[00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:18.780]   And intuition is a really important feature of that.
[00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:20.580]   And so a lot of the ways I do my science
[00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:22.300]   is guided by intuition.
[00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:23.860]   So when I give fast answers like that,
[00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:25.380]   I think it's usually because I haven't really thought
[00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:29.060]   about them and therefore that's probably telling me something.
[00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:31.580]   - Let's continue the deep analysis of your tweets.
[00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:35.900]   You said that determinism in a tweet,
[00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:38.540]   determinism and randomness play important roles
[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:40.580]   in understanding what life is.
[00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:42.540]   So let me ask on this topic of free will,
[00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:45.700]   what is determinism, what is randomness,
[00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:48.220]   and why the heck do they have anything to do
[00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:50.260]   with understanding life?
[00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:52.620]   - Yeah, and you threw free will in there,
[00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:55.020]   just throwing all the stuff in the bag.
[00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:55.940]   - Are they not related?
[00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:58.060]   Determinism and randomness? - No, no, they are related.
[00:57:58.060 --> 00:58:00.380]   No, no, sorry, I was being unfair.
[00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:02.340]   - You didn't even capitalize the tweet, by the way.
[00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:03.580]   It was all lowercase.
[00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:05.180]   - I must have been angry.
[00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:08.220]   - Oh, that was, can you analyze the emotion behind that?
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:09.900]   - No, I actually-- - Is it frustration?
[00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:10.900]   - Yeah, maybe.
[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:14.260]   So I already argued that I don't think that can happen
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:16.140]   without that whole causal history.
[00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:18.500]   And so I guess in some sense,
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:22.620]   the determinism for me arises because of the causal history.
[00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:26.820]   And I'm not really sure actually about whether
[00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:29.020]   the universe is random or deterministic.
[00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:32.180]   I just had this sort of intuition for a long time.
[00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:34.100]   I'm not sure if I agree with it anymore,
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:35.380]   but it's still kind of lingering,
[00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:37.240]   and I don't know what to do with this question.
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:40.540]   But it seems to me, so you asked the question,
[00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:41.460]   what is life?
[00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:42.880]   But you could also, why life?
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:43.740]   Why does life exist?
[00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:45.620]   What does the universe need life for?
[00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:46.840]   Not that the universe has needs,
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:48.920]   but we have to anthropocentrize things sometimes
[00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:49.860]   to talk about them.
[00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:53.900]   And I had this feeling that if it was possible
[00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:57.260]   for a cup or a desk ornament or a phone on Mars
[00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:59.580]   to spontaneously fluctuate into existence,
[00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:01.780]   the universe didn't need life to create those objects.
[00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:03.380]   It wasn't necessary for their existence.
[00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:05.700]   It was just a random fluke event.
[00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:09.140]   And so somehow to me, it seems that it can't be
[00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:11.860]   that those things form by random processes.
[00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:14.180]   They actually have to have a set of causes
[00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:17.300]   that accrue and form those things,
[00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:18.860]   and they have to have that history.
[00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:23.420]   And so it seems to me that life was somehow deeply related
[00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:25.980]   to the question of whether the underlying rules
[00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:27.680]   of our universe had randomness in them
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:29.140]   or they were fully deterministic.
[00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:30.620]   And in some ways, you can think about life
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:33.940]   as being the most deterministic part of physics
[00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:38.940]   because it's where the causes are precise in some sense.
[00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:40.380]   - Or most stable?
[00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:41.900]   So like-- - Most stable, yes.
[00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:43.020]   Most reliable.
[00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:47.180]   - Most reliable for the tools of physics.
[00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:48.220]   But what--
[00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:49.060]   - Right, well, so--
[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:50.700]   - Where's randomness come from then?
[00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:54.420]   Okay, so you were speaking with--
[00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:55.780]   - I've gone in a tangent,
[00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:57.780]   so I'm not sure where we are in the, yeah.
[00:59:57.780 --> 01:00:00.820]   - All of the universe is a kind of tangent,
[01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:03.340]   so we're embracing the tangent.
[01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:07.260]   So free will, you believe-- - Yes.
[01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:09.420]   - At this current time that you have free will--
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:11.100]   - I believe my whole life I have free will.
[01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:11.940]   What is illusion?
[01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:12.760]   No, just kidding.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:13.600]   (Lex laughing)
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:14.440]   I still believe it.
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:15.260]   - You still believe it.
[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:18.940]   So at the same time, you think that
[01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:20.860]   in your conception of the universe,
[01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:23.140]   causality seems to be pretty fundamental.
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:23.980]   - That's right.
[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:27.400]   - Which kind of wants the universe to be deterministic.
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:29.260]   So how the heck--
[01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:30.100]   - Because I'm a determ--
[01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:31.260]   - Do you think you have a free will
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:33.380]   and yet you value causality?
[01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:39.800]   - Because I depart from the conception of physics
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:42.780]   that you can write down an initial condition
[01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:43.900]   and a fixed law of motion
[01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:45.780]   and that will describe everything.
[01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:47.180]   There's no incompatibility
[01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:49.540]   if you are willing to reject that assertion.
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:51.180]   - So where's the randomness,
[01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:54.220]   where's the magic that gives birth to the free will?
[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:56.900]   Is it the randomness of the laws of physics?
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:00.100]   - No, in my mind what free will is
[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:03.260]   is the fact that I as a physical system
[01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:05.380]   have causal control over certain things.
[01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:06.980]   I don't have causal control over everything,
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:09.060]   but I have a certain set of things.
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:12.100]   And I'm also, as I described,
[01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:15.380]   sort of a nexus of a particular set of histories
[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:16.220]   that exist in the universe
[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:18.660]   and a particular set of futures that might exist.
[01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:20.660]   And those futures that might exist
[01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:25.660]   are in part specified by my physical configuration as me.
[01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:29.580]   And therefore, it may not be free will
[01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:30.760]   in the traditional sense.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:31.960]   I don't even know what people mean
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.460]   when they're talking about free will, honestly.
[01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:35.500]   It's like the whole discussion's really muddled.
[01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:38.360]   But in the sense that I am a causal agent,
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.740]   if you wanna call it that, that exists in the universe,
[01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:42.180]   and there are certain things that happen
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:45.620]   because I exist as me, then yes, I have free will.
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:49.300]   - No, but do you, Sarah,
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:51.620]   have a choice about what's going to happen next?
[01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:52.780]   - Oh, I see.
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:56.100]   - Could I have, if I run this universe again--
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:57.380]   - Yes, I think so.
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.580]   - You have a choice.
[01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:00.220]   Where's the choice come from?
[01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:02.260]   - I think that's related to the physics of consciousness.
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:03.940]   So one of the things I didn't say about that,
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:06.820]   I don't know, maybe this is me just being hopeful
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:08.620]   because maybe I just wanna have free will.
[01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:10.860]   But I don't think that we can rule out the possibility
[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:13.060]   because I don't think that we understand enough
[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:14.460]   about any of these problems.
[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:16.460]   But I think one of the things that's interesting for me
[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:18.900]   about the sort of inversion of the question
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:21.100]   of consciousness that I proposed
[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:24.140]   is one of the features that we do
[01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:27.060]   is we have imagination, right?
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:28.580]   And people don't think about imagination
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:30.820]   as a physical thing, but it is a physical thing.
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:32.540]   It exists in the universe, right?
[01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:35.620]   And so I'm really intrigued by the fact that, say,
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:38.260]   humans for, you know, another physical system
[01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:39.780]   could do this too, it's not special to humans,
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:44.260]   but for centuries imagined flying machines and rockets
[01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:45.820]   and then we finally built them, right?
[01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:47.660]   So they were represented in our minds
[01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:50.060]   and on the pages of things that we drew
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:51.860]   for hundreds of years before we could build
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:54.060]   those physical objects in the universe.
[01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:58.140]   But certainly the existence of rockets is in part
[01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:03.660]   caused by the fact that we could imagine them.
[01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:07.940]   And so there seems to be this property
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:09.900]   that some things don't exist,
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:12.100]   they've never physically existed in the universe,
[01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:14.700]   but we can imagine the possibility of them existing
[01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:16.540]   and then cause them to exist,
[01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:18.500]   maybe individually or collectively.
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:21.780]   And I think that property is related to what I would say
[01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:23.220]   about having choice or free will,
[01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:24.940]   because that set of possibilities,
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:27.380]   that thing, those set of things that you can imagine
[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:29.740]   is not constrained to your local physical environment
[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:30.660]   and history.
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:32.060]   And this is what's a little bit different
[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:34.460]   about intelligence as we see it in humans
[01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:37.860]   and AI that we wanna build than biological intelligence
[01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:40.700]   because biological intelligence is predicated completely
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:42.540]   on the history of things that's seen in the past.
[01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:45.460]   But something happened with the neural architectures
[01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:48.020]   that evolved in multicellular organisms
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:50.460]   that they don't just have access to the past history
[01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:52.460]   of their particular set of events,
[01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:55.180]   but they can imagine things that haven't happened,
[01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:56.220]   aren't on their timeline,
[01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:58.120]   and as long as they're consistent with the laws of physics,
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:03:59.620]   make them happen.
[01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:02.380]   - So this is fascinating.
[01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:05.420]   - It's trippy physics, but it exists, so there you go.
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:07.820]   - I mean, in some sense, if you look at like
[01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:11.940]   general relativity and gravity morphing space-time,
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:14.260]   in that same way, maybe whatever the physics
[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:17.420]   of consciousness might be, it might be morphing,
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:18.820]   that's like what free will is.
[01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:21.620]   It's morphing like the space,
[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:25.060]   just like ideas make rockets come to life.
[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:30.060]   It's somehow changing the space of possible realizations
[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:33.340]   of like whatever's, yeah, okay.
[01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:35.580]   - Life is kind of basically, if you wanna think about it,
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:38.540]   like life is sort of changing the probability distributions
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:39.380]   over what can exist.
[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:41.020]   That's the physics of what life is,
[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:43.460]   and then consciousness is this sort of layered property,
[01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:45.220]   your imagination on top of it,
[01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:47.300]   that kind of scrambles that a little bit more
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:50.580]   and like has access to, I don't know.
[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:53.100]   It's kind of, we don't know how to describe it, right?
[01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:54.260]   Like that's why it's interesting, but--
[01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:56.140]   - But it's probabilistic, so you do think
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:58.620]   like God plays dice, so let me--
[01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:00.580]   - No, I think the description's probabilistic.
[01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:05.180]   I don't necessarily think the underlying physics
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:06.300]   is probabilistic.
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:09.540]   I think the way that we can describe this physics
[01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:12.260]   is going to be probabilistic and statistical,
[01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:13.940]   but the underlying, like when we take measurements
[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:16.000]   in the lab, but the underlying physics itself
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.100]   might still be deterministic.
[01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:20.940]   I don't know, maybe I'm, it's hard to know
[01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:22.340]   what concepts to hold onto,
[01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:24.780]   so I find myself constantly rejecting concepts,
[01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:26.220]   but then I have to grab another one
[01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:29.660]   and try to hold onto something from intellectual history.
[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:31.340]   - Well, it's possible that our mind is not able
[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:33.420]   to hold the correct concepts in mind at all.
[01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:36.100]   Like we're not able to even conceive of them correctly.
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:39.020]   Maybe the words deterministic or random
[01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:42.380]   are not the right even words, concepts to be holding.
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:46.580]   But maybe you can talk to the theory of everything,
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:49.340]   this attempt in the current set of physical laws
[01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:50.880]   to try to unify them.
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:55.300]   Is there any hope that once a theory of everything
[01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:56.860]   is developed, and by theory of everything,
[01:05:56.860 --> 01:06:00.300]   I mean in a narrow sense of unifying quantum field theory
[01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:03.260]   and general relativity, do you think that will contain
[01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:08.260]   some, like in order to do that unification,
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:11.860]   you would have to get something that would then give hints
[01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:15.020]   about the physics of life, physics of existence,
[01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:15.860]   physics of consciousness?
[01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:19.180]   - Yeah, I used to not, but I actually,
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:23.880]   I have become increasingly convinced that it probably will.
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.840]   And part of the reason is, I think I've talked
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:29.300]   a little bit already about these holes in physics,
[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:32.620]   like these, the theories we have in physics,
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:35.340]   you know, they have problems, they have lots of problems,
[01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:37.140]   and they're very deep problems,
[01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:39.060]   and we don't know how to patch them.
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:41.200]   And some of those problems become very evident
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:43.460]   when you try to patch quantum mechanics
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:45.660]   and general relativity together.
[01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:47.540]   So there is this kind of interesting feature
[01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:49.860]   that some of the ways of patching that
[01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:54.180]   might actually closely resemble the physics of life.
[01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:56.420]   And so the place where that actually comes up most,
[01:06:56.420 --> 01:06:58.740]   and actually we just had a workshop in the Beyond Center
[01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:00.580]   where I work at Arizona State University,
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:02.740]   and Lee Smolin made this point that he thinks
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:05.080]   that the theory of quantum gravity, when we solve it,
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:08.460]   is gonna be the same theory that gives rise to life.
[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:11.460]   And I think that I agree with him on some levels
[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:12.940]   because there's something very interesting
[01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:16.160]   where if you look at these sort of causal set theories
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:18.660]   of gravity, where they're looking for space
[01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:23.620]   as being emergent, and so space-time is an emergent concept
[01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:26.180]   from a causal set, which is also sort of related,
[01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:29.180]   I think, to what Wolfram's doing with his physics project.
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:30.780]   It's the same kind of underlying math
[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:32.900]   that we have in this theory that we've been developing
[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:35.540]   related to life called assembly theory,
[01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:39.780]   which is basically trying to look at complex objects
[01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:43.860]   like molecules and bacteria and living things
[01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:51.460]   as basically being assembled from a set of component parts
[01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:54.640]   and that they actually encode all the possible histories
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.620]   that they could have in that physical object.
[01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:59.000]   So mathematically, all these ideas, I think,
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:07:59.840]   are related.
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:00.680]   I think a lot of people are thinking about this
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.280]   from different perspectives.
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:04.460]   And then constructor theory that David Deutsch
[01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:05.960]   and Chiara Marleto have been developing
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:07.580]   is a totally different angle on it,
[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:09.100]   but I think getting at some similar ideas.
[01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:11.180]   So it's a really interesting time right now, I think,
[01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:13.700]   for the frontiers of physics and how it's relating
[01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:15.940]   to maybe deeper principles about what life is.
[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:17.100]   So short answer, yes.
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:19.200]   Long-winded answer, rewind.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:22.780]   - Can we talk about aliens?
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:23.620]   - Anytime.
[01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:25.660]   (laughing)
[01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:28.340]   - So one, I think one interesting way
[01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:31.220]   to sneak up on the question of what is life
[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:36.140]   is to ask what should we look for in alien life?
[01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:40.620]   If we were to look out into our galaxy
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:44.320]   and into the universe and come up with a framework
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:47.500]   of how to detect alien life,
[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:49.660]   what should we be looking for?
[01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:52.300]   Is there a set of rules?
[01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:57.980]   It's both the tools and the tools that are,
[01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:01.700]   serve as sensors for certain kind of properties of life.
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:05.420]   So what should we look for in alien life?
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:08.020]   - Yeah, so we have a paper actually coming out on Monday,
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:09.660]   which is collaboration.
[01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:11.700]   It's actually really Lee Cronin's lab,
[01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:12.940]   but my group worked with him on it
[01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:13.860]   and we're working on the theory,
[01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:18.060]   which is this idea that we should look for life
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:20.340]   as high assembly objects.
[01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:22.420]   What we mean by that is,
[01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:24.460]   which is actually observationally measurable.
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:25.420]   And this is one of the reasons
[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:27.220]   that I started working with Lee on these ideas
[01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:30.020]   is because being a theorist, it's easy to work in a vacuum.
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:32.600]   It's very hard to connect abstract ideas
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:33.700]   about the nature of life
[01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:35.900]   to anything that's experimentally tractable.
[01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:39.500]   But what his lab has been able to do
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:43.180]   is develop this method where they look at a molecule
[01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:46.220]   and they break it apart into all its component parts.
[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:48.460]   And so you say you have some elementary building blocks
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:51.220]   and you can build up all the ways of putting those together
[01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:52.740]   to make the original object.
[01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:55.300]   And then you look for the shortest path in that space.
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:59.140]   And you say that's sort of the assembly number
[01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:00.940]   associated to that object.
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:02.900]   And if that number's higher,
[01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:05.860]   it assumes that a longer causal history
[01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:07.500]   is necessary to produce that object
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:08.820]   or more information is necessary
[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:11.480]   to specify the creation of that object in the universe.
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:14.220]   Now that kind of idea at a superficial level
[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:15.840]   has existed for a long time.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:19.260]   That kind of idea as a physical observable of molecules
[01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:20.820]   is completely novel.
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:22.860]   And what his lab has been able to show
[01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:24.580]   is that if you look at a bunch of samples
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:26.860]   of non-biological things and biological things,
[01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:31.380]   there's this kind of threshold of assembly
[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:34.940]   where as far as the experimental evidence is
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:38.120]   and also your intuition would suggest
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:41.240]   that non-biological systems don't produce things
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.220]   with high assembly number.
[01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:44.740]   So this goes back to the idea
[01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:47.120]   like a protein's not gonna spontaneously fluctuate
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:48.740]   into existence on the surface of Mars.
[01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:50.180]   It requires an evolutionary process
[01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:52.700]   and a biological architecture to produce a protein.
[01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:54.340]   You generalize that argument,
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:58.860]   you know a complex molecule or a cup or a desk ornament
[01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:02.020]   in this sort of abstract idea of assembly spaces
[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:04.620]   as being the causal history of objects.
[01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:06.300]   And you can talk about the shortest path
[01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:08.500]   from elementary objects to an object
[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:11.000]   given an elementary set of operations.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.260]   And you can experimentally measure that with a mass spec.
[01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:16.700]   And that's basically sort of the idea.
[01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:17.700]   - That's really fascinating.
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:19.100]   I can't get out of my head.
[01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:20.860]   I'd start imagining Legos
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:23.380]   and all the Legos I've ever built and how many steps.
[01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:25.340]   What is the shortest path to the final--
[01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:26.180]   - Right, right.
[01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:28.460]   - To find a little Lego castles.
[01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:30.660]   - So yeah, so then like asking
[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:31.840]   about going to look for alien life,
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:35.580]   the idea is most of the instruments that NASA builds,
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:37.500]   for example, or any of the space agencies
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:38.620]   looking for life in the universe
[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:42.020]   are looking for chemical correlates of life, right?
[01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:43.380]   But here we have something
[01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:46.300]   that is based on properties of molecules.
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:47.860]   It's not a chemical correlate.
[01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:49.140]   It's agnostic.
[01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:50.540]   It doesn't care about the molecule.
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:54.260]   It cares about what is the history necessary
[01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:56.340]   to produce this molecule.
[01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:58.780]   How complex is it in terms of how much time is needing,
[01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:00.860]   how much information is required to produce it.
[01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:04.220]   - So when you observe a thing on another planet,
[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:06.500]   you're essentially,
[01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:08.540]   the process looks like reverse engineering,
[01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:10.500]   trying to figure out what is the shortest path
[01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:11.620]   to create that thing.
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:12.980]   - Yeah, so most, yeah.
[01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:14.300]   And I would say most,
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:16.700]   like most examples of biology or technology
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:18.100]   don't take the shortest path, right?
[01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:20.140]   But the shortest path is a bound on how hard it is
[01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:21.660]   for the universe to make that.
[01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:25.100]   - Yeah, and I guess you and Lee are saying
[01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:26.580]   that there's a heuristic,
[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:29.260]   that's a good metric for,
[01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:31.620]   like better perhaps than chemical correlates.
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:33.380]   - Yes, because it doesn't,
[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:36.780]   it's not contingent on looking for the chemistry of life
[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:38.940]   on Earth, on other planets.
[01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:42.020]   And it also has a deeper explanatory framework
[01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:44.660]   associated to it, as far as the kind of theory
[01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:45.700]   that we're trying to develop
[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:47.260]   associated to what life is.
[01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:48.900]   And I think this is one of the problems I have
[01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:51.620]   in my field personally in astrobiology,
[01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:53.940]   is people observe something on Earth,
[01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:56.140]   say oxygen in the atmosphere,
[01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:58.460]   or an amino acid in a cell,
[01:12:58.460 --> 01:12:59.500]   and then they say,
[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:02.260]   let's go look for that on another planet.
[01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:04.060]   Let's look for oxygen on exoplanets,
[01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:06.300]   or let's look for amino acids on Mars.
[01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:09.140]   And then they assume that's a way of looking for life.
[01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:13.540]   Or even phosphine on Venus.
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:15.220]   But you know, like there's all these examples
[01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:17.220]   of let's look for one molecule.
[01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:18.420]   A molecule is not life.
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:20.980]   Life is a system that patterns
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:22.460]   particular structures into matter.
[01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:24.460]   That's like, that's what it is.
[01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:26.780]   And it doesn't care what molecules are there.
[01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:28.180]   It's something about the patterns
[01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:30.180]   and that structure and that history.
[01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:33.260]   And if you're looking for a molecule,
[01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:34.700]   you're not testing any hypotheses
[01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:36.220]   about the nature of what life is.
[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:37.460]   It doesn't tell me anything
[01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:39.060]   if we discover oxygen on an exoplanet
[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:40.220]   about what kind of life is there.
[01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:42.060]   Just oxygen on an exoplanet.
[01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:44.020]   It's not, there's,
[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:46.660]   I guess I think like when you think about the question,
[01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:47.780]   are we alone in the universe?
[01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:49.500]   That's a pretty fricking deep question.
[01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.020]   It should have a fricking deep answer.
[01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:53.020]   It shouldn't just be there's a molecule on an exoplanet.
[01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:54.520]   Wow, we solved the problem.
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:56.540]   It should tell us something meaningful about our existence.
[01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:58.980]   And I feel like we've fallen short
[01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:01.180]   on how we're searching for life
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:05.260]   in terms of actually searching for things like us
[01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:06.960]   in this kind of deeper way.
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:10.380]   - But how do you do that initial kind of,
[01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:12.060]   say I'm walking down the street
[01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:15.540]   and I'm looking for that double take test of like,
[01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:17.180]   like what the hell is that?
[01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:19.700]   Like that initial,
[01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:24.180]   like how do we look for the possibility of weirdness
[01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:27.220]   or the possibility of high assembly number?
[01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:30.060]   What would aliens look like
[01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:32.740]   if they don't have two eyes and are green?
[01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:35.500]   - If I knew, I would have probably already solved the problem.
[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:37.620]   - Right, there's another Nobel prize in there somewhere.
[01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:39.860]   - Yeah, somewhere in there.
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:41.300]   Well, I think it's kind of,
[01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:43.180]   so there is a bias here, right?
[01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:45.940]   So we've evolved to recognize life on earth, right?
[01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:48.660]   Like I, you know, children at a very early age
[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:50.700]   can tell the difference between a puppy and a plant
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:53.460]   and then the plant and a chair, for example,
[01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:55.740]   you know, like it just, it seems innate.
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:58.560]   And so I think, and also because we're life,
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:02.620]   you know, I think like there's this implicit bias
[01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:03.900]   that we should know it when we see it
[01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:06.820]   and it should be completely obvious to us.
[01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:08.980]   But there are a lot of features of our universe
[01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:10.420]   that are not completely obvious to us.
[01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:12.420]   Like the fact that this table is made of atoms
[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:14.620]   and that I'm sitting in a gravitational
[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:16.100]   potential well right now.
[01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:19.500]   And I guess my point with this is,
[01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:23.280]   I think life is much less obvious than we think it is.
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:27.100]   And so it could be in many more forms than we think it is.
[01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:28.760]   And I guess this goes back to the point
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:31.720]   about being open-minded that we may not know
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:33.020]   what alien life looks like.
[01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:35.500]   It might not even be possible to interact with alien life
[01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:38.100]   'cause maybe something about, you know,
[01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:41.260]   our informational lineage, it makes it impossible
[01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:43.900]   for information from an alien to be copied to us.
[01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:46.060]   Therefore there's no, you know,
[01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:47.820]   so to speak communication channel.
[01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:49.860]   And I don't mean, you know, verbal communication,
[01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:53.000]   just it's not in our observational space.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.700]   Like, you know, like, you know,
[01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:57.300]   there's fundamental questions about why we observe
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:59.060]   the universe in position rather than momentum,
[01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:01.460]   but we also, you know, observe it
[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:03.660]   in terms of certain informational patterns and things.
[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:05.020]   Like that's what our brain constructs
[01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:07.340]   and maybe aliens just interact
[01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:08.660]   with a different part of reality than we do.
[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:10.660]   That's wildly speculative, but I think--
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:12.860]   - But it's possible.
[01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:15.140]   - It's possible and I think it's consistent with the physics.
[01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:17.180]   So I think the best ways we can ask questions
[01:16:17.180 --> 01:16:20.580]   are about life and chemistry and asking questions
[01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:23.340]   about if information is a real physical thing,
[01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:25.700]   what would its signatures be in matter?
[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:28.940]   And how do we recognize those?
[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:31.540]   And I think the ones that are most obvious
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:33.080]   are the ones I've already articulated.
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.680]   You have these objects that seem completely improbable
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:36.900]   for the universe to produce
[01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:39.140]   because the universe doesn't have the design
[01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:40.980]   of that object in the laws.
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:44.500]   So therefore, an object had to evolve.
[01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:46.740]   We talk, we call it evolution,
[01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:48.500]   but it had to be produced by the universe
[01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:51.380]   that then had all of the possible tasks
[01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:54.700]   to make that object specified.
[01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:56.020]   - I mean, there's some, like,
[01:16:56.020 --> 01:16:59.140]   there's an engineering question here of,
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:02.100]   are there sensors we can create that can give us,
[01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:05.740]   can help us discover certain pockets
[01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:08.460]   of high assemblies, aliens?
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:10.980]   Like, I mean, there is a hope,
[01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:14.660]   setting dogs and chairs aside,
[01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:19.460]   there's a hope that visually we could detect.
[01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:22.860]   Like, because our universe,
[01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:24.500]   I mean, at least the way we look at it now,
[01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:27.220]   like this three-dimensional, like space-time,
[01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:29.380]   we can visually comprehend it.
[01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:32.780]   It's interesting to think, like, if we got to hang out,
[01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:34.900]   you know, if there's an alien in this room,
[01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:37.760]   like, would we be able to detect it
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:39.340]   with our current sensors?
[01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:41.700]   Not the fancy kinds, but like webcams.
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:43.340]   - Like, say, standing over there?
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:44.460]   - Yeah, standing over there,
[01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:45.860]   or maybe like in this carpet.
[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:47.580]   See, there's all these kinds of patterns, right?
[01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:48.420]   - Yeah.
[01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:52.900]   - I don't know if this carpet is an alien.
[01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:55.160]   - Well, so I see what you're saying.
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.820]   So assembly theory is pretty general.
[01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:00.020]   Like, I mean, we've been applying it to molecules
[01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:02.160]   because it makes sense to apply it to molecules,
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:05.080]   but it's supposed to explain life,
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.200]   you know, like the physics of life.
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:09.300]   So it should explain, you know, the things in this room
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:11.280]   in addition to molecules.
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:14.640]   So I guess, and you can apply it to images and things.
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:18.600]   So I guess the idea, you know, you could explore
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:21.280]   is just looking at everything on planet Earth
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.200]   in terms of its assembly structure,
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:24.960]   and then looking for things
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:27.080]   that aren't part of our biological lineage.
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:29.440]   If they have high assembly, they might be aliens on Earth.
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:30.880]   - I mean, that is a very kind of
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:32.320]   rigorous computer vision question.
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:36.600]   Can we visually, is there a strong correlation
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:38.560]   between certain kind of high assembly objects
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:42.080]   when they get to the scale where they're visually observable
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:47.080]   and some, like when it's, say, projected onto a 2D plane,
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:49.720]   can we figure out something?
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:51.520]   - I'm glad you brought up the computer vision point
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:53.600]   'cause for a while I had this kind of thought in my mind
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:55.240]   that we can't even see ourselves clearly.
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:56.560]   So one of the things, you know,
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:58.000]   people are worried about artificial intelligence
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.920]   for a lot of reasons, but I think it's really fascinating
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:03.360]   'cause it's like the first time in history
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:04.480]   that we're building a system
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:06.400]   that can help us understand ourselves.
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:08.600]   So like, you know, people talk about AI physics,
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:12.560]   but like, you know, when I look at another person,
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:15.440]   I don't see them as a four billion year lineage,
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:18.200]   but that's what they are, and so is everything here, right?
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:21.480]   So imagine that we built artificial systems
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:24.320]   that could actually see that feature of us.
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:25.680]   What else would they see?
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:28.720]   And I think that's what you're asking.
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:31.920]   And I think that would be so cool.
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:34.360]   (both laughing)
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:35.400]   I want that to happen,
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:37.160]   but I think we're a little ways off from it,
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:40.240]   but yeah, we're going there, I hope.
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:43.440]   - Okay, let me ask you, I apologize ahead of time,
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:45.200]   but let me ask you the internet question.
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:47.600]   So you're a physicist, you ask rigorous questions
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:49.680]   about the physics of existence
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:52.880]   and these models of high assembly objects.
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:55.200]   Now, when the internet would see an alien,
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:56.480]   they would ask two questions.
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:58.160]   One, can I eat it?
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:00.000]   And two, can I have sex with it?
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:00.840]   - Yes.
[01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:02.480]   - So... (laughs)
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:04.600]   - All the existential questions.
[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:05.440]   Those are very important.
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:07.160]   - The internet is very sophisticated.
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:08.000]   - It really is.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.600]   It's gotten our basal cognition pretty good.
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:12.640]   - So you kind of mentioned that it's very difficult.
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:15.040]   It's possible that we may not be even able
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:16.120]   to communicate with it.
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:18.560]   - Right, I think the internet has more hope than we do.
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:20.520]   - Yeah, it's a hopeful place, yes.
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:23.720]   Do you think in terms of like interacting
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:27.760]   on this very primal level of sharing resources,
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:28.920]   like what would aliens eat?
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:29.920]   What would we eat?
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:31.440]   Would we eat the same thing?
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:33.960]   Could we potentially eat each other?
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:37.280]   One person eats the other or the aliens eat us.
[01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:40.680]   And the same thing with not sex in general reproduction,
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:42.360]   but genetically mixing stuff.
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:46.600]   Like would we be able to mix genetic information?
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:48.800]   - Maybe not genetic, but maybe information, right?
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.520]   And I think part of your question is like,
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:54.200]   so if you think of life as like this history
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:55.600]   of events that happen in the universe,
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:57.000]   like there's this question of like,
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.320]   how divergent are those histories, right?
[01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:00.920]   So when we get to the scale of technology,
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:02.920]   it's possible to imagine,
[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:04.560]   imagine, although we can't even do it,
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:06.200]   like imagine all the possible technologies
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:07.320]   that could exist in the universe.
[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:09.080]   But if you think about all the possible chemistries,
[01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:11.320]   somehow that seems like a lower dimensional space
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:13.160]   and a lower set of possibilities.
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:16.280]   So it might be that like when we interact with aliens,
[01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:19.560]   we do have to go back to those more basal levels
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:23.160]   to figure out sort of what the map is, right?
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:26.160]   Like the sort of where we have a common history.
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:29.280]   We must have a common history somewhere in the universe,
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.820]   but in order to be able to actually interact
[01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:34.000]   in a meaningful way, you have to have some shared history.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000]   I mean, the reason we can exchange genetic information
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.520]   and eat each other's food or eat each other as food
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:41.160]   is because we have a shared history.
[01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:43.160]   - So we have to find that shared history.
[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:44.680]   We have to find the common ancestor
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:47.640]   in this causality map, this causality tree.
[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:50.040]   - Yes, and we have a last universal common ancestor
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:52.280]   for all life on earth, which I think is sort of the nexus
[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:54.520]   of that causality map for life on earth.
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:58.120]   But the question is, where would other aliens diverge
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:00.120]   on that map? - That's really interesting.
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:04.780]   So say there's a lot of aliens out there in the universe,
[01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:08.660]   each set of organisms would probably have like a number,
[01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:13.240]   you know, like Erdos number of like how far,
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:16.040]   like how far our common ancestor is.
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:19.680]   And so the closer the common ancestor, like it is on earth,
[01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:21.920]   the more like each other, the more likely we are
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:24.200]   to be able to have sexual reproduction.
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:25.300]   - Well, it's like sort of like humans
[01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:27.240]   having common culture and languages, right?
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:30.160]   - Yeah, exactly, language, communication.
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:32.400]   - It might take a lot of work though with an alien
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:35.640]   'cause you really have to get over a language barrier.
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:40.120]   - Oh boy, so it's communication, it's resources.
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:41.660]   I mean, it's the whole.
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:46.360]   - And I think tied into that is the questions
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:48.320]   of like who's gonna harm who.
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:49.800]   And actually definitions of harm.
[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:50.960]   - And whether your parents approve,
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:52.840]   you know, all those kind of questions.
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:55.000]   - Whether the common ancestor approves, yeah.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.280]   It's just very true.
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:23:00.860]   How many alien civilizations do you think are out there?
[01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:03.960]   - I don't have intuition for that,
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:07.480]   which I have always thought was deeply intriguing.
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:11.480]   So, and part of this, I mean, I say it specifically
[01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:12.740]   as I don't have intuition for that
[01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:14.200]   because it's like one of those questions
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:15.520]   that you feel around for a while
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:19.400]   and you really just, you can't see it,
[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:20.900]   even though it might be right there.
[01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:24.240]   And in that sense, it's a little like
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:25.860]   the quantum to classical transition.
[01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:26.800]   You're like really talking about
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:28.040]   two different kinds of physics.
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:29.400]   And I think that's kind of part of the problem.
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:30.420]   Once we understand the physics,
[01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:33.080]   that question might become more meaningful.
[01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:34.780]   But there's also this other issue.
[01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:37.760]   And this was really instilled on me
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:39.740]   by my mentor, Paul Davies, when I was a postdoc
[01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:42.280]   'cause he always talks about how, you know,
[01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:45.880]   whether aliens are common or rare is kind of just,
[01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:49.280]   you know, it follows a wave of popularity
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:51.400]   and it just depends on like the mood of, you know,
[01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:53.240]   what the culture is at the time.
[01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:54.080]   And I always thought that was kind of
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:55.860]   an intriguing observation,
[01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:58.440]   but also there's this set of points about
[01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:00.000]   if you go by the observational evidence,
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.280]   which we're supposed to do as scientists, right?
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:08.680]   You know, we have evidence of us
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:11.640]   and one original life event from which we emerged.
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:13.160]   And people wanna make arguments
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:15.800]   that because that event was rapid
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:17.320]   or because there's other planets
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:18.800]   that have properties similar to ours,
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:20.480]   that that event should be common.
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:22.080]   But you actually can't reason on that
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:23.780]   because our existence observing that event
[01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:25.780]   is contingent on that event happening,
[01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:27.880]   which means it could have been completely improbable
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:29.400]   or very common.
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:31.840]   And Brandon Carter like clearly articulated that
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:35.440]   in terms of anthropic arguments a few decades ago.
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:38.000]   So there is this kind of issue
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.880]   that we have to contend with dealing with life
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:41.920]   that's closer to home than we have to deal with
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:43.680]   with any other problems in physics,
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:45.840]   which we're talking about the physics of ourselves.
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:47.700]   And when you're asking about the original life event,
[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:49.000]   that event happening in the universe,
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.640]   at least it's like our existence is contingent on it.
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:55.840]   And so you can think about sort of fine tuning arguments
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:56.680]   that way too.
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:00.040]   So, but the sort of other part of it is like,
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:03.240]   when I think about how likely it is,
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:06.360]   I think it's because we don't understand this mechanism yet
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:10.880]   about how information can be generated spontaneously.
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:13.880]   That I like, 'cause I can't see that physics clearly yet,
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:15.840]   even though I have a lot of,
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:18.720]   like some things around the space of it in my mind,
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:22.520]   I can't articulate how likely that process is.
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:24.220]   So my honest answer is, I don't know.
[01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:25.960]   And sometimes that feels like a cop out,
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.440]   but I feel like that's a more honest answer
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:29.840]   and a more meaningful way of making progress
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:32.800]   than what a lot of people wanna do, which is say,
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:34.880]   oh, well, we have a one in 10 chance of having it
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:36.520]   on an exoplanet with Earth-like properties
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:38.800]   because there's lots of Earth-like planets out there
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.360]   and life happened fast on Earth.
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:43.000]   - Well, so, kind of a follow-up question,
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.360]   but as a side comment,
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:47.400]   what I really am enjoying about the way
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:50.120]   you're talking about human beings is you always say,
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:51.640]   and not to make yourself conscious about it,
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:54.520]   'cause I really, really enjoy it, that you say we.
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:57.400]   - Yes. - You don't say humans.
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:00.240]   You say, 'cause oftentimes, like, you know,
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:01.800]   I don't know, evolutionary biologists
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:05.440]   will kind of put yourself out as an observer,
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:08.280]   but it's kind of fascinating to think
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:11.080]   that you as a human are struggling about your own origins.
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:13.760]   - Yes, that's the problem, and yeah,
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:17.200]   and I think, I don't do that deliberately,
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:18.480]   but I do think that way,
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:19.800]   and this is sort of the inversion
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:20.880]   from the logic of physics,
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:23.540]   because physics, as it's always been constructed,
[01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:26.440]   has treated us as external observers of the universe,
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:27.720]   and we are not part of the universe,
[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:29.700]   and this is why the problem of life, I think,
[01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:31.360]   demands completely new thinking,
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:33.640]   because we have to think about ourselves
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:35.640]   as minds that exist in the universe,
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:37.840]   and are at this particular moment in history,
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:39.720]   and looking out at the things around us,
[01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:42.760]   and trying to understand what we are inside the system,
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:43.880]   not outside the system.
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:46.840]   We don't have descriptions at a fundamental level
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:48.880]   that describe us as inside the system,
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:51.320]   and this was my problem with cellular automata also.
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:54.240]   You're always an external observer for a cellular automata.
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:55.320]   You're not in the system.
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:58.040]   What does a cellular automata look like from the inside?
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:00.960]   - I think you just broke my brain with that question.
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:01.800]   - Exactly, but that's the fundamental--
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:03.320]   - I thought about that for a long time, but.
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:05.840]   (laughing)
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:08.800]   - Yeah, that's a really clean formulation
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:10.640]   of a very fundamental question,
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:13.640]   'cause you can only, to understand cellular automata,
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.000]   you have to be inside of it,
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:20.880]   but as a human, sort of a poetic, romantic question,
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:22.120]   does it make you sad?
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:27.120]   Does it make you hopeful, whether we're alone or not?
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:30.260]   In the different possible versions of that,
[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:36.060]   if we're the highest assembly object in the entire universe,
[01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:36.980]   does that give you--
[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:38.180]   - At this moment in time, maybe.
[01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:39.860]   - At this moment in the causality--
[01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:41.860]   - 'Cause we may, I assume we have a future.
[01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:43.500]   - Well, we definitely have a future.
[01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:48.420]   The question is where that future decreases the assembly.
[01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:52.860]   It could be we're at the peak, or we could be just--
[01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:55.780]   - That would be inconsistent with the physics in my mind,
[01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:59.140]   but, so I should give a caveat.
[01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:01.580]   I've given the caveat that I'm biased as a physicist,
[01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:03.580]   but I'm also biased as an eternal optimist,
[01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:06.580]   so pretty much all of my modes of operation
[01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:08.140]   for building theories about the world
[01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:10.180]   are not like an Occam's razor,
[01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:11.660]   what's the simplest explanation,
[01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:14.460]   but what's the most optimistic explanation?
[01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:17.380]   And part of the reason for that is if you really think
[01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:20.460]   explanations have causal power,
[01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:23.180]   in the sense that the fact that we have theories
[01:28:23.180 --> 01:28:24.980]   about the world has enabled technologies
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:27.580]   and physically transformed the world around us.
[01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:29.140]   I think I have to take seriously that
[01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:31.420]   as a part of the physics I wanna describe,
[01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:35.900]   and try to build theories of reality
[01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:37.860]   that are optimistic about what's coming next,
[01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:39.140]   because the theories are in part
[01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:40.660]   the causes of what comes next.
[01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:45.060]   - So there could be a physics of hope
[01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:46.940]   or a physics of optimism in there too.
[01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:48.060]   - Yes.
[01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:51.140]   - 'Cause that seems like also, I mean,
[01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:53.980]   optimism does seem to be a kind of engine
[01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:56.260]   that results in innovation.
[01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:57.100]   - Yes.
[01:28:57.100 --> 01:28:59.660]   - So this is, like, why the hell
[01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:02.060]   are we trying to come up with new stuff?
[01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:04.660]   - Oh, so I made this point about thinking
[01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:06.140]   life is the physics of existence,
[01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:07.820]   and it's not just the physics of existence,
[01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:11.380]   it's the physics of more things existing.
[01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:12.700]   So I think one of these drives--
[01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:13.660]   - Creativity.
[01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:15.700]   - Yeah, creativity, like optimism.
[01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:19.940]   People like entropy, I don't like entropy
[01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:21.380]   as it was formulated in the 1800s,
[01:29:21.380 --> 01:29:22.780]   I think it's an antiquated concept,
[01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:27.620]   but this idea of maximizing over the possible number
[01:29:27.620 --> 01:29:28.860]   of states that could exist.
[01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:31.060]   Imagine the universe is actually trying to maximize
[01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:33.340]   over the number of things that could physically exist.
[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:34.700]   What would be the best way to do that?
[01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:35.620]   The best way to do that would be
[01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:37.780]   evolve intelligent technological things
[01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:39.260]   that could explore that space.
[01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:43.860]   - So okay, that's talking about alien life
[01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:45.220]   out there in the universe,
[01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:46.980]   but you've also earlier in the conversation
[01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:50.180]   mentioned the shadow biosphere.
[01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:51.860]   So is it possible?
[01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:56.340]   That we have weird life here on Earth
[01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:58.460]   that we're just not,
[01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:02.180]   like even in a high assembly formulation of life,
[01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:07.020]   that we're just not paying attention to, we're blind to?
[01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:09.500]   Like life we're potentially able to detect,
[01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:10.500]   but we're blind to?
[01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:12.380]   And maybe you could say, what is the shadow biosphere?
[01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:13.340]   - Sure, sure.
[01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:15.180]   Yeah, the shadow biosphere is this idea
[01:30:15.180 --> 01:30:17.940]   that there might have been other original life events
[01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:20.980]   that happened on Earth that were independent
[01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:24.020]   from the original life event that led to us
[01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:26.340]   and all of the life that we know on Earth.
[01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:29.340]   And therefore there could be aliens
[01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:32.100]   in the sense they have a different origin event
[01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:33.260]   living among us.
[01:30:33.260 --> 01:30:37.140]   And it was proposed by a number of people,
[01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:39.900]   but one of them was Paul Davies
[01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:41.180]   that I mentioned earlier as my mentor.
[01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:42.940]   And he has a really cute way of saying
[01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:44.780]   that aliens could be right under our noses
[01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:46.100]   or even in our noses.
[01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:50.340]   With a British accent, it sounds better.
[01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:53.740]   But anyway, so the idea is like,
[01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:56.420]   it could literally be anywhere around us.
[01:30:56.420 --> 01:30:58.220]   And if you think actually about the discovery
[01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:00.220]   of like viruses and bacteria,
[01:31:00.220 --> 01:31:02.380]   for a long time, they were kind of a shadow biosphere.
[01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:06.060]   It was life that was around us, but invisible.
[01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:09.780]   But this takes it a little bit further
[01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:13.100]   in saying that all of those examples, viruses, bacteria,
[01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:14.940]   and everything that we've discovered so far
[01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:16.140]   has this common ancestry
[01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:18.540]   and the last universal common ancestor of life on Earth.
[01:31:18.580 --> 01:31:20.500]   So maybe there was a different origin event
[01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:24.500]   and that life is weirder still and might be among us
[01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:25.620]   and we could find it.
[01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:28.540]   We don't have to go out and the stars look for aliens
[01:31:28.540 --> 01:31:29.660]   just here on Earth.
[01:31:29.660 --> 01:31:32.940]   - Do you think that's a serious possibility
[01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:35.220]   that we should explore with the tools of science?
[01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:36.900]   Like this should be a serious effort?
[01:31:36.900 --> 01:31:39.580]   - I think yes and no.
[01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:44.300]   And I mean, yes, because I think it's a serious hypothesis
[01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:46.340]   and I think it's worth exploring
[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:48.860]   and it is certainly more economical
[01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:52.060]   to look for signs of alien life on Earth
[01:31:52.060 --> 01:31:54.180]   than it is to go and build spacecraft
[01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:56.300]   and send robots to other planets.
[01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:58.340]   And that was one of the reasons it was proposed is,
[01:31:58.340 --> 01:31:59.740]   well, if we do find an example
[01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:01.980]   of another original life on Earth,
[01:32:01.980 --> 01:32:03.260]   it's hugely informative
[01:32:03.260 --> 01:32:05.460]   because it means the original life is not a rare event.
[01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:08.060]   If it happened twice on the same planet,
[01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:09.580]   that means it's probably pretty probable
[01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:11.660]   given conditions are right.
[01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:14.180]   So it has huge potential scientific impact,
[01:32:14.180 --> 01:32:15.660]   not to mention the fact that you might have
[01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:17.620]   like biochemistry and stuff that's informative
[01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:19.060]   for like medicine and stuff like that.
[01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:22.220]   But I think that the thing for me
[01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:23.340]   that's challenging about it,
[01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:24.700]   and this really comes from my own work,
[01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:28.900]   like thinking about life as a planetary scale process
[01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:31.020]   and also trying to understand
[01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:31.940]   sometimes what I call like
[01:32:31.940 --> 01:32:33.860]   the statistical mechanics of biochemistry,
[01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:35.660]   but large scale statistical patterns
[01:32:35.660 --> 01:32:38.460]   in the chemistry that life uses on Earth.
[01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:40.700]   There are a lot of regularities there
[01:32:40.740 --> 01:32:45.740]   and life does seem to have planetary scale organization
[01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:47.900]   that's consistent even with some of the patterns
[01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:49.300]   that we see at the individual scale.
[01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:52.100]   So if you think life is a planetary scale phenomena
[01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:54.300]   and the chemistry of life has to be sort of,
[01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:56.580]   not just, it's not,
[01:32:56.580 --> 01:32:58.140]   an individual is not necessarily
[01:32:58.140 --> 01:33:00.060]   the fundamental unit of life, right?
[01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:01.260]   The fundamental unit of life
[01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:03.900]   is these informational lineages
[01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:05.300]   and they're kind of,
[01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:08.340]   they intersect over spatial scales.
[01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:10.420]   So everything on Earth is kind of related
[01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:12.540]   by the common causal history.
[01:33:12.540 --> 01:33:14.180]   So it's hard for me,
[01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:15.980]   based on the way I think about the physics
[01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:19.140]   and also some of the stuff that my group has done,
[01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:22.700]   to really think that there could be evidence
[01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:25.180]   or there could be a second sample of life on Earth.
[01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:26.340]   But I think there are ways
[01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:28.620]   that we need to be more concrete about that.
[01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:30.700]   And I have thought a little bit about,
[01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:33.500]   like you can represent the chemistry
[01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:35.740]   in an individual cell as a network.
[01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:37.540]   And then those networks,
[01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:39.380]   something my group has shown,
[01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:42.540]   actually scale with the same property.
[01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:43.940]   So ecosystems have the same properties
[01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:46.100]   as individuals as planetary scale.
[01:33:46.100 --> 01:33:47.140]   And then you could imagine
[01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:49.620]   if you had alien chemistry intermixed in there,
[01:33:49.620 --> 01:33:50.980]   that scaling would be broken.
[01:33:50.980 --> 01:33:52.820]   So if there's some robustness property
[01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:54.620]   or something associated to it,
[01:33:54.620 --> 01:33:56.060]   and you get alien chemistry in there,
[01:33:56.060 --> 01:33:57.180]   it just breaks everything.
[01:33:57.180 --> 01:34:00.780]   And you don't have a planetary ecosystem functioning
[01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:04.620]   and individuals functioning across all these scales.
[01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:06.220]   So I guess what I'm arguing
[01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:08.460]   is life is not a scale dependent phenomena.
[01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:10.260]   It's not just cellular life.
[01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:11.540]   So if you have a shadow biosphere,
[01:34:11.540 --> 01:34:13.580]   it has to be integrated with all of these other scales.
[01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:16.180]   - And that would lose the meaning
[01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:17.460]   of the word shadow biosphere, I guess.
[01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:18.540]   - I think so, yeah.
[01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:21.260]   So it's an open question, right?
[01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:23.180]   And I think it would tell us a lot.
[01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:25.540]   So there has been very minimal effort
[01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:28.180]   of people to look for a shadow biosphere.
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:29.180]   - But then the question,
[01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:33.260]   it could be possible that there's like sufficiently
[01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:37.180]   distinct planets within one planet,
[01:34:37.180 --> 01:34:39.820]   meaning like environments within one planet.
[01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:41.300]   Like, I don't know.
[01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:44.220]   I've been looking recently
[01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:47.620]   because of having a chat with Catherine DeCleer
[01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:49.260]   about Io, the moon of Jupiter,
[01:34:49.260 --> 01:34:51.620]   that's like all volcanoes and volcanoes are bad-ass.
[01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:53.180]   But like imagining-
[01:34:53.180 --> 01:34:54.020]   - Io's bad-ass.
[01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:58.780]   - Imagining life inside volcanoes, right?
[01:34:58.780 --> 01:35:03.020]   It seems like sufficiently chemically different
[01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:05.500]   like to be living in the darkness
[01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:06.700]   where there's a lot of heat
[01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:10.380]   and maybe you can have different Earths on a planet.
[01:35:10.380 --> 01:35:12.660]   - Yeah, or like if you go deep enough in the crust,
[01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:14.380]   maybe there's like a layer where there's no life
[01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:15.860]   and then there's suddenly life again.
[01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:19.300]   And maybe those lizard men or whatever
[01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:22.660]   that people dream about are really down there.
[01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:24.420]   I know that's a little flippant,
[01:35:24.420 --> 01:35:26.780]   but really like there could be like chemical cycles
[01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:29.020]   deep in the Earth's crust that might be alive
[01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:31.660]   and are completely distinct in chemical origin
[01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:33.460]   to surface life.
[01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:35.420]   - Right, that they wouldn't be interacting with each other.
[01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:36.660]   - Yeah, and that's one of the proposals
[01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:38.140]   for the shadow biosphere is like,
[01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:40.860]   sometimes people talk about it as being geologically
[01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:43.700]   or geographically distinct that it might be,
[01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:45.220]   you have no life for this region
[01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:46.740]   and then a different example.
[01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:47.940]   And then sometimes people talk about it
[01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:49.300]   being chemically distinct,
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:51.580]   that the chemistry is sufficiently different,
[01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:52.940]   that it's completely orthogonal
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:54.420]   or non-interacting with our chemistry.
[01:35:54.420 --> 01:35:55.980]   - It seems to me at least the chemistry
[01:35:55.980 --> 01:36:00.980]   is a more powerful boundary than geographic.
[01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:06.260]   It just seems like life finds a way literally to travel.
[01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:11.540]   What do you think about all these UFO sightings?
[01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:14.100]   So to me, it's really inspiring.
[01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:18.220]   It's yet another localized way to dream
[01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:21.660]   about the mysterious that is out there.
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:24.660]   - Yeah, so I've actually been more intrigued
[01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:26.580]   by the cultural phenomena UFOs
[01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:28.440]   than the phenomena UFOs themselves,
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:30.860]   because I think it's intriguing about how
[01:36:32.140 --> 01:36:35.500]   we are preparing ourselves mentally
[01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:37.620]   for understanding others
[01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:39.740]   and how we have thought about that historically
[01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:43.440]   and what the sort of modern incarnations of that are.
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:47.520]   It's more like, I want an explanation for us,
[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:48.720]   that's my motivation.
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:52.180]   And having some streaks across the sky or something
[01:36:52.180 --> 01:36:55.780]   and saying that's aliens, it doesn't tell you anything.
[01:36:55.780 --> 01:36:57.620]   So unless you have a deeper explanation
[01:36:57.620 --> 01:36:59.700]   and you have more lines of,
[01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:02.740]   where is this gonna take us in the future?
[01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:04.780]   It's just not as interesting to me
[01:37:04.780 --> 01:37:06.840]   as the problem of understanding life itself
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:08.820]   and aliens as a more general phenomenon.
[01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:11.100]   - I do think it's just, as you said,
[01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:14.020]   a good way to psychologically and sociologically
[01:37:14.020 --> 01:37:15.940]   prepare ourselves to sort of like,
[01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:17.540]   what would that look like?
[01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:18.740]   And very importantly,
[01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:21.540]   which is what a lot of people talk about politically,
[01:37:21.540 --> 01:37:24.580]   sort of there's this idea from the,
[01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:27.720]   so I came from the Soviet Union of like the Cold War
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:30.140]   and we have to hide secrets.
[01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:33.500]   Some way in us searching for life on other planets
[01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:35.220]   or searching for life in general,
[01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:40.900]   the way we've done government in the past,
[01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:43.340]   we tend to think of all new things
[01:37:43.340 --> 01:37:47.140]   as potential military secrets, so we want to hide them.
[01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:49.260]   And one of the ways that people kind of look
[01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:51.940]   at UFO sightings is like,
[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:53.540]   maybe we shouldn't hide this stuff.
[01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:55.100]   Like what is the government hiding?
[01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:56.780]   I think that's a really,
[01:37:57.940 --> 01:38:00.140]   in one sense it's a conspiratorial question,
[01:38:00.140 --> 01:38:02.460]   but I think in another,
[01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:07.380]   it's an inspiration to change the way we do government
[01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:10.020]   to where secrets don't,
[01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:12.480]   maybe there are times when you want to keep secrets
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:13.500]   as military secrets,
[01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:15.980]   but maybe we need to release a lot more stuff
[01:38:15.980 --> 01:38:18.260]   and see us as a human species
[01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:20.220]   as together in this whole search.
[01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:21.740]   - Yeah, the public engagement part there
[01:38:21.740 --> 01:38:23.180]   is really interesting.
[01:38:23.180 --> 01:38:25.700]   - And it's almost like a challenge
[01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:27.740]   to the way we've done stuff in the past
[01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:29.620]   in terms of keeping secrets.
[01:38:29.620 --> 01:38:33.340]   When they're not, so like the first step,
[01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:36.620]   if you don't know how something works,
[01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:38.460]   if there's a mysterious thing,
[01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:42.100]   the first instinct should not be like, let's hide it.
[01:38:42.100 --> 01:38:44.060]   Let's put it in the closet.
[01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:46.060]   So that the Chinese or the Russian government
[01:38:46.060 --> 01:38:48.900]   or whatever government doesn't find it.
[01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:53.140]   Maybe the first instinct should be, let's understand it.
[01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:54.860]   Perhaps let's understand it together.
[01:38:54.860 --> 01:38:56.740]   - No, I think that's good.
[01:38:56.740 --> 01:38:58.820]   And something I realized recently
[01:38:58.820 --> 01:39:00.220]   that I never thought was gonna be a problem,
[01:39:00.220 --> 01:39:02.740]   but I think this actually helps with quite a bit
[01:39:02.740 --> 01:39:05.900]   is because so many people nowadays
[01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:08.300]   believe we've already made contact
[01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:10.980]   that as an astrobiologist,
[01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:14.740]   if we actually wanna understand life and make contact,
[01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:17.460]   we kind of have to deconstruct the narratives
[01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:18.740]   we've already built from ourselves
[01:39:18.740 --> 01:39:20.060]   and kind of unteach ourselves
[01:39:20.060 --> 01:39:22.780]   that we've learned about aliens and then reteach ourselves.
[01:39:22.780 --> 01:39:26.180]   So there's this really interesting sort of dialogue there
[01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:27.900]   and making it open to the public
[01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:29.620]   that they actually have to think critically about it
[01:39:29.620 --> 01:39:30.980]   and they see the evidence for themselves,
[01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:33.820]   I think is really important for that process.
[01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:35.020]   - Yeah, the reteaching,
[01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:38.220]   that aliens might be way weirder than we can imagine.
[01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:39.820]   - Yes, yes.
[01:39:39.820 --> 01:39:41.940]   I'm pretty sure they're probably weirder
[01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:42.940]   than we can imagine.
[01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:49.140]   - Okay, we've in 2020 and still living through a pandemic,
[01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:54.180]   setting the political and all those kinds of things aside,
[01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:59.180]   I've always found viruses fascinating as dynamical systems.
[01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:03.180]   I was gonna say living systems,
[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:07.140]   but I've always kind of thought of them as living,
[01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:09.540]   but that's a whole nother kind of discussion.
[01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:13.260]   Maybe it'd be great to put that on the table.
[01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:17.540]   One, do you find viruses beautiful/terrifying?
[01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:21.540]   And two, do you think they're living things?
[01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:25.780]   Or there's some aspect to them per our discussion of life
[01:40:25.780 --> 01:40:27.740]   that makes them living?
[01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:29.020]   - I mean, living in a pandemic,
[01:40:29.020 --> 01:40:30.900]   saying viruses are beautiful is probably a hard thing,
[01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:34.460]   but I do find them beautiful to a degree.
[01:40:34.460 --> 01:40:39.460]   I think even in the sense of mediating a global pandemic,
[01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:41.380]   there's something like deeply intriguing there
[01:40:41.380 --> 01:40:46.140]   because these are tiny, tiny little things, right?
[01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:50.020]   And yet they can essentially,
[01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:52.540]   like cause a seizure,
[01:40:52.540 --> 01:40:55.780]   like handicap an entire civilization at a global scale.
[01:40:55.780 --> 01:40:58.500]   So just that intersection between
[01:40:58.500 --> 01:41:02.620]   our perceived invincibility and our susceptibility to things
[01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:04.820]   and also the interaction across scales of those things
[01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:09.260]   is just a really amazing feature of our world.
[01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:12.660]   - Most technology, whether it's viruses or AI,
[01:41:12.660 --> 01:41:16.420]   that can scale in an exponential way,
[01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:18.740]   like kind of run,
[01:41:20.300 --> 01:41:23.900]   as opposed to like one thing makes another thing,
[01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:24.780]   makes another thing,
[01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:26.500]   it's one thing makes two things
[01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:28.700]   and those two things make four things.
[01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:30.900]   Like that kind of process
[01:41:30.900 --> 01:41:34.780]   also seems to be fundamental to life.
[01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:35.620]   - Yes.
[01:41:35.620 --> 01:41:39.980]   - And it's terrifying because in a matter of,
[01:41:39.980 --> 01:41:42.020]   in a very short timescale,
[01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:48.740]   if it's good at being life, whatever that is,
[01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:52.500]   it can quickly overtake the other competing forms of life.
[01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:53.540]   - Right.
[01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:57.700]   - And that's scary both for AI and for viruses.
[01:41:57.700 --> 01:42:00.580]   And it seems like understanding these processes
[01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:02.060]   that are underlying viruses.
[01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:05.300]   And I don't mean like on the virology or biology side,
[01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:09.860]   but on some kind of more computational physics perspective,
[01:42:09.860 --> 01:42:11.380]   as we've been talking about,
[01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:12.740]   seems to be really important
[01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:18.620]   to figure out how humans can survive.
[01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:20.540]   - Right.
[01:42:20.540 --> 01:42:22.900]   - Along with these kinds of,
[01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:24.020]   well, this kind of life
[01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:26.900]   and perhaps becoming a multi-planetary species
[01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:28.740]   is a part of that.
[01:42:28.740 --> 01:42:30.020]   Like there's no,
[01:42:30.020 --> 01:42:32.940]   maybe like we'll figure out from a physics perspective
[01:42:32.940 --> 01:42:37.940]   is like, there's no way any living system
[01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:40.820]   can be stable for a prolonged period of time
[01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:43.740]   and survive unless it expands exponentially throughout.
[01:42:43.740 --> 01:42:46.260]   Like we have to multiply.
[01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:49.940]   Otherwise, anything that doesn't multiply exponentially
[01:42:49.940 --> 01:42:50.860]   will die eventually.
[01:42:50.860 --> 01:42:52.460]   Maybe that's a fundamental law.
[01:42:52.460 --> 01:42:56.020]   - Maybe, I don't know.
[01:42:56.020 --> 01:42:58.940]   I always get really bothered by these Darwinian narratives
[01:42:58.940 --> 01:43:01.740]   that are like the fittest replicator wins and things.
[01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:04.740]   And I just don't feel like that's exactly what's going on.
[01:43:04.740 --> 01:43:06.460]   I think like the copying of information
[01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:10.460]   is sort of ancillary to this other process of creativity.
[01:43:10.460 --> 01:43:12.420]   Right, so like the drive is actually,
[01:43:12.420 --> 01:43:13.740]   the drive is creativity,
[01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:16.020]   but if you wanna keep the creativity
[01:43:16.020 --> 01:43:17.500]   that's existed in the past,
[01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:19.660]   it has to be copied into the future.
[01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:21.660]   So replication, like if you,
[01:43:21.660 --> 01:43:23.260]   so that for me is,
[01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:25.300]   so I had this set of arguments
[01:43:25.300 --> 01:43:26.820]   with Michael Lachman and Lee Cronin
[01:43:26.820 --> 01:43:29.540]   about the like life being about persistence.
[01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:30.740]   They thought it was about persistence
[01:43:30.740 --> 01:43:32.340]   and like survival of the fittest kind of thing.
[01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:33.820]   And I'm like, no, it's about existence.
[01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:36.660]   It's like, 'cause when you're talking about that,
[01:43:36.660 --> 01:43:38.620]   it's easy to say that in retrospect,
[01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:40.820]   you can post-select on the things that survived
[01:43:40.820 --> 01:43:42.900]   and then say why they survived,
[01:43:43.060 --> 01:43:46.260]   but you can't do that going forward.
[01:43:46.260 --> 01:43:47.980]   - That's really profound.
[01:43:47.980 --> 01:43:52.180]   That survival is just a nice little side effect feature
[01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:54.980]   of maximizing creativity,
[01:43:54.980 --> 01:43:56.620]   but it doesn't need to be there.
[01:43:56.620 --> 01:43:57.540]   - Yeah.
[01:43:57.540 --> 01:43:59.100]   - That's really beautiful. - I like that, yeah.
[01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:00.060]   - Yeah, that's really-- - Like I said,
[01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:01.820]   I like optimistic theories.
[01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:03.140]   - Well, I don't know if that's optimistic.
[01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:05.220]   That could be terrifying to people because,
[01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:09.380]   because a system that maximizes creativity
[01:44:09.380 --> 01:44:12.420]   may very quickly get rid of humans
[01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:15.940]   for some reason if it comes up with some other creative,
[01:44:15.940 --> 01:44:18.980]   I mean, forms of existence.
[01:44:18.980 --> 01:44:19.860]   - Yeah.
[01:44:19.860 --> 01:44:21.300]   - Right, this is the AI thing.
[01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:24.260]   It's like the moment you have an AI system
[01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:29.000]   that can flourish in the space of ideas
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:33.380]   or in some other space much more effectively than humans,
[01:44:33.380 --> 01:44:36.620]   and it's sufficiently integrated into the physical space
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:39.180]   to be able to modify the environment.
[01:44:39.180 --> 01:44:40.300]   - I think we'll just be like
[01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:42.100]   the core genetic architecture or something.
[01:44:42.100 --> 01:44:44.460]   We'll be like the DNA for AI, right?
[01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:45.500]   - Yeah. - It's like we haven't lost
[01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:47.740]   the past informational architectures on this planet.
[01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:48.800]   They're still there.
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:53.860]   - Yeah, so the AI will use our brains in some part
[01:44:53.860 --> 01:44:58.020]   to like ride, like it'll accelerate the exchange of ideas.
[01:44:58.020 --> 01:45:00.980]   That's the neural language dream is that,
[01:45:00.980 --> 01:45:03.500]   well, the humans will be still around
[01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:05.340]   'cause you're saying architecture will still--
[01:45:05.340 --> 01:45:07.060]   - Yeah, but I don't even think they necessarily
[01:45:07.060 --> 01:45:08.340]   need to tap in our brains.
[01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:10.420]   I mean, just collectively, we do interesting things.
[01:45:10.420 --> 01:45:12.220]   What if they were just using like the patterns
[01:45:12.220 --> 01:45:14.740]   in our communication or something?
[01:45:14.740 --> 01:45:18.100]   - Oh, without controlling it, just observing?
[01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:19.020]   - Well, I don't know.
[01:45:19.020 --> 01:45:20.740]   In what sense do you control the chemistry
[01:45:20.740 --> 01:45:21.900]   happening in your body?
[01:45:21.900 --> 01:45:25.220]   - Hmm, yeah.
[01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:27.500]   - I mean, obviously I don't know.
[01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:32.240]   People look at AI and then they look at this thing
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:34.660]   that's bigger than us and is coming in the future
[01:45:34.660 --> 01:45:37.020]   and is smarter than us, and I think though
[01:45:37.020 --> 01:45:39.780]   that looking at the past history of life on the planet
[01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:41.140]   and what information has been doing
[01:45:41.140 --> 01:45:42.300]   for the last four billion years
[01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:44.940]   is probably very informative to asking questions
[01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:46.240]   about what's coming next.
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:53.460]   One is planetary scale transitions are really important
[01:45:53.460 --> 01:45:55.620]   for new phases, so the global internet
[01:45:55.620 --> 01:45:57.340]   and sort of global integration of our technology
[01:45:57.340 --> 01:45:58.540]   I think is an important thing.
[01:45:58.540 --> 01:46:01.120]   So that's again, life as a planetary scale phenomena,
[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:03.380]   but we're an integrated component of that phenomena.
[01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:04.980]   I don't really see that the technology
[01:46:04.980 --> 01:46:07.100]   is gonna replace us in that way.
[01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:09.820]   It's just gonna keep scaffolding and building.
[01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:11.300]   And I also don't have an idea
[01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:12.680]   that we're gonna build AI in a box.
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:14.460]   I think AI is gonna emerge.
[01:46:14.460 --> 01:46:17.100]   AGI to me is a planetary scale phenomena
[01:46:17.100 --> 01:46:19.860]   that's gonna emerge from our technology.
[01:46:19.860 --> 01:46:22.220]   - Planetary scale phenomena.
[01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:26.100]   But do you think, and AGI is not distinct from humans.
[01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:28.300]   The whole package-- - The whole package, yeah.
[01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:30.060]   - Comes as a planetary scale phenomena.
[01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:31.620]   - And that goes back to the fact that
[01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:34.860]   you were asking questions about you as an individual.
[01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:36.100]   Like what are you as an individual?
[01:46:36.100 --> 01:46:38.020]   You're like a packet of information
[01:46:38.020 --> 01:46:41.320]   that exists in the particular physical thing that is you.
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:43.660]   We're all just packets of information
[01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:45.620]   and some of us are aggregates in certain ways,
[01:46:45.620 --> 01:46:47.060]   but it's all just kind of exchanging
[01:46:47.060 --> 01:46:49.620]   and propagating, right, and processing.
[01:46:49.620 --> 01:46:52.620]   - Is your packet of information
[01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:56.020]   that you've continually referred to as Sarah
[01:46:56.020 --> 01:47:01.020]   afraid of the dissipation of the death of that packet?
[01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:02.980]   Are you afraid of death?
[01:47:02.980 --> 01:47:04.660]   Do you ponder death?
[01:47:04.660 --> 01:47:09.260]   Does death have meaning in this process of creativity?
[01:47:09.260 --> 01:47:12.300]   - I think I have the natural biological urge
[01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:13.900]   that everyone has to fear death.
[01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:17.820]   I think the thing that I think is interesting
[01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:20.220]   is if I think about it rationally,
[01:47:20.220 --> 01:47:22.060]   I'm not necessarily afraid of death for me
[01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:25.260]   because I won't be aware of being dead.
[01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:26.740]   But I am afraid for my kids
[01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:28.800]   because it matters to them if I die.
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:33.740]   So again, I think death becomes more significant
[01:47:33.740 --> 01:47:37.300]   as a collective property, not as an individual one.
[01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:39.300]   - Yeah, but isn't there something to fear
[01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:41.700]   about the fact that the way,
[01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:45.580]   like the creative,
[01:47:45.580 --> 01:47:48.580]   the complexity of information
[01:47:48.580 --> 01:47:50.980]   that's been created in you,
[01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:57.100]   the fact that it kind of breaks apart and disappears.
[01:47:57.100 --> 01:47:59.600]   - It doesn't, but I don't think it disappears.
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:01.040]   It's just not me anymore.
[01:48:02.260 --> 01:48:07.100]   - Right, but that process of it being not you anymore,
[01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:09.020]   that doesn't scare you?
[01:48:09.020 --> 01:48:09.940]   - Of course it does.
[01:48:09.940 --> 01:48:10.780]   - The mystery of it.
[01:48:10.780 --> 01:48:11.860]   I mean the-- - Yeah.
[01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:13.380]   But I guess I'm heartened by the fact
[01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:15.060]   that there will be some imprints of the fact
[01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:17.980]   that I existed still in the universe after I leave it.
[01:48:17.980 --> 01:48:20.220]   - Yeah, but there'll be a, okay.
[01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:22.740]   - And also that has to do with my perception of time, right?
[01:48:22.740 --> 01:48:24.780]   So I perceive time as flowing,
[01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:26.340]   but that might not be the case.
[01:48:26.340 --> 01:48:30.380]   I mean, this is standard physicist comfort
[01:48:30.380 --> 01:48:32.620]   is every moment exists,
[01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:37.620]   and the flow of time is just our perception of us changing.
[01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:43.980]   - So you can travel back in time and that's comforting?
[01:48:43.980 --> 01:48:45.460]   Like from a physicist's--
[01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:47.420]   - No, no, no, I'm not talking about traveling back in time.
[01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:50.980]   I'm just saying that the moments in the past still exist.
[01:48:50.980 --> 01:48:53.180]   Now whether the moments in the future exist or not
[01:48:53.180 --> 01:48:54.380]   is a different question.
[01:48:54.380 --> 01:48:56.780]   - That's not comforting to me in terms of death.
[01:48:56.780 --> 01:48:59.580]   The flow of time is not, that does not--
[01:48:59.580 --> 01:49:04.140]   - I think there's no comfort in the face of death
[01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:07.900]   for what we are because we like existing.
[01:49:07.900 --> 01:49:11.620]   And I think it's especially true if you love life
[01:49:11.620 --> 01:49:13.740]   and you love what life is.
[01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:16.220]   - Do you think there's a certain sense in which
[01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:19.180]   the fear of death or the fear of non-existence,
[01:49:19.180 --> 01:49:21.420]   maybe fear is not the right word,
[01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:26.420]   is the actual very phenomena that gives birth to existence?
[01:49:26.420 --> 01:49:28.780]   Like death is fundamental.
[01:49:28.780 --> 01:49:31.340]   Like it just feels like freaking out,
[01:49:31.340 --> 01:49:35.900]   oh shit, this ride ends, is actually like,
[01:49:35.900 --> 01:49:41.300]   that's the thing that gives birth to this whole thing.
[01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:47.940]   It's constantly, it's matter constantly freaking out
[01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:49.380]   about the fact that it's gonna be--
[01:49:49.380 --> 01:49:51.660]   - No, I think things like to exist.
[01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:52.500]   I think they wanna exist.
[01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:55.820]   - Yeah, there's a desire or whatever to exist.
[01:49:55.820 --> 01:49:58.020]   - Yeah, there's a drive to exist
[01:49:58.020 --> 01:50:00.100]   and there's a drive for more things to exist.
[01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:03.060]   I guess, yeah, I like existing.
[01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:04.980]   I like it a lot.
[01:50:04.980 --> 01:50:08.000]   And I don't know it any other way.
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:12.020]   - See, I don't even know if I like existing.
[01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:14.580]   I think I really don't like not existing.
[01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:15.860]   - Yes, yeah, that too.
[01:50:15.860 --> 01:50:17.540]   (laughing)
[01:50:17.540 --> 01:50:19.820]   Yeah, maybe it's that.
[01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:23.420]   Some days I might like existing less than others.
[01:50:23.420 --> 01:50:24.660]   (laughing)
[01:50:24.660 --> 01:50:27.620]   - Yes, but I think those are like surface feelings.
[01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:29.900]   There is some, seems like there's something fundamental
[01:50:29.900 --> 01:50:31.260]   about wanting to exist.
[01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:34.580]   - No, I think that's right, but I think to your point
[01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:38.260]   that that might go back to the more fundamental idea
[01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:40.660]   that if life is the physics of existence
[01:50:40.660 --> 01:50:43.080]   and maximizing existence, individual organisms,
[01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:45.540]   of course, wanna maximize their existence
[01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:48.040]   and everything wants to exist.
[01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:50.620]   But I guess for me, the small comfort is
[01:50:50.620 --> 01:50:52.820]   my existence matters to future existence.
[01:50:52.820 --> 01:50:56.060]   - Speaking of future existence,
[01:50:56.060 --> 01:51:00.900]   is there advice you can give to future pockets of existences
[01:51:00.900 --> 01:51:04.180]   aka young people about life?
[01:51:04.180 --> 01:51:07.260]   You've had, you've worn many hats,
[01:51:07.260 --> 01:51:10.420]   you've taken on some of the biggest problems in the universe.
[01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:13.900]   Is there advice you can give to young people about life,
[01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:17.300]   about career, about existing?
[01:51:17.300 --> 01:51:20.380]   - Maybe not about the last one.
[01:51:20.380 --> 01:51:23.420]   A lot of people ask me this question
[01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:25.900]   about like working on such hard problems,
[01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:28.180]   like how can you make a successful career out of that?
[01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:31.300]   But I think for me, it couldn't be otherwise.
[01:51:31.300 --> 01:51:33.340]   Like I have to, to be fulfilled,
[01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:35.260]   you have to work on things you care about
[01:51:35.260 --> 01:51:36.860]   and that's always kind of driven me.
[01:51:36.860 --> 01:51:39.740]   And that's been discipline, department
[01:51:39.740 --> 01:51:44.940]   and sort of superficial level problem independent
[01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:48.420]   because I started at community college actually
[01:51:48.420 --> 01:51:49.740]   and I was taking a physics class
[01:51:49.740 --> 01:51:53.100]   and I learned about magnetic monopoles
[01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:55.500]   and we didn't know if they existed in the universe
[01:51:55.500 --> 01:51:57.940]   but we could predict them and we could go look for them.
[01:51:57.940 --> 01:51:59.540]   And I was so deeply intrigued by this idea
[01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:01.180]   that we had this mathematical formula
[01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:02.500]   to go look for things.
[01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:05.140]   And then I wanted to become a theoretical physicist
[01:52:05.140 --> 01:52:05.980]   because of that,
[01:52:05.980 --> 01:52:07.700]   but that actually wasn't my driving question.
[01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:10.660]   I realized my driving question is the nature
[01:52:10.660 --> 01:52:12.180]   of the correspondence between our minds
[01:52:12.180 --> 01:52:14.420]   and physical reality and what we are.
[01:52:14.420 --> 01:52:16.500]   And that question is very deep
[01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:18.620]   so you can work across a lot of fields doing that.
[01:52:18.620 --> 01:52:20.100]   But I think without that driving question,
[01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:22.340]   I never would have been able to do all the things
[01:52:22.340 --> 01:52:23.180]   that I've done.
[01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:25.100]   It's really the passion that drives it.
[01:52:25.100 --> 01:52:28.500]   And usually when students ask me these kinds of questions,
[01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:30.700]   I tell them like,
[01:52:30.700 --> 01:52:33.300]   you have to find something you really care about working on
[01:52:33.300 --> 01:52:35.500]   because if you don't really care about it,
[01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:37.900]   A, you're not gonna be your best at it
[01:52:37.900 --> 01:52:39.860]   and B, it's not gonna be worth your time.
[01:52:39.860 --> 01:52:41.580]   Why would you spend your time working on something
[01:52:41.580 --> 01:52:43.060]   you're not interested in?
[01:52:43.060 --> 01:52:44.820]   - So find the driving questions.
[01:52:44.820 --> 01:52:47.500]   - Yeah, find the driving question, find your passion.
[01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:49.460]   I mean, I think passion makes a huge difference
[01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:52.740]   in terms of creativity, talent and potential
[01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:55.060]   and also being able to tolerate all the hard things
[01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:57.900]   that come with any career or life.
[01:52:57.900 --> 01:52:59.860]   - Yeah, I've had a bunch of moments in my life
[01:52:59.860 --> 01:53:03.220]   where I've just been captivated by some beautiful phenomena
[01:53:03.220 --> 01:53:06.100]   and I guess being rigorous about it
[01:53:06.100 --> 01:53:09.580]   and asking what is the question underlying this phenomenon
[01:53:09.580 --> 01:53:13.420]   like robots bring a smile to my face
[01:53:13.420 --> 01:53:17.060]   and forming a question of like,
[01:53:17.060 --> 01:53:19.980]   why the hell is this so fascinating?
[01:53:19.980 --> 01:53:21.620]   Why is this specifically
[01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:24.820]   the human robot interaction question
[01:53:24.820 --> 01:53:28.220]   that something beautiful is brought to life
[01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:30.740]   when humans and robots interact,
[01:53:30.740 --> 01:53:32.620]   understanding that deeply.
[01:53:32.620 --> 01:53:36.660]   I was like, okay, so this is gonna be my life work then.
[01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:37.780]   I don't know what the hell it is,
[01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:39.220]   but that's what I wanna do.
[01:53:39.220 --> 01:53:43.020]   And doing that for whatever the hell gives you
[01:53:43.020 --> 01:53:45.500]   that kind of feeling, I guess is the point.
[01:53:46.540 --> 01:53:47.940]   Am I allowed to ask you a question?
[01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:48.780]   - Sure.
[01:53:48.780 --> 01:53:50.940]   - Okay, on that point,
[01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:53.940]   'cause I had this colleague that suggests the idea
[01:53:53.940 --> 01:53:56.180]   that consciousness might be contagious
[01:53:56.180 --> 01:53:57.900]   and so interacting with things.
[01:53:57.900 --> 01:53:59.020]   - That's funny.
[01:53:59.020 --> 01:53:59.860]   No, yeah, yeah, it's a beautiful way of putting it.
[01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:01.060]   - It's an interesting idea, right?
[01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:04.500]   So I'm wondering the motivation there.
[01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:08.660]   Is it the motivation that you want more of the universe
[01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:11.340]   to appreciate things the way we do
[01:54:11.340 --> 01:54:12.820]   and appreciate those interactions
[01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:15.820]   or is it really more the enjoyment of the human
[01:54:15.820 --> 01:54:16.820]   in those interactions?
[01:54:16.820 --> 01:54:20.380]   Is it, do you know what I'm asking?
[01:54:20.380 --> 01:54:21.220]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:54:21.220 --> 01:54:23.860]   See, I think consciousness is created
[01:54:23.860 --> 01:54:27.580]   in the interaction between things.
[01:54:27.580 --> 01:54:28.420]   - Yes, I agree.
[01:54:28.420 --> 01:54:31.140]   - So the joy is in the creation of consciousness.
[01:54:31.140 --> 01:54:31.980]   - I see.
[01:54:31.980 --> 01:54:36.980]   - I really like the idea that it doesn't just have to be
[01:54:36.980 --> 01:54:40.140]   two humans creating consciousness together.
[01:54:40.140 --> 01:54:43.420]   It could be humans and other entities.
[01:54:43.420 --> 01:54:46.540]   We talked offline about dogs and other pets and so on.
[01:54:46.540 --> 01:54:49.700]   There's a magic, I mean, I've been calling it love.
[01:54:49.700 --> 01:54:54.340]   There's beauty of the human experience that's created
[01:54:54.340 --> 01:54:58.260]   and it just feels like fascinating that you could do that
[01:54:58.260 --> 01:55:00.460]   with a robotic system.
[01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:06.940]   There's something really powerful at least to me
[01:55:06.940 --> 01:55:10.900]   about engineering systems that allow you to create
[01:55:10.900 --> 01:55:12.620]   some of the magic of the human experience
[01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:15.460]   'cause then you get to understand what it takes,
[01:55:15.460 --> 01:55:17.940]   at least get inklings of what it takes
[01:55:17.940 --> 01:55:21.380]   to create consciousness.
[01:55:21.380 --> 01:55:24.300]   And I don't get this, you know,
[01:55:24.300 --> 01:55:26.260]   philosophers get really upset about this idea
[01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:29.660]   that sort of the illusion of consciousness is consciousness.
[01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:33.700]   But I really like the idea of engineering systems
[01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:37.260]   that fool you into thinking they're conscious.
[01:55:37.260 --> 01:55:38.100]   - Right.
[01:55:38.100 --> 01:55:40.060]   - Because that's sufficient to create
[01:55:40.060 --> 01:55:41.900]   the magical experience.
[01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:43.540]   - Right, because it's the interaction, yeah.
[01:55:43.540 --> 01:55:45.100]   - It's the interaction, yeah.
[01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:47.620]   And this is the Russian hat I wear,
[01:55:47.620 --> 01:55:50.260]   which is like, I think there's an ocean
[01:55:50.260 --> 01:55:51.940]   of loneliness in the world.
[01:55:51.940 --> 01:55:53.460]   I think we're deeply lonely.
[01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:57.220]   We're not even allowing ourselves to acknowledge that.
[01:55:57.220 --> 01:55:59.220]   And I kind of think that's what love is
[01:55:59.220 --> 01:56:01.940]   between romantic love and friendship
[01:56:01.940 --> 01:56:05.220]   is two people kind of getting a little bit
[01:56:05.220 --> 01:56:11.420]   alleviating for a brief moment.
[01:56:11.420 --> 01:56:12.260]   - That loneliness.
[01:56:12.260 --> 01:56:15.300]   - That loneliness, but we're not,
[01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:17.940]   it's not the full aspect of that loneliness.
[01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:19.380]   Like we're desperately alone,
[01:56:19.380 --> 01:56:22.580]   we're desperately afraid of non-existing.
[01:56:22.580 --> 01:56:23.420]   - Right.
[01:56:23.420 --> 01:56:24.560]   - I have that kind of sense,
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:28.180]   and I just wanna explore that ocean of loneliness more.
[01:56:28.180 --> 01:56:29.020]   - Right.
[01:56:29.020 --> 01:56:30.860]   - In engineering, like create a submarine
[01:56:30.860 --> 01:56:33.740]   that goes into the depth of that loneliness.
[01:56:33.740 --> 01:56:36.580]   So creating systems that can truly hear you.
[01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:37.420]   - Right.
[01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:38.240]   - And truly listen.
[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:39.780]   - Make the universe a less lonely place.
[01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:40.980]   - Exactly.
[01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:43.180]   Let me ask you about the meaning.
[01:56:43.180 --> 01:56:44.820]   You've brought up why.
[01:56:44.820 --> 01:56:45.660]   - Yeah.
[01:56:45.660 --> 01:56:46.480]   - The physics of why.
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:51.100]   What do you think is the meaning of our particular planets,
[01:56:51.100 --> 01:56:54.600]   set of existences, and the universe in general?
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:57.020]   The meaning of life.
[01:56:57.020 --> 01:56:59.020]   - Yes, someone once told me as a physicist,
[01:56:59.020 --> 01:57:00.780]   I'm not allowed to ask why questions,
[01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:02.100]   but I don't believe that.
[01:57:02.100 --> 01:57:09.100]   I think what we are is the creative process
[01:57:09.940 --> 01:57:11.460]   in the universe, I think.
[01:57:11.460 --> 01:57:13.200]   And for me, that's the meaning.
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:15.140]   The ability to-- - Create.
[01:57:15.140 --> 01:57:18.180]   - Yeah, to create more possibilities
[01:57:18.180 --> 01:57:19.540]   and more things to exist.
[01:57:19.540 --> 01:57:23.820]   - What is, Odessiyevsky has the saying,
[01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:25.980]   "Beauty will save the world."
[01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:32.320]   Is there a connection between creation and beauty?
[01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:34.220]   - I think so.
[01:57:34.220 --> 01:57:39.080]   - So is that like, is beauty a correlate of creation?
[01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:41.260]   - It might be, I don't know.
[01:57:41.260 --> 01:57:43.420]   I mean, why is it, you know,
[01:57:43.420 --> 01:57:44.860]   a lot of people have asked these kind of questions,
[01:57:44.860 --> 01:57:47.300]   but like, why is it we have such an emotional response
[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:49.460]   to intellectual activity or creativity?
[01:57:49.460 --> 01:57:52.540]   And that seems kind of a deep question to me.
[01:57:52.540 --> 01:57:55.660]   Like, it seems very intrinsic to what we are.
[01:57:55.660 --> 01:57:59.940]   So I do have an interest in the questions I ask
[01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:01.380]   because I think they're beautiful,
[01:58:01.380 --> 01:58:02.980]   and I think the universe is beautiful,
[01:58:02.980 --> 01:58:06.480]   and I'm just so deeply fascinated
[01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:08.420]   by the fact that I exist at all.
[01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:13.560]   And so maybe it's that, you know,
[01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:17.280]   that intrinsic feeling of beauty that's in part driving,
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:19.120]   you know, the physics of creating more things,
[01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:22.160]   so they could be deeply related in that way.
[01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:24.760]   - Well, I don't think there's a better way to end it.
[01:58:24.760 --> 01:58:27.200]   I think this conversation was beautiful.
[01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:29.840]   Thank you so much for wasting
[01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:32.000]   all your valuable time with me today.
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:33.600]   I really, really appreciate it, Sarah.
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:34.440]   This is an honor.
[01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:36.080]   I hope we get the chance to talk again.
[01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:38.200]   I hope, like I mentioned to you offline,
[01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:39.640]   we get a chance to talk with Lee.
[01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:44.640]   You guys have a beautiful, like, intellectual chemistry
[01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:46.080]   that's fascinating to listen to,
[01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:47.440]   so I'm a huge fan of both of you,
[01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:49.760]   and I can't wait to see what you do next.
[01:58:49.760 --> 01:58:50.600]   - Thanks so much.
[01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:51.600]   Great to be here.
[01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:52.440]   Bye. - Bye.
[01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:54.720]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:55.760]   with Sarah Walker.
[01:58:55.760 --> 01:58:59.040]   A thank you to Athletic Greens, NetSuite,
[01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:01.440]   Blinkist, and Magic Spoon.
[01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:04.680]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[01:59:04.680 --> 01:59:07.800]   And now let me leave you with some words from Robert Frost,
[01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:09.800]   one of my favorite poets.
[01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:10.640]   In three words,
[01:59:10.640 --> 01:59:13.880]   I can sum up everything I've learned about life.
[01:59:13.880 --> 01:59:15.080]   It goes on.
[01:59:15.080 --> 01:59:17.120]   Thank you for listening.
[01:59:17.120 --> 01:59:18.920]   I hope to see you next time.
[01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:21.500]   (upbeat music)
[01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:24.080]   (upbeat music)
