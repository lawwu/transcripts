[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.840]   Scripture uses 22 different names for Satan.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.040]   His diabolical intentions are recorded for us all over our Bibles.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.440]   And we're even assured that he is still present and active in this world,
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.320]   and in each of our lives. But when, and how, and where?
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.720]   Those are great questions from a listener named Josh. Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.080]   To what extent, and by what means specifically, does Satan influence the world?
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.040]   Where do you see his works most clearly today?
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.000]   The word Satan is a transliteration of the Hebrew "Satan,"
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.800]   and basically means "opponent" or "adversary." The Greek translation
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.400]   of that Hebrew Old Testament always translates "Satan" with "diabolos"
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.080]   in Greek, which means "devil." We always translate "diabolos" in English
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:09.120]   in the New Testament "devil." And "diabolos" puts a more specific focus on the meaning
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:16.000]   of the "opponent" or "adversary," because "diabolos" basically means "slander" or "accuse."
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.760]   It's used not to refer to the devil. Several times in the pastoral epistles of Paul,
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:29.040]   to just refer to people who are slandering others, speaking evil of them, being false about them.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.720]   So even though this supernatural being, this fallen angel, an arch-enemy of God,
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.800]   has a remarkable power in the material or physical realm—like, he can make people sick,
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.240]   he can throw them in prison, he can even kill them—nevertheless,
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:53.920]   his main way of opposing God and destroying God's people is not in the physical or material realm,
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.320]   but in the mental or intellectual or moral realm. In other words, the best way to think about his
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.080]   power is not in terms of physical strength, but moral deception.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:14.080]   So let me try to illustrate this from the Bible. Here's the passage that piles up
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:21.600]   more designations of Satan than any other passage in the Bible. You need one or two verses to put
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:30.080]   the identity and work of Satan before you. It would be Revelation 12, 9 and 10. Here it says,
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:39.520]   "And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent"—and remember what the Bible
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.760]   said in Genesis 3 about him, he's subtler, he's subtler than every beast, so it's his subtlety
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.480]   that's being focused on in his serpent-like reality—"who is called the devil, diabolo,
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:03.360]   slanderer, liar, cheat, and Satan, adversary, the deceiver of the whole world." I don't think you
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:12.240]   can say anything more sweeping or more basic than the end of Revelation 12, 9, "He is the deceiver
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:22.480]   of the whole world." Verse 10, "The accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:31.440]   day and night before God." So at the center of Satan's purpose is to deceive on earth and to
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:39.360]   accuse in heaven. If he can deceive you about God and Christ, you will perish. If he can successfully
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:47.040]   accuse you of unforgiven sin in heaven, you will perish. And Jesus calls him a murderer
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.360]   from the beginning, John 8, 44. So the deception and the accusation and the eternal death that
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:03.520]   results from unforgiven sin is a way of destroying people and opposing God. So Josh asks me,
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:10.800]   "To what extent and by what means specifically does Satan influence the world?" My answer,
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:20.240]   therefore, is the extent is worldwide, and the means is deception. We can see this in another
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:28.880]   text. Here's Revelation 28-10. He comes out to deceive the nations, but he will be defeated.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:37.760]   "And the devil who had deceived them." So there's the focus again on his major strategy of destroying
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.800]   the world. Deceive them, and he will be thrown into the lake of fire. So my basic answer to
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.920]   Josh's question is that the extent of Satan's influence is global, covers all nations,
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:05:01.360]   and the primary means of his influence is deception. He destroys, not mainly by the sword
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:10.000]   or disease or killing, but mainly by lying. Jesus calls him the father of lies, John 8, 44.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:18.000]   Specifically, he lies mainly about God, about Jesus, about the gospel, about sin, and oh,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   how wonderful it is that he has been dealt a decisive blow. You can see his deception about
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.840]   the gospel in 2 Corinthians 4, 4. In the case of the God of this world, he has blinded the
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.880]   minds of unbelievers to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ,
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:49.680]   who is the image of God. So Josh's second question is, where do you see his works most clearly?
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:06:01.280]   And my answer is, therefore, wherever saving truth is hated and resisted and distorted and muted,
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:10.960]   so that people are kept from being saved by the truth of the gospel, that's where I see his works
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:21.360]   most clearly. 2 Thessalonians 2, 9, Satan comes with wicked deception for those who are perishing
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:31.040]   because they refuse to love the truth and so be saved. Satan hates the truth of the gospel.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:39.680]   And the truth of the cross more than any other truth. You remember when Jesus was on earth,
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:45.760]   Satan tried to keep him away from the cross? Matthew 16, 23, when Peter says, "No, no,
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:52.240]   this isn't going to happen to you." Jesus says, "Get behind me, Satan. That's what Satan wants.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.040]   He doesn't want me to die for the sins of the world." Even though at the end,
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:04.640]   Satan gave up on that strategy and filled Judas to get Jesus betrayed, nevertheless, at the end,
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:10.320]   he's trying to make it as horrible as possible. But his first design was, "I'm not going to let
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:18.160]   him get to the cross, no way." And now, Satan is mainly bent on preventing the message of the cross
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:24.960]   from being spread, from being understood, from being believed. And he does everything in his
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:33.280]   power to distort and silence the saving message of the cross. Remember how Jesus said he snatches
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.800]   the word. He snatches it. Just as soon as you preach the cross, as soon as you preach the
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:44.560]   saving word of the kingdom, boy, Satan will, if he can, snatch the word right out of the mind,
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:51.920]   just like birds snatching seed off of a path. Now, why is he so opposed to this central truth?
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:08:00.000]   Because the gospel is the truth that Christ has paid the price for sins of everyone who believes,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.680]   and that means Satan cannot successfully accuse us in heaven. He cannot make a case against the
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:13.840]   elect because our sins have been covered, and that's the only means he has to destroy us,
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:20.080]   which means, of course, he can oppress us, he can distress us, he can tempt us, he can make us sick,
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:29.200]   he can kill us, and he cannot damn us ever. They are eternally safe. We, the elect, are eternally
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:36.080]   safe in God's sovereign grace. And so he rages against the people of God, and he rages against
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:46.560]   the gospel that snatches people out of the damning hands of his own greedy self. You can see this in
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:53.920]   Colossians 2.13. God has forgiven us all our trespasses by canceling the record of debt that
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:09:00.880]   stood against us with his legal demands. He has set aside those sins, nailing them to the cross,
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:08.960]   and here's what follows. "Thus he disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to an open
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:14.800]   shame by triumphing over them in him." When our sins are forgiven, nailed to the cross,
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:22.640]   the satanic rulers and authorities are decisively defeated. They are undone, meaning their one
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:31.600]   condemning, damning weapon has been taken out of their hands, namely, unforgiven sin. If our sins
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:36.960]   are not forgiven, Satan can rightly accuse us before God, and we will be sentenced to hell.
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:46.240]   But if our sins are forgiven, Satan cannot successfully accuse us before God. And so Paul
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:53.040]   soars in exultation over the great gospel of deliverance in Romans 8. If God is for us,
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:10:01.440]   who can be against us? Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? That is in Satan's face.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.840]   Who shall bring any charge? It is God who justifies, Mr. Satan. Who is to condemn? It is
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:16.720]   Christ Jesus who died, Mr. Satan. You couldn't stop it more than that who was raised from the
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:23.760]   dead, who is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us, Mr. Accuser. So I am sure that
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:30.320]   neither death nor life nor angels nor rulers—yeah, nor rulers nor Satan nor anything else in all
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:41.040]   creation—can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus. So our weapon against Satan in this
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:50.080]   world is truth, especially the truth of the gospel of the cross of Christ. And our great mission
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:59.440]   is the deliverance of the world. Tell them the truth. Spread the truth. Defend the truth. Live
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:05.040]   the truth, for you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free, free from sin,
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:12.720]   free from Satan. The words of Jesus to the apostle Paul before he sent him out was, "I am
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:22.400]   sending you to open their eyes to the truth of Christ so that they may turn from the power of
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:31.600]   Satan to God," Acts 26, 18. That's our great liberating mission in the world, to open the eyes
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:38.160]   of the blind by the power of the Holy Spirit, by the great instrument of truth, because Paul said
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:48.640]   God will grant them repentance, leading to a knowledge of the truth, and they will become free
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.560]   and escape from the snare of the devil, having been captured by him to do his will.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:01.600]   May God make us valiant spokesmen and spreaders of liberating truth.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:08.560]   05 Amen. Thank you, Pastor John. Nothing less is called for in the face of this diabolical deception
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.680]   than what you just called for, Pastor John. Thank you. Thank you for listening to the Ask
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:17.120]   Pastor John podcast, and thank you to all of you who support our labors through your regular prayers
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:23.040]   on our behalf and through the generous financial giving that makes DesiringGod.org possible.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:30.160]   We are, in fact, engaged in spiritual war in this work of proclaiming the supremacy of Christ
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:36.640]   over every power and principality. So thank you for your partnership. Thank you for joining us.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:43.120]   Well, self-consciousness is a very troubling thing. It can be a paralyzing thing for some people.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:49.840]   So how do we break free from a preoccupation with our own self-consciousness? It's a really
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:54.400]   important discussion, and it's the topic on the table Wednesday when we return.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.400]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll see you then.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:57.120]   [END]
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:58.160]   you
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:08.160]   [END]
