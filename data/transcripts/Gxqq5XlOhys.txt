[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.540]   9. And if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine
[00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:29.540]   heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:37.080]   For with the heart men believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.080]   salvation.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:46.560]   Now, I've described these two verses as the apostles' summary of saving faith. And we
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.980]   are examining, therefore, what is meant by saving faith. And I've suggested a threefold
[00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.480]   division. First, of course, you must consider the content of saving faith. Then you consider
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:06.940]   its character, or its nature. And finally, the proof of saving faith. Those three things
[00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.220]   are suggested here by this statement which the apostle makes.
[00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.880]   Now, we've already been dealing with the content of saving faith. That is, that we believe
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:26.120]   that Jesus is Lord, and that we believe that God hath raised him from the dead. We've considered
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.680]   those two statements and their full implications. So that now we are in a position to move forward
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:41.700]   to the second division of this statement of saving faith. And that is the nature, or the
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.740]   character, of saving faith.
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:53.340]   Now, you notice that the apostle deals with this in both the verses, 9 and 10. "If thou
[00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:01.960]   shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.180]   hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart men believeth
[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.780]   unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.520]   And there can be no doubt, therefore, that the very fact that the apostle repeats in
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:26.140]   verse 10 what is said in verse 9 means that he attaches very great significance to this.
[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:33.300]   The object of the repetition is to bring out emphasis. That is always the purpose of repetition
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.660]   in the Scriptures. It is to underline something. Evidently, therefore, there are certain dangers
[00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.960]   with respect to this whole matter of saving faith. And it is in order to safeguard us
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:51.700]   from those dangers that the apostle puts it in this way, and puts the emphasis upon it
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:03:00.940]   by repeating it, stating it twice over in this way and manner.
[00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.200]   In other words, he puts his emphasis upon the heart and upon the confession. Now, in
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.380]   introducing this statement, I think I called attention to the way in which he reverses
[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:19.980]   the order. In verse 9, he puts confession with the mouth before believing in the heart.
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.820]   But in verse 10 he reverses that and says, "With the heart men believeth unto righteousness,
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.860]   and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation." And the reason, of course, for
[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:37.220]   the change in order is simply this, that in the ninth verse, which follows on from what
[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:44.460]   he has been saying before, he is concerned with the statement of the faith. He has been
[00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:51.740]   talking about the word of faith which we preach. He is concerned now to show how you can tell
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.380]   whether a man is a Christian or not, and you do that by what he says. And therefore, he
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:04.500]   puts the confession with the mouth first. But then when he comes to tell us, or give
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.700]   us a description, or an account of the way in which one does make this confession, he
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:18.220]   obviously has to reverse the order. You meet a man and you are concerned to know whether
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.980]   he is a Christian or not. Well, you will discover that by what he says. But then you know perfectly
[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.700]   well that what he says is the result of something else that had gone before, the believing.
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.180]   So the believing in the heart comes first, and that then is given expression by what
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.860]   comes out of the mouth.
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:47.820]   If you want a perfect exposition of this order, you get it in our Lord's statement about
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:55.180]   the seat of sin in men. You remember, you got it in the fifteenth chapter of the Gospel
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:02.380]   according to St. Matthew, where our Lord was dealing with the Pharisees, and the Pharisees
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:08.180]   are always concerned about externals. And our Lord tells them that what really matters
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.660]   is what is inside. In verse seventeen he says, "Do ye not yet understand that whatsoever
[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.940]   entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? But those
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:23.620]   things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart, and they defile the
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:30.220]   men. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts,
[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.180]   false witness, blasphemies, etc. These are the things which defile a man; but to eat
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.380]   with unwashen hands defileth not a man. It is out of the heart," he says, "elsewhere.
[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.780]   Out of the fullness of the heart the mouth speaketh."
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:52.900]   Now this needn't cause us any difficulty, therefore. What decides which you put first
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.220]   is what you're immediately concerned to do. If your emphasis is upon the confession of
[00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.820]   the Christian, you put the mouth first. But if you're trying to discover how it is a man
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:08.820]   really does believe, you put the heart first. And so you get the reversing of the order.
[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:15.260]   Well, now then, the important thing, of course, is to discover why it is that the apostle
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:23.900]   goes out of his way like this to amplify his definition of saving faith. It isn't enough
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:30.340]   to say that saving faith means that a man believes these two main things, that Jesus
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:36.140]   is Lord and that God hath raised him from the dead. There is more to it than that. Well,
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.220]   what is this? Perhaps we'd better start with the negative in order to be quite clear as
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.740]   to what the apostle is not saying. There have been those who have misunderstood both these
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:54.140]   verses, this statement, by interpreting in this way, that what the apostle is saying
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:07:01.540]   is that it is our belief and confession that saves us. On the surface, of course, it looks
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:06.420]   like that. "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in
[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:11.820]   thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved." Therefore,
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:17.540]   it is argued that the man who does make this confession with his mouth, and who believes
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:24.460]   that God has raised him from the dead, thereby saves himself. But, of course, that is impossible
[00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:32.100]   for this reason. That if that were the case, it would mean that we had turned belief into
[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:38.820]   a work, and it would mean that we were saving ourselves by our works. It would be another
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:44.380]   form of salvation by works. And many people have fallen, of course, into that very error.
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:50.620]   They say, "Ah, we agree that a man doesn't save himself by doing particular deeds."
[00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.780]   But here we are told quite plainly that if he says with his mouth, "I believe Jesus
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:00.340]   is Lord, and I believe that God has raised him from the dead," he thereby, in saying
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:08.660]   that, saves himself. Now, I say that is impossible for this reason, that the whole context in
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:13.340]   this tenth chapter, and particularly the ninth from which it follows on, and of which it
[00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:19.820]   is an elaboration, is entirely against such a thing. That's the very thing the apostle
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:28.020]   is concerned to disprove. His whole case is that we are all saved by grace. We are saved
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:36.900]   by what he has called in the ninth chapter, "the election of grace." For the children
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:43.220]   being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God, according
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:50.100]   to election, might stand not of works, but of him that calleth. That's the whole context.
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:56.980]   So, the moment we begin to say that our mere confession, or mere statement of belief, is
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:04.060]   the thing that saves us, we are denying this essential teaching that salvation is entirely
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:10.140]   of grace, that it is all of God, that we've got nothing of whereof we can burst. And we
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:16.060]   mustn't say that we have saved ourselves by believing, because the answer is, by grace
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:22.180]   you are saved, through faith, but that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God. So we've
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:27.220]   got to clear that preliminary point. Now, why does the apostle put it like this then?
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:32.700]   Well, he puts it like this for this reason. You remember that he had been dramatizing
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:38.300]   this matter by, as it were, putting up two preachers. You remember we looked at that
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:47.820]   in verses 5 and following. He says, "Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:53.540]   law in this way. This is what the righteousness which is of the law says, that the men which
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:59.420]   doeth those things shall live by them. But the righteousness which is of faith," here's
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:04.980]   the second preacher, "speaketh on this wise. Say not in thine heart." You see, he's got
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:12.980]   two speakers, two speeches, and he's finished up by saying, "This then is the word of faith
[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:21.460]   which we preach." What is it? Well, it is a word which saith, which makes this confession.
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:29.520]   And the confession is that we believe that Jesus is Lord, and we believe also that God
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:36.460]   hath raised him from the dead. In other words, the Christian's confession is that a man is
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:42.340]   not saved by the works of the law, but that he is saved by the Lord Jesus Christ. The
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:47.860]   emphasis here is not upon our confession. It is what we are confessing. And we are confessing
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:53.140]   that Jesus is Lord, and that God hath raised him from the dead, and all that that involves,
[00:10:53.140 --> 00:11:00.220]   which is, as we've seen, the way of salvation. So that is what the apostle is really saying.
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:06.500]   The statement which is made by saving faith is not that a man justifies himself in any
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:14.280]   way, but that he is justified by the Lord Jesus Christ, and what he has done on his
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:21.780]   behalf. Very well, we get rid of that which to me is nothing but a superficial and mechanical
[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:25.660]   interpretation of the scripture. You know the kind of argument people bring, "But it's
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:30.900]   as if thou shalt confess, thou shalt be saved." So it's your confessing that saves you. Well,
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:36.020]   that's not the way to approach the scripture. What's important is the confession, not our
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:44.020]   confessing. The whole of the emphasis of the apostle is upon the thing confessed, not upon
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.140]   our actual confession.
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:53.740]   Now, we shall see this as we go on with our exposition. Indeed, we've already done it
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:58.060]   earlier, but let me say this in passing for some perhaps who were not present at that
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:10.460]   time. Faith is not the basis of our salvation. Faith is only the instrument of our salvation.
[00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:16.340]   It is the channel. The basis of our salvation is the Lord Jesus Christ and his work. That's
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:22.900]   the foundation, not our faith. Our faith doesn't save us. It's the Lord Jesus Christ who saves
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:30.220]   us, and he saves us by doing what he has done on our behalf. Faith, then, I say, is nothing
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:35.380]   but the instrument or the channel by means of which the work of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:40.220]   becomes efficacious in the children of God.
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:46.620]   Very well. We get rid of that, and that allows us now to approach this subject positively
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:55.460]   and directly. Why does the apostle, I say again, put this emphasis upon the heart and
[00:12:55.460 --> 00:13:02.060]   the confession? Why isn't he content with saying that all that is necessary is this
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:08.860]   belief in Jesus as Lord and in the fact that God hath raised him from the dead? Well, now,
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:14.780]   I say, the answer is that he's anxious to safeguard us from certain dangers, and you
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:22.220]   get this same safeguarding in many, many other places in the New Testament teaching.
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:28.820]   There are two great dangers in particular from which this statement saves us and from
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:36.340]   which it safeguards us. The first is this, the danger of going to extremes. Now, we're
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:41.100]   all given to that, we're all aware of that, we're creatures of extremes. If we're corrected
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:46.260]   on one side, we go right over to the other side and lose our balance again. And the extremes
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:54.460]   here are these. Having been shown and shown so clearly by the apostle that a man can never
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:14:03.100]   save himself by his works or by his deeds, our danger is to swing right over to the other
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:08.340]   side and say, "Ah, quite, they don't matter at all. All that matters is that a man gives
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:15.060]   assent to these propositions of saving faith." So many have swung right over from a reliance
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:23.180]   upon works to a reliance upon nothing but a merely and a purely intellectual assent
[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:33.060]   to certain propositions. And it is the safeguarders from that that the apostle amplifies his definition.
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:39.940]   Or take the second danger. The second danger, I think, which tends to assail us is the danger
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:48.020]   of superficiality. And this is perhaps the main one of the present time. It's the danger
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:56.820]   of failing to see the profound nature of the problem of man himself, and therefore correspondingly,
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:05.900]   the profound nature and character of the salvation whereby we are saved. We are always given
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:11.260]   to something glib, easy, quick, and superficial, whereas the whole of the New Testament teaching,
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:17.180]   indeed the whole of the biblical teaching, is to show us that the problem of man in sin
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:24.820]   is the profoundest problem in the whole universe. And it necessitated everything that has happened
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:30.620]   in and through our Lord Jesus Christ. Because the problem is a profound one, the salvation
[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:36.900]   is a correspondingly great one, and a large one. So great a salvation.
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:43.500]   Now then, it is, I feel in particular, to safeguard us against those two things, this
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:49.500]   danger of flying to extremes and the danger of superficiality, that the apostle amplifies
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:54.380]   his definition in this way. Very well. The word we've got to concentrate on, of course,
[00:15:54.380 --> 00:16:01.540]   is the word "heart". "If thou shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:07.500]   the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart men believeth unto righteousness."
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:16.540]   Now then, what does this word "heart" mean? It's a most important word in the Scriptures.
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:22.660]   And what is important for us is to realise that it doesn't only mean the feelings. The
[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:29.100]   word "heart" in Scripture very rarely means the feelings or the sensibilities or the sensations
[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:35.540]   only. It includes that, and sometimes it only means that. The context will generally make
[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:41.220]   it plain and clear. But in the vast majority of instances, the word "heart" in the Scripture
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:49.420]   means the centre of personality. The very innermost citadel of the personality. Or if
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:56.700]   you like, it means the whole personality. So when we are told that it is with the heart
[00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:01.380]   that men believe that God hath raised him from the dead, it means that with the whole
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:07.460]   of our being we believe that. With the heart men believeth unto righteousness. With the
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:14.060]   whole of his personality, the totality of everything that he is. Not merely his feelings,
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:21.220]   not merely his intellect, but the whole of the personality. Now then, we obviously have
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:27.860]   got to work this out therefore. And in doing it we shall see what I've just been referring
[00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:34.040]   to, namely, the depth of the problem, and also the corresponding height and greatness
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:41.660]   and largeness of the salvation. So let me put it like this as a first proposition. We
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:50.180]   are reminded by this statement of the Apostle that unbelief is not merely a matter of the
[00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:57.660]   intellect, but is essentially a matter of the heart. Now then, here you see, I'm going
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:06.180]   to show you the danger of the superficiality. Let me repeat my proposition. Unbelief is
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:14.380]   not merely a matter of intellect or of understanding. It is primarily and essentially a matter of
[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:22.540]   the heart, the center of the personality, the very essence of what a man really is.
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:30.500]   Now it is the failure to realize this that is, as I understand it, the root cause of
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:39.180]   what we may call the modern fallacy. Now when I say the modern fallacy, I mean partly the
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:46.660]   unbelieving world that is outside the church. The unbelieving world, of course, regards
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:51.780]   this question as to whether a man believes in Christian faith or not, as being purely
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:58.940]   a matter of the intellect. And he doesn't believe the gospel because of his brain and
[00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:04.540]   his understanding, because of his logic, because of his reason, and because of his knowledge,
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:09.100]   and because of all that he's able to deduce from this wonderful knowledge, especially
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:14.940]   scientific knowledge, which he has at the present time. The men in the street, the non-Christians,
[00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:20.140]   he dismisses us as fools. We either haven't got any brains, or if we have, we don't
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:25.260]   use them. He says we're either stupid, or else we're deliberately burying our heads
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:31.460]   in the sand and refusing to face facts. Or else he may say that we're living in compartments,
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:37.180]   that as students, ah, well, we think scientifically and so on, but then we have another compartment
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:41.420]   of our life which we enter into on a Sunday and a Friday night, in which we stop thinking
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:46.340]   altogether, we stop doing what we always do, and we enter into another realm where we throw
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:51.860]   our brains overboard and we just allow ourselves to be carried away by our feelings. Purely
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:58.220]   a question of intellect. Now that's what the world says. The problem of Christianity,
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:04.180]   belief or unbelief, is to the unbelieving world, nothing but a problem of intellect
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:09.380]   and of understanding. That's why they often put it like this, that primitive races of
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:14.460]   course are religious. And they're religious because they're ignorant, they're not educated,
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:18.420]   and they haven't been taught how to think. People in the past ages used to be a religious
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:23.220]   life, same reason. They were ignorant, they were not taught how to think, they were not
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:27.380]   taught how to use their brains, and so on. It's purely an intellectual problem, they
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:31.660]   think. And therefore they, on intellectual grounds, reject it and have nothing at all
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:38.180]   to do with it. Now there, I say, is one aspect of what I call the modern problem. And of
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:43.780]   course you see the profound implications of all this. Men and women will turn to religion,
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:48.060]   to the Christian faith, which is the only thing that can deal with their moral and all
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:52.340]   their other problems. They won't even look at it. Why? Well they say their intellect
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:58.460]   is prohibited. Now that's the very reason, so you see, this is a very practical question.
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:07.580]   But unfortunately, this error, this mistake, which regards the problem of unbelief as purely
[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:13.740]   an intellectual problem, is not confined to those who are outside the church. It is one
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:19.740]   of the most fashionable points of view inside the Christian church. Now I am referring,
[00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:24.900]   of course, to all this which is so popular at the present time, this modern school of
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:32.100]   thinking, this, what do they call it, South Bank theology. It shouldn't be called that
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:37.780]   because it isn't theology. This South Bank speculation that masquerades as theology and
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:44.260]   as an attempt to outline the Christian faith, it isn't confined to the South Bank in London.
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:48.980]   You've got it in Cambridge. The four men who write their book Objections to Christianity
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:54.660]   and others, it's popular. Now then, what's the fallacy here? Well it's exactly the same
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:22:03.180]   fallacy as the fallacy of those who are out in the world. The whole motive behind this
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:07.620]   new movement in Christian teaching – it isn't Christian, but it's called that so
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:15.540]   I've got to use the term – the whole motive behind it is this. They say it's no use addressing
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:24.740]   modern men in the old way, because he's different. Now they say there was a time when
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:31.140]   men wasn't scientific, and then he was ready to believe in the supernatural and in the
[00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:37.540]   miraculous, in the unseen, and so on, and he thought in a spatial manner. But they say
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:45.100]   he doesn't do that any longer. Science has advanced and has taught us in a new way. So
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:50.580]   they say if you are going to evangelize the modern men, you must stop talking to him in
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:55.860]   that way. You must stop talking to him – you know the terms – about a God up there or
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:02.220]   out there. That's wrong, you see. That's the old way of thinking. You mustn't talk
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:09.480]   in terms of this supernatural. No, no. Men today handle things, and they are interested
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.820]   in instruments and in measurements, and in things which can be seen and felt and touched
[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:18.540]   and handled. Now, you've got to address men like that, otherwise you'll never make
[00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:22.900]   a Christian of him. I've got to grant them this much. Their desire is, they say, to make
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:28.060]   men Christian. And they say the only way you can make them Christian is to talk to them
[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:32.940]   in a manner that is intellectual. You must not talk about miracles, you must not talk
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:37.940]   about virgin birth, you must not talk about a literal physical resurrection, you must
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:42.140]   not talk about the substitutionary atonement, and things like that. The modern men can't
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:46.780]   take that. You mustn't even talk about God as personal. Modern men, with his knowledge
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:53.140]   and his way of thinking, he cannot accept it. But you see, quite apart from the details
[00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:59.980]   where they go wrong, the real trouble with their teaching is that it is fundamentally
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:07.420]   wrong. Its presupposition is that this is purely and entirely a matter of intellect
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:13.900]   and a matter of understanding. So they are proposing a new creed and a new way of teaching
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:21.220]   it, simply because they are guilty of exactly the same fallacy as the unbeliever who is
[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:25.940]   right out in the world. Now they don't see that, they don't know that. But that is the
[00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:30.940]   serious criticism. It's much more serious than their going wrong about any details,
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:35.740]   because at this point they are all wrong. So even if they should happen to say something
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:41.580]   now and again which is right, it is of no value, because their fundamental presupposition
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:48.500]   is wrong. They think the trouble with men is entirely misunderstanding. And this is
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:53.420]   the very thing that the apostle is countering at this point. But let's be clear about this.
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:25:01.020]   I want to take it a step further. Not only this modern school of teaching and of thought
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:09.780]   is wrong at this point and falls into this error, it may interest you to know that the
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:17.700]   real argument behind the production of what is called the New English Bible was exactly
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:23.660]   the same thing. What was the argument for that? What is the argument for this spate
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:28.140]   of new translations that we are getting? And everybody seems to think this is going to
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:34.220]   solve the problem. Well the argument behind it is this. The modern men no longer knows
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:40.220]   anything about justification or sanctification and so on. There was a time when those categories
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:46.100]   meant something to men. They don't any longer. Very well then, you must have a new translation.
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:50.220]   You must get rid of all these terms that are meaningless to the modern men. Tom, Dick and
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:54.500]   Harry, they can make nothing of it at all. But if you get a translation to them that
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:59.500]   they can understand and follow, then they'll probably become Christian. That was the argument
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:06.500]   behind it. It's the main argument for it. But it's exactly the same old fallacy. It
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:11.700]   is to assume that the reason why people are not Christian is because they don't understand
[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:17.100]   terms like justification and sanctification and glorification. And of course that isn't
[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:22.660]   the reason at all. Men and women in the world have never understood those terms. They've
[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:27.220]   always had to have them explained to them. Preaching has always been essential. The people
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:31.220]   of two hundred years ago, here in London, when Whitfield used to preach on Kennington
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:35.740]   Common and in Moorgate, they knew no more about justification and sanctification than
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:39.780]   Tom, Dick and Harry do today. And yet those are the very terms that Whitfield preached
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:44.700]   to them, explaining what they meant. It's got nothing to do with intellectual difficulty
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:49.820]   about understanding terminology. That isn't the trouble. But you see, it's the argument
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:57.260]   behind these new, what somebody called kitchen sink translations of the Bible ones. And it's
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:03.460]   a complete fallacy. Very well, this is the most important point. Now, we have to grant,
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:09.460]   of course, and it would be foolish not to, that the gospel must be preached and presented,
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:14.100]   if I may use the term that was used by the Protestant reformers, in a language and a
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:20.340]   standard of the people. What they meant by that was this, that it's no use speaking
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:24.940]   to people in Latin if they don't understand Latin. Even the Roman church is beginning
[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:33.460]   to see that. But that's a very different thing from imagining that the great terms
[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:39.460]   of the Christian salvation will ever be understood by the natural man. It's an entirely different
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:46.300]   point. Of course, we should be as plain and as simple as we can in our preaching, in our
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:51.860]   presentation of the word. That's common sense. But that isn't the argument of this
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:59.860]   other school. Their argument is that if only we use language that men can understand, that
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:04.300]   they will then immediately believe the message. And that's exactly where the fallacy comes
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:13.060]   in. Why? Well, because, as the apostle shows us here, the trouble with men is not in his
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:19.980]   head, it's in his heart. The problem is not an intellectual one. The problem is much
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:28.420]   deeper than that. The real trouble is not merely in man's brain, intellect, and understanding.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:34.100]   It's down in the very depth of his personality. Man isn't only partly wrong, he's entirely
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:38.940]   wrong. He's completely wrong. He is totally false.
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:44.500]   Now, this is a very important point, so I must establish it. You notice how the apostle
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:50.340]   does it. Did you notice, I wonder, in the sixth verse of this tenth chapter, how he's
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:56.940]   already thrown out a hint of what he's going to do? You see, "The righteousness which
[00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:02.940]   is of faith speaketh on this wise." Here is the preacher of righteousness by faith.
[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:09.900]   What does he say? Well, he says, "Don't say in your mind," or "Don't think with
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:16.540]   your intellect," not a bit of it, "Say not in thine heart." There's the trouble.
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:22.100]   "Say not in thine heart, who shall ascend into heaven?" In other words, as we expounded
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:28.140]   it, this is the fundamental unbelief of the natural man, who is always raising his objections.
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:34.180]   He puts them intellectually, but they don't arise in his intellect. All he produces as
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:38.220]   intellectual arguments are simply meant to substantiate what he really believes in his
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:42.940]   heart. "Say not in thine heart, who shall ascend."
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:50.220]   Now this, I do trust I'm making this plain and clear. What man says is only the excuse
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:55.700]   for what he really is. It is his defense for what he really is in his heart. So the thing
[00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:59.580]   to pay attention to is not to what he says, but to what he really is. Very well, there
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:04.980]   it is in the sixth verse. But of course, that's not the only example. Go right back to the
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:10.460]   first chapter of this epistle to the Romans, and you will find that the apostle has already
[00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:16.420]   said it away back there in the very first chapter. Listen. The 18th verse of the first
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:25.860]   chapter. "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:35.060]   of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness." Now the right translation there is "who hold
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:44.900]   down the truth in unrighteousness." The wrath of God is against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:50.540]   of men. What's the trouble with these men? Ah, the trouble with these men is not in their
[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:54.660]   minds, it's not in their intellects, it's not in their understanding. Here's their trouble.
[00:30:54.660 --> 00:31:02.820]   They hold down the truth in unrighteousness. They won't have it. They are resisting it.
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:08.460]   They are stamping on it. They are keeping their foot upon it. They hold down the truth
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:14.500]   in their state and condition of unrighteousness. Now there's a tremendous statement of this
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:20.380]   very principle away back at the beginning. But look at the 21st verse. Here's the trouble
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:31.300]   with the human race. "Because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:40.540]   were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened." That's
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:48.060]   the trouble. See, it wasn't intellect. It was something much deeper. It was man's whole
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:53.940]   fundamental attitude towards God. It was not just a question of terminology. It was not
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:58.180]   merely a question of knowledge and intellectual apprehension. There was that down in the very
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:04.500]   depth of man's personality that wouldn't glorify God. Like the devil before him had raised
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:10.020]   himself up in his pride and had rebelled against God and had attacked God, man has done the
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:15.820]   same thing. It's in his heart. His foolish heart was darkened.
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:23.140]   But still more clearly perhaps you've got it in the 28th verse. "And even as they did
[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:29.380]   not like to retain God in their knowledge." That's it. They didn't like to retain God
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:33.760]   in their knowledge. They didn't want to. They didn't like doing so. They wanted to be doing
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:38.900]   something else. Not because of their intellectual understanding, not because of their great
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:43.860]   education. No, no. But because they were governed by something much deeper than the intellect,
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:51.700]   their whole personality, their whole desire. They didn't like to retain God in their knowledge.
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:58.260]   That's why they turned their backs upon God, and that is why they are unbelievers.
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:02.900]   But again, of course, we've had a great statement of this in the 8th chapter of this epistle
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:11.740]   in verse 7. Here it is. "Why is man an unbeliever? Ah, intellectual knowledge, his great brain,
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:20.940]   not at all. The carnal mind is enmity against God. He is not subject to the law of God,
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:25.220]   neither can be. The trouble with Tom, Dick, and Harry is not that they don't understand
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:31.840]   the meaning of justification and sanctification, it's that they love sin and hate God. Enmity
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:40.140]   against God is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. Now there is the essential
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:45.340]   cause of the trouble. Now the Bible is full of this. Look at the 14th Psalm, the first
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:53.940]   verse. Do you remember it? "The fool hath said in his heart there is no God." You notice
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:34:02.460]   where he says it? In his heart. That is where this modern movement is so completely fatuous
[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:10.140]   and ridiculous. To me, really, if these things were not tragic, they would certainly be the
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:14.820]   most amusing thing I've ever come across. That these people pride themselves on saying
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:21.580]   something new. And all they're saying is that the fool hath always said in his heart there
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:29.660]   is no God. A way back a thousand years before the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ, that's
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:39.420]   what they were saying. The clever fools were saying in their hearts there is no God. That's
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:45.540]   always the cause of the trouble. There are many repetitions of that in the Old Testament.
[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:49.900]   Indeed we could have gone further back to Genesis 6, 5. Here was the condition before
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:57.220]   the flood. God saw that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart, namely men,
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:06.300]   was only evil continually. Every imagination of the thought of his heart was only evil
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:14.060]   continually. That's men's trouble. It's not in his intellect. It's not in his understanding.
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:21.300]   It's not in his brain. It's in his heart. There's the seat of unbelief. So you see why
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:26.500]   he emphasizes that it's also the seat of belief. But wait a minute, I'm determined to establish
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:34.140]   this point and to nail it. Look at our Lord himself putting this point in the 11th chapter
[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:40.660]   of the Gospel according to St. Matthew, verse 25 and following. "At that time Jesus answered
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:46.780]   and said, 'I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:53.380]   things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father,
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:36:02.700]   for so it seemed good in thy sight.'" Now there it is, once and forever. The wise and
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:08.380]   prudent, these who believe in their brains and intellects and understandings and are
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:15.580]   so proud of it, they are the people who never get this understanding. But the babes get
[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:22.660]   it. The babes, the unintelligent, as it were, those who don't trust to their intellect,
[00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:28.060]   they are the ones to whom it is revealed. It isn't a matter of the intellect. It's
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:33.180]   this attitude. It is this pride of intellect. Well then, of course, you've got it in John
[00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:38.540]   3, verse 19, one of the most amazing statements of all, which one would have thought would
[00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:46.700]   have been sufficient in and of itself to put this matter right once and forever. This is
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:37:01.980]   the condemnation, that light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:08.980]   light. The light has come. Why don't men believe it? "Ah," they say, "intellect, understanding."
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:17.060]   No, no. Men loved darkness rather than light. The problem is not intellectual. It's much
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:23.580]   deeper. It's in men's whole nature. That's why it needs to be regenerated. It isn't merely
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:27.060]   a matter of the intellect. If it were, that could be put right by instruction. It's much
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:33.660]   deeper. You see, this is a profound problem. A man is totally fallen. He's entirely wrong.
[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:39.820]   It isn't only his head, the whole of him. This is the condemnation. Then you get it
[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:46.380]   in John 5, verse 44. Well, it's the same thing. "How can you believe," says our Lord, "which
[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:50.420]   receive honour one of another, and receive not the honour that cometh from God only?"
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:54.140]   He says, "Your trouble is your pride. You receive honour one from another. You write
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:57.420]   your books to one another, and you praise one another in your reviews, and here you
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:01.940]   are going round and round in your circle, and you're outside the knowledge of God."
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:08.980]   And that's precisely what's happening today. They receive honour one from another, and
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:14.060]   so they never receive that honour that cometh from God only.
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:17.580]   But let me give you another illustration to show the same thing. Look at this man, the
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:24.980]   Apostle Paul, before he became a Christian. He was a great intellect, a great brain, a
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:32.620]   most learned, erudite man. But he wasn't a Christian. Why wasn't he a Christian? It
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:36.820]   can't have been a matter of brain, because he'd got it. It couldn't have been lack of
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:41.140]   information, because, like every other Pharisee, he'd heard all about it. He tells us later
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:46.300]   on in addressing Agrippa and Festus, "I verily thought with myself that I ought to do many
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:50.860]   things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth." He knew all about him, but he regarded him
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:55.140]   as a blasphemer. What was the matter with him? Was his problem an intellectual one?
[00:38:55.140 --> 00:39:02.180]   Was it that he couldn't understand the terminology? You get the answer in the first verse of the
[00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:08.420]   ninth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles. "And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:17.100]   and slaughter." That's not cold intellectual detachment, is it? That's not a scientific
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:22.740]   view of the situation. He's not rejecting it because of his great brain and this detached,
[00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:28.420]   purely scientific point of view. No, no, he's governed by something else, breathing out
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:36.180]   threatenings and slaughter, passion, hatred, venom, spleen, wanting to massacre these innocent
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:42.220]   Christian people. And what was true of Saul of Tarsus before his conversion is the simple
[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:46.900]   truth about all who are not Christian today. Their trouble isn't there, it's lower down.
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:53.460]   It's in the heart. It's this antagonism, this bitterness, this hatred. They can't deal with
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:57.460]   it, you see, without making fun of it. You read their books, these new ones, and you'll
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:03.100]   see how they say that we innocent Christians and people before us have always thought of
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:07.860]   God as some glorified Father Christmas. How clever. And you can hear the little laughter
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:13.860]   and the tittle, can't you, as these things are said. How clever it all is. And they think
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:18.420]   they're intellectuals. The trouble isn't in their brains. It is there, but it's much deeper
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:25.020]   also. It's down in the very basis and depth of their personality. Or take it again as
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:30.060]   the Apostle, this Apostle Paul, puts it so plainly and clearly in the first epistle to
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:35.380]   the Corinthians. You've got it in the first two chapters. He preaches Christ crucified.
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:39.860]   He says he knows perfectly well that to the Jews it is a stumbling block, and to the Greeks
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:48.340]   foolishness. The point is not that they examine it rationally, and then in a purely intellectual
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:53.740]   and objective manner reject it. No, no, there's scorn, there's foolishness. They spit upon
[00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:58.780]   it, they make fun of it, they laugh. Why the heat and the passion? Because the trouble
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:03.540]   isn't intellectual, because it isn't understanding. It's altogether deeper. And so you get him
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:08.980]   saying explicitly in the second chapter in verse 14, "The natural man receiveth not the
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:13.940]   things of the Spirit of God, for their foolishness unto him neither can he, because they are
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:18.900]   spiritually discerned." He doesn't merely reject them. He ridicules them. Their foolishness,
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:24.860]   sheer folly, something unworthy of consideration. So I leave you with a final quotation of the
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:32.740]   state of the unregenerate in Ephesians 4, beginning at verse 17. "This I say therefore,
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:39.020]   and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity
[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:45.940]   of their mind, having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:51.060]   the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their hearts." They're ignorant
[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:56.100]   because of the blindness of their heart, who being past feeling, have given themselves
[00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:03.900]   over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness. It's not an accident that
[00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:08.180]   the last chapter in the books of these gentlemen is generally one on what they call the new
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:17.260]   morality, which is nothing but lasciviousness explained away, license and immorality, now
[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:23.300]   condoned and excused and defended. There it is. It's because of the blindness of their
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:28.140]   heart and their past feeling, and they've given themselves over unto lasciviousness,
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:36.700]   to work all uncleanness with greediness. So you see a perfect description of your modern
[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:44.740]   generation, bursting of its great intellectuality, and living as if they were animals in the
[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:54.780]   farmyard. The two things always go together. The trouble with men, the cause of unbelief,
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:43:01.860]   is not purely intellectual. It is not a matter of the understanding. Unbelief is the result
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:08.780]   of a condition of the heart of men. Very well, we've got to leave it at that tonight. But
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:14.220]   you see, this negative is tremendously important. If this, my friends, doesn't open your eyes
[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:22.300]   to the whole modern discussion, well then, I finally despair of you. It's a perfect exposure
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:31.620]   of it. It is the heart that matters, in unbelief and in belief also. And nothing less than
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:37.740]   that is the belief which constitutes saving faith. God willing, we'll go on to consider
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:44.620]   that next Friday night. Let us pray. O Lord our God, we thank Thee more than ever for
[00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:50.940]   Thy Word, for this Word of the Scripture. Lord, we bless Thee for it, and we thank Thee
[00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:55.980]   for its fullness. We thank Thee for the way in which it searches us. We thank Thee for
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:44:02.100]   the way in which it exposes our natural human fallacies. We thank Thee, O Lord, in which
[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:09.800]   it exposes to us unbelief in every age and generation. We see that Thy Word is so contemporary,
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:15.620]   dealing with the very latest in the form of intellectualism, showing it for what it rarely
[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:23.940]   is, and not only showing that but safeguarding us from all its subtle enticements, and all
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:30.500]   that it does contrary to the glory of Thy Name and of Thy dear Son. We therefore humbly
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:36.540]   thank Thee, O Lord, that Thou hast ever given us Thy Word, that we have it in a language
[00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:42.060]   that we can understand. And above all, we thank Thee for the light and the anointing
[00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:48.460]   and the unction of Thy most blessed Holy Spirit upon it. O God, we pray Thee to keep us ever
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:56.180]   to that simplicity that is in Christ Jesus. Keep us, we pray Thee, from philosophy and
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:45:04.740]   knowledge and science, falsely so called. O God, keep us from all the deceit and the
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:12.180]   wiles of Satan. We thank Thee for the impregnable rock of Holy Scripture. We thank Thee for
[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:19.780]   the perspicuity of the Scriptures, to the mind of men enlightened by the Holy Spirit.
[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:24.860]   We thank Thee that we Thy people can join in saying, "But God hath revealed them unto
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:32.460]   us by his Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God."
[00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:39.060]   And we have received not the Spirit that is of the world, but the Spirit that is of God,
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:48.340]   that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. O Lord, we again thank
[00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:56.500]   Thee therefore that we are what we are by Thy grace, by grace are we saved, and that
[00:45:56.500 --> 00:46:05.460]   through faith, and that not of yourselves. It is the gift of God. O Lord, receive our
[00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:15.540]   praise for this wonderful gift which brings us to a knowledge of Thine unspeakable gift,
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:23.140]   in Thy dearly beloved Son. And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love
[00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:28.900]   of God, and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with
[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:35.660]   us now this night, throughout the remainder of this hour's short, uncertain, earthly
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:41.300]   life and pilgrimage, and evermore. Amen.
[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:45.380]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
