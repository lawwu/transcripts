[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.840]   - We close out the week with a very commonly asked question
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.480]   in the minds of many Christians,
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.920]   and it's a question that you, Pastor John,
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.760]   are asked a lot on the road,
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.280]   and it's one of the most common questions
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.540]   we get from our listener emails as well.
[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.600]   Here it is.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.240]   If I read my Bible, but I don't feel anything
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.000]   in my affections that resonates with the worth
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.120]   and the value and the preciousness of the words,
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.860]   of what those words communicate to me,
[00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.840]   is there anything I can do next,
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.400]   or do I just have to wait and let the experience
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.520]   happen to me in the future?
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.080]   How would you answer such a question?
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.840]   - Well, I am so glad for the question
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.440]   because it is something that I've been thinking about
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.720]   recently so much because I've been meditating
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.720]   on a section of the book of Proverbs,
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.640]   and I think this section of the book of Proverbs
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.800]   is introduced by the inspired writer
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.060]   precisely to answer that question.
[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.060]   So the section is Proverbs 22, 17,
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.440]   down to 24, 22, I think it goes,
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.560]   and it's a section, in fact, I'll just pause here.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.400]   No, I won't.
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.000]   You can pause. (laughs)
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.680]   So push pause if you wanna go get your Bible
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.120]   'cause I'm gonna get everything I have to say
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.120]   from about three lines in verses 17 and 18 of Proverbs 22.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.200]   So get your Bible.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.240]   Okay, now you've got your Bible.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.240]   And the section runs from 22, 17 down to 24, 22,
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.280]   and it's called, if you look at the end, verse 20,
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.600]   it says, "Have I not written for you 30 sayings?"
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.600]   Now, those 30 sayings are found in 22, 17 to 24, 22
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.280]   in groupings.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.960]   Some Bibles break the groupings out for you.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.960]   So every time a new theme starts,
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.960]   there's a new saying, and there are 30 of them in this unit.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.040]   And in verse 17 is where they start,
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.480]   and it says, "Incline your ear
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.200]   and hear the words of the wise."
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.200]   So these are usually entitled the words of the wise.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.760]   Now, what's so important about this
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.920]   is that I think the first two verses
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.960]   or the first three verses, perhaps,
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.320]   in this new section of 30 sayings
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.100]   are written precisely to answer the question
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.100]   that we've just been given, namely, how do you hear
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.520]   and how do you feel appropriately these words?
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.620]   So let me read verse 17 and 18.
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.620]   "Incline your ear and hear the words of the wise
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.800]   and apply your heart to my knowledge,
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.800]   for it will be pleasant if you keep them."
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.840]   These words of the wise, communicating that knowledge.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.880]   It will be pleasant if you keep them within you,
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.880]   if all of them are ready on your lips.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.620]   So two things, the first line,
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.080]   incline your ear and hear the words of the wise.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:29.100]   So clearly, the point there is words are being spoken
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.900]   and you should lean in, incline your ear.
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.580]   So literally, if you can't hear them,
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.580]   what do we do when we can't hear?
[00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.700]   We kind of lean, we press in closer,
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.100]   but we do that with our attention as well.
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.480]   If you're reading words or if you're hearing words
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.640]   and the words are just going by,
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.680]   he's saying, don't let them go by.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.840]   Don't let any of the words go by.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.760]   Attend meticulously, carefully,
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.780]   attentively to the words themselves
[00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.800]   because the words, next line,
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.120]   are going to form knowledge in your mind
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.360]   because the next line says,
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.520]   "And apply your heart to my knowledge."
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.300]   So knowledge is what forms in the mind
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.200]   some idea, some communication of something valuable
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.700]   or precious or important or wise
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.260]   that he's going to communicate,
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.440]   coming through the medium of words that hit your ear,
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.920]   go inside, produce knowledge, and then here it comes,
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.560]   "And apply your heart to my knowledge."
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.560]   And the effect will be, it will be pleasant.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.560]   And I take it that the heart is the organ of pleasantness,
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.500]   pleasure, and that's what the question is, right?
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.060]   How can I experience pleasure,
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.060]   an appropriate admiring and valuing and treasuring
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.920]   and loving and embracing and enjoyment and satisfaction
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.920]   in what I'm perceiving through the words?
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.920]   And he says, "The way you do it is apply your heart."
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.540]   Now, I'm going to talk for just a minute or two
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.540]   about what that means,
[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.740]   but just know this writer,
[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.740]   this inspired writer is answering your question, yes.
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.220]   Is there something you can do
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.620]   to move from ears attending to words
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.520]   and mind grasping knowledge
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.960]   to heart experiencing pleasantness of what is within?
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.700]   Is there anything you can do?
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.040]   And his answer is yes.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.540]   And the words he uses are,
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.100]   "Apply your heart to what your ear has heard
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.380]   and the knowledge that's forming in your mind."
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.620]   What does that mean?
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.560]   And I've got here right in front of me on my screen,
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.360]   "Katashit," the verb, "apply."
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.680]   V'liv-ka-tashit.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.640]   Your heart, apply, or literally put or set
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.940]   or stand or place.
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.940]   So you take your heart and you push it, you put it,
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.940]   you place it into what you've seen with your eyes
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.680]   or heard with your ears.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.980]   You push the nose of your heart
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.520]   in the beauty of the knowledge.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.260]   If the heart is not feeling anything,
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.740]   you say to heart, "Heart, wake up."
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.260]   And you take hold of the heart and you apply, you push it,
[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.100]   you place it in the knowledge, you push on it.
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.960]   There is something you can do.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.380]   So here's an analogy.
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:55.700]   Suppose you would like to taste a steak.
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.320]   You can hear it sizzling on the grill outside.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.360]   So you go outside and then your eyes see the steak
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.160]   sizzling on the grill.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.360]   And if you get close enough,
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.200]   your nose may smell the steak sizzling on the grill
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.200]   and still no taste in your mouth of that steak.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.520]   Is there anything you can do?
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.920]   That is the question.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.800]   It really is the question.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.760]   Is there anything you can do with the steak of God,
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.160]   with the steak of Christ, with the steak of salvation,
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.620]   with the steak of the word of God,
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.940]   the word of the infinite creator God,
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.360]   is there anything you can do to taste it?
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.740]   And you know what the answer is.
[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.240]   You take a knife and you cut off a piece
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.040]   and you put it in your mouth and you chew and you chew
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.280]   and then you swallow and you taste.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.280]   So you say to your heart, "Eat heart, eat heart."
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.480]   So let me give some more examples.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.200]   I'm walking to church.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.400]   It's October, this happened last two weeks.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.240]   The leaves on the trees in my neighborhood,
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.440]   unbelievably bright with yellow and orange
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.840]   and the sun was shining
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.980]   and it was a more mild October than usual.
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.760]   And it's 60 degrees, the leaves are flickering
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.680]   and it is absolutely stunning.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.360]   But I'm walking to church to a prayer meeting
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.500]   and not noticing anything.
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.360]   My eyes are seeing it and I'm not seeing it.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.520]   What has to happen?
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.520]   I pause, God's grace causes me to pause.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:35.520]   This little podcast right here causes you to pause
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.320]   and you look at it, you look at it, you lean in
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:43.800]   and you say, "Heart, that's orange, that's yellow.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.980]   "They were green and now they're orange and yellow and gold
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.260]   "and the sun is making them bright
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.160]   "and they are waving at you with the breeze
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.420]   "and God is trying to get your attention
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.280]   "and say the glory of God is shining here.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.680]   "Look heart," and you push the nose of the heart
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.680]   up into the tree.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.120]   When I came home several days,
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.240]   there were two or three afternoons that were so stunning.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.920]   I would look out my window and say, "Whoa,"
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.240]   and I'd get up, go downstairs
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.040]   and I walk under the tree and look up.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.880]   Then I walked across the street and looked back.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.460]   Then I got out my camera
[00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.320]   and tried to get some different shots.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.780]   Then I walked around the side of the house
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.780]   to see what it looked like from that angle.
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:26.280]   This is the pushing of the heart
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.260]   into the gold of natural revelation
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:35.240]   and you do the same thing with the word of God.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.600]   A diamond is offered you.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.740]   You see the diamond but you don't see the diamond
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.620]   and you say to your heart, "Heart, move around this diamond.
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.240]   "Look at the diamond from that side
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.320]   "and look at the diamond from that side."
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.200]   And you know, when a born again person
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.780]   is doing Proverbs 17b.
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.560]   Apply your heart to this knowledge.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.640]   Apply your heart, apply your heart.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.800]   You can't help but turn it into prayer.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.360]   When you're preaching to your heart
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.700]   and you're saying to your heart,
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.080]   "Come on, heart, wake up.
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.440]   "Come on, heart, look at this.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.040]   "Come on, heart, feel this.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.220]   "This is beautiful.
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.640]   "Wake up, heart."
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.800]   Instinctively, you are praying
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.360]   and you're not just talking to your heart,
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.240]   though you are talking to your heart
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.840]   because that's what the text says to do.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.760]   Apply your heart.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.180]   But you are praying, "God, God help me.
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.200]   "God, open my eyes."
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.520]   So may I suggest that even if you listen to this right now
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.040]   and you say, "I've tried that and it doesn't work,"
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.880]   or, "I don't even know what you're talking about,"
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.520]   may I urge you, may I plead with you,
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.800]   you may be such a novice at this,
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.800]   like a little child who knows nothing about sex.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.320]   You choose an analogy.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.580]   You may be such a novice at this that you need practice.
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.560]   Please, don't give up.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.480]   Don't say that you are beyond the capacity
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.280]   to feel the beauty of the knowledge of God in the Bible
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.640]   and the knowledge of His ways.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.620]   This text is God's word to you.
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.840]   Apply your heart.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.680]   - Amen.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.000]   - That's Pastor John.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.080]   And with that, another week comes to an end.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.280]   And if you missed any of the episodes from the week,
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.000]   you can catch up with the daily Ask Pastor John podcast app
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.840]   or you can go online at our online home
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.440]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.320]   And there you can find everything related to this podcast.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.200]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.200]   Have a great weekend.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.900]   And we will see you back here on Monday, Lord willing.
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.060]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:53.060]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
