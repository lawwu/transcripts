[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   So how should we filter positive versus negative feedback?
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.080]   Well, there's a meta-analysis here.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.880]   This is Kluger and Dinesi looking at 100 years of feedback research, and they found that
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.000]   what drives the utility of feedback is not whether it's positive or negative.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.600]   It's whether it focuses on the task or on the self.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.380]   So if I tell you that your work is terrible, you're going to get defensive.
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.540]   If I tell you that your work is great, you're going to get complacent.
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.320]   If I tell you, here's the specific thing that I liked about your work, you're going to try
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.880]   to learn to repeat that.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.020]   And if I tell you, here's the thing I didn't like, you're going to try to see if you can
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.560]   fix it.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.860]   So I actually think we should worry less about whether the feedback is encouraging or discouraging,
[00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.120]   and more about how do I make sure that I get input that's going to allow me to learn from
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.660]   my strengths and also overcome my weaknesses.
[00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.340]   And actually, one of the things I've learned recently is there's some, I would say, a growing
[00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.580]   body of evidence at this point that asking for feedback is not the best way to get people
[00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.220]   to help you.
[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.980]   Because when you ask for feedback, you end up getting two groups of people.
[00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.180]   You get cheerleaders and you get critics.
[00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.980]   And cheerleaders are basically applauding your best self.
[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.620]   Critics are attacking your worst self.
[00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.020]   What you want is a coach, which is somebody who helps you become a better version of yourself.
[00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.220]   And the way you get people to coach you is not to say, "Give me feedback," because they
[00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.820]   will then look at the past and tell you what you screwed up or what you did right.
[00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.340]   What you want is to say, "Can you give me advice for next time?"
[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.780]   And then they look at the future and they'll give you either a note on something to repeat
[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.380]   or something to correct.
[00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.700]   And this is such a subtle shift, but it can make a big difference.
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.300]   Andrew, one of the things I've, I guess I found myself applying this to a lot is after
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.300]   giving speeches.
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.020]   I used to get off stage and say, "I'd love some feedback."
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.260]   And you get back a bunch of, "Oh, you know, I really enjoyed that.
[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.260]   Thanks.
[00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.740]   What do I do with that information?
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.700]   I'm trying to learn how to get better."
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.020]   And when I shift the question to say, "What's the one thing I could do better next time?"
[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.780]   It's like, "Oh, don't open with a joke.
[00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.020]   The audience couldn't tell you were joking."
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.300]   Frequently, it's, "Give me a little bit more of a through line.
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.420]   You focused a lot on, you know, a bunch of interesting points, but I lost the connective
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.420]   tissue."
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.780]   And, you know, those actionable suggestions are much more likely to come when you just
[00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.540]   ask for a tip as opposed to an evaluation.
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.140]   Oh, that's so good.
[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.740]   I mean, I'm going to just pause for a second.
[00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.780]   I've never taken a pause.
[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.460]   I've taken occasional pause, to be honest, but they're very rare, as the audience knows.
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:42.700]   Oh, that's just gazillion dollar advice because I think that everyone has an ego.
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.100]   We all want to perform well.
[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.340]   We'd like to perform better over time, and negative feedback hurts.
[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.260]   And it can hurt a little or a lot depending on how defensive we are, but a tool like you
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.320]   just described to remove some of that defensive armor that we all have and actually let the
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.500]   information in in a way that's constructive is really great.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.460]   What you described, I think, is a way to create constructive criticism, but the constructive
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.580]   part is really coming from within as opposed to saying, "I'd like some constructive criticism,"
[00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.380]   and then hoping that the criticism is actually constructive.
[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.900]   So you're taking control over the process in a healthy way, in a benevolent way.
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.900]   That's the goal.
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.480]   And I think the big question that comes up for a lot of people at this point is, "Okay,
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.940]   so I get somebody to give me advice, but it might still sting.
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.940]   How do I get better at taking it constructively?"
[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.220]   And I think probably my favorite technique on this I learned from Sheila Heen.
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.100]   She calls it the second score.
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.780]   And the idea is that when somebody gives you a piece of criticism, that's your first score.
[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.900]   So let's say in my world they gave me a three and a half, and I want to know how I can do
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.900]   better next time.
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.780]   How do I get myself to focus on that?
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.140]   What I do is say, "I want to get a 10 for how well I took the three and a half."
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.140]   And that's the second score.
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.460]   I want to evaluate myself on how well I took the first score.
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.700]   I think about this almost every day.
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.980]   Actually, can I tell you a quick story?
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.980]   So when I was right out of my doctorate, I got asked to teach a motivation class for
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.420]   Air Force generals and colonels.
[00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.720]   I was 25, I think, 25, 26.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.300]   They're all twice my age.
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.460]   They've got thousands of flying hours.
[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.940]   They've got billion dollar budgets.
[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.540]   They've got-- well, you know this community well.
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.420]   Their nicknames are Stryker and Sand Dune.
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.460]   And I was extremely intimidated.
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.940]   So I walked in there, and I thought I had to impress them.
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.540]   And I started talking about my credentials and all my research experience.
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.460]   And the feedback at the end of the four-hour session was brutal.
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.260]   I remember reading the feedback forms, and one person had written, "More knowledge in
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.740]   the audience than on the podium."
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.740]   I was like, "True.
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.820]   I can't argue with that."
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.780]   And then another wrote, "I gained nothing from this session, but I trust the instructor
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:03.780]   gained useful insight."
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.940]   And that was devastating.
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.380]   I was like, "Can I-- I would really like to transform into an actual bear and hibernate
[00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.500]   for the next four months, and then maybe I'll come out of a hole ready to hear this."
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.900]   I didn't have that option.
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.700]   I had committed to teach a second session a week later.
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.780]   So all I could do was figure out, how am I going to hear this feedback and really take
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.780]   it seriously?
[00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.620]   And I guess I applied a version of the second score, and I said, "All right, you know, there's
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.020]   some generals that are going to come back and see me again, and I've got to prove to
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.140]   them that I was open to feedback."
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.720]   And one of the things I heard loud and clear was that they valued humility, and I had led
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.180]   with too much confidence, which was just insecurity masked.
[00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.140]   And so I thought, "Okay, how do I-- how do I change the equation?"
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.900]   And walked in, looked at the room, and I said, "I know what you're all thinking right now.
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.180]   What could I possibly learn from a professor who's 12 years old?"
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.180]   Dead silence.
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.060]   I'm like, "Oh, no.
[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.940]   This is going to go horribly wrong."
[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.660]   And then one of the guys in the audience jumps in, and he's like, "Oh, that's ridiculous.
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.220]   You've got to be at least 13."
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.220]   Everybody started laughing.
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.780]   It broke the ice.
[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.780]   And I think what I was trying to do was to take myself off the pedestal and say, "Look,
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.360]   I heard your feedback.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.460]   You told me that you didn't think I had anything to teach you, and I've got to acknowledge
[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.420]   that right up front and be open to the fact that that's true.
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.140]   And so I want to come in here and learn from you, and I want to see if I can curate a conversation
[00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.400]   where we all end up learning."
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.180]   And the feedback was night and day different.
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.140]   Afterward, one person wrote, "Although junior in experience, the professor dealt with the
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.380]   evidence in an interesting way."
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.900]   I was like, "All right, I'll take it."
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.940]   And there was something really powerful about saying, "Look, you know, I can't change the
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.660]   fact that they hated my session.
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.220]   What I can do is convince them that I was motivated to learn from their criticism."
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:59.460]   I love this concept of the second score, and thank you for sharing that story.
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.940]   I think, you know, very often we hear about people like you who, if people didn't catch
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.780]   the math in there, you were a PhD by age 25.
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.460]   And as far as I know, the youngest tenured professor at Penn at 28.
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:18.840]   So these are outrageously impressive metrics of accomplishment.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:24.420]   And for you to share a story about, you know, less than optimal performance and how you
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:30.620]   adjusted to it and the incorporation of the second score that you're referring to, I think
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.500]   it's really appreciated.
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:37.420]   Because I think that as much as we hear, you know, "Oh, you know, Jordan, you know, took
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:41.340]   many more, you know, free throws, and everyone just thinks about all the ones he made."
[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.620]   You know, people think about all the ones he made.
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.780]   That's the way the game works.
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.660]   That's the way the mind works, I should say.
[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.180]   So it's, I appreciate that you've fleshed it out with a personal example.
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.780]   I too would want to turn into a bear and disappear.
[00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.180]   But I would, but I think that it's really impressive what you did.
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:00.460]   And it makes me think that the second score of getting a 10 at bringing the three and
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:10.020]   a half up, right, as it were, is really about turning a score into a verb process.
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:14.060]   You know, over and over again, as I do this podcast, and as I've taught in the classroom,
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.380]   what I keep coming back to is this idea that we should be focusing more on verbs and less
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:18.620]   on nouns.
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:23.800]   We love to name things and categorize them, but when we start living life through a lot
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.860]   of verb processes, so instead of getting, being fit, we think about that, you know,
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:32.860]   or running as a thing, we really think about, like, just running, right, it becomes less
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.420]   daunting and we accomplish far more.
[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:39.300]   But the idea that, you know, and this has, there are mathematical models of this, I'm
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.240]   sure, but where you're basically talking about, you know, like an integral, right, as opposed
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.240]   to just some value.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.380]   You're talking about the slope of the line, right, so you're a three and a half, how are
[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.380]   you going to get to a 10?
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:52.180]   Gosh, that's a huge gap, and you're dealing with being back on your heels psychologically
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:56.500]   from getting all this, you know, battering feedback from these, you know, these highly
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.580]   accomplished individuals, all these accoutrements and, you know, literally wearing them presumably
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.340]   on their body for you to see.
[00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:08.220]   And it's really about creating, it's about taking control of the slope of that line from
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.220]   the three onward.
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.520]   And it's really a forward-looking perspective.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.600]   So I don't think we're being unduly psychological here or analytic.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:21.100]   I mean, I think it's really about taking a moment state and a noun and turning it into
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.100]   a verb.
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.100]   Yeah, I think that's right.
[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:29.220]   I'm reminded of the great philosopher Homer Simpson, who said that verbing weirds language.
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.820]   So it's harder to talk about this stuff in verbs.
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.820]   I love it.
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.140]   I swear I didn't steal it from the Simpsons, but if it came from Homer Simpson, like, I'm
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.140]   all for it.
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.220]   You have to, I mean, that's incredibly credible.
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:42.000]   Small brain, but, you know, given the size of his brain and people have seen the image,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.080]   you know, fairly robust knowledge.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.680]   No, I think you're on to something.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.220]   I think verbs are active and we're drawn to them.
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.680]   I think, yeah, a lot of times people review their past work and they just like, they end
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.040]   up shaming an earlier version of themselves and they wallow in rumination.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:02.480]   And what we want to try to do in that situation, which is easier said than done, is to say,
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:07.000]   all right, like the purpose of, you know, of getting feedback or advice is not to shame
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.040]   my past self, it's to educate my future self.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.140]   Which I think is very connected to a lot of the work on growth mindset that you've been
[00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.140]   talking about.
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:18.860]   And there's been a firestorm of controversy around, can we teach growth mindset in schools
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:19.860]   lately?
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:25.880]   And I think what that has underscored for me is, look, you can't expect someone to listen
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.960]   to one podcast episode or go through one workshop and magically believe that they're capable
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.200]   of learning anything at any moment.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.800]   This is something we have to actively work on on a daily basis.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:40.240]   And part of doing that, exactly as you said, is thinking about this loop and saying, all
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.360]   right, the person that I'm, you know, I'm competing with is my past self and I want
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.120]   to get a little bit better today than I was yesterday.
