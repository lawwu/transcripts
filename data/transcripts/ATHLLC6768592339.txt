[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:10.160]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All the Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.240]   your life, money, and travel, all while spending less and saving more.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.360]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you on
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.880]   my journey to find all the hacks.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.240]   And today I want to talk about getting a deal when you're buying a car.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.600]   My wife, Amy, and I had our first child last year and with parents in town, we
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.840]   quickly realized that bigger cars in our future.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.440]   So before I go down that path, I want to learn everything there is to get a good
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.960]   deal, and this means deciding whether I go new or used, lease or buy, and getting
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.920]   the absolute best when negotiating.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.720]   So today I'm joined by Leanne Shattuck, aka The Car Chick.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.360]   She races cars, hosts the Straight Shift podcast, and most relevant to today, runs
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.160]   her own car buying service where she helps people get the best deals on a new or used
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.480]   car.
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.440]   So let's jump in.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.720]   Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.800]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions and
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.640]   do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.

[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.360]   Leanne, thank you for being here.
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.280]   Well, thanks for having me, Chris.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.600]   Definitely sounds like you have a lot of changes coming up in your life with the
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.880]   baby and everything else.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.360]   That's great.
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.320]   Congratulations.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.200]   Thank you.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.760]   Yeah, it turns out when you want to fit two adults, a dog, a baby and in-laws into a
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.080]   five-seater sedan, it just doesn't work.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.800]   Yeah, that's tougher than packing up a 1945 firetruck into crates to ship from South
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.280]   Carolina down to Florida, which is what I was doing this morning.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.560]   Oh, I have never had that problem, and I'm excited to hear more.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.000]   Yeah, can you tell us a little bit about how you got here?
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.480]   It is kind of a long, circuitous journey, but my love of cars began, I think, about
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.520]   age two.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.240]   That's when Disney had come out with the Herbie the Love Bug movies, and I fell in
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.600]   love with classic Volkswagens.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.320]   This is before I knew that they were not necessarily the most safe or reliable
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.600]   vehicle on the road, but as a two-year-old, they're cute and they were very
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.440]   recognizable, and our neighbors had one.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.800]   So it was kind of downhill after that, and I just always loved cars.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.960]   And my dad started teaching me high-performance driving skills when I was
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:31.120]   seven, and I got into racing and varying degrees of legality, which we won't talk
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.520]   about because I'm not sure the statute of limitations has yet expired, but got into
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.160]   it all legally eventually.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.640]   And cars are just my passion, but I saw how many people, women in particular, just
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.720]   would rather have a root canal than shop for a car.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.720]   They sometimes don't feel like the dealers treat them with the respect that they
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.960]   deserve, or they get overwhelmed by all the different makes and models on the
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.800]   market, or they just don't like the haggling back and forth, because cars are
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.040]   one of the few products that we haggle over in American society at any rate.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.280]   We're not used to doing that in the markets every day like they do in Europe
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.280]   and many other countries.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.520]   So it's just, for many people, it's a frustrating and stressful process, and I
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.720]   think it should be fun and exciting because getting a new car, oh my gosh, is
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.160]   there a few things more exciting than that, in my opinion.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.520]   So I came up with a way to take the stress out of it and pay people money in
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.240]   the meantime.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.680]   Yeah, I mean, buying a car is probably one of the few, outside of a home, one of
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.600]   the biggest purchases people make, and we make it multiple times.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.640]   So I think having the skills to do that right is really important.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.960]   So before we start, I'm curious, is there a thing that you think is one of the
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.360]   biggest misconceptions that people have when it comes to buying a car?
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:53.000]   Oh gosh, there are so many of those, but one of the ones that I see frequently is
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.800]   that people think that, "Oh, I can pay cash.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.720]   I'll get a better deal."
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:04.320]   And maybe back in the 60s and 70s, that was true, but because the dealers make a
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.320]   little bit of a commission from the banks on the back end, even if it's through
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.000]   their captive finance company, you can sometimes actually get a better deal if
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.920]   you finance.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.480]   So that's one of the things that I still hear today, "Oh, I should be able to get
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.840]   a better deal because I'm paying cash."
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.960]   I'm like, "Well, actually, no, you won't."
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.920]   Yeah, I mean, maybe if you're buying it from someone on Craigslist, that's a
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.200]   bonus, but at a dealership, it sounds like it's not.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.400]   Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.560]   So I've heard you say buying a car is more of a process than an event, and so I
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.720]   thought what could be helpful is to just kind of walk through that process.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.000]   But it's a long process, there's a lot of things, and you've done so many great
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   episodes of your podcast to dive in.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.520]   So I figured maybe today we'll start with someone who's already decided what car
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.760]   they want, but are just now starting to think about whether they should buy it
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.520]   used or new.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.840]   How do you help someone who comes to you and can't make that decision think about
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.960]   it?
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.200]   I look at a lot of different things about their lifestyle because it's more than
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.920]   just saving money.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.840]   In most cases, yes, you can save money by buying a used car, but you're not going
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.360]   to get the full warranty on it.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.840]   How many miles does the car already have on it versus how many are you planning to
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.920]   put on it every year?
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:28.480]   If you are looking at putting 25,000, 30,000 miles on the car because you're in a
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.560]   sales position or you're a realtor, then you need to start with a car that is as
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.880]   new as possible.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.600]   Otherwise, you're not going to be able to keep it for five or six years.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.560]   You're going to blow through the miles and then it's going to start costing you a
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.440]   ton of money in repairs while you're still paying the monthly payments on the
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.960]   loan.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.160]   So you have to look very strategically at it.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.840]   It's not just how much money can I save up front, but then what is it going to
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.960]   look like keeping this car year after year after year?
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.560]   So if you're in sales, you just know that it's going to cost you more per year to
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.560]   drive because you're going to put more miles on that car and you don't want to be
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.640]   paying larger repair bills and making a $500 a month car payment at the same time.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.320]   That'll kill your budget right away.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.440]   So you just have to look strategically at what your lifestyle is like.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.840]   What do you need this four-wheeled tool to do for you to support that lifestyle and
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.480]   over what period of time?
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.600]   And it also depends on the car.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.320]   Some cars hold their value extremely well.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.880]   Others, that initial depreciation is a lot higher.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.360]   So yeah, let's save $10,000 and get one that's only a couple of years old.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.640]   But that's just not true for every make and model.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.880]   And it also depends on what's going on in the market.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.000]   Right now, whole different ballgame right now with the inventory shortage.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.320]   But on average, not every car depreciates in the same way.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.280]   Let's just put it that way.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.440]   Is that more driven by the manufacturer or the car type?
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.400]   Is it like trucks depreciate differently than sedans or is it just varies
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.800]   manufacturer to manufacturer?
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.000]   It's actually a little bit of both.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.520]   So trucks will have a different depreciation because they're used in the work
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.200]   environment. But it can also vary from manufacturer to manufacturer.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.320]   Cars that are more reliable or at least the perception of the general public is that
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.120]   they're more reliable will hold their value better.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.760]   Cars that were a lot more expensive to begin with.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:33.080]   So a lot of your highline cars, your BMWs, your Mercedes, especially the super
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:38.040]   expensive ones that are maybe $80,000 to $100,000 new, those are going to have a
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.920]   higher initial depreciation because you can either afford a $100,000 car or you
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.440]   can't. So there's not a lot.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.960]   And the people that can't afford them do buy them new because they want a new one
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.320]   and they can afford it and all the power to them.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.600]   Great. But then it goes on to the secondary market.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.680]   And now you're into a completely different demographic looking at that vehicle used.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.280]   So they tend to have a higher depreciation.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.000]   But Cadillac Escalades have one of the highest depreciations of any car.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.400]   Anything made by Toyota is going to hold its value a lot better.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:13.680]   Is there a site, is it Consumer Reports or somewhere that you can kind of easily look
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.680]   up the reliability of cars in kind of an easy way?
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:24.040]   Easy is a relative term, but I do love Consumer Reports as a research tool because
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.640]   it is self-funded.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.320]   It's not funded by advertising.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.280]   So you can trust their information.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.120]   And they also gather the information from actual owners.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.480]   I don't know if you've ever had one of those surveys sent to you about your car.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.440]   I filled out a million of them, I think, over the years.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.760]   And so they're getting that feedback from actual owners.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.400]   You still have to take it a little bit with a grain of salt because there are some
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.840]   cars, especially your more economical vehicles, that are cheap or new.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:57.040]   Sometimes they get a bad rap for bad reliability when really it's the people that
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.400]   are buying the cheaper cars are not maintaining them properly.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.040]   So, yes, they break down, but that's because they skimped on the maintenance.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.920]   So you kind of have to look at it with a grain of salt.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:13.520]   But I have found also just Googling problems with your make and model will bring up a
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.280]   lot. And there's a great site called CarComplaints.com.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.760]   That correlates a lot of that data and some of the information that they have is not
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.080]   necessarily reflected in other places in the industry.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.200]   So sometimes you can find some little interesting quirks about cars on that.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.120]   It's not as easy to weed through all their data, but the data is there.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.920]   And that's one of the sites that I use for research.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:41.240]   That's great. One of the other things I think that happened when we had a child or at
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.400]   least we're planning for it was, you know, I was always someone who wanted the best
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.400]   deal. So we drove a 3 Series BMW for almost 13 years and I didn't want to get rid of
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.160]   it. It hadn't even hit 100,000 miles.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.080]   We barely drove it.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.840]   And then my wife said, you know, we're having a child.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.080]   Do we really want to own a 15, 16 year old car?
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:03.240]   And so ultimately the decision was, yes, there are a lot of used cars that are really
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:10.000]   old. I found that the safety features of cars in the last five years is far and above
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.800]   better than the safety features of a 15, 20 year old car.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.520]   Is that is my finding kind of accurate?
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:20.400]   Is there a point in time at which cars got a lot better in the last few decades?
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.480]   Yeah, absolutely. You're spot on.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.480]   And it's not even in the last 15 years.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.200]   It's really been in the last six or seven years.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:32.840]   The new safety aids, which are some of the most desirable features on cars today,
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.800]   everybody wants them, except me.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.160]   Those driver safety aids and my driving style just don't get along.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.480]   But that's a different story.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:45.520]   But the lane keeping, the emergency braking, I call them electronic babysitters.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:51.280]   But they are the building blocks for the self-driving cars that are coming down the
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:56.800]   line. And they are good because the reality is most people suck at driving.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.640]   Sorry to say it, folks, but we're so much more distracted and our roads are getting
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:06.560]   more congested. So having the car kind of given you that safety net, if you're just
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.720]   not quite paying attention or the kid is in the back seat screaming at you, you can't
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.200]   not be distracted by that.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.640]   The car can hopefully save you from rear-ending the guy in front of you.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:23.880]   And those technologies started to come out in what I would call your average consumer
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:29.040]   models, your Hondas, your Toyotas, your Hyundais, the affordable cars, in about 2016.
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:33.480]   And they also started rolling out your Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, some of that
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.040]   smartphone integration, which is also popular.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:43.600]   And so if you want those technologies, that factors into your new versus used.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:49.040]   Because for many of those, depending on the manufacturer, it might be 2018 when a lot
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.320]   of that was rolled out in the model you're looking at.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:56.640]   So, yeah, you can save a lot more money by going with a 2016 or 2017, but you're giving
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.280]   up these driver safety aids that might be important to you.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:04.520]   So really looking at when did a certain feature that you want to get implemented in
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.160]   that car absolutely factors into your new and used equation.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:15.560]   Wow. OK, so newer car for safety and technology, older car could be a deal, but
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.520]   know what you're missing.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:23.160]   Exactly. So you briefly touched on what's going on right now in the world in 2021.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.840]   And my understanding is the residual effects of COVID on manufacturing and there's a
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.880]   global shortage of semiconductor chips, which cars need.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.320]   There's a big shortage.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.920]   How is this affecting things?
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.680]   Does this change new versus used?
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.960]   Or I feel like you know this better than almost anyone.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:44.680]   Yeah. And I'll tell you what, it's been driving me crazy even for the last couple of
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:49.640]   months because there is a shortage of new cars.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:53.880]   The manufacturers are not able to spit out as many because, like you said, they don't
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.640]   have enough computer chips to actually build them.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:01.120]   Some of the manufacturers like Ford, they've been building these cars, especially the
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.080]   trucks and the SUVs that have a lot of fancier features.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.680]   So they need even more computer chips.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:11.560]   They're assembling the cars without those components and then parking them on a
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:15.160]   supply lot somewhere out by a factory.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.440]   And they're just sitting there waiting until they get the shipments of chips that they
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:24.040]   can then add in all those electronics components and actually finish building the
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.640]   car, which is a scary thought.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.840]   So a lot of people haven't been able to find the new car that they want.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.880]   So now they're looking at the slightly used ones.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:32.960]   Well, what does that do?
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.120]   That drives up the demand for the used cars.
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.640]   But there's also a supply shortage there because people have been extending their
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:46.120]   leases. They haven't been turning over the people that would normally lease a new car
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.080]   every few years.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.880]   Well, they can't get the new cars, so they extended their lease.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.440]   They're not turning in that leased car.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.160]   So now the supply of three-year-old cars is low.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.520]   So it's really a big mess right now.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:02.040]   So the car buying strategies that I teach people, they all still apply, but you kind
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.360]   of have to take it to the Olympic level now.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.760]   And it's just like jockeying.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.800]   It's like when we were trying to get the last packet of toilet paper last year.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.400]   It's now cars are the toilet paper.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:18.040]   And so you're just jockeying, trying to get your hands on the one car.
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:22.960]   I've literally been buying cars that as soon as the truck shows up at the
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.000]   dealership and the dealer calls me, I'm like, yes, we'll take that one.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.440]   So they're selling stuff before it even arrives on their lot.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.720]   I can't even find cars to test drive for some people, depending on what it is they're
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.680]   looking at. It's crazy.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:41.000]   Does that mean if you want to test drive and you probably don't have a chance with new
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.120]   cars, so you might have you thought of should people like rent a car on Turo or
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.160]   something just so they can see how the car drives so that they're ready to pull the
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:48.560]   trigger?
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:53.760]   That's actually not a bad idea in cities that have those options where you
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.760]   can rent a car from a private party that owns that car.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:58.920]   That's kind of renting it out.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:02.840]   It's sort of like, I guess, the Airbnb of cars that can be an option.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.280]   In some cases, I've actually had to have clients that I bought one car.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:10.840]   And this is happening a lot on, for example, like the Kia Telluride, most popular SUV
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.640]   out there and has been since they came out a couple of years ago.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:17.280]   But now trying to get one, I have one client that wants one.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.320]   And I actually asked another client that I got one for last month if he could come see
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:21.800]   her car.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.120]   Wow.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.480]   Yeah, it was like, well, my neighbor has one.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.520]   Maybe they'll let me drive theirs.
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.840]   Let's call and ask.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.680]   Wow.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:34.160]   You have to get really creative right now if you want one of the cars that's just hot,
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:39.120]   hot on the market and they're pre-sold a couple of months in advance.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:43.600]   And I assume creative includes things like you might not get the color you want, the
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.400]   options you want.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.360]   You might have to drive to pick it up or fly to pick it up.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.920]   Yeah, I have been transporting more cars across state lines.
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:57.200]   You know, I have a client in Nebraska and we bought a car for her in Illinois and we
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.400]   shipped it across.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.560]   I've been doing so much of that.
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.200]   And fortunately, I have a good relationship with a good auto transport company that does
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.120]   a great job with that.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:10.480]   But I have ordered and transported across state lines more cars in the last year than
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.720]   I have in the last 15.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.640]   Wow, that's crazy.
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.680]   It's just nuts.
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:19.960]   Someone told me that you've got to find the things that you can deal with, like color
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:20.560]   right now.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:25.560]   And the one question that I just didn't know the answer to is, is it easy to change the
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.280]   color of a car?
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:30.560]   Like if I find the perfect car and it's red and I just want a black car, do I just buy
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.920]   the red car and paint it?
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.920]   Is that a better deal than waiting for the black car to come up?
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.840]   Or is that like a terrible idea because of all the coating they put on cars these days
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.880]   that it's going to end up being really expensive?
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.000]   Anything can be done if you throw enough money at it.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.440]   But here's the thing about painting a new car.
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:54.560]   Once you paint a car, you have destroyed the resale value because now it looks like the
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.440]   car's been wrecked.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.920]   Like, why did you repaint this car?
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.400]   It destroys the resale value.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.280]   So you might consider something like a wrap.
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.800]   You can get really cool vehicle wraps.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.320]   Again, not inexpensive in any way, shape or form.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:12.040]   You're going to drop, you could drop as much as, you know, three to ten grand, depending
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.800]   on how crazy a wrap you want.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.400]   But that's a way to get a different color.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.320]   It's not going to look the same as paint.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:25.240]   But if you want something that's just kind of interesting or funky or just different,
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.680]   yeah, you can wrap the car and then that doesn't hurt its resale value because the wrap
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.600]   just comes right off.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.600]   But you can paint it if you want.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.720]   Just be aware that you've killed the resale value.
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.680]   And if you've leased the car, they will definitely frown upon that.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:43.200]   OK, so I'll separate the new versus used.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.600]   And I have a couple of questions on each.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:51.640]   New seems to be a place where dealers are where you get new cars.
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:57.880]   So it at least seems a little easier and approachable as to where one of the if you
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:02.760]   wanted to buy a new car right now, do you have to reach out to four dealers, ten
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.280]   dealers, all the dealers?
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.720]   Is there a way to reach out to every dealer or see inventory everywhere?
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:11.160]   Or how do people start to think about finding a new car?
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.800]   You know, right now, I know it's hard, but even in the future.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:20.760]   Sure. Even in normal times, if we ever go back to something that's normal, you should
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:26.400]   always shop around to at least three or four different new car dealers just to find the
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:31.920]   best deal. That's how you're going to make sure that you get the best end to end deal
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.120]   because they all have different pricing strategies.
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.680]   Some may put accessories on the car.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:42.360]   Some might not. There's really eight areas in any car deal where the dealer tries to
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.160]   make money off of you. So you've got to look out for yourself in all of those areas,
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:51.000]   not just negotiating the price of the actual vehicle that you're buying.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.720]   It's a there's more variables in that equation than most people think.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:19:00.680]   Right now, you may have to look at every dealer in your city.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.280]   Now, here, for example, in Charlotte, we've probably got nine Toyota stores within a
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:09.080]   forty five minute radius of the city of Charlotte.
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.360]   You may have to go further out.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:19.400]   I have been literally looking at cars within probably a two to three hundred mile radius
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.080]   trying to find exactly what the client wants.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:28.560]   In normal times, let's say you want the black car, but the dealer doesn't have a black
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.560]   car and you're not going to take the red car.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.600]   Dealers do what is called dealer trading.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.800]   They will play musical inventory with each other.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:40.960]   Each dealership has a network of other dealers that are trading partners and they'll
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.920]   call each other up and be like, hey, dude, you know, you got this black one.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.720]   Can we have it? We'll give you this blue one.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.680]   And they do that all the time.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.920]   It's a standard in the industry.
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:53.800]   And so if your dealer doesn't have the car you want, you can see if they can trade for
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:54.960]   it with another dealer.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:59.000]   That way you're still buying from your local guy, which is more convenient for you.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:03.960]   And of course, obviously, that dealer wants to make the sale to you, but it just gives
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.160]   them access to more inventory.
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:10.440]   Nowadays, what's happening in the industry with the lack of inventory, dealers are not
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.040]   trading with each other very much.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.120]   It's very difficult to make that happen.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:19.560]   So you, as the car shopper, must look at all the inventory out there.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:25.720]   And while your sites like Autotrader, Cars.com, you can shop for new cars there.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:32.240]   Just keep in mind that the cars that are listed on there may not actually be available.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:37.320]   That car may have already sold and it just takes a while for it to fall off of that
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:43.920]   conglomerate site, or it might not be here yet, or it may be in transit to the
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.480]   dealership, but somebody else already has a deposit on it.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.760]   So you just you have to call around.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:53.480]   So, for example, I have a client here in Charlotte that just on Saturday took delivery
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:21:01.040]   of his brand new, red, he wanted the red one, Mazda CX-9, and it was the Grand Touring
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.920]   trim. Nobody had a red one.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.520]   The red with the tan interior is the most popular color for that car.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.240]   And there were just there were none.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:16.080]   I didn't see any in the production pipeline, didn't see any on the water, nothing.
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:20.840]   We couldn't do a dealer trade for it, just on a whim as a last ditch effort.
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:25.200]   So we didn't have to take a blue one that was coming into the port in Wilmington.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.560]   I'm like, I'm just going to look one more time.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:32.080]   And I found one on the website of a dealership in Winston-Salem, which is only two
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.600]   hours away. I'm like, oh, that has to be pre-sold.
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.720]   And they were hiding it in the production system.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.280]   But I called. They're like, yeah, it should be here any day now.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.760]   It's not pre-sold.
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:41.720]   I said, it is now.
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.760]   Here's the credit card number for the deposit.
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.240]   So, you know, it just took calling around.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:53.120]   Literally, I probably called 30 Mazda stores to find a car for this client, whereas
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.000]   before I would have had to have called three.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.920]   And is calling the move or is email ever more effective?
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.480]   No, email is usually not as effective.
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:06.320]   You end up on the mailing list of every dealership in the country, which is and
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.440]   hitting the unsubscribe button doesn't seem to help.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.760]   But for me, I am also calling the general manager.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.640]   I'm calling the top boss in the dealership.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.720]   I'm not talking to a salesperson.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.720]   I go straight to the top of the food chain and have that conversation.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:23.200]   And that gets me more places.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.380]   Yeah.
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.480]   And but I have a different relationship because I'm inside the industry.
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:28.960]   So I'm inside the boys club.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:29.720]   I speak their language.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.960]   They know who I am so I can make those phone calls.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.200]   Yeah, I have cell phone numbers.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:40.280]   What about those sites like Trucar, Costco's auto buying program?
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.240]   Are those useful in general?
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.040]   Useful now?
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:48.400]   I personally don't find them to be particularly useful.
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.280]   You have to any of those sites.
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:56.560]   Really, they are advertising sites for the dealerships.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:04.040]   So, yes, they may have a prearranged pricing deal with one or two dealers in
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:04.800]   your area.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:09.880]   That prearranged relationship may or may not be the best available deal in the
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.880]   market currently.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.880]   And there's a lot of fine print that you have to understand.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:20.360]   If they don't have the exact make model, the exact options, the exact colors that
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.280]   you want, they don't have to honor that price.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:28.640]   There's a lot of loopholes in those contracts for the dealers to not be
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.440]   required to honor that price that was displayed on the website to you.
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:37.760]   And you're still on your own with your trade, your financing, all those other
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.960]   areas in the deal where the dealer makes money off of you.
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.320]   And it doesn't include dealer installed accessories.
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:49.880]   There's just a lot of areas where if the dealer is giving you a good price
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.200]   through that website, they are making it up somewhere else.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:57.960]   So that's why I personally don't find them helpful, because it's just maybe it
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.920]   maybe gives you five to 10 percent of the whole puzzle.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:04.920]   OK, and so we talked about a couple of sites.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:09.640]   You mentioned Kars.com changing gears to used cars.
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:14.920]   I feel like there's a lot more places to buy a used car than a new car.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.520]   And that could be Craigslist.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:21.800]   It could be all these new kind of car sites like Carvana.
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.360]   It could be dealer inventory.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.880]   Is there a place that searches all of them?
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.680]   Do you have to do it all yourself?
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:32.600]   There's not one site that searches absolutely everything.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:37.000]   Your bigger sites like Autotrader and Kars.com, that's going to give you used
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.320]   cars at your franchise dealers, used cars at independent dealers.
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:45.400]   And not every dealership has a relationship with both of those companies.
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:49.320]   So sometimes I'll see things on Kars.com that I didn't see on Autotrader.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.040]   So I look at both.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:57.400]   You can see cars that are for sale by owner, and you'll usually get the better
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:00.640]   cars that are for sale by owner will be on those sites because you actually have
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.040]   to pay to advertise them.
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.840]   You know, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, those are free to
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:06.680]   advertise.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:12.760]   And so there's a lot of junk out there, and there's a lot of scammers out there.
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:19.120]   Facebook Marketplace is, I swear, there are probably 20% of the cars listed there
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:19.800]   are scammers.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.400]   So you really have to be careful.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:28.880]   And if you see in the description, don't chat me, I don't respond to chats, email
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:34.120]   this person and said, I'm selling the car for my aunt, my sister, my mother, 100%
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:34.640]   scam.
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:41.840]   Never ever communicate with a seller outside of that platform, because that
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:42.840]   means that they're not legit.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:46.000]   If you have some conversations via that platform, and then you start texting each
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.280]   other, you know, after you verified that you're both real, that's perfectly fine.
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.840]   But if it says in the description, don't chat me, I'm selling it for my aunt,
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.120]   send her this email, that is a 100% scam.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.840]   So you just have to be careful.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:03.440]   But depending on the price of the car that you're looking at, the more expensive
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.720]   cars, you know, are going to be advertised on autotradercars.com.
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:11.480]   If you're selling a car for 20 grand, it's okay to pay, you know, 30, 40 bucks
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.320]   to advertise it.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:16.280]   If you're selling a $5,000 car, yeah, stick to Craigslist and Facebook
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.040]   Marketplace.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:22.480]   You know, for cities that still actually have classified ads in the paper
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:27.000]   newspaper, you can find some gems in there if you're looking for an
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.920]   inexpensive car, because the older crowd, you're retired folks, not all of them
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.960]   are on Marketplace or Craigslist yet.
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:37.440]   They're still very old school and still they're still advertising that car that
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.880]   they drove on Sundays only.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:43.720]   That's in fantastic condition, they might advertise it still in the paper.
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.440]   Here in Charlotte, we don't have classifieds anymore.
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.840]   I found that I was like, there's no classifieds.
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.760]   So, that's a dying thing.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.720]   But if you still live in a town that has newspaper classifieds and you need
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.240]   something cheap, take a look there first.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.760]   You might find that diamond in the rough.
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:58.760]   Wow.
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:05.560]   What about CarMax and Carvana and some of these like used car non-dealer kind of
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:08.360]   marketplaces or not marketplaces, but sales companies?
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.080]   Well, they are dealerships.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.760]   They're independent dealerships.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.680]   So, they just have a little bit of a different model.
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.680]   You know, CarMax is the physical locations.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.400]   They were the first ones that really came into the industry and said, you
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.440]   know what, people hate haggling, we're going to have a no haggle model.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:26.200]   That doesn't mean the car is a good deal.
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:30.080]   They actually, their profit margin per vehicle is actually way higher than most
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:38.480]   dealerships, but now we're seeing a new model of the online only dealerships.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.800]   They don't have a physical lot.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.200]   You can't go look at the car.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:46.200]   And while I'm perfectly comfortable buying a lot of products, you know, off of, you
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.360]   know, Amazon, off the internet and having it delivered to my house, and if it takes
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.440]   more than two days, I get pissed.
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:55.800]   A car, you have to understand when you're buying from one of these dealerships, you
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.480]   don't even get to test drive it.
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:02.400]   You don't even get to see it until after you've already bought it.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:09.640]   Now they have a caveat in there that says you have five days or seven days to return
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:16.320]   it, be sure that you already have a pre-purchase inspection appointment
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:21.560]   scheduled with your mechanic within that window so that if you take that car, they
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.720]   bring it to your house, they drop it off the truck, you know, you've signed the
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.960]   paperwork, it's yours.
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:31.040]   You've only got a few days to get that car inspected, and if the mechanic finds a big
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:35.560]   problem with it that you can't live with, you've got to hurry up and get through that
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:39.400]   return process before that very short time window expires.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:45.720]   And they're counting on 95% of the people not doing that, but it violates, you know,
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:51.800]   one of my absolute just hard, fast rules in my world is you do not buy a used car
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.880]   without a pre-purchase inspection.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:57.760]   You know, unless it's, you know, six months old and has 3,000 miles and it's
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.240]   certified pre-owned from the dealership down the road and you can go look at it, you
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:02.560]   need a pre-purchase inspection.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:07.920]   So, I really applaud their business model, it's a fantastic business model, but you
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:12.240]   can, you're taking on increased risk and you need to take the steps to mitigate those
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.880]   risks by booking that pre-purchase inspection within that window and getting it done.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:20.440]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.160]   I get it.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:26.360]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:26.760]   hang.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:30.800]   So, kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:36.160]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app for
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.240]   drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.280]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.120]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:47.520]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.040]   want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:54.680]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:59.080]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:29:59.600]   yours.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:03.560]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:06.840]   selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.160]   So, when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:14.760]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.840]   I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:22.840]   So, whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:26.760]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:30.120]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:35.960]   Yeah, and if you're buying a car from a dealer out of state, I assume you don't get
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:36.680]   a refund.
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:40.480]   Can you do these kind of pre-purchase inspections remotely?
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.040]   Is there any easy way to make that happen?
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.080]   Oh, yes, there is.
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:48.160]   There is a wonderful third-party company that I have been working with since they
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:48.880]   started.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:52.560]   The original founder of that company started the company.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:58.200]   I found him and he built a lot of his processes around what I needed, so I was
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.080]   really grateful.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.640]   He's since sold the company.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.920]   It's called the Lemon Squad.
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.240]   Okay, best branding ever, right?
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:09.920]   And you can just go online and they have a network of ASE certified mechanics that
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.360]   they send out to do the inspections.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.720]   I have used them successfully from New York to California.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.360]   I think it's a great company.
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.640]   There are other companies that do the same thing.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:22.160]   I just knew the owner, Andy, and their branding's great.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:25.480]   So, I have sent them to look at cars in New York.
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:28.360]   I've sent them to look at cars in California and everywhere in between.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:33.160]   There has not been a small town in the middle of nowhere USA that they have not
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.600]   been able to get a technician to.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:38.400]   They've had to charge extra in some cases because the technician had to drive an
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.840]   hour and a half out into a cornfield to see the car, but they got it done.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.360]   So, it can be done remotely.
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.600]   There's a lot out there if you just know where to go.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:53.440]   And for someone who's never done a pre-purchase inspection, is this like $100,
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:53.880]   $500?
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:57.120]   What's a ballpark cost for getting a car inspected?
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:02.920]   If you take it to your local mechanic at home, they may charge anywhere from, you
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.960]   know, $90 to $120.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.000]   It's usually around an hour of labor.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.320]   The companies like the Lemon Squad, they charge more, but you don't have to go
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:12.720]   anywhere.
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:16.960]   They charge, I think they charge maybe $170 or $180 for it.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:24.200]   I get a discount, so I only pay, I think, $130, but it's money well spent.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.080]   And they give you this great report.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:30.080]   They send you 4 million pictures, half of which you as an average person might not
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.200]   even know what it is.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.360]   Sometimes I'm looking, I'm like, "What is that?
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:36.360]   Oh, that's the backside of the exhaust manifold.
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:38.000]   OK, no rust on it.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:38.360]   Yay."
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:41.680]   So, they're very, very detailed.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.360]   Nice.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:49.200]   And a few others, is the certified pre-owned, is that a thing worth paying
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:49.440]   for?
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:55.280]   I remember when I bought my car maybe 15 years ago, there were some CPO cars on
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.440]   a lot and some non.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:03.080]   How important is looking at the certified pre-owned kind of label on a used car?
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.520]   The certified pre-owned does a few things for you.
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:11.520]   It means that it met a set of standards for that manufacturer.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:15.520]   What you have to understand is that doesn't mean the car is perfect.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:20.720]   It doesn't necessarily mean that the car has not been in an accident.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:26.480]   Each manufacturer has different parameters for what they will allow on a
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.560]   certified pre-owned.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:35.280]   So, for example, with Subaru, most of them have 150 odd things that they look at.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:41.080]   But, for example, it can bend in an accident, but you can't have the accident
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:44.440]   effect more than two body panels.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:49.120]   So, maybe if a bumper and a quarter panel were fixed from the accident, that's
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:53.200]   still okay, but if it was a hood and a bumper and a quarter panel, then they
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.160]   can't certify it.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:59.320]   But each manufacturer is a little bit different, and it doesn't mean the car is
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.840]   going to be cosmetically perfect.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:08.960]   So, it's good to try and get your hands on what those inspection criteria are to
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.480]   know.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:16.040]   And it gives you a certain amount of extended factory-backed warranty beyond
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.760]   the original factory warranty.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.400]   But, again, that varies by manufacturer.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.280]   So, a couple of certified pre-owned programs that I think are absolutely
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:30.800]   worth it, Hyundai and Kia, if you buy one brand new, you get the full five-year,
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.600]   60,000, what we call bumper-to-bumper.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.720]   The lawyers don't let the dealers call it that anymore, but for you and me,
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:37.520]   bumper-to-bumper.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:41.200]   But you get the 10 years or 100,000 miles on the powertrain.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:44.520]   That's your engine, your transmission, the expensive stuff that makes the car go
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:45.160]   back and forth.
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:50.280]   If you are the second owner, if you buy one used, you don't get that 10, 100
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:50.920]   powertrain.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:56.200]   You only get the five-year, 60,000, unless it's certified pre-owned.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.080]   Then you get that 10, 100,000 back.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.920]   That's absolutely worth it.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:08.160]   Audi, for example, you only get one year extra, but you get unlimited miles.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:12.160]   So, if you drive a lot of miles every year, that's maybe worth it to you.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:16.600]   There are dealers up in New York that they don't certify any of their Audis.
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:20.320]   Even though they could, the car's perfectly good shape would meet the
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.640]   certification criteria.
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:25.120]   But the dealers in New York are like, "We don't need the mileage.
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:25.920]   We need the time.
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.840]   Everybody goes to work on the subway."
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.400]   You know, they only put 3,000 miles a year on the car.
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:35.880]   So, it's not worth the nearly $2,000 that that certification costs.
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:39.960]   Audi certification is more expensive than, say, Honda's certification or
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.120]   Hyundai's certification.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:46.200]   So, you have to look at what you get with that certified pre-owned warranty
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.040]   because it varies dramatically across manufacturer.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:52.800]   And then see, "Okay, how much extra am I paying for that?
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:56.480]   And is that worth it to you based on how you're going to use that car?"
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.840]   But it's absolutely worth it with Hyundai and Kia.
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:03.520]   Lexus, Audi, and Porsche give you unlimited miles.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.960]   So, if you drive a lot, it can totally be worth it on those.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.160]   Toyota, it's like, "Eh, that's nice."
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.240]   But, you know, it's a Toyota.
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.120]   It's not going to break anyway.
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:11.800]   So... (laughs)
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:15.640]   Are there any hacks for finding cars?
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:16.640]   Is it auctions?
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:19.920]   Is it getting on a list for dealer demos that are coming up?
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.160]   Are there things that you won't find on the internet that are worth pursuing
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:27.640]   to try to get a car before everyone else, especially right now?
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.360]   Auctions.
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.640]   Most auctions are not open to the public.
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:36.680]   The auctions that are open to the public are pretty scary.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:37.840]   (laughs)
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.680]   Those are the cars that the dealers, nobody wanted those.
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.560]   So, you're basically getting, you know, the bottom of the barrel.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.880]   You know, police auctions, all that stuff is as-is.
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:50.040]   And so, unless you're very mechanically inclined,
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.880]   that's just the risk of getting something there
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.520]   is you're not going to get anything good.
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.760]   It's going to take a lot of work.
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:02.080]   So, right now, really, it's about making phone calls
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:06.440]   and just pounding the pavement until you can find something
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:10.040]   and build a good relationship with the dealer so that you're saying,
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:12.440]   "Okay, you know, you don't have it on your lot right now,
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:15.480]   but you've placed an order for one of these.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:18.240]   It's supposed to be coming in sometime next month.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.160]   Get your name on that car.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:23.320]   Pay that deposit so that they pre-sell it to you."
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.240]   It really is pounding the pavement.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:27.640]   I've got some different relationships because, for me,
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.160]   it's an ongoing relationship.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.640]   I've been working with some of these dealers for nearly 20 years.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:35.480]   So, a couple of weeks ago, when one of my Telluride clients,
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:40.960]   we had very specific, she wanted the EX Premium
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.560]   with the captain's chairs in the wolf gray
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:46.440]   with the new nightfall package and all-wheel drive.
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:47.760]   Very specific.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.240]   And I just knew we were going to have to order one.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:53.400]   But one of my dealers called me and said,
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:56.160]   "I have exactly the car that you want."
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.000]   It arrived this morning.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.560]   The person who placed the order backed out of the deal at the last minute.
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.560]   Do you want it?
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:05.720]   You can have it without any markups or any dealer add-ons.
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:08.720]   And I said, "Yes, send me the paperwork."
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:13.080]   But I've known that dealer for 15 years.
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.160]   So, for the rest of the world,
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.200]   you just have to pound the pavement right now.
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:20.240]   And you may need to look at private party sales.
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.920]   A lot of people are like,
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.240]   "Hey, I can get some good money for my car right now."
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:28.040]   But I tell you what, Carvana and Vroom and those online dealers,
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:31.400]   because they're not getting the cars from the rental fleets,
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.120]   which usually make up the bulk of their inventory,
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:37.520]   they are putting some crazy money.
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:40.400]   So, if you've got a car that you don't really drive a whole lot,
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.280]   and you're like, "Eh, maybe I'll sell that."
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:43.560]   Now is the time to do it.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.480]   You can make some great money
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:48.480]   by selling that car that you don't necessarily need.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.560]   Yeah, so sell your second cars if you don't need it.
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:52.560]   Right.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:55.000]   Right now, we're going the opposite direction.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.200]   We're like, "Oh, we have a kid, a dog,
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.000]   and people coming into town to visit the kid.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.360]   Maybe we need two cars?"
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.920]   I'm scared, but maybe we just sell the car and get a bigger car.
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.400]   There you go. That might be the more economical thing to do.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.680]   While you can get great money for your trade-in,
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:11.720]   you may have to apply that extra money to the new car that you're buying
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:13.400]   because the pricing has just shifted.
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:19.080]   Yeah, so once you find the car, you're like, "Okay, I found the car."
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.800]   I feel like there's two big questions for me.
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.440]   One is, "Are you leasing or buying it?"
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:28.440]   And then two is, "What's the price and negotiating?"
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:31.400]   Do you want to make one of those decisions before the other?
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:34.280]   Do you want to negotiate it and then decide lease or buy?
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.200]   Or do you have to make the lease or buy first?
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.440]   I approach...
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:41.480]   I don't like to tell the dealers that it's a lease
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.120]   because when they hear that you want a lease,
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.960]   all they're going to give you is that monthly payment.
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:49.160]   They think that that's all that matters to you
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.080]   and they're not going to give you any of the other numbers.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:54.600]   So I always negotiate the price of the car first.
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:59.320]   But keep in mind, some of the incentives from the manufacturer
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:02.360]   only apply to leasing or only apply to purchasing.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:06.520]   So that final negotiated price may be different.
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.440]   But you bring that into the game later.
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:10.040]   I always negotiate the price.
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.280]   But I've done my research ahead of time
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.440]   so I know which rebates apply to leasing
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.440]   and which ones only apply to purchasing.
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:18.680]   So I'll go through that process,
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:21.560]   do some additional math on my own,
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.600]   and then go to the dealer and say,
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:25.240]   "Hey, let's look and see what that looks like on a lease."
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.360]   But if you don't negotiate that upfront,
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.640]   that lease that they give you is going to be based on full price.
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.000]   Wow.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.080]   And how does the average person negotiate the price?
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:43.240]   Does it go online and look at the value on Edmunds or another site?
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.560]   Is it working with the dealer?
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:46.920]   Are there tricks to get it done?
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.800]   I've helped friends negotiate cars
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:53.800]   and I felt like I was a little clueless going in there with information.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.960]   There's a couple different steps.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.480]   You start with doing your homework.
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:02.360]   And that is researching what, more or less, price you should pay.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.320]   Edmunds is great.
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.560]   You want to look at, "Okay, what's the MSRP?"
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.640]   Then what's invoice price?
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:11.400]   And the advertised invoice price varies a little bit.
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.000]   It may not be 100% accurate
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.280]   because there are things like advertising money
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:20.040]   and some things like that that may come into play and may vary by region.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:23.720]   But you can get a good idea of what the bottom line price is.
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:26.360]   You need to see what types of incentives are there.
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.560]   Are there rebates?
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:30.440]   So, I research it on sites like Edmunds.
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:34.520]   I also go to the manufacturer's website directly to see what they advertise.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:40.040]   And you can get about 75% of the information you need
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:44.120]   to effectively negotiate the price of a new car on those sites.
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.960]   I have access to additional information.
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:49.160]   So, I know some of the incentives that are secret,
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:51.960]   that go back and forth between the manufacturer and the dealer,
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.960]   that the dealer may not tell you about.
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:59.640]   That's when step two comes in, and that is shopping around.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:04.760]   As I said before, you need to shop to at least three or four different dealers
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.880]   to see just how low can you get them.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:10.440]   You just kind of make the rounds, make the rounds,
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:11.880]   and let them know you're shopping around
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:15.000]   and whoever gives you the best bottom line price.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.680]   But in the process of doing that,
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:20.680]   be sure you're asking them for a full numbers breakdown.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:24.280]   They will just send you the price of the car.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:26.600]   And then when you get into the dealership,
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:31.640]   you realize they've added on, you know, $2,000 worth of BS accessories,
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:34.680]   you know, window tints, and paint protection,
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:36.520]   and all that stuff that you didn't want.
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.760]   And their dock fee.
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.920]   And then you get into the taxes and tags.
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:45.320]   So there's a lot of areas that the dealer can add on money.
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:49.480]   So they may have shown you a really low price for that car that you want,
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:53.800]   but that's because they are adding on a bunch of junk
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:56.280]   to the sale when you actually get in the door.
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.000]   So always ask for that numbers breakdown
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.280]   and get what the industry calls the out-the-door price.
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:05.800]   Then, you know, then you can compare apples to apples,
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:10.520]   because until then, one dealership may be offering you a price that's $2,000 less,
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.120]   and you're like, "Wow, that's a great deal."
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:14.280]   And you run into that dealership to close the deal,
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:17.800]   but they added $4,000 worth of junk to the car that you didn't need to pay for.
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:20.200]   Yeah, never good.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:24.120]   Are there things that are more negotiable, right?
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:28.440]   If you do want some add-on accessories,
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:33.400]   are those much more negotiable than, you know, getting far below invoice?
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.640]   They can be.
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:39.080]   It just really depends on how you're structuring the overall deal.
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:44.520]   A lot of people ask a dealer to, "Hey, will you throw in a maintenance plan?
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.760]   Will you throw in rubber floor mats?
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:48.120]   Will you throw in..."
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.000]   Anytime you're asking the dealer to throw in something to the deal,
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.280]   that means that they had room in the deal to do that and still make money.
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:00.200]   So I work with my dealers very transparently.
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.120]   We just work in true bottom-line numbers.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:07.480]   So when I negotiate a deal on the car, that's our absolute bottom-line number.
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.720]   They're not just going to be able to throw in anything else
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:13.240]   because I've eliminated their entire profit margin on the price of the car.
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:17.320]   But they'll add on things like, "Hey, we want crossbars on the roof rails."
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:23.000]   Well, they'll do that at cost versus what the retail markup would be
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.640]   to add those accessories, things like that.
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:28.120]   You've really got to keep it all separate
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:30.920]   because they're going to listen to what's important to you.
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:33.960]   It's like, "Yeah, if they can throw in a $600 maintenance plan,
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:37.000]   that means there was still a whole lot of profit in your deal
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.240]   that you were leaving on the table to start with."
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:44.760]   Are there any things that when you just want to get that last little bit out of the deal
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:49.960]   that some people might not think to throw in that are worth throwing in?
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:55.800]   For me, I remember with my car, when you bought a BMW at least 15 years ago,
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.760]   you only got one key that could remotely unlock the car.
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:00.600]   And so I remember whenever I told anyone, I was like,
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.440]   "Look, if you're going to negotiate one thing at the end,
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:04.360]   try to get them to throw in a second key."
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:07.160]   Are there other things like that that people should...
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:11.560]   If they're at the end and they feel like they think they've got as much as they could,
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:13.480]   there's one more good thing to ask for?
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:16.440]   Fortunately, the cars come with two keys now.
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:19.400]   So you don't have to worry about getting that second key.
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:23.160]   Used cars don't always come with two keys, but new ones do.
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:27.560]   If there's something that I can usually get thrown in at the last minute,
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:28.840]   it'll be rubber floor mats.
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:29.960]   Yeah.
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.640]   Because they can usually get those.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.640]   They're usually about $100 cost,
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.600]   but they might be able to take them out of another car that's already on their lot
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:40.200]   and then replace them and then add the price onto theirs.
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:44.680]   So that's something that occasionally will get thrown in at the very last minute.
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:45.960]   It's like, "Can we get some rubber mats?"
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:49.320]   And is there a better time to do this?
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:53.160]   Is this like, do it in the fall, do it at the end of the month, do it at the end of the year?
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:57.640]   Depends on the market for the vehicle that you're looking for.
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:02.520]   And again, all this goes out the window this year.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:06.840]   So, you know, in a normal year, there are different times of year.
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:10.440]   Like July is usually the best month to buy new pickup trucks.
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:14.840]   That is not going to be true likely this July.
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:18.200]   You're gonna be lucky to find any pickup trucks that are still on the lots in this July.
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:20.760]   Waiting till the end of the month.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.680]   And I tell people don't wait until the last day to start this process.
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:27.000]   Because remember, this is a process, not an event.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.040]   Give yourself a couple of weeks to go through this whole process.
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:33.320]   But if you want to kind of get close to that last week of the month.
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:36.680]   So, like right now, we're recording this on, what, the 24th.
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:38.520]   You know, we got basically one week left.
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:42.280]   That's when you can start pulling a little more of that pressure.
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:43.880]   Because they're looking at their numbers going,
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:47.320]   "Okay, we're running out of time to make these quotas that we want to make."
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:55.560]   So, as a periodic car shopper, as a retail car shopper, that can be of an advantage to you.
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.160]   I don't have to play those games with them.
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:59.960]   Because I buy so many cars that I can get the same deal, usually.
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:03.880]   Now, you can wait till the second half of the month.
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:07.480]   Because the manufacturer is looking at their numbers.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:12.200]   And if they see, "Okay, we didn't do as much the first half of the month as we would like.
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:16.280]   So, we're gonna add another $500 rebate for the second half of the month."
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:19.080]   So, you may be able to get a little bit of a better price
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:23.080]   if the manufacturer sweetens the pot in the second half of the month.
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:27.160]   And then, this question that I've always wanted to know,
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:28.920]   and I've actually never been able to ask.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:33.880]   When you're at the dealership, back in times when we went in places in person more,
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:37.000]   and you negotiate the price and the guy says, "Let me get back to you."
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.520]   And goes into the office in the back.
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:39.960]   What? Do you know what's happening in there?
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:43.880]   Are they just talking and then coming back out?
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:45.320]   Did they already know what they were doing?
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:48.360]   They are going to their sales manager.
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:54.200]   The salesperson that you interact with is only allowed to
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:58.120]   give you so much of a discount off the price of the car.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:02.200]   So, when he says he has to go back and talk to his manager, that's actually true.
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.400]   And the conversation that they're having is,
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:07.800]   you know, he's telling his manager.
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:10.200]   He or she is telling the manager about the customer.
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.320]   Here's what's going on in the deal.
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:12.440]   Here's what's important to them.
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:14.520]   And they're coming up with a strategy of
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:21.240]   how little of an additional discount can they offer and think you're still going to say yes.
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:24.920]   So, they're coming up with an additional sales strategy.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:28.040]   And sometimes the sales manager, you know,
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:30.600]   might come out and talk with you if they're busy that they won't.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:35.320]   But that salesperson only has so much pricing decision-making authority
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:37.640]   beyond that it's above his pay grade.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:40.760]   And he has to literally go talk to his boss to see if he can get that.
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:46.200]   And sometimes the salesperson is actually negotiating with the manager saying,
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:51.080]   "Dude, I really need this sale because, you know, I haven't met my quotas this month.
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:55.720]   And will you please do this for me so that I can sell it to this guy so I can make
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:56.840]   my numbers for the month?"
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:59.640]   So, sometimes they're actually advocating on your behalf.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:01.800]   But they're trying to figure out, you know,
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:06.920]   what can they come back with that you will likely say yes to that still makes them money.
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:09.960]   Remember, a dealership is a for-profit business.
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:11.320]   It's not a charity.
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:16.920]   It's -- they're under no obligation to give you a zero-profit deal on a silver platter.
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:20.280]   That is why we go through this negotiating process.
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:21.800]   But if they didn't make any money,
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:24.840]   then their doors wouldn't be open and we wouldn't have anybody to buy cars from.
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:29.960]   So, that's why what's going on now is especially challenging for them
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:33.080]   because they're not making the money by volume.
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:36.600]   So, they have to make a higher profit on every car they sell because they're
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:40.040]   only selling a fraction of the number of cars that they normally do.
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:43.240]   And that salesperson still has bills to pay, as does the dealership.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:43.740]   So...
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:48.840]   I just want to thank you, Quick, for listening to and supporting the show.

[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:02.600]   So, please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:07.240]   Yeah, I think -- don't forget that, you know, anyone you're negotiating with,
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:11.080]   whether it's the customer service agent with the airline or someone at the car dealer,
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:16.440]   they're all humans and they generally want to do better for people who are nice to them.
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:22.760]   And I've observed people yelling at the salespeople at dealerships trying to get
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:25.720]   better deals and I just tend to think that's probably not the right strategy.
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.720]   Exactly.
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:33.240]   And one of the things that I just have an advantage is that I buy
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:36.600]   more cars in a week than most people do in their lifetime.
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.520]   So, it's a different relationship.
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:43.880]   But it is the dealers that, you know, we're trying to create a win-win.
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:46.200]   So, I'm not out to screw the dealers.
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:51.560]   Yes, I'm out to get the absolute best possible end-to-end deal that I possibly can for my clients.
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:56.520]   But they can afford to give those discounts because, you know,
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:51:00.280]   I may buy six cars from one dealership this month.
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:05.320]   This time last year, I was actually the top salesperson, so to speak,
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:09.320]   for one of my local dealerships here in Charlotte because of the lockdown.
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:13.480]   I sold more cars than any of their internal salespeople did.
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:16.280]   Wow, that's wild.
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:17.320]   It was hilarious.
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:18.760]   Bummer for those salespeople.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:19.960]   Bummer for them, yeah.
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:24.120]   But I tell you what, that dealer loves me now because I helped them stay afloat.
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:25.720]   You're going to be at the top of their list.
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:27.000]   Yeah, it was really nice.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.320]   They do a good job for me, so they earn that business.
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:30.680]   It's not just given to them.
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:31.240]   They earn it.
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:37.000]   In a time like this where prices are higher than they are normally,
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.200]   if I go to Edmunds and find out the invoice price,
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.840]   that maybe doesn't help me negotiate like I used to.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:46.360]   If you know that you're going to pay over,
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:49.720]   is there any way to kind of figure out what the best price is
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:55.000]   if you're not targeting a specific invoice price or something like that?
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.480]   It's a matter of making those phone calls.
[00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:58.840]   Just call around.
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:01.560]   First of all, see who has the car that you want.
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:06.040]   It's honestly a "Can I find what I want?" game right now,
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:08.760]   not a "Can I get the best possible deal on it?"
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:12.040]   And then just, you know, if you're flexible, you're like,
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:13.960]   "Yeah, you know, I don't care. I'll take any color."
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:17.480]   Then it's about calling around and letting the dealer know,
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:19.080]   "Hey, you know, I don't care what color it is.
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:21.960]   You know, I just, you know, want to get, you know, a decent deal."
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:23.720]   And make those phone calls.
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:27.880]   Call 10, 20 dealerships, literally,
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:30.600]   and see who will give you the best overall deal.
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:33.240]   And let's say I've decided,
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.920]   "No, I actually want this one particular car."
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:37.640]   I call 30 dealers, only one of them has anything like it,
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:39.800]   and they give me a price.
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:41.080]   Do I just have to take that?
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:43.640]   Can I, like, I don't have an alternative.
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:48.280]   You know, is there a rule of thumb on what to come back with?
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:49.480]   Is it 10% lower?
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:54.280]   Is it 5% lower to try to get the best deal you can when you have no leverage?
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:56.760]   You can try. It never hurts to ask.
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:59.480]   But if they laugh and hang up on you,
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:03.560]   then 30 seconds later, someone else may have bought that car.
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:06.760]   So it's just, it's a decision that you've got to make.
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:09.800]   And that's what I'm being honest with people that,
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.560]   you know, I'm talking to now that say they want a car.
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:13.240]   I'm like, "Here's what's going on in the industry.
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:14.920]   It's about finding the car.
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:18.600]   We do not have the leverage that we normally would in negotiating.
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:21.400]   I cannot guarantee what kind of deal we can get,
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:24.120]   but I can guarantee that I will scour the earth
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:25.720]   to find what you're looking for
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:29.720]   and figure out what's gonna be the best way to get that to you.
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:34.760]   And I know a lot more avenues for obtaining the vehicles than you might know.
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:37.080]   But yeah, there's just sometimes where you just,
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:39.160]   if you want it, you got to pay for it.
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:43.400]   You're always welcome to walk away and not get a car.
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.400]   So briefly coming back to leases,
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:52.360]   my understanding of how leases work at the highest level is
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:55.960]   you have a price, the dealer comes up with what they think it will be worth
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:59.320]   as a residual value after your, let's say, three-year lease.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:03.880]   And I've always assumed dealers are conservative, right?
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:05.240]   They don't want to lose money.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:07.960]   So if you're not going to drive the car very hard
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:09.400]   and not going to put a lot of miles on it,
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:12.520]   you're probably going to overpay taking a lease.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:15.160]   But if you're going to drive right up to and not over the limit
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:17.880]   and your kids are going to throw food all over the car
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:22.680]   and you really value just not having to haggle for a new car in three years,
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:23.960]   it could make sense.
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:27.160]   Or I guess if you can expense or write off your lease payments,
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:31.640]   is that kind of a general way it works?
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:33.080]   Or am I totally off?
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:34.200]   Sort of.
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:35.640]   You have it partially right.
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:39.000]   The dealerships do not set the residual value.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.040]   Okay.
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:43.080]   The only thing the dealers get to do is decide the selling price.
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:44.840]   That's what you negotiate.
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:47.320]   The lease is based on the residual value,
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:53.160]   which is based on what they anticipate the car will be worth
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:55.880]   at the end of that lease, depending on...
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:59.320]   So whether you say you're going to drive 10,000 miles a year
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:01.800]   or 12,000 miles a year or 15,000 miles a year,
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:03.560]   that affects that residual.
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:07.000]   That and what's called a money factor,
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.720]   which just think of that as leasing's equivalent
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:12.200]   of an APR, an interest rate.
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:15.320]   That's what determines what that lease payment is going to be.
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:17.560]   The dealers do not set those.
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:20.280]   The captive finance companies do.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:22.920]   So BMW Financial, Honda Financial,
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:25.880]   Southeastern Toyota Financial,
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:30.360]   the banks who hold the lease make those determinations.
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:31.800]   And those are not negotiable.
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:34.680]   If you don't drive a lot of miles,
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.920]   maybe you only drive 5,000 miles a year,
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:38.600]   even in non-pandemic years,
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:41.480]   then you don't necessarily need a 12,000 mile a year lease.
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:45.000]   You can say, "Hey, well, do you offer a low mileage lease?"
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.960]   Honda, Toyota, they normally don't.
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:49.240]   They might go down to 10,000.
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:51.720]   Most of them are 12,000 is the lowest.
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:54.440]   Some companies will do a 10,000 mile a year lease.
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:56.920]   Your more expensive cars like Mercedes and BMW
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.440]   and Audi, Porsche, definitely,
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:00.200]   they have very low mileage leases
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:01.880]   because a lot of times people will lease those,
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:03.240]   but it's not their daily driver.
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:06.280]   So only by the number of miles
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:07.800]   that you think you're going to need,
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:09.080]   maybe a little bit more.
[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:11.960]   But that's a decision that you have to make.
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:15.640]   Leasing is a lifestyle choice.
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:17.880]   If you like to have a new car every three years,
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:21.800]   you don't like to deal with expensive maintenance items,
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:23.800]   and you don't drive a lot of miles per year,
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:25.480]   you may be a great lease candidate,
[00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:27.080]   and that's the right solution for you.
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:30.840]   If you do not use all the miles on your lease,
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:33.560]   one of the things that the leasing companies
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:37.000]   don't want you to know is that at the end of your lease,
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.680]   you don't just have to turn it in.
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:40.200]   They'll tell you you can either turn it in
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:41.480]   or you can buy it out.
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:44.360]   There is a third option in most cases,
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:46.520]   and that is you can trade in that leased car
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:49.240]   just like you would any other car
[00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:51.160]   that you have sitting in your driveway,
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:54.520]   because leasing is just another way to finance the car.
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:58.360]   They pay it off, you negotiate a trade price,
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:00.520]   and they pay off the lease
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:03.000]   just like they would pay off the loan with the bank.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.240]   It's really no different.
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:08.360]   So that means if you didn't drive as many miles,
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:10.440]   you might have positive equity in that car
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:12.360]   when you go to trade it in.
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:15.400]   That positive equity should be in your pocket.
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:17.880]   You should be able to apply that to your next lease
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:19.240]   or your next purchase,
[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:21.240]   but the leasing company doesn't want you to know that
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:24.360]   because they want that equity in their pockets.
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:25.960]   They wanna be able to turn around
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:29.400]   and sell it for more money than they were expecting.
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:31.400]   So that's one of the biggest secrets of leasing
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:33.480]   is you can trade in your leased car
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:35.320]   and keep that equity for yourself.
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:38.280]   You just don't mention to the dealer that it's leased
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:41.800]   until after you've already come up with that nice trade price.
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:45.000]   So do it all the time, been doing it for 20 years.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.600]   It does work that way.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:50.680]   - And I assume you could also go to these online sites,
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:53.160]   you said that are paying top dollar right now
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:54.440]   and sell your lease to them.
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:56.520]   And you're not really selling the lease,
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:58.680]   you're selling them the car and you're paying off the lease.
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:00.280]   But if they're gonna offer you more
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:01.720]   than the dealer will on the trade in,
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:03.640]   is that, you could do that as well?
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:05.960]   - Absolutely, I did two of them last week that way.
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:08.040]   - Okay, wow.
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:11.400]   And if you have a car that's up for lease right now,
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:13.400]   given how high prices are,
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:16.520]   even if you didn't put half the money,
[00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:18.200]   even if you hit all the miles,
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:20.120]   you might be better off doing this
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:23.320]   because used cars are just so much more valuable this year
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:24.280]   than they have been before.
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:27.240]   - Absolutely, I always tell people,
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:29.800]   about a month or about two months
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:31.640]   before your lease comes due,
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:33.880]   start looking at the market value of your car
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:37.160]   to see if you have any positive equity.
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:38.600]   Because yes, that's absolutely true,
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:41.400]   but especially right now with the crazy money
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:43.320]   that the cars are bringing,
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:45.480]   even if you're slightly over your miles,
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:47.800]   you may still be able to get out of it cleanly,
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:50.280]   trading it or selling it to a place like Vroom
[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:52.840]   or Carvana that's paying crazy money
[00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:56.280]   versus actually having to pay money to the leasing company
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:57.720]   because you're over your miles.
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:59.800]   There's a lot of options right now.
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:02.200]   A few of the manufacturers have been,
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:04.200]   I've heard whispers, I have not confirmed this,
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:06.360]   so please take it with a grain of salt,
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:08.760]   but I've heard of a couple of manufacturers
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:10.280]   saying that they're not gonna allow
[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:13.640]   you to sell your car to someone else,
[00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:14.920]   trade it into a different dealer
[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:17.080]   other than one of their own franchise dealers
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:19.160]   because they know that Vroom and Carvana,
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:21.320]   those companies are quote, "Stealing their cars."
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:23.800]   I have not confirmed that.
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.360]   I'm not even sure it's legal under the contracts,
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:29.080]   but that may be something.
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:30.760]   That is something that they told me.
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:32.520]   They're like, "Oh no, you're not gonna be able to sell that."
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:34.600]   I'm like, "Yeah, I'm gonna still try anyway
[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:36.360]   because I don't think you're telling me the truth."
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:38.840]   - And if you had enough money,
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:40.680]   you could always just buy it and sell it.
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:44.520]   Even if they offered that or change those rules,
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:46.360]   they're still not gonna stop you from buying it.
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:46.920]   - Correct.
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:48.600]   You could always buy it out from them.
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:51.400]   You just have to pay it off or get another loan for it.
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:53.160]   Yeah, you can do that,
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:55.000]   but that's why you don't wanna wait
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.160]   until two days before the lease is due.
[00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.520]   Give yourself a couple of months
[00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.360]   because there is a process
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.440]   and it does take typically seven to 10 days
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.760]   for it to get fully paid off, et cetera, and so forth.
[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:06.200]   But yeah, absolutely.
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.760]   And those companies will tell you
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:10.840]   if you go on to one of those online dealerships
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:13.160]   and fill out a form to get the quote on your car,
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:15.560]   they ask if it's a clear title,
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:16.600]   meaning you own it outright,
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:18.520]   or if there's a loan or if it's a lease.
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.120]   And if for some reason it's a lease
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.960]   and they are not allowed to buy it, they will tell you.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:25.480]   - Okay, and here's one.
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:28.040]   If two people bought the same car,
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.960]   one leased it for three years,
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.720]   one just bought it outright,
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.640]   or financed it,
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:35.000]   and then three years later,
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.960]   the lease person goes, trades it in, buys another car,
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.240]   and the other person goes in
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:41.080]   and just trades it in and buys another car.
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:46.680]   If you value that ability to trade cars every three years,
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.760]   are you getting a better deal with leasing?
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.360]   Or is it just kind of easier?
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.360]   - You're getting a better deal,
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:53.960]   usually, depending on the car,
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:56.120]   because with leasing,
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:57.880]   you're only paying for the portion of the car
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:58.680]   that you're using.
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.920]   So you're financing three years
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:02.760]   and 36,000 miles of the car
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:05.480]   versus financing the entire value of the car.
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.400]   That's why those lease payments are lower.
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:10.840]   But I urge people to reconsider
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.520]   if they're only looking at leasing
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.040]   to get a lower payment,
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:16.280]   they're using it as a financial strategy,
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.640]   they're asking for trouble.
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.400]   Because if they don't know
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.920]   how many miles a year that they drive,
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:24.120]   I just see so many people get in trouble leasing,
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:26.280]   particularly realtors, people in sales
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:28.920]   that wanna drive that luxury car
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:30.280]   to project a certain image.
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:32.040]   And I respect that as a business owner,
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.360]   but they also drive 30,000 miles a year
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:35.080]   and they don't realize
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:37.080]   that they're 12,000 mile a year lease.
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:39.240]   They get to the end of their lease
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:41.000]   and didn't realize that they are now
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.680]   60,000 miles over the lease.
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:47.320]   And now they actually owe $15,000 in overage charges.
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:49.400]   So you can get yourself in trouble leasing,
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:50.440]   there are more risks.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.680]   But if you're a good lease candidate
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.440]   and you do just want a new car every three years,
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:55.720]   yeah, it can be an excellent option.
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:56.840]   And you'll pay less money.
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.760]   - If you're in that circumstance
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.760]   where you just totally blew over the miles
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:04.040]   and the dealership wants to charge you a huge penalty,
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.200]   are you ever better off just buying the car
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:08.600]   and selling it than paying the penalty for going over?
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:09.880]   - Very often, yes.
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:12.600]   And I tell people that in most situations,
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.080]   you can actually refinance the car
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:16.360]   directly with your bank.
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.600]   You don't necessarily have to go to the dealership
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:20.440]   and buy it out,
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:23.560]   'cause that saves you typically 1,000 to $2,000
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:26.200]   in bogus fees that you don't actually have to pay.
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.400]   Call your bank directly,
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:28.600]   especially if you have a credit union,
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.760]   say, "Hey, I wanna refinance my lease."
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:33.000]   Interest rate is gonna be a little bit higher.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.360]   It'll probably be about the same as buying a used car,
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:38.600]   but they'll be able to do that whole process with you
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:41.640]   without the dealer charging you all of their fees
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:44.600]   on top of just the price of the car.
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:48.600]   - So when I bought my most recent car,
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:50.040]   I found that the financing rates
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:51.720]   from the dealership weren't great.
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:54.840]   And so I ended up going to a credit union.
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:55.960]   Is that normal?
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:58.360]   I see all these ads about 0% APR.
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:01.480]   Should people be shopping those interest rates around
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:02.920]   or is it really like,
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:04.760]   if it's not 0%, go elsewhere?
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:07.000]   - If you have excellent credit,
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.520]   anytime you see those 0% or 0.9, 1.9,
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.560]   those are being offered
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:14.600]   by the manufacturer's captive finance company
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:15.880]   to help sell cars.
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:18.840]   But you have to have excellent credit to get those,
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.960]   typically 720 credit score or above.
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:24.600]   So if you don't qualify for them,
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.920]   then absolutely go to your credit union.
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:30.040]   If they don't have one of those special APRs
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:31.400]   and they just have normal rates,
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.200]   the dealers have relationships with multiple banks,
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:36.680]   sometimes even with credit unions in your area.
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:40.520]   It doesn't necessarily hurt to let them shop your rates
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.200]   'cause they're only pulling your credit once
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:44.280]   and then they'll look and see based on your credit,
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.960]   they know which of their banks to talk to.
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:49.720]   But getting pre-approved through your own credit union
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:52.040]   or your own bank is always a good step
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.960]   'cause then you know you've got something in your pocket
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:54.920]   and you can go to the dealer and say,
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:56.840]   "Hey, can you beat this rate?"
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:01.240]   - It was kind of a pain to get my pre-approval
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.880]   and then they had to like mail the check to the dealership.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.480]   I did feel like it would have been easier
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:06.440]   if I went with a dealer,
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.160]   but in this case, it was like 3% or 4%
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:13.560]   versus 1.5% and so I just couldn't do it.
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:16.280]   - Different banks have different processes,
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:19.320]   more and more of them are getting with the times
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.640]   and can get things done faster.
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:24.360]   Very few have to mail a paper check anymore,
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:26.040]   but there are still those few little credit unions
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.880]   that are still operating in 1976.
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:30.760]   Then you just have to decide,
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.920]   "Is the money that I'm saving
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:34.360]   worth the extra hassle or not?"
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:38.840]   - Yep, and last big one is when you're done,
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:40.760]   let's say I've decided I found the car I want,
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:42.520]   I didn't lease my car,
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.040]   so I just have a car to get rid of.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:47.640]   I've always logged into Kelley Blue Book and searched
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:49.720]   and I'm like, "Man, the trade-in price is always
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.800]   so much worse than that private party price."
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:54.280]   What do you tell people to do
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:56.840]   when they have a car they don't need
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:58.440]   and they want to get rid of it?
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:04:59.560]   Do you just trade it in?
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:01.640]   Do you try to clean it up and detail it
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:03.160]   and sell it yourself?
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.840]   What's the best way to get rid of a car,
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:08.040]   maximize your money and reduce your hassle?
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:12.040]   - Right now, you can get any of these online companies
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:14.520]   because they're buying them for crazy money.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.520]   In normal times, it's always a trade-off.
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:19.480]   Yes, you can typically get more money for your car,
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:22.440]   selling it privately, listing it yourself on AutoTrader
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.200]   or Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace.
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:27.240]   A lot of times, it depends on how much that car is
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:28.040]   to begin with.
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:29.880]   If it's a $30,000 car
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:32.280]   and you might make a couple extra thousand dollars,
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:33.880]   you don't necessarily need to
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:35.960]   because you're not trying to pay off a loan
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:38.280]   that you still owe $32,000 on.
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:40.280]   Then you have to decide,
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:43.400]   "Is it worth the amount of work that I have to do
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:44.920]   to sell it and list it
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:46.920]   and deal with all the yahoos that call you,
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:48.200]   half of whom are not serious,
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.240]   the other half are scammers,
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:51.000]   going through that process?
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.680]   Is that worth it to you
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:54.680]   for the extra money that you're gonna make
[01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:55.960]   or is it not?"
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.400]   For a lot of people, it is.
[01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:58.680]   And then, yeah, they clean it up
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:05:59.960]   and they go through that process
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:02.280]   and they sell it and they pocket that extra money.
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:03.080]   Other people are like,
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:04.840]   "I just don't even wanna deal with it.
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:06.040]   I wanna unload it.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.880]   Maybe the car has some problems
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:10.840]   and it's gonna be harder for them to sell."
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:13.400]   In which case, you just sell it to a dealer.
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:16.520]   If it's an older, higher mileage car
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:18.760]   that maybe has the occasional issue,
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:21.800]   sometimes we pawn it off on CarMax.
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:24.040]   They actually own their own auction house.
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:26.280]   So sometimes on the older, higher mile cars,
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.400]   they can put more money on it
[01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.640]   because they don't have to pay to haul it to auction.
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:30.680]   They have their own auctions.
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:32.680]   So that can be a good option as well.
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:36.200]   It really depends on what that car looks like
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:39.160]   to know exactly where to sell it.
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.160]   Sometimes you could even, if it's a good car,
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:43.160]   shop it around to different dealers.
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:45.720]   Some might pay $2,000 more
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:49.400]   just because you're selling your Toyota to a Toyota store
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:51.560]   versus you're selling your Toyota to a Honda store next door
[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:53.960]   that can't sell three-year-old Toyotas
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:55.800]   with all those certified pre-owned ones next door.
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.960]   So again, it takes shopping around.
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:59.320]   - Okay.
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:02.040]   And those online dealerships, that's Carvana, Vroom,
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:03.720]   are there any other ones people should be looking at?
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.800]   - You know, you have to Google.
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.320]   Those are the two that I've been looking at.
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:09.960]   I've been selling to Vroom lately
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:14.680]   because they have been getting through the process a lot faster.
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.280]   I think Carvana might come up with a good offer,
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:17.960]   but then you don't hear from them for three weeks.
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.480]   Vroom's been getting it through the process
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:21.720]   and people have had checks in their pockets really fast.
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:24.520]   And I was very impressed with how they were handling it.
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:26.440]   So that's the direction that I have been going.
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:27.560]   This is all very new.
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:29.640]   And quite frankly, I'm learning as I go as well.
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:30.760]   - Okay.
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:36.200]   Any other car auto tips, tricks, hacks,
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.040]   nothing that doesn't have to be about buying,
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:41.480]   could be about maintenance, avoiding speeding tickets,
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:43.160]   anything that you just love to share.
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:47.960]   I know you race cars, so I'm sure you have tips there.
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:50.600]   Anything outside of the buying and selling process
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:51.880]   that you love to share?
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:54.680]   - I clearly do not have any tips
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:56.360]   for getting out of speeding tickets.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:57.560]   If you look at my record,
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.480]   I just have a really good attorney.
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:01.080]   So we won't go there.
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:04.760]   But one thing about used cars
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:08.200]   is always get a Carfax report.
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.760]   Always, always, always.
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:12.760]   If you have to buy it yourself for 30 bucks,
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:16.040]   it is well worth it to know what that history is.
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.440]   And you're not just looking at, was it in an accident?
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.680]   There's actually 30 different pieces of data
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.120]   that I look at on a Carfax.
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:25.720]   So you might find that it's a car from Canada.
[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:27.720]   It's gonna have a lot of rust
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:30.680]   and it's gonna all be in kilometers instead of miles.
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:33.880]   And you may find that it's got kind of a hanky history.
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:37.320]   It was in a state that has hurricanes
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:38.840]   and then they moved it to a state
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:41.560]   that doesn't have requirements on the titles
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:43.080]   to report those things.
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:44.440]   And then it went back to another state.
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:49.240]   So it basically laundered the title of flood history.
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:51.480]   There's so much data that you can glean.
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:53.640]   And Carfax is the best.
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:54.600]   They're the oldest company.
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:56.040]   They have the most reporting relationships.
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.800]   So you're gonna get the most data from them
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.880]   versus AutoCheck or one of the newer companies
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:02.040]   that just doesn't have as much information.
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:06.200]   So in my world, getting a Carfax report on a used car
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:07.400]   is non-negotiable.
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:08.840]   I have to have that or I won't buy it.
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:10.360]   - Okay.
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:12.120]   So I remember you saying earlier
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:14.280]   that there's these eight areas of negotiating.
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:16.280]   We don't need to go through all of them,
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:18.440]   but this is all something you do.
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:19.880]   Can you talk for a couple minutes
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:22.040]   about how you help people do this?
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:22.840]   What's that model?
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:23.960]   - Absolutely.
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:26.680]   Our process is called My Perfect Car.
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:29.080]   And we look at your unique lifestyle,
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:31.720]   budget and personality to help figure out
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:33.560]   what car are we even buying?
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:35.240]   Are we buying new versus used?
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:37.800]   Are we buying, are we leasing or loan cash?
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:39.320]   We look at that whole picture to figure out
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:41.160]   what's the right way to solve this puzzle
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:44.520]   for your lifestyle and to get you what you want.
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:46.680]   And I typically narrow it down to two or three cars
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:48.840]   that I think would be perfect for you.
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:50.840]   And then I can set you up on test drives
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:52.600]   so that you can get your butt in the seat.
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:53.960]   So we have a saying here,
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:55.800]   comfort is in the butt to the beholder.
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:58.200]   So you gotta get in the car and see how it feels.
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:01.000]   And then once you decide what you like best,
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.640]   then we'll scour the earth to find it,
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:04.920]   go through all the negotiating,
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:06.440]   handle your trade, your financing,
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:09.240]   looking at all eight of those areas in the deal
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.160]   to find the best overall deal for you,
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:13.640]   as well as the best customer experience.
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.880]   And we'll work with the dealer then
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.480]   to get all the paperwork together.
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:20.200]   Sometimes we can have the car delivered to your house.
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:21.720]   If you have to go to the dealership,
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:24.200]   we make sure they have everything done ahead of time.
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:26.760]   We've had a conversation about all those extras
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:29.080]   that they might want to try and ambush you with
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:30.200]   in the finance office.
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:33.160]   So if they are anything like an extended warranty
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:34.040]   or something that you want,
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:35.240]   I've pre-negotiated those.
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:36.440]   That way there's no surprises
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:38.520]   and you can get in and out as quickly as possible.
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:41.240]   Sign papers, take the keys and get back on the road.
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.720]   So it's a true end to end service.
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:46.840]   A lot like a buyer's agent in real estate.
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:49.960]   - And how are you compensated in this process?
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:52.120]   - We charge our clients a flat fee up front
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:53.400]   when we sign the contract.
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:55.720]   So I'm not tied to the price of the car
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:57.560]   in any way, shape or form.
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:00.040]   It's just a flat fee for the perfect car package.
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:01.640]   And if you're interested,
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:05.000]   people can contact us at our website at thecarchick.com
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.760]   and sign up for a 15-minute complimentary car chat
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:10.040]   to talk about your situation
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.440]   and just see if we're a good fit to work together.
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:13.960]   Not everybody's a good fit for us.
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:15.720]   We're not a good fit for everybody.
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:16.840]   But the worst thing that happens
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.360]   is you walk away from that conversation
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:19.960]   with a lot of good advice
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:21.360]   when we point you in the right direction.
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.840]   - Yeah.
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:25.560]   And hopefully everyone listening walks away from this
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:26.600]   with a lot of good advice.
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:27.320]   I know I have.
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.000]   Is there anywhere else people should find you online?
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.600]   - They can go directly to thestraightshift.com.
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:36.520]   Don't forget the F in the last word.
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:38.920]   And they can also get to that.
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:42.040]   We have a podcast link on the website, thecarchick.com.
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:46.440]   So we've got about 76 episodes out there
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:49.000]   on a variety of car-related topics.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.560]   So I'm passionate about educating people
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:54.440]   and helping them to get the information that they need
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:56.600]   to empower them to make smart financial decisions
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:57.880]   for themselves when it comes to buying,
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.160]   selling and maintaining their cars.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:01.800]   'Cause there's just so much confusing information out there.
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:04.360]   And so that's why we named the podcast The Straight Shift.
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:06.680]   'Cause I am always gonna tell it to you straight,
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:08.440]   whether it's what you wanna hear or not.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.760]   But I want you to have the right information
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.520]   to make good decisions for yourself and your family.
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:13.960]   - Awesome.
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:15.560]   Well, thank you so much for being on here.
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:16.600]   This has been fantastic.
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:17.800]   - Well, thanks for having me, Chris.
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:18.680]   I really appreciate it.
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:20.200]   - That was awesome.
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:22.120]   And thank you so much for listening.
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.360]   I know my mom has a lease coming up in the next few months.
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:26.440]   So I'm pretty sure I might be able to save her some money.
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:29.880]   And as always, links to everything we discussed
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:32.200]   are in the show notes at allthehacks.com.
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:35.480]   I also wanna say thank you to all the listeners
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:37.000]   who've been reaching out with questions,
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.160]   their favorite hacks and ideas for guests
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.440]   to have on the show.
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:42.760]   I really love hearing from all of you.
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:44.760]   You can always find me on Twitter
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:46.920]   or you can email Chris at AllTheHacks
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.760]   and reach out about anything.
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:50.040]   I'm already starting to think about
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.480]   how to build out this community,
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:54.040]   whether that's a Facebook group or part of Substack
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:56.360]   where the newsletter is or something else.
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:57.960]   So stay tuned there.
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:59.320]   And speaking of the newsletter,
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:01.800]   I just sent the first episode out yesterday.
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:03.240]   So if you're not subscribed,
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:05.480]   you can do that on the right side of our website
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:07.800]   or at allthehacks.com/newsletter.
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:11.240]   Finally, to everyone who's left a reviewer rating,
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:12.840]   thank you so much.
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.680]   If you haven't yet, it's never too late
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:15.960]   and it'd really help out the show.
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:17.240]   Have a great week.
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:29.240]   (upbeat music)
