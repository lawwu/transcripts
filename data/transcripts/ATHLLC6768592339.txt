[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.920]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.600]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:43.600]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.680]   your life, money and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.680]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you on my journey to find
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.320]   All The Hacks.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.680]   And today I want to talk about getting a deal when you're buying a car.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.080]   My wife, Amy, and I had our first child last year, and with parents in town, we
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.280]   quickly realized that bigger cars in our future.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.880]   So before I go down that path, I want to learn everything there is to get a good
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.440]   deal. And this means deciding whether I go new or used, lease or buy, and getting
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.360]   the absolute best when negotiating.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.160]   So today I'm joined by Leanne Shattuck, aka The Car Chick.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.840]   She races cars, hosts the Straight Shift podcast, and most relevant to today, runs
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.320]   her own car buying service where she helps people get the best deals on a new or
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.880]   used car. So let's jump in.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.160]   Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.280]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions and
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.160]   do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.320]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.320]   investment decisions.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.800]   Leanne, thank you for being here.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.720]   Well, thanks for having me, Chris.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.080]   Definitely sounds like you have a lot of changes coming up in your life with the
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.360]   baby and everything else.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.800]   That's great. Congratulations.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.080]   Thank you. Yeah, it turns out when you want to fit two adults, a dog, a baby and
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.520]   in-laws into a five-seater sedan, it just doesn't work.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:12.000]   Yeah, that's tougher than packing up a 1945 fire truck into crates to ship from
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.720]   South Carolina down to Florida, which is what I was doing this morning.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.040]   Oh, I have never had that problem and I'm excited to hear more.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.480]   Yeah. Can you tell us a little bit about how you got here?
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.960]   It is kind of a long, circuitous journey, but my love of cars began, I think, about
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.000]   age two.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.720]   That's when Disney had come out with the Herbie the Love Bug movies and I fell in
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.080]   love with classic Volkswagens.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.800]   This is before I knew that they were not necessarily the most safe or reliable
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.080]   vehicle on the road. But as a two-year-old, they're cute and they were very
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.920]   recognizable and our neighbors had one.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.840]   So it was kind of downhill after that.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.280]   And I just always loved cars.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.880]   And my dad started teaching me high performance driving skills when I was seven.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.880]   And I got into racing and varying degrees of legality, which we won't talk about
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.080]   because I'm not sure the statute of limitations has yet expired, but got into it
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.640]   all legally eventually.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.480]   And just cars are just my passion.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.440]   But I saw how many people, women in particular, just would rather have a root
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.200]   canal than shop for a car.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.200]   They sometimes don't feel like the dealers treat them with the respect that they
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.440]   deserve, or they get overwhelmed by all the different makes and models on the
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.280]   market, or they just don't like the the haggling back and forth because cars are
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.560]   one of the few products that we haggle over in American society at any rate.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.960]   We're not used to doing that in the markets every day like they do in Europe and
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.880]   many other countries.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.360]   So it's just for many people, it's a frustrating and stressful process.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.160]   And I think it should be fun and exciting because getting a new car, oh, my gosh,
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.720]   is there there are a few things more exciting than that, in my opinion.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.240]   So I came up with a way to take the stress out of it and pay people money in the
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.760]   meantime.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.280]   Yeah, I mean, buying a car is probably one of the few outside of a home, one of the
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.080]   biggest purchases people make, and we make it multiple times.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.120]   So I think having having the skills to do that right is really important.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.440]   So before we start, I'm curious, is there a thing that you think is one of the
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.760]   biggest misconceptions that people have when it comes to buying a car?
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.280]   Oh, gosh, there are so many of those.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.640]   But one of the ones that I see frequently is that people think that, oh, I can pay
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.200]   cash, I'll get a better deal.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.680]   And maybe back in the 60s and 70s, that was true.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:41.040]   But because the dealers make a little bit of a commission from the banks on the
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.000]   back end, even if it's through their captive finance company, you can sometimes
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.320]   actually get a better deal if you finance.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.000]   That's one of the things that I still hear today.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.320]   Oh, I should be able to get a better deal because I'm paying cash.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.440]   I'm like, well, actually, no, you won't.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.400]   Yeah, I mean, maybe if you're buying it from someone on Craigslist, that's a
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.640]   bonus. But dealership, it sounds like it's not.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.840]   Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.520]   So I've heard you say buying a car is more of a process than an event.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.400]   And so I thought what could be helpful is to just kind of walk through that
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.880]   process. But it's a long process, is a lot of things.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.440]   And you've done so many great episodes of your podcast to dive in.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.960]   So I figured maybe today we'll start with someone who's already decided what car
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.520]   they want, but are just now starting to think about whether they should buy it used
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.080]   or new. How do you help someone who comes to you and can't make that decision think
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.240]   about it? I look at a lot of different things about their lifestyle because it's
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.360]   more than just saving money.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:47.320]   In most cases, yes, you can save money by buying a used car, but you're not going
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.800]   to get the full warranty on it.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.280]   How many miles does the car already have on it versus how many are you planning to
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.360]   put on it every year?
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.920]   If you are looking at putting 25,000, 30,000 miles on the car because you're in a
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:07.000]   sales position or you're a realtor, then you need to start with a car that is as
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.320]   new as possible.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.040]   Otherwise, you're not going to be able to keep it for five or six years.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.000]   You're going to blow through the miles and then it's going to start costing you a
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.400]   ton of money in repairs while you're still paying the monthly payments on the loan.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.600]   So you have to look very strategically at it.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.640]   It's not just how much money can I save up front, but then what is it going to look
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.400]   like keeping this car year after year after year?
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.000]   So if you're in sales, you just know that it's going to cost you more per year to
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.040]   drive because you're going to put more miles on that car.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.440]   And you don't want to be paying larger repair bills and making a $500 a month car
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.080]   payment at the same time.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.720]   That'll kill your budget right away.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.880]   So you just have to look strategically at what your lifestyle is like.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.240]   What do you need this four-wheeled tool to do for you to support that lifestyle and
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.920]   over what period of time?
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.040]   And it also depends on the car.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.760]   Some cars hold their value extremely well.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.320]   Others, that initial depreciation is a lot higher.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.840]   So, yeah, let's save $10,000 and get one that's only a couple of years old.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.080]   But that's just not true for every make and model.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.320]   And it also depends on what's going on in the market.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.480]   Right now, whole different ballgame right now with the inventory shortage.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.800]   But on average, not every car depreciates in the same way.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.800]   Let's just put it that way.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.920]   Is that more driven by the manufacturer or the car type?
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.920]   Is it like trucks depreciate differently than sedans or is it just varies
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.280]   manufacturer to manufacturer?
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.480]   It's actually a little bit of both.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:45.040]   So trucks will have a different depreciation because they're used in the work
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:49.720]   environment. But it can also vary from manufacturer to manufacturer.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:54.840]   Cars that are more reliable or at least the perception of the general public is that
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.600]   they're more reliable will hold their value better.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.240]   Cars that were a lot more expensive to begin with.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.600]   So a lot of your highline cars, your BMWs, your Mercedes, especially the super
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.400]   expensive ones that are maybe, you know, $80,000 to $100,000 new.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:14.520]   Those are going to have a higher initial depreciation because you can either afford
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.920]   $100,000 car or you can't.
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.920]   So there's not a lot.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.440]   And the people that can't afford them do buy them new because they want a new one
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.800]   and they can afford it and all the power to them.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.680]   Great. But then it goes on to the secondary market and now you're into a completely
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.160]   different demographic looking at that vehicle used.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.720]   So they tend to have a higher depreciation.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.440]   But, you know, Cadillac Escalades have one of the highest depreciations of any car.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.880]   You know, anything made by Toyota is going to hold its value a lot better.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:47.120]   Is there a site, is it Consumer Reports or somewhere that you can kind of easily look
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.120]   up the reliability of cars in kind of an easy way?
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:57.520]   Easy is a relative term, but I do love Consumer Reports as a research tool because
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.120]   it is self-funded.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.800]   It's not funded by advertising.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.760]   So you can trust their information.
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.560]   And they also gather the information from actual owners.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.960]   I don't know if you've ever had one of those surveys sent to you about your car.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.920]   I filled out a million of them, I think, over the years.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:17.240]   And so they're getting that feedback from actual owners.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.880]   You still have to take it a little bit with a grain of salt because there are some
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.280]   cars, especially your more economical vehicles, that are cheap or new.
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.480]   Sometimes they get a bad rap for bad reliability when really it's the people that
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.880]   are buying the cheaper cars are not maintaining them properly.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.480]   So, yes, they break down, but that's because they skimped on the maintenance.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.360]   So you kind of have to look at it with a grain of salt.
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:46.760]   But I have found also just Googling "problems with your make and model" will bring
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:47.360]   up a lot.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:52.600]   And there's a great site called carcomplaints.com that correlates a lot of that
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:57.560]   data. And some of the information that they have is not necessarily reflected in
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.560]   other places in the industry.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.680]   So sometimes you can find some little interesting quirks about cars on that.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.600]   It's not as easy to weed through all their data, but the data is there.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.400]   And that's one of the sites that I use for research.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:14.640]   That's great. One of the other things I think that happened when we had a child or
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.480]   at least we're planning for it was, you know, I was always someone who wanted the
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.440]   best deal. So we drove a three series BMW for almost 13 years and I didn't want to
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.600]   get rid of it. It hadn't even hit 100,000 miles.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.520]   We barely drove it.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.280]   And then my wife said, you know, we're having a child.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.520]   Do we really want to own a 15, 16 year old car?
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:36.400]   And so ultimately the decision was, yes, there are a lot of used cars that are
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:43.040]   really old. I found that the safety features of cars in the last five years is far and
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.200]   above better than the safety features of a 15, 20 year old car.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.920]   Is that is my finding kind of accurate?
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.800]   Is there a point in time at which cars got a lot better in the last few decades?
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.880]   Yeah, absolutely. You're spot on.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.880]   And it's not even in the last 15 years.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.600]   It's really been in the last six or seven years.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:06.240]   The new safety aids, which are some of the most desirable features on cars today,
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.200]   everybody wants them except me.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.560]   Those driver safety aids and my driving style just don't get along.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.880]   But that's a different story.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:18.920]   But the lane keeping, the emergency braking, I call them electronic babysitters.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:24.600]   But they they are the building blocks for the self-driving cars that are coming down
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:30.200]   the line. And they are good because the reality is most people suck at driving.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:35.040]   Sorry to say it, folks, but we're so much more distracted and our roads are getting
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.960]   more congested. So having the car kind of given you that safety net, if you're just
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:44.120]   not quite paying attention or the kid is in the backseat screaming at you, you can't
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.600]   not be distracted by that.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.040]   The car can hopefully save you from rear ending the guy in front of you.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:56.760]   And those technologies started to come out in what I would call your your average
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:01.120]   consumer models, your Honda's, your Toyota's, your Hyundai's, the affordable cars in
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.440]   about 2016.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.880]   And they also started rolling out your Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, some of that
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.520]   smartphone integration, which is also popular.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:17.640]   And so if you want those technologies, that factors into your new versus used, because
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:22.600]   for many of those, depending on the manufacturer, it might be 2018 when a lot of
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.840]   that was rolled out in the model you're looking at.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:29.800]   So, yeah, you can save a lot more money by going with a 2016 or 2017, but you're
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.800]   giving up these driver safety aids that might be important to you.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:38.000]   So really looking at when did a certain feature that you want to get implemented in
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.640]   that car absolutely factors into your new and used equation.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:49.000]   Wow. OK, so newer car for safety and technology, older car could be a deal, but
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:49.960]   know what you're missing.
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:56.600]   Exactly. So you briefly touched on what's going on right now in the world in 2021.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:01.320]   And my understanding is the residual effects of COVID on manufacturing and there's a
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.360]   global shortage of semiconductor chips, which cars need.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.800]   There's a big shortage.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.400]   How is this affecting things?
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.160]   Does this change new versus used?
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.440]   Or I feel like you know this better than almost anyone.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:18.160]   Yeah. And I'll tell you what, it's been driving me crazy even for the last couple of
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:23.120]   months because there is a shortage of new cars.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.360]   The manufacturers are not able to spit out as many because, like you said, they don't
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.080]   have enough computer chips to actually build them.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.560]   Some of the manufacturers like Ford, they've been building these cars, especially the
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.520]   trucks and the SUVs that have a lot of fancier features.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.120]   So they need even more computer chips.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:45.000]   They're assembling the cars without those components and then parking them on a
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.600]   supply lot, you know, somewhere out by a factory.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.920]   And they're just sitting there waiting until they get the shipments of chips that they
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:57.520]   can then add in all those electronics components and actually finish building the
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.120]   car, which is a scary thought.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.320]   So a lot of people haven't been able to find the new car that they want.
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.400]   So now they're looking at the slightly used ones.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.440]   Well, what does that do?
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.600]   That drives up the demand for the used cars.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:14.120]   But there's also a supply shortage there because people have been extending their
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:19.600]   leases. They haven't been turning over the people that would normally lease a new car
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.560]   every few years.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.360]   Well, they can't get the new cars, so they extended their lease.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.920]   They're not turning in that leased car.
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.640]   So now the supply of three-year-old cars is low.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.000]   So it's really a big mess right now.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.800]   So the car buying strategies that I teach people, they all still apply.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.840]   But you kind of have to take it to the Olympic level now.
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.240]   And it's just like jockeying.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.280]   It's like when we were trying to get the last packet of toilet paper last year.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.880]   It's now cars are the toilet paper.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.520]   And so you're just jockeying, trying to get your hands on the one car.
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:57.200]   I've literally been buying cars that as soon as the truck shows up at the dealership
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.520]   and the dealer calls me, I'm like, yes, we'll take that one.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.960]   So they're selling stuff before it even arrives on their lot.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:07.240]   I can't even find cars to test drive for some people, depending on what it is they're
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.200]   looking at. It's crazy.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:14.480]   Does that mean if you want to test drive and you probably don't have a chance with new
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.640]   cars, so you might have you thought of should people like rent a car on Turo or
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.680]   something just so they can see how the car drives so that they're ready to pull the
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.080]   trigger?
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:27.560]   Or that's actually not a bad idea in cities that have those options where you can
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:32.440]   rent a car from a private party that owns that car that's kind of renting it out.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.320]   It's sort of like, I guess, the Airbnb of cars that can be an option.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.800]   In some cases, I've actually had to have clients that I've bought one car.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:44.360]   And this is happening a lot on, for example, like the Kia Telluride, most popular SUV
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.160]   out there and has been since they came out a couple of years ago.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:52.040]   But now trying to get one, I have one client that wants one, and I actually asked
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.280]   another client that I got one for last month if he could come see her car.
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.120]   Wow. Yeah.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.960]   I was like, well, my neighbor has one.
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.040]   Maybe they'll let me drive theirs.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.320]   Let's call and ask.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:06.640]   Wow. You have to get really creative right now if you want one of the cars that's
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:12.600]   just hot, hot on the market and they're pre-sold a couple of months in advance.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:17.080]   And I assume creative includes things like you might not get the color you want, the
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:20.880]   options you want. You might have to drive to pick it up or fly to pick it up.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:25.360]   Yeah, I have been transporting more cars across state lines.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:30.640]   You know, I have a client in Nebraska and we bought a car for her in Illinois and we
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.840]   shipped it across.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.000]   I've been doing so much of that.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.480]   And fortunately, I have a good relationship with a good auto transport company that
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.560]   does a great job with that.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:43.920]   But I have ordered and transported across state lines more cars in the last year than
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.160]   I have in the last 15.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.080]   Wow, that's crazy.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.160]   It's just nuts.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:53.440]   Someone told me that you've got to find the things that you can deal with like color
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:58.640]   right now. And the one question that I just didn't know the answer to is, is it easy to
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.760]   change the color of a car?
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:04.040]   Like if I find the perfect car and it's red and I just want a black car, do I just buy
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.440]   the red car and paint it?
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.400]   Is that a better deal than waiting for the black car to come up?
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:13.320]   Or is that like a terrible idea because of all the coating they put on cars these days
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.400]   that it's going to end up being really expensive?
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.560]   Anything can be done if you throw enough money at it.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.960]   But here's the thing about painting a new car.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:28.080]   Once you paint a car, you have destroyed the resale value because now it looks like the
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.440]   car's been wrecked. Like, why did you repaint this car?
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.880]   It destroys the resale value.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.760]   So you might consider something like a wrap.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.280]   You can get really cool vehicle wraps.
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.800]   Again, not inexpensive in any way, shape or form.
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:45.520]   You're going to drop, you could drop as much as, you know, three to ten grand, depending
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.280]   on how crazy a wrap you want.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.840]   But that's a way to get a different color.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.760]   It's not going to look the same as paint.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:58.720]   But if you want something that's just kind of interesting or funky or just different,
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.160]   yeah, you can wrap the car and then that doesn't hurt its resale value because the wrap
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.040]   just comes right off. But you can paint it if you want.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.200]   Just be aware that you've killed the resale value.
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:11.160]   And if you've leased the car, they will definitely frown upon that.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:19.080]   OK, so I'll separate the new versus used, and I have a couple of questions on each.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:25.080]   New seems to be a place where dealers are where you get new cars.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.160]   So it at least seems a little easier and approachable as to where.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:36.200]   If you wanted to buy a new car right now, do you have to reach out to four dealers, ten
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.720]   dealers, all the dealers?
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:41.160]   Is there a way to reach out to every dealer or see inventory everywhere?
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.600]   Or how do people start to think about finding a new car?
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.280]   You know, right now, I know it's hard, but even in the future.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:54.200]   Sure. Even in normal times, if we ever go back to something that's normal, you should
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:59.840]   always shop around to at least three or four different new car dealers just to find the
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:05.360]   best deal. That's how you're going to make sure that you get the best end to end deal
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.560]   because they all have different pricing strategies.
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.880]   Some may put accessories on the car, some might not.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:16.560]   There's really eight areas in any car deal where the dealer tries to make money off of
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:22.080]   you. So you've got to look out for yourself in all of those areas, not just negotiating
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.440]   the price of the actual vehicle that you're buying.
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:28.160]   It's a there's more variables in that equation than most people think.
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:34.120]   Right now, you may have to look at every dealer in your city.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:40.440]   Here, for example, in Charlotte, we've probably got nine Toyota stores within a 45
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.600]   minute radius of the city of Charlotte.
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.840]   You may have to go further out.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:52.920]   I have been literally looking at cars within probably a two to three hundred mile radius
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.560]   trying to find exactly what the client wants.
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:02.040]   In normal times, let's say you want the black car, but the dealer doesn't have a black
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.040]   car and you're not going to take the red car.
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.040]   Dealers do what is called dealer trading.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.280]   They will play musical inventory with each other.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:14.400]   Each dealership has a network of other dealers that are trading partners, and they'll
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.400]   call each other up and be like, hey, dude, you got this black one.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.200]   Can we have it? We'll give you this blue one.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.120]   And they do that all the time.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.400]   It's a standard in the industry.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:27.240]   And so if your dealer doesn't have the car you want, you can see if they can trade for
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.440]   it with another dealer.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:32.480]   That way, you're still buying from your local guy, which is more convenient for you.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:37.440]   And of course, obviously, that dealer wants to make the sale to you, but it just gives
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.640]   them access to more inventory.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:43.920]   Nowadays, what's happening in the industry with the lack of inventory, dealers are not
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.520]   trading with each other very much.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.640]   It's very difficult to make that happen.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:53.040]   So you as the car shopper must look at all the inventory out there.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:59.200]   And while your sites like Autotrader, Cars.com, you can shop for new cars there.
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:05.680]   Just keep in mind that the cars that are listed on there may not actually be available.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:10.760]   That car may have already sold and it just takes a while for it to fall off of that
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:17.360]   conglomerate site, or it might not be here yet, or it may be in transit to the
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.920]   dealership, but somebody else already has a deposit on it.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.200]   So you just you have to call around.
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:26.920]   So, for example, I have a client here in Charlotte that just on Saturday took delivery
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:34.520]   of his brand new red, he wanted the red one, Mazda CX-9, and it was a Grand Touring
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.400]   trim. Nobody had a red one.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.960]   The red with the tan interior is the most popular color for that car.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.680]   And there were just there were none.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:49.520]   I didn't see any in the production pipeline, didn't see any on the water, nothing.
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.720]   We couldn't do a dealer trade for it.
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:57.000]   Just on a whim, as a last ditch effort, so we didn't have to take a blue one that was
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.720]   coming into the port in Wilmington.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.080]   I'm like, I'm just going to look one more time.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:05.920]   And I found one on the website of a dealership in Winston-Salem, which is only two hours
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.120]   away. I'm like, oh, that has to be pre-sold.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.240]   And they were hiding it in the production system.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.800]   But I called. They're like, yeah, it should be here any day now.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.240]   It's not pre-sold.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.200]   I said, it is now.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.280]   Here's the credit card number for the deposit.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.720]   So, you know, it just took calling around.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:26.960]   Literally, I probably called 30 Mazda stores to find a car for this client, whereas before
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.480]   I would have had to have called three.
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:33.360]   And is calling the move or is email ever more effective?
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.960]   No, email is usually not as effective.
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:40.040]   You end up on the mailing list of every dealership in the country, which is and hitting
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.920]   the unsubscribe button doesn't seem to help.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.240]   But for me, I am also calling the general manager.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.120]   I'm calling the top boss in the dealership.
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.160]   I'm not talking to a salesperson.
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:53.160]   I go straight to the top of the food chain and have that conversation.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.640]   And that that gets me more places.
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:00.920]   Yeah. And but I have a different relationship because I'm inside the industry.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.400]   So I'm inside the boys club.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.160]   I speak their language. They know who I am.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.400]   So I can make those phone calls.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.640]   Yeah, I have cell phone numbers.
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:13.760]   What about those sites like Trucar, Costco's auto buying program?
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.720]   Are those useful in general?
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.520]   Useful now?
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:21.880]   I personally don't find them to be particularly useful.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.160]   You have to any of those.
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:30.000]   Sites, really, they are advertising sites for the dealerships.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:38.280]   So, yes, they may have a prearranged pricing deal with one or two dealers in your area.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:43.680]   That prearranged relationship may or may not be the best available deal in the market
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:49.840]   currently. And there's a lot of fine print that you have to understand if they don't have the exact
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.640]   make model, the exact options, the exact colors that you want.
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.760]   They don't have to honor that price.
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:03.240]   There's a lot of loopholes in those contracts for the dealers to not be required to honor that
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.880]   price that was displayed on the website to you.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:12.160]   And you're still on your own with your trade, your financing, all those other areas in the
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.440]   deal where the dealer makes money off of you.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.840]   And it doesn't include dealer installed accessories.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:23.760]   There's just a lot of areas where if the dealer is giving you a good price through that
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.720]   website, they are making it up somewhere else.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:32.080]   So that's why I personally don't find them helpful, because it's just maybe it maybe gives
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.440]   you five to ten percent of the whole puzzle.
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:38.440]   OK, and so we talked about a couple of sites.
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:43.120]   You mentioned Cars.com changing gears to used cars.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:48.440]   I feel like there's a lot more places to buy a used car than a new car.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.040]   And that could be Craigslist.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:55.280]   It could be all these new kind of car sites like Carvana.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.840]   It could be dealer inventory.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.360]   Is there a place that searches all of them?
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.160]   Do you have to do it all yourself?
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:06.080]   There's not one site that searches absolutely everything.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:11.200]   Your bigger sites like Autotrader and Cars.com, that's going to give you used cars at your
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.760]   franchise dealers, used cars at independent dealers.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.840]   And not every dealership has a relationship with both of those companies.
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:22.760]   So sometimes I'll see things on Cars.com that I didn't see on Autotrader.
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.480]   So I look at both.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:31.400]   You can see cars that are for sale by owner, and you'll usually get the better cars that
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:35.240]   are for sale by owner will be on those sites because you actually have to pay to advertise
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:40.120]   them. You know, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, those are free to advertise.
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:46.160]   And so there's a lot of junk out there and there's a lot of scammers out there.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:52.600]   Facebook Marketplace is I swear there are probably 20 percent of the cars listed there
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.840]   are scammers. So you really have to be careful.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:00.520]   And if you see in the description, don't chat me.
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.880]   I don't respond to chats.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:06.000]   Email this person and said, I'm selling the car for my aunt, my sister, my mother.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.120]   One hundred percent scam.
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:15.680]   Never, ever communicate with a seller outside of that platform because that means that
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.920]   they're not legit. If you have some conversations via that platform and then you start
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:23.280]   texting each other, you know, after you verified that you're both real, that's perfectly
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.080]   fine. But if it says in the description, don't chat me.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.480]   I'm selling it for my aunt, send her this email.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.600]   That is a 100 percent scam.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.280]   So you just have to be careful.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:38.160]   But depending on the price of the car that you're looking at, the more expensive cars are
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:41.200]   going to be advertised on AutoTraderCars.com.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:45.040]   If you're selling a car for 20 grand, it's OK to pay, you know, 30, 40 bucks to
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:49.720]   advertise it. If you're selling a $5,000 car, yeah, stick to Craigslist and Facebook
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:55.960]   Marketplace. For cities that still actually have classified ads in the paper
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:28:01.320]   newspaper, you can find some gems in there if you're looking for an inexpensive car,
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.880]   because the older crowd, you're retired folks.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:07.400]   Not all of them are on Marketplace or Craigslist yet.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:11.000]   They're still very old school and still there's still advertising that car that they
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.320]   drove on Sundays only.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.680]   That's in fantastic condition.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.160]   They might advertise it still in the paper.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.920]   Here in Charlotte, we don't have classifieds anymore.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.280]   I found that I was like, there's no classifieds.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:25.200]   So that's a dying thing.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.400]   But if you still live in a town that has newspaper classifieds and you need something
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.680]   cheap, take a look there first.
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.200]   You might find that diamond in the rough.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:39.000]   Wow. What about CarMax and Carvana and some of these like used car non-dealer kind of
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.800]   marketplaces or not marketplaces, but sales companies?
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.520]   Well, they are dealerships.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.160]   They're independent dealerships.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.120]   So they just have a little bit of a different model.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:51.160]   CarMax has the physical locations.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:54.320]   They were the first ones that really came into the industry and said, you know what?
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.440]   People hate haggling.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.920]   We're going to have a no haggle model.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.720]   That doesn't mean the car is a good deal.
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:04.240]   Their profit margin per vehicle is actually way higher than most dealerships.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:11.960]   But now we're seeing a new model of the online only dealerships.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.280]   They don't have a physical lot.
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.720]   You can't go look at the car.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:20.600]   And while I'm perfectly comfortable buying a lot of products off of Amazon, off the
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.600]   Internet and having it delivered to my house, and if it takes more than two days, I get
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:28.600]   pissed. A car you have to understand when you're buying from one of these dealerships,
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.040]   you don't even get to test drive it.
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:35.840]   You don't even get to see it until after you've already bought it.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:43.160]   Now, they have a caveat in there that says you have five days or seven days to return
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:50.480]   it. Be sure that you already have a pre-purchase inspection appointment scheduled
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:55.600]   with your mechanic within that window so that if you take that car, they bring it to your
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.480]   house, they drop it off the truck, you sign the paperwork, it's yours.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.280]   You've only got a few days to get that car inspected.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:07.920]   And if the mechanic finds a big problem with it that you can't live with, you've got
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:12.320]   to hurry up and get through that return process before that very short time window
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:16.800]   expires. And they're counting on 95 percent of the people not doing that.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:23.640]   But it violates, you know, one of my absolute just hard, fast rules in my world is you do
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:29.240]   not buy a used car without a pre-purchase inspection, you know, unless it's, you know,
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.240]   six months old and has three thousand miles and it's certified pre-owned from the
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.000]   dealership down the road and you can go look at it.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.080]   You need a pre-purchase inspection.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.720]   So I really applaud their business model.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.040]   It's a fantastic business model.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:45.520]   But you can you're taking on increased risk and you need to take the steps to mitigate
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:49.080]   those risks by booking that pre-purchase inspection within that window and getting it
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:55.480]   done. It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and the cracks start
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:00.320]   to emerge. Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.280]   manual processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.360]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.520]   Thirty seven thousand, twenty five, one.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:13.880]   Thirty seven thousand, that's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.840]   Oracle. And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:21.400]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining accounting, financial
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.680]   management, inventory, HR and more.
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:27.080]   Twenty five. NetSuite turns twenty five this year.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:31.880]   That's twenty five years of helping businesses do more with less, close their books in
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:34.600]   days, not weeks and drive down costs.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:38.200]   And one, because your business is one of a kind.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:43.800]   So you get a customized solution for all your KPIs in one efficient system with one
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:48.560]   source of truth. Manage risk, get reliable forecasts and improve margins.
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:52.960]   Everything you need to grow all in one place, which I can tell you from all the
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.720]   companies I've run, makes everything so much better.

[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:07.560]   consistently excellent performance, absolutely free at allthehacks.com/netsuite.
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:12.240]   That's allthehacks.com/netsuite to get your own KPI checklist.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:17.720]   allthehacks.com/netsuite, N-E-T-S-U-I-T-E.
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:24.200]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is actually so good
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:27.360]   for you, and nothing showcases that better than Pu-Erh tea.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.160]   It has so many health benefits.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:33.360]   And I think one of the best and easiest ways to consume it is from our sponsor today,
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:38.720]   Peak Tea. Peak's Pu-Erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:44.760]   leaves from 250-year-old tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:50.000]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals, and toxic
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.880]   mold commonly found in plants.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:57.040]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in pre-measured
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:02.360]   quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds and are so travel friendly.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:07.200]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green Pu-Erh
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:12.080]   for mental clarity and energy, and the black Pu-Erh, which helps kickstart digestion
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:16.840]   and metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so good and probably one of my
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.120]   favorite things to drink.
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:22.160]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research-backed benefits
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:26.560]   of polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more, and then be
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:30.880]   happy that Pu-Erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all other teas in the
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:35.280]   world, but you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak offers
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.680]   free US shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee.
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:44.480]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12 tea

[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:01.680]   Yeah, and if you're buying a car from a dealer out of state, I assume you don't get
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.440]   a refund.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:06.240]   Can you do these kind of pre-purchase inspections remotely?
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.800]   Is there any easy way to make that happen?
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.840]   Oh, yes, there is.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:13.920]   There is a wonderful third-party company that I have been working with since they
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:14.640]   started.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:18.320]   The original founder of that company started the company.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:23.960]   I found him, and he built a lot of his processes around what I needed, so I was
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:24.840]   really grateful.
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.400]   He's since sold the company.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.720]   It's called the Lemon Squad.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:30.040]   Okay, best branding ever, right?
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:35.680]   And you can just go online, and they have a network of ASC-certified mechanics that
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:37.160]   they send out to do the inspections.
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:40.520]   I have used them successfully from New York to California.
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:42.160]   I think it's a great company.
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.480]   There are other companies that do the same thing.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.960]   I just knew the owner, Andy, and their branding's great.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:51.240]   So I have sent them to look at cars in New York.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:54.160]   I've sent them to look at cars in California and everywhere in between.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:58.920]   There has not been a small town in the middle of nowhere USA that they have not
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.360]   been able to get a technician to.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:04.160]   They've had to charge extra in some cases because the technician had to drive an
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.600]   hour and a half out into a cornfield to see the car, but they got it done.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.120]   So it can be done remotely.
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:13.360]   There's a lot out there if you just know where to go.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:19.200]   And for someone who's never done a pre-purchase inspection, is this like $100,
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:19.640]   $500?
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.880]   What's a ballpark cost for getting a car inspected?
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:28.600]   If you take it to your local mechanic at home, they may charge anywhere from, you
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.640]   know, $90 to $120.
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.680]   It's usually around an hour of labor.
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:38.000]   The companies like the Lemon Squad, they charge more, but you don't have to go
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:38.400]   anywhere.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.640]   They charge, I think they charge maybe $170 or $180 for it.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:49.880]   I get a discount, so I only pay, I think, $130, but it's money well spent.
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.760]   And they give you this great report.
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:55.760]   They send you 4 million pictures, half of which you as an average person might not
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:56.880]   even know what it is.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.040]   Sometimes I'm looking, I'm like, what is that?
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.040]   Oh, that's the backside of the exhaust manifold.
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:03.680]   OK, no rust on it.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:04.040]   Yay.
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:07.360]   So they're very, very detailed.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.040]   Nice.
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:14.880]   And a few others, is the certified pre-owned, is that a thing worth paying
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:15.120]   for?
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:20.960]   I remember when I bought my car maybe 15 years ago, there were some CPO cars on
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:27.440]   the lot and some non, how important is looking at the certified pre-owned kind
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.800]   of label on a used car?
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:32.240]   The certified pre-owned does a few things for you.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:37.240]   It means that it met a set of standards for that manufacturer.
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:41.240]   What you have to understand is that doesn't mean the car is perfect.
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:46.440]   It doesn't necessarily mean that the car has not been in an accident.
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:52.200]   Each manufacturer has different parameters for what they will allow on a
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.280]   certified pre-owned.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:37:00.080]   So, for example, with Subaru, they have a list of, most of them have 150 odd
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.000]   things that they look at.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.800]   But for example, it can bend in an accident, but you can't have the accident
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:10.160]   effect more than two body panels.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:14.840]   So maybe if a bumper and a quarter panel were fixed from the accident, that's
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:18.920]   still okay, but if it was a hood and a bumper and a quarter panel, then they
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:19.880]   can't certify it.
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:25.040]   But each manufacturer is a little bit different and it doesn't mean the car is
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:27.560]   going to be cosmetically perfect.
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:34.680]   So it's good to try and get your hands on what those inspection criteria are to
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.200]   know.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:41.760]   And it gives you a certain amount of extended factory backed warranty beyond
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.480]   the original factory warranty.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:46.120]   But again, that varies by manufacturer.
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:50.000]   So a couple of certified pre-owned programs that I think are absolutely
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   worth it, Hyundai and Kia.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:58.440]   If you buy one brand new, you get the full five year, 60,000, what we call
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:59.280]   bumper to bumper.
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.400]   The lawyers don't let the dealers call it that anymore, but for you and me,
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.200]   bumper to bumper.
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.880]   But you get the 10 years or 100,000 miles on the powertrain.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.200]   That's your engine, your transmission, the expensive stuff that makes the car go
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:10.800]   back and forth.
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:16.040]   If you are the second owner, if you buy one used, you don't get that 10, 100
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:16.680]   powertrain.
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:22.600]   You only get the five year, 60, unless it's certified pre-owned, then you get
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:23.840]   that 10, 100 back.
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.720]   That's absolutely worth it.
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:33.920]   Audi, for example, if you only get one year extra, but you get unlimited miles.
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:37.920]   So if you drive a lot of miles every year, that's maybe worth it to you.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:42.360]   There are dealers up in New York that they don't certify any of their Audis,
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:46.120]   even though they could, the car's perfectly good shape would meet the
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.440]   certification criteria.
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:50.920]   But the dealers in New York are like, we don't need the mileage.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:51.720]   We need the time.
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.640]   Everybody goes to work on the subway.
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:56.160]   You know, they only put 3,000 miles a year on the car.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:01.640]   So it's not worth the nearly $2,000 that that certification costs.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:06.040]   Audi certification is more expensive than say Honda certification or Hyundai
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:06.920]   certification.
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:12.000]   So you have to look at what you get with that certified pre-owned warranty,
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.840]   because it varies dramatically across manufacturer.
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:18.560]   And then see, okay, how much extra am I paying for that?
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:22.280]   And is that worth it to you based on how you're going to use that car?
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:28.120]   But it's absolutely worth it with a Hyundai and Kia, Lexus, Audi and Porsche
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.320]   give you unlimited miles.
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.720]   So if you drive a lot, it can totally be worth it on those.
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:35.040]   Toyota, it's like, eh, that's nice, but you know, it's a Toyota.
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:35.920]   It's not going to break anyway.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:41.440]   So are there any hacks for finding cars?
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.440]   Is it auctions?
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:45.720]   Is it like getting on a list for dealer demos that are coming up?
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:49.400]   Are there are there things that you won't find on the internet that are worth
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:53.400]   pursuing to try to get a car before everyone else, especially right now?
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:57.400]   Auctions, most auctions are not open to the public.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:02.480]   The auctions that are open to the public are pretty scary.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:06.440]   Those are the cars that the dealers, nobody wanted those.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:10.000]   So you're basically getting, you know, the bottom of the barrel, you know,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.640]   police auctions, all that stuff is as is.
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:17.720]   And so unless you're very mechanically inclined, that's just the risk of
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.280]   getting something there is you're not going to get anything good.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.520]   It's going to take a lot of work.
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:29.200]   So the right now, really, it's about making phone calls and just pounding
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:33.680]   the pavement until you can find something and build a good relationship
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:37.360]   with a dealer so that you're saying, OK, you know, you don't have it on
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:41.240]   your lot right now, but you've placed an order for one of these.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:43.960]   It's supposed to be coming in sometime next month.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:49.080]   Get get your name on that car, pay that deposit so that they presell it to you.
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:50.960]   It really is pounding the pavement.
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:54.880]   I've got some different relationships because for me, it's an ongoing relationship.
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.360]   I've been working with some of these dealers for nearly 20 years.
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:03.680]   So a couple of weeks ago when one of my Telluride clients, we had very specific.
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:09.280]   Yes, she wanted the EX Premium with the captain's chairs in the wolf gray
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:13.440]   with the new nightfall package and all wheel drive, very specific.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.920]   And I just knew we were going to have to order one.
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:21.640]   But one of my dealers called me and said, I have exactly the car that you want.
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.720]   It was it arrived this morning.
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:27.240]   The person who placed the order backed out of the deal at the last minute.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.280]   Do you want it?
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:31.480]   You can have it without any markups or any dealer add-ons.
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.120]   And I said, yes, send me the paperwork.
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:38.840]   But you know, but I've known that dealer for 15 years.
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:42.920]   So for the rest of the world, you just have to pound the pavement right now.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.640]   And you may need to look at private party sales.
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:49.880]   A lot of people are like, hey, you know, I can get some good money for my car right now.
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:53.160]   But I tell you what, Carvana and Vroom and those online dealers,
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:57.080]   because they're not getting the cars from the rental fleets,
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.560]   which usually make up the bulk of their inventory.
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:03.160]   They are putting some crazy money.
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:06.760]   So if you've got a car that you don't really drive a whole lot and you're like,
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.040]   maybe I'll sell that.
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:09.240]   Now is the time to do it.
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:13.880]   You can make some great money by selling that car that you don't necessarily need.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:17.240]   Yeah, sell your second cars if you don't need it.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:17.740]   Right.
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:20.680]   Right now, we're like, we're going the opposite direction.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.960]   We're like, oh, we have a kid, a dog and people coming into town to visit the kid.
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.080]   Maybe we need two cars.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.200]   I'm like scared.
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.680]   But maybe we just sell the car and get a bigger car.
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:29.160]   There you go.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.080]   That might be the more economical thing to do.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:36.200]   While you can get great money for your trade-in, you know, you may have to apply that extra money
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:39.080]   to the new car that you're buying because the pricing has just kind of shifted.
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:41.080]   So yeah.
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:44.280]   So once you find the car, you're like, okay, I found the car.
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:47.560]   I feel like there's kind of two big questions for me.
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:50.200]   Is one, are you leasing or buying it?
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:54.200]   And then two is what's the price and negotiating?
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:57.160]   Do you want to make one of those decisions before the other?
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:00.120]   Do you want to negotiate it and then decide lease or buy?
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.960]   Or do you have to make the lease or buy first?
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:04.200]   I approach...
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:09.960]   I don't like to tell the dealers that it's a lease because when they hear that you want to lease,
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:11.720]   all they're going to give you is that monthly payment.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:14.920]   They think that that's all that matters to you.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:16.840]   And they're not going to give you any of the other numbers.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:20.360]   So I always negotiate the price of the car first.
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:25.080]   But keep in mind, some of the incentives from the manufacturer
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:28.120]   only apply to leasing or only apply to purchasing.
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:32.280]   So that final negotiated price may be different.
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:34.200]   But you bring that into the game later.
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:38.040]   I always negotiate the price, but I've done my research ahead of time.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:42.200]   So I know which rebates apply to leasing and which ones only apply to purchasing.
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:47.320]   So I'll go through that process, do some additional math on my own,
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:50.920]   and then go there and say, "Hey, let's look and see what that looks like on a lease."
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:54.120]   But if you don't negotiate that upfront,
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:57.400]   that lease that they give you is going to be based on full price.
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:58.760]   Wow.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:02.840]   And how does the average person negotiate the price?
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:09.000]   Does it go online and look at the value on Edmunds or another site?
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.320]   Is it working with the dealer?
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.680]   Are there tricks to get it done?
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.560]   I've helped friends negotiate cars,
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:19.480]   and I felt like I was a little clueless going in there with information.
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.640]   There's a couple different steps.
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.160]   You start with doing your homework.
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:28.040]   And that is researching what more or less price you should pay.
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.000]   Edmunds is great.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.240]   You want to look at, okay, what's the MSRP?
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:33.320]   Then what's invoice price?
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:37.080]   And the advertised invoice price varies a little bit.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:41.960]   It may not be 100% accurate because there are things like advertising money
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:45.800]   and some things like that that may come into play and may vary by region.
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:49.960]   But you can get a good idea of what the bottom line price is.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:52.120]   You need to see what types of incentives are there.
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:53.240]   Are there rebates?
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:56.200]   So, I research it on sites like Edmunds.
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:45:00.280]   I also go to the manufacturer's website directly to see what they advertise.
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:05.720]   And you can get about 75% of the information you need
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:09.880]   to effectively negotiate the price of a new car on those sites.
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:11.720]   I have access to additional information.
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:14.920]   So, I know some of the incentives that are secret,
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.720]   that go back and forth between the manufacturer and the dealer
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:19.720]   that the dealer may not tell you about.
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:25.400]   That's when step two comes in, and that is shopping around.
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:30.440]   As I said before, you need to shop to at least three or four different dealers
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:33.640]   to see just how low can you get them.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.200]   You just kind of make the rounds, make the rounds,
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.640]   and let them know you're shopping around
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:40.760]   and whoever gives you the best bottom line price.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:42.440]   But in the process of doing that,
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:46.360]   be sure you're asking them for a full numbers breakdown.
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:49.960]   They will just send you the price of the car.
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:52.360]   And then when you get into the dealership,
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:57.320]   you realize they've added on, you know, $2,000 worth of BS accessories,
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:00.440]   you know, window tints and paint protection
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:02.280]   and all that stuff that you didn't want.
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:06.600]   And their dock fee, and then you get into the taxes and tags.
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:11.000]   So, there's a lot of areas that the dealer can add on money.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.160]   So, they may have shown you a really low price for that car that you want,
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:19.480]   but that's because they are adding on a bunch of junk
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:22.040]   to the sale when you actually get in the door.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.760]   So, always ask for that numbers breakdown
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:27.960]   and get what the industry calls the out-the-door price.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:31.560]   Then you know, then you can compare apples to apples,
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:36.280]   because until then, one dealership may be offering you a price that's $2,000 less.
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:37.800]   And you're like, "Wow, that's a great deal."
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:40.040]   And you run into that dealership to close the deal,
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:43.480]   but they added $4,000 worth of junk to the car that you didn't need to pay for.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:45.960]   Yeah, never good.
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:49.880]   Are there things that are more negotiable, right?
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:54.200]   You know, if you do want some add-on accessories,
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:59.160]   are those much more negotiable than, you know, getting far below invoice?
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:01.480]   They can be.
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:04.840]   It just really depends on how you're structuring the overall deal.
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:10.280]   A lot of people ask a dealer to, "Hey, will you throw in a maintenance plan?
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:12.520]   Will you throw in rubber floor mats?
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:13.880]   Will you throw in..."
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:16.760]   Anytime you're asking the dealer to throw in something to the deal,
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:22.040]   that means that they had room in the deal to do that and still make money.
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:25.960]   So, I work with my dealers very transparently.
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.880]   We just work in true bottom line numbers.
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:33.240]   So, when I negotiate a deal on the car, that's our absolute bottom line number.
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:35.400]   They're not just going to be able to throw in anything else
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:38.920]   because I've eliminated their entire profit margin on the price of the car.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:43.000]   But they'll add on things like, "Hey, we want crossbars on the roof rails."
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:48.680]   Well, they'll do that at cost versus what the retail markup would be
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:51.320]   to add those accessories, things like that.
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:53.800]   You've really got to keep it all separate
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:56.600]   because they're going to listen to what's important to you.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:59.640]   It's like, "Yeah, if they can throw in a $600 maintenance plan,
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:02.680]   that means there was still a whole lot of profit in your deal
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:05.000]   that you were leaving on the table to start with."
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.680]   Are there any things that when you just want to get that last little bit out of the deal that
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:15.720]   some people might not think to throw in that are worth throwing in?
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:21.560]   For me, I remember with my car, when you bought a BMW at least 15 years ago,
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:24.520]   you only got one key that could remotely unlock the car.
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:26.280]   And so I remember whenever I told anyone, I was like,
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:28.200]   "Look, if you're going to negotiate one thing at the end,
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.120]   try to get them to throw in a second key."
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:32.840]   Are there other things like that that people should...
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:37.320]   If they're at the end and they feel like they think they've got as much as they could,
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:39.240]   there's one more good thing to ask for?
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:42.120]   Fortunately, the cars come with two keys now.
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:45.080]   So you don't have to worry about getting that second key.
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:48.920]   Used cars don't always come with two keys, but new ones do.
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:53.320]   If there's something that I can usually get thrown in at the last minute,
[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:57.400]   it'll be rubber floor mats because they can usually get those.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:59.320]   They're usually about $100 cost,
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:02.280]   but they might be able to take them out of another car that's already on their lot
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:05.960]   and then replace them and then add the price onto theirs.
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:10.440]   So that's something that occasionally will get thrown in at the very last minute.
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:11.720]   It's like, "Can we get some rubber mats?"
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:15.000]   And is there a better time to do this?
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.920]   Is this like, do it in the fall, do it at the end of the month, do it at the end of the year?
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:23.400]   Depends on the market for the vehicle that you're looking for.
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:28.280]   And again, all this goes out the window this year.
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:32.600]   So, you know, in a normal year, there are different times of year,
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:36.120]   like July is usually the best month to buy new pickup trucks.
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:40.520]   That is not going to be true likely this July.
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:43.960]   You're gonna be lucky to find any pickup trucks that are still on the lots in this July.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:46.520]   Waiting till the end of the month,
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:50.440]   and I tell people don't wait until the last day to start this process,
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:52.760]   because remember, this is a process, not an event.
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:55.800]   Give yourself a couple of weeks to go through this whole process.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:59.080]   But if you want to kind of get close to that last week of the month,
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:02.440]   so like right now, we're recording this on, what, the 24th.
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:04.280]   You know, we got basically one week left.
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:08.040]   That's when you can start pulling a little more of that pressure
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:09.640]   because they're looking at their numbers going,
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:13.080]   "Okay, we're running out of time to make these quotas that we want to make."
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:18.360]   So, as a periodic car shopper, as a retail car shopper,
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:21.320]   that can be of an advantage to you.
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:22.920]   I don't have to play those games with them
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:25.720]   because I buy so many cars that I can get the same deal usually.
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:29.640]   Now, you can wait till the second half of the month
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:33.720]   because the manufacturer is looking at their numbers.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:37.880]   And if they see, "Okay, we didn't do as much the first half of the month as we would like,
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:42.040]   so we're gonna add another $500 rebate for the second half of the month."
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:44.760]   So, you may be able to get a little bit of a better price
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:48.840]   if the manufacturer sweetens the pot in the second half of the month.
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:52.920]   And then this question that I've always wanted to know,
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:54.680]   and I've actually never been able to ask.
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:56.520]   When you're at the dealership, you know,
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:59.640]   back in times when we went in places in person more,
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:01.640]   and you've negotiated the price and the guy says,
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:04.280]   "Let me get back to you," and goes into the office in the back.
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:05.720]   What? Do you know what's happening in there?
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:09.640]   Are they just talking and then coming back out?
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:11.080]   Did they already know what they were doing?
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:14.040]   They are going to their sales manager.
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:19.800]   The salesperson that you interact with is only allowed to
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:23.720]   give you so much of a discount off the price of the car.
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:26.680]   So, when he says he has to go back and talk to his manager,
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:27.880]   that's actually true.
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:31.080]   And the conversation that they're having is,
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:33.560]   you know, he's telling his manager,
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:35.960]   he or she is telling the manager about the customer.
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.080]   Here's what's going on in the deal.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:38.200]   Here's what's important to them.
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:40.280]   And they're coming up with a strategy of
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:43.800]   how little of an additional discount can they offer
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:47.000]   and think you're still going to say yes.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.600]   So, they're coming up with an additional sales strategy.
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:53.720]   And sometimes the sales manager, you know,
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:54.920]   might come out and talk with you
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:56.280]   if they're busy that they won't.
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:59.720]   But that salesperson only has so much pricing,
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:01.080]   decision-making authority,
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:03.320]   beyond that it's above his pay grade.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.320]   And he has to literally go talk to his boss
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:06.520]   to see if he can get that.
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:10.600]   And sometimes the salesperson is actually negotiating
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:11.960]   with the manager saying,
[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:13.560]   "Dude, I really need this sale
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:16.840]   because I haven't met my quotas this month.
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:19.000]   And will you please do this for me
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.360]   so that I can sell it to this guy
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:22.600]   so I can make my numbers for the month?"
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:25.320]   So, sometimes they're actually advocating on your behalf,
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:27.480]   but they're trying to figure out, you know,
[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.720]   what can they come back with
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.320]   that you will likely say yes to
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:32.680]   that still makes them money.
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:35.720]   Remember, a dealership is a for-profit business.
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:37.080]   It's not a charity.
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:39.800]   It's, they're under no obligation
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:42.680]   to give you a zero-profit deal on a silver platter.
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:46.040]   That is why we go through this negotiating process.
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:47.560]   But if they didn't make any money,
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:48.840]   then their doors wouldn't be open
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:50.600]   and we wouldn't have anybody to buy cars from.
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:53.240]   So, that's why what's going on now
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:55.720]   is especially challenging for them
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:58.840]   because they're not making the money by volume.
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:00.840]   So, they have to make a higher profit
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:02.040]   on every car they sell
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:03.320]   because they're only selling a fraction
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:05.720]   of the number of cars that they normally do.
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:07.880]   And that salesperson still has bills to pay,
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:08.840]   as does the dealership.
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:14.760]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:17.000]   and Trade Coffee is a great addition
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.600]   to your new year routine.
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:21.000]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.600]   Trade is a subscription service
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:24.360]   we've been using for over a year
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:27.480]   that sources the best coffee across the country
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:29.720]   and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:32.600]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:34.200]   so you can enjoy their craft
[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:35.960]   from the comfort of your own home
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:39.160]   at a fraction of the cost of going out for coffee.
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:42.200]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with Trade.
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:43.480]   Sign up for a subscription
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:46.120]   or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:48.280]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:50.600]   just show up exactly when we need it.
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:51.720]   And over the past year,
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:54.520]   we've gotten so many great coffees from Trade.
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:55.960]   But this last bag of beans
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:58.600]   from Drink Coffee, Do Stuff in Tahoe,
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:01.240]   it's called Bark the Moon and it's so delicious.
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:03.640]   So jumpstart this year by signing up
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.000]   for a Trade subscription.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.240]   Right now, Trade is offering a free bag
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:09.080]   with select subscription plans
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:12.680]   when you visit allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:15.400]   That's allthehacks.com/trade
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:18.120]   for a free bag with select subscription plans.
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.440]   allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:24.680]   Do you all remember episode 122
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:26.760]   when I spoke to chef David Chang
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:28.920]   about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:31.240]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.840]   But one of his top hacks
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:34.680]   was using the microwave more.
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:37.080]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first,
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:38.600]   but after getting a full set
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:40.680]   of microwave cookware from Anyday,
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:42.120]   I'm a total convert
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:43.480]   and I'm excited to partner with them
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:44.360]   for this episode.
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:47.080]   Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:48.440]   to make delicious food
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:50.280]   from scratch in the microwave.
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:51.960]   And honestly, using it feels
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:53.480]   like a kitchen cheat code
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:54.600]   because it speeds up
[00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:57.160]   and simplifies the process so much.
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:59.560]   The cookware is 100% plastic free
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:02.360]   and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:03.960]   all in the same dish
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:06.120]   that happens to be dishwasher, freezer,
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:07.400]   and oven safe too.
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:09.080]   And if you need a recipe suggestion
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:10.920]   to kick off your Anyday adventure,
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:13.720]   I highly recommend David Chang's Salmon Rice.
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:15.000]   It is so good.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.080]   And if you haven't checked out
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:19.000]   the Matte Black Ayo Collection
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.280]   they launched last year,
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:22.040]   you have to check it out.
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:25.400]   So to get 15% off our new favorite cookware,

[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:33.800]   for 15% off.
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:36.920]   I just want to thank you, Quick,
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:39.240]   for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:42.040]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:46.520]   and discounts from our partners,
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:50.120]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.

[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:53.000]   those who support us.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.280]   - Yeah, I think, don't forget that, you know,
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:57.640]   anyone you're negotiating with,
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:59.640]   whether it's the customer service agent
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:01.720]   with the airline or someone at the car dealer,
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:02.840]   like they're all humans
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:05.160]   and they generally want to do better
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:06.760]   for people who are nice to them.
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:09.320]   And I've found, you know,
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:11.880]   I've observed people yelling at the salespeople
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:13.720]   at dealerships trying to get better deals.
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:14.520]   And I just tend to think
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:16.120]   that's probably not the right strategy.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:18.120]   - Exactly.
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:20.520]   And, you know, one of the things
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:22.440]   that I just, you know, have an advantage
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:25.320]   is that I buy more cars in a week
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:27.000]   than most people do in their lifetime.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.920]   So it's a different relationship,
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:32.680]   but it is the dealers that, you know,
[00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:34.280]   we're trying to create a win-win.
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:36.600]   So I'm not out to screw the dealers.
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:39.240]   Yes, I'm out to get the absolute best possible
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:41.960]   and then deal that I possibly can for my clients,
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:46.040]   but they can afford to give those discounts
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:48.920]   because, you know, I may buy six cars
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:50.680]   from one dealership this month.
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:52.440]   This time last year,
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:55.720]   I was actually the top salesperson, so to speak,
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:58.280]   for one of my local dealerships here in Charlotte
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:56:59.720]   because of the lockdown.
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:03.880]   I sold more cars than any of their internal salespeople did.
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:06.440]   - Wow, that's wild.
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:07.320]   - It was hilarious.
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:08.840]   - Bummer for those salespeople.
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:10.360]   - Bummer for them, yeah.
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:12.440]   But I tell you what, that dealer loves me now
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:14.600]   because I helped them stay afloat.
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:15.800]   - You're gonna be at the top of their list.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:17.400]   - Yeah, it was really nice.
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:19.720]   They do a good job for me, so they earn that business.
[00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:21.640]   It's not just given to them, they earn it.
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:23.800]   - Yeah, in a time like this,
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:27.400]   where prices are higher than they are normally,
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:30.600]   if I go to Edmunds and find out the invoice price,
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:33.320]   that maybe doesn't help me negotiate like I used to.
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:36.760]   If you know that you're gonna pay over,
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:38.680]   is there any way to kind of figure out
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:41.800]   what the best price is if you're not targeting
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:45.400]   a specific invoice price or something like that?
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:47.960]   - It's a matter of making those phone calls.
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:49.240]   Just call around.
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:51.960]   First of all, see who has the car that you want.
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:56.440]   It's honestly a can I find what I want game right now,
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:59.160]   not a can I get the best possible deal on it.
[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:02.440]   And then just, if you're flexible, you're like,
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:04.360]   yeah, I don't care, I'll take any color.
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:07.880]   Then it's about calling around and letting the dealer know,
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:09.720]   hey, I don't care what color it is,
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:12.360]   I just wanna get a decent deal.
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:14.120]   And make those phone calls.
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:18.280]   Call 10, 20 dealerships, literally,
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:21.000]   and see who will give you the best overall deal.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.640]   - And let's say I have decided,
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:25.320]   no, I actually want this one particular car.
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:28.040]   I call 30 dealers, only one of them has anything like it.
[00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:30.200]   And they give me a price.
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:31.480]   Do I just have to take that?
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:34.120]   I don't have an alternative.
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:38.760]   Is there a rule of thumb on what to come back with?
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:39.880]   Is it 10% lower?
[00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:43.320]   Is it 5% lower to try to get the best deal you can
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:44.680]   when you have no leverage?
[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:47.240]   - You can try, it never hurts to ask.
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:49.880]   But if they laugh and hang up on you,
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:53.960]   then 30 seconds later, someone else may have bought that car.
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:57.160]   So it's just, it's a decision that you've got to make.
[00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:00.200]   And that's what I'm being honest with people that,
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:01.960]   you know, I'm talking to now that say they want a car.
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:03.640]   I'm like, here's what's going on in the industry.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.320]   It's about finding the car.
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:07.080]   We do not have the leverage
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:09.000]   that we normally would in negotiating.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.800]   I cannot guarantee what kind of deal we can get,
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:14.520]   but I can guarantee that I will scour the earth
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:16.120]   to find what you're looking for
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:18.600]   and figure out what's gonna be the best way
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.120]   to get that to you.
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:23.800]   And I know a lot more avenues for obtaining the vehicles
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:25.080]   than you might know.
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:27.480]   But yeah, there's just sometimes where you just,
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:29.560]   if you want it, you gotta pay for it.
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:33.720]   You're always welcome to walk away and not get a car.
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:37.800]   - Yeah, so briefly coming back to leases,
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:42.120]   my understanding of how leases work at the highest level
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:43.880]   is you have a price,
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:46.360]   the dealer comes up with what they think it will be worth
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:48.520]   as a residual value after your,
[00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:49.720]   let's say three-year lease.
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:54.280]   And I've always assumed dealers are conservative, right?
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:55.640]   They don't wanna lose money.
[00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:58.440]   So if you're not gonna drive the car very hard
[00:59:58.440 --> 00:59:59.800]   and not gonna put a lot of miles on it,
[00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:02.920]   you're probably gonna overpay taking a lease.
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:04.520]   But if you're gonna drive right up to
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:05.560]   and not over the limit
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.280]   and your kids are gonna throw food all over the car
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:11.640]   and you really value just not having to haggle
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:14.360]   for a new car in three years, it could make sense.
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.960]   Or I guess if you can expense
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:17.560]   or write off your lease payments,
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:22.040]   is that kind of a general, the way it works?
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.480]   Or am I totally off?
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:26.120]   - Sort of, you have it partially right.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:29.400]   The dealerships do not set the residual value.
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.280]   - Okay.
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:31.880]   - The only thing the dealers get to do
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:33.480]   is decide the selling price.
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.240]   That's what you negotiate.
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.720]   The lease is based on the residual value,
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:42.120]   which is based on what they anticipate
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:45.560]   the car will be worth at the end of that lease,
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:46.280]   depending on,
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:49.720]   so whether you say you're gonna drive 10,000 miles a year
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:52.120]   or 12,000 miles a year or 15,000 miles a year,
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:53.880]   that affects that residual.
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:57.320]   That and what's called a money factor,
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:00.040]   which just think of that as leasing's equivalent
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.520]   of an APR, an interest rate.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.200]   That's what determines
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:05.640]   what that lease payment is gonna be.
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.880]   The dealers do not set those.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.600]   The captive finance companies do.
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.240]   So BMW Financial, Honda Financial,
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:16.280]   Southeastern Toyota Financial,
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:20.760]   the banks who hold the lease make those determinations.
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.200]   And those are not negotiable.
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:25.080]   If you don't drive a lot of miles,
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:27.320]   maybe you only drive 5,000 miles a year,
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:29.000]   even in non-pandemic years,
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.880]   then you don't necessarily need a 12,000 mile a year lease.
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:35.400]   You can say, "Hey, well, do you offer a low mileage lease?"
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:38.360]   Honda, Toyota, they normally don't.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:39.640]   They might go down to 10,000.
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:42.120]   Most of them are 12,000 is the lowest.
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:44.920]   Some companies will do a 10,000 mile a year lease.
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:47.400]   Your more expensive cars like Mercedes and BMW
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.840]   and Audi, Porsche, definitely,
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:50.680]   they have very low mileage leases
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:52.280]   'cause a lot of times people will lease those,
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.720]   but it's not their daily driver.
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:56.680]   So only by the number of miles
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:58.200]   that you think you're gonna need,
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:59.480]   maybe a little bit more,
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:02.440]   but that's a decision that you have to make.
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:06.120]   Leasing is a lifestyle choice.
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.360]   If you like to have a new car every three years,
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:11.800]   you don't like to deal with expensive maintenance items,
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:14.280]   and you don't drive a lot of miles per year,
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:15.880]   you may be a great lease candidate,
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:17.560]   and that's the right solution for you.
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:21.240]   If you do not use all the miles on your lease,
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:23.960]   one of the things that the leasing companies
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:27.400]   don't want you to know is that at the end of your lease,
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:29.160]   you don't just have to turn it in.
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.600]   They'll tell you you can either turn it in
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:31.960]   or you can buy it out.
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:34.840]   There is a third option in most cases,
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.480]   and that is you can trade in that leased car
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:39.720]   just like you would any other car
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:41.640]   that you have sitting in your driveway,
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:45.000]   because leasing is just another way to finance the car.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.840]   They pay it off, you negotiate a trade price,
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:51.000]   and they pay off the lease
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.400]   just like they would pay off the loan with the bank.
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:55.720]   It's really no different.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:58.840]   So that means if you didn't drive as many miles,
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:00.840]   you might have positive equity in that car
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:02.760]   when you go to trade it in.
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:05.880]   That positive equity should be in your pocket.
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.320]   You should be able to apply that
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:09.720]   to your next lease or your next purchase.
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:11.720]   But the leasing company doesn't want you to know that
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:14.760]   because they want that equity in their pocket.
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:16.440]   They wanna be able to turn around
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:19.800]   and sell it for more money than they were expecting.
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:21.880]   So that's one of the biggest secrets of leasing
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:23.960]   is you can trade in your leased car
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:25.720]   and keep that equity for yourself.
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.760]   You just don't mention to the dealer that it's leased
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.520]   until after you've already come up with
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.280]   that nice trade price.
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:35.480]   So do it all the time, been doing it for 20 years.
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:37.080]   It does work that way.
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:41.160]   - And I assume you could also go to these online sites
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.640]   you said that are paying top dollar right now
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:44.840]   and sell your lease to them.
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:47.000]   And you're not really selling the lease.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.040]   You're selling them the car
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:49.160]   and you're paying off the lease.
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:50.680]   But if they're gonna offer you more
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:52.200]   than the dealer will on the trade in,
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:54.040]   is that you could do that as well?
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:54.840]   - Absolutely.
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:56.440]   I did two of them last week that way.
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:58.520]   - Okay, wow.
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:01.800]   And if you have a car that's up for lease right now,
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:03.800]   given how high prices are,
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:06.760]   even if you didn't put half them,
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.600]   I mean, even if you hit all the miles,
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.520]   you might be better off doing this
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:13.720]   because used cars are just so much more valuable this year
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:14.680]   than they have been before.
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:16.040]   - Absolutely.
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:19.160]   I always tell people about a month
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:22.040]   or about two months before your lease comes due,
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.280]   start looking at the market value of your car
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:27.560]   to see if you have any positive equity.
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:29.000]   Because yes, that's absolutely true.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.800]   But especially right now with the crazy money
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.720]   that the cars are bringing,
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:35.880]   even if you're slightly over your miles,
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:38.200]   you may still be able to get out of it cleanly,
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.680]   trading it or selling it to a place like Vroom
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:43.240]   or Carvana that's paying crazy money
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:46.680]   versus actually having to pay money to the leasing company
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:48.120]   because you're over your miles.
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.200]   There's a lot of options right now.
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:52.600]   A few of the manufacturers have been,
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:54.600]   I've heard whispers, I have not confirmed this.
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:56.760]   So please take it with a grain of salt.
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:59.160]   But I've heard of a couple of manufacturers
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:02.120]   saying that they're not gonna allow you
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:04.040]   to sell your car to someone else,
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.320]   trade it into a different dealer
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:07.480]   other than one of their own franchise dealers
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.560]   because they know that Vroom and Carvana,
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:11.720]   those companies are "stealing their cars."
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:14.200]   I have not confirmed that.
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:16.760]   I'm not even sure it's legal under the contracts.
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:19.480]   But that may be something.
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.160]   That is something that they told me.
[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:22.920]   They're like, "Oh no, you're not gonna be able to sell that."
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:25.000]   I'm like, "Yeah, I'm gonna still try anyway
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.760]   because I don't think you're telling me the truth."
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:29.240]   And if you had enough money,
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:31.080]   you could always just buy it and sell it.
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:34.920]   Even if they offered that or change those rules,
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:36.920]   they're still not gonna stop you from buying it.
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:39.000]   Correct. You could always buy it out from them.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.800]   You just have to pay it off or get another loan for it.
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:43.560]   Yeah, you can do that.
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:45.400]   But that's why you don't wanna wait
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.560]   until two days before the leases do.
[01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:48.920]   Give yourself a couple of months
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:50.760]   because there is a process
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:52.840]   and it does take typically seven to 10 days
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:54.600]   for it to get fully paid off, et cetera.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.160]   And so forth.
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:56.600]   But yeah, absolutely.
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:59.160]   And those companies will tell you
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:01.240]   if you go on to one of those online dealerships
[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.560]   and fill out a form to get the quote on your car,
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.960]   they ask if it's a clear title,
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:07.000]   meaning you own it outright
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.920]   or if there's a loan or if it's a lease.
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:10.520]   And if for some reason it's a lease
[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:11.720]   and they are not allowed to buy it,
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:12.360]   they will tell you.
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:15.880]   Okay. And here's one.
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:18.440]   If two people bought the same car,
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.360]   one leased it for three years,
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:24.040]   one just bought it outright or financed it,
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.400]   and then three years later,
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:27.080]   the leased person goes, trades it in,
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:28.360]   buys another car,
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:29.640]   and the other person goes in
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:31.480]   and just trades it in and buys another car.
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:34.920]   If you value that ability
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:37.080]   to trade cars every three years,
[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.160]   are you getting a better deal with leasing
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.760]   or is it just kind of easier?
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:42.760]   You're getting a better deal
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:44.440]   usually depending on the car
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.520]   because with leasing,
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:48.280]   you're only paying for the portion of the car
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:49.080]   that you're using.
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:51.320]   So you're financing three years
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:53.160]   and 36,000 miles of the car
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:55.880]   versus financing the entire value of the car.
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:57.880]   That's why those lease payments are lower.
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:01.240]   But I urge people to reconsider
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:02.920]   if they're only looking at leasing
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:04.440]   to get a lower payment,
[01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:06.760]   they're using it as a financial strategy,
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.040]   they're asking for trouble
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.880]   because if they don't know
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:11.320]   how many miles a year that they drive,
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:13.240]   I just see so many people
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:14.520]   get in trouble leasing,
[01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:16.680]   particularly realtors, people in sales
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:19.320]   that want to drive that luxury car
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:20.680]   to project a certain image.
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:22.440]   And I respect that as a business owner,
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.760]   but they also drive 30,000 miles a year
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:25.480]   and they don't realize
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:27.480]   that their $12,000 a year lease,
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:29.560]   you know, they get to the end of their lease
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.080]   and didn't realize that they are now,
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:33.080]   you know, 60,000 miles over the lease
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:34.920]   and now they actually owe,
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:37.720]   you know, $15,000 in overage charges.
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.800]   So you can get yourself in trouble leasing,
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:40.760]   there are more risks.
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:43.080]   But if you're a good lease candidate
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:44.840]   and you do just want a new car every three years,
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:46.120]   yeah, it can be an excellent option
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:47.240]   and you'll pay less money.
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:49.160]   If you're in that circumstance
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:51.160]   where you just totally blew over the miles
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:53.240]   and the dealership wants to charge you
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:54.440]   a huge penalty,
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:55.560]   are you ever better off
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.320]   just buying the car and selling it
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:59.480]   than paying the penalty for going over?
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:00.360]   Very often, yes.
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:03.000]   And I tell people that in most situations,
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.560]   you can actually refinance the car
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:06.840]   directly with your bank.
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.200]   You don't necessarily have to go
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.840]   to the dealership and buy it out
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:12.440]   because that saves you typically
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:14.840]   $1,000 to $2,000 in bogus fees
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:16.600]   that you don't actually have to pay.
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:17.800]   Call your bank directly,
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:19.000]   especially if you have a credit union,
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.160]   say, "Hey, I want to refinance my lease."
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:23.480]   Interest rate is going to be a little bit higher.
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:25.320]   It'll probably be about the same
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:26.280]   as buying a used car.
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:29.000]   But they'll be able to do that whole process with you
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.040]   without the dealer charging you all their fees
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:35.000]   on top of just the price of the car.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.080]   So when I bought my most recent car,
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.440]   I found that the financing rates
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:42.200]   from the dealership weren't great.
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:45.320]   And so I ended up going to a credit union.
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:46.360]   Is that normal?
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:48.840]   I see all these ads about 0% APR.
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.960]   Should people be shopping those interest rates around?
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.320]   Or is it really like,
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:55.160]   if it's not 0%, go elsewhere?
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:57.400]   If you have excellent credit,
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:00.920]   anytime you see those 0% or 0.9, 1.9,
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:01.960]   those are being offered
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:05.080]   by the manufacturer's captive finance company
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:06.360]   to help sell cars.
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:09.240]   But you have to have excellent credit to get those,
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:12.360]   typically 720 credit score or above.
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:15.000]   So if you don't qualify for them,
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.320]   then absolutely go to your credit union.
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:20.440]   If they don't have one of those special APRs
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:21.800]   and they just have normal rates,
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:24.520]   the dealers have relationships with multiple banks,
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:27.000]   sometimes even with credit unions in your area.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.840]   It doesn't necessarily hurt to let them shop your rates
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:32.600]   'cause they're only pulling your credit once.
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.600]   And then they'll look and see based on your credit,
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.280]   they know which of their banks to talk to.
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:40.120]   But getting pre-approved through your own credit union
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:42.440]   or your own bank is always a good step
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:44.360]   'cause then you know you've got something in your pocket
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:45.400]   and you can go to the dealer and say,
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:47.320]   "Hey, can you beat this rate?"
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:51.640]   - It was kind of a pain to get my pre-approval
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:54.360]   and then they had to like mail the check to the dealership.
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:55.960]   I did feel like it would have been easier
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:56.920]   if I went with a dealer,
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:00.600]   but in this case, it was like 3% or 4% versus 1.5%.
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.600]   And so I just-
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:06.760]   - And different banks have different processes.
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:09.720]   More and more of them are getting with the times
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:12.040]   and can get things done faster.
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:14.760]   Very few have to mail a paper check anymore,
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.440]   but there are still those few little credit unions
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.360]   that are still operating in 1976.
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:21.160]   So then you just have to decide,
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:24.760]   the money that I'm saving worth the extra hassle or not.
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:29.240]   - Yep, and last big one is when you're done,
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:31.240]   let's say I've decided I found the car I want.
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:34.440]   I didn't lease my car, so I just have a car to get rid of.
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:38.040]   I've always logged into Kelley Blue Book and searched.
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:39.800]   And I'm like, "Man, the trade-in price
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:42.200]   is always so much worse than that private party price."
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:44.680]   What do you tell people to do
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:47.240]   when they have a car they don't need
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:48.840]   and they want to get rid of it?
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:49.960]   Do you just trade it in?
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:52.040]   Do you try to clean it up and detail it
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.000]   and sell it yourself?
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.240]   What's the best way to get rid of a car,
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:58.400]   maximize your money and reduce your hassle?
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:02.440]   - Right now, you can get any of these online companies
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.920]   because they're buying them for crazy money.
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.920]   In normal times, it's always a trade-off.
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:09.400]   Yes, you can typically get more money for your car,
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:12.840]   selling it privately, listing it yourself on AutoTrader
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:14.600]   or Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace.
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:17.640]   A lot of times, it depends on how much that car is
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:18.440]   to begin with.
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:20.360]   If it's a $30,000 car
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:22.680]   and you might make a couple extra thousand dollars,
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:24.280]   you don't necessarily need to
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.360]   because you're not trying to pay off a loan
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:28.760]   that you still owe $32,000 on.
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:30.680]   Then you have to decide,
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:33.880]   "Is it worth the amount of work that I have to do
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:36.760]   to sell it and list it and deal with all the yahoos
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.680]   that call you, half of whom are not serious,
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:39.720]   the other half are scammers?"
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:41.480]   Going through that process,
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:43.880]   is that worth it to you for the extra money
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:46.440]   that you're gonna make or is it not?
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:47.880]   For a lot of people, it is.
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.160]   And then, yeah, they clean it up
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:50.920]   and they go through that process and they sell it
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:52.680]   and they pocket that extra money.
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:53.560]   Other people are like,
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.320]   "I just don't even wanna deal with it.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:56.520]   I wanna unload it."
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:58.360]   Maybe the car has some problems
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:01.320]   and it's gonna be harder for them to sell,
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.800]   in which case you just sell it to a dealer.
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:06.920]   If it's an older, higher mileage car
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:09.160]   that maybe has the occasional issue.
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:12.200]   Sometimes we pawn it off on CarMax.
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:14.360]   They actually own their own auction house.
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:16.680]   So sometimes on the older, higher mile cars,
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:17.800]   they can put more money on it
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:20.040]   because they don't have to pay to haul it to auction.
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.080]   They have their own auctions.
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:23.080]   So that can be a good option as well.
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:26.600]   It really depends on what that car looks like
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:29.560]   to know exactly where to sell it.
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:30.520]   Sometimes you could even,
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:33.560]   if it's a good car, shop it around to different dealers.
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:36.040]   Some might pay $2,000 more
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:39.800]   just because you're selling your Toyota to a Toyota store
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.960]   versus you're selling your Toyota to a Honda store next door
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:44.360]   that can't sell three-year-old Toyotas
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.200]   with all those certified pre-owned ones next door.
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:48.360]   So again, it takes shopping around.
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:49.720]   - Okay.
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:52.440]   And those online dealerships, that's Carvana, Vroom,
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.120]   are there any other ones people should be looking at?
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:56.200]   - You know, you'll have to Google.
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:57.720]   Those are the two that I've been looking at.
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:00.360]   I've been selling to Vroom lately
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:05.160]   because they have been getting through the process a lot faster.
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:06.680]   I think Carvana might come up with a good offer,
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:08.360]   but then you don't hear from them for three weeks.
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:09.880]   Vroom has been getting it through the process
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:12.120]   and people have had checks in their pockets really fast.
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:14.920]   And I was very impressed with how they were handling it.
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:16.840]   So that's the direction that I have been going.
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:17.960]   This is all very new.
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:20.040]   And quite frankly, I'm learning as I go as well.
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:21.160]   - Okay.
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:26.600]   Any other car auto tips, tricks, hacks,
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:28.440]   nothing that doesn't have to be about buying,
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.880]   could be about maintenance, avoiding speeding tickets,
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:33.640]   anything that you just love to share.
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:38.360]   I know you race cars, so I'm sure you have tips there.
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:41.000]   Anything outside of the buying and selling process
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.360]   that you love to share?
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:45.080]   - I clearly do not have any tips
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:46.760]   for getting out of speeding tickets.
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:49.880]   If you look at my record, I just have a really good attorney.
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:51.480]   So we won't go there.
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:55.160]   But one thing about used cars
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:58.600]   is always get a Carfax report.
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.920]   Always, always, always.
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:03.160]   It's if you have to buy it yourself for 30 bucks,
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:06.440]   it is well worth it to know what that history is.
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:08.840]   And you're not just looking at, was it in an accident?
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:11.080]   There's actually 30 different pieces of the data
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:12.520]   that I look at on a Carfax.
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:16.200]   So you might find that it's a car from Canada.
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:18.120]   It's gonna have a lot of rust
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:21.080]   and it's gonna be all be in kilometers instead of miles.
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:24.280]   And you may find that it's got kind of a hanky history.
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:27.720]   It was in a state that has hurricanes
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:29.240]   and then they moved it to a state
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:31.960]   that doesn't have requirements on the titles
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:33.480]   to report those things.
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:34.840]   And then it went back to another state.
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:39.640]   So it basically laundered the title of flood history.
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:41.880]   There's so much data that you can glean.
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:44.040]   And Carfax is the best.
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:45.000]   They're the oldest company.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.440]   They have the most reporting relationships.
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:48.200]   So you're gonna get the most data from them
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:50.280]   versus AutoCheck or one of the newer companies
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:52.440]   that just doesn't have as much information.
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.760]   So in my world,
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:57.800]   getting a Carfax report on a used car is non-negotiable.
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:59.240]   I have to have that or I won't buy it.
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:00.760]   - Okay.
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:02.520]   So I remember you saying earlier
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.680]   that there's these eight areas of negotiating.
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:06.680]   We don't need to go through all of them,
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:08.840]   but this is all something you do.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:10.280]   Can you talk for a couple minutes
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:12.440]   about how you help people do this?
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:13.240]   What's that model?
[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:14.360]   - Absolutely.
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:17.080]   Our process is called My Perfect Car.
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:19.880]   And we look at your unique lifestyle, budget,
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:22.120]   and personality to help figure out
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:23.960]   what car are we even buying?
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:25.640]   Are we buying new versus used?
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:28.200]   Are we buying or releasing a loan cash?
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:29.800]   We look at that whole picture to figure out
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.560]   what's the right way to solve this puzzle
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:34.920]   for your lifestyle and to get you what you want.
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:37.160]   And I typically narrow it down to two or three cars
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:39.240]   that I think would be perfect for you.
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:41.320]   And then I can set you up on test drives
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.080]   so that you can get your butt in the seat.
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:44.360]   So we have a saying here,
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:46.200]   "Comfort is in the butt to the beholder."
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.680]   So you gotta get in the car and see how it feels.
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:51.480]   And then once you decide what you like best,
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:54.040]   then we'll scour the earth to find it,
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:55.400]   go through all the negotiating,
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:56.920]   handle your trade, your financing,
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:59.640]   looking at all eight of those areas in the deal
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:01.640]   to find the best overall deal for you,
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:04.040]   as well as the best customer experience.
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:06.360]   And we'll work with the dealer then
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:07.960]   to get all the paperwork together.
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:10.680]   Sometimes we can have the car delivered to your house.
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:12.200]   If you have to go to the dealership,
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.600]   we make sure they have everything done ahead of time.
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:17.240]   We've had a conversation about all those extras
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:19.560]   that they might want to try and ambush you with
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:20.600]   in the finance office.
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:23.560]   So if they are anything like an extended warranty
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:24.440]   or something that you want,
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:25.640]   I've pre-negotiated those.
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:26.840]   That way there's no surprises
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:28.920]   and you can get in and out as quickly as possible,
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:31.640]   sign papers, take the keys and get back on the road.
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:34.120]   So it's a true end-to-end service,
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:37.240]   a lot like a buyer's agent in real estate.
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:40.360]   - And how are you compensated in this process?
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:42.520]   - We charge our clients a flat fee up front
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:43.800]   when we sign the contract.
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:46.120]   So I'm not tied to the price of the car
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:47.960]   in any way, shape or form.
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:50.440]   It's just a flat fee for the perfect car package.
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:52.040]   And if you're interested,
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:55.400]   people can contact us at our website at thecarcheck.com
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:59.160]   and sign up for a 15-minute complimentary car chat
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.440]   to talk about your situation
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:02.840]   and just see if we're a good fit to work together.
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:04.360]   Not everybody's a good fit for us.
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:06.120]   We're not a good fit for everybody.
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:07.240]   But the worst thing that happens
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:08.760]   is you walk away from that conversation
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:09.880]   with a lot of good advice
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:11.800]   and we point you in the right direction.
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:15.160]   - Yeah, and hopefully everyone listening
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:17.000]   walks away from this with a lot of good advice.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:17.720]   I know I have.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.840]   Is there anywhere else people should find you online?
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:25.000]   - They can go directly to thestraightshift.com.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.920]   Don't forget the F in the last word.
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:29.320]   And they can also get to that.
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:32.440]   We have the podcast link on the website, thecarcheck.com.
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:36.840]   So we've got about 76 episodes out there
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:39.400]   on a variety of car-related topics.
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:41.960]   So I'm passionate about educating people
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:44.840]   and helping them to get the information that they need
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:47.000]   to empower them to make smart financial decisions
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.280]   for themselves when it comes to buying,
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:49.560]   selling and maintaining their cars.
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:52.280]   'Cause there's just so much confusing information out there.
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:54.760]   And so that's why we named the podcast The Straight Shift.
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:57.160]   'Cause I am always gonna tell it to you straight,
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:58.840]   whether it's what you wanna hear or not.
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:01.160]   But I want you to have the right information
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:02.920]   to make good decisions for yourself and your family.
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:04.360]   - Awesome.
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:05.960]   Well, thank you so much for being on here.
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:07.000]   This has been fantastic.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.200]   - Well, thanks for having me, Chris.
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:09.080]   I really appreciate it.
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:10.600]   - That was awesome.
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.520]   And thank you so much for listening.
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.760]   I know my mom has a lease coming up in the next few months.
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:16.840]   So I'm pretty sure I might be able to save her some money.
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:20.360]   And as always, links to everything we discussed
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:22.600]   are in the show notes at allthehacks.com.
[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:25.960]   I also wanna say thank you to all the listeners
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:27.480]   who've been reaching out with questions,
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:29.560]   their favorite hacks and ideas for guests
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:30.840]   to have on the show.
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:33.240]   I really love hearing from all of you.
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:35.240]   You can always find me on Twitter
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:37.400]   or you can email Chris at AllTheHacks
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.240]   and reach out about anything.
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:40.440]   I'm already starting to think about
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:41.960]   how to build out this community,
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:44.520]   whether that's a Facebook group or part of Substack,
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.760]   where the newsletter is or something else.
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:47.880]   So stay tuned there.
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:49.800]   And speaking of the newsletter,
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:52.280]   I just sent the first episode out yesterday.
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:53.640]   So if you're not subscribed,
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:55.880]   you can do that on the right side of our website
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:58.280]   or at allthehacks.com/newsletter.
[01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:01.720]   Finally, to everyone who's left a reviewer rating,
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:03.240]   thank you so much.
[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:05.080]   If you haven't yet, it's never too late
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:06.360]   and it'd really help out the show.
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:07.880]   Have a great week.
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:19.480]   (upbeat music)
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:24.120]   I wanna tell you about another podcast I love
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:26.440]   that goes deep on all things money.
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:28.120]   That means everything from money hacks
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:30.280]   to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:32.520]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:35.400]   and it's much more about building generational wealth
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:37.560]   and spending your money on the things you value
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:40.440]   than it is about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:42.440]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew,
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.600]   who truly believes that everyone in this world
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:47.320]   can build wealth and his passion and excitement
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:49.800]   are what make this show so entertaining.
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:53.640]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022,
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.640]   but recently I listened to an episode
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:57.880]   where Andrew shared 16 money stats
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:59.240]   that will blow your mind.
[01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:02.840]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:05.880]   are not participating in their employer's retirement plan.
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:09.560]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:12.280]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:14.920]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:17.800]   to help you get better with your money and grow your wealth.
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:19.880]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:22.200]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:23.880]   on Apple Podcasts, Spotify,
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:26.520]   or wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
