[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.880]   We open the week with a question from Vincent, a podcast listener.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.320]   He writes in with a very good question.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.680]   "Pastor John, can a person who doubts his salvation seek to be married, or should he
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.600]   wait until his assurance is more settled before pursuing a wife?"
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.760]   What would you say, Pastor John, to Vincent about assurance and the desire to be married?
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.600]   Desiring to be married in and of itself is a good desire.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.840]   It can be bad, can be a bad desire, if the motives that are controlling it are bad.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:49.720]   For example, if the desire to be married is not controlled by the good of the other person
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.320]   and the glory of Christ.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.400]   If a person says, "It's not about the good of the other person, it's not about the glory
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.560]   of Christ, it's just about me and my desire for sex or companionship," then the desire
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.720]   is bad.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:15.480]   So there are always big issues to settle before one can pursue a desire for marriage that
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.680]   pleases God.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:25.000]   Do I love the glory of God more than my own earthly pleasures?
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.800]   That's the crucial question.
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:35.640]   Is the glory of God a greater pleasure to me than the pleasures that marriage offers?
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:44.720]   And do I love the other person, this fiancé, more than I love my own earthly pleasures?
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.440]   I mean, horrible things can happen in marriage.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.640]   Are you just going to walk away from her if she doesn't quite give the same pleasure she
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.400]   once did?
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:02.480]   Do I find it more blessed to give to her than to use her for my own private good?
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:09.880]   Now, those are the big preliminary questions Vincent must ask.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.400]   And the sticking point for him is that he is doubting that he is a child of God.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.400]   He's doubting that he's justified, saved, forgiven.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.000]   Assuming that he's talking about himself.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.840]   He might be asking about somebody else, but I'm just going to assume that he's talking
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.840]   about himself.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.520]   He wonders if that should check his search for a marriage partner, or maybe he's in a
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.080]   relationship and check his moving forward toward marriage.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.800]   And I think the answer will become clear to him if he asks the question this way.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:53.120]   In my doubt, will I glorify Christ by entering marriage this way?
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.720]   And will I be able to love this woman by bringing her a heart that doubts the reality of my
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.920]   salvation?
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.360]   He might see the matter even more clearly if he puts himself in her shoes.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:18.840]   Should she marry a man whose heart is not sure that he's a child of God?
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:26.380]   My answer is that I would never counsel a Christian woman to marry a man that had this
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.680]   spiritual condition of not knowing if he's in the Lord.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:40.380]   Because when Paul said to the Christian woman in 1 Corinthians 7, verse 39, "She is free
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:52.480]   to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord," he did not mean one may marry in
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.960]   the Lord, but also one may marry one who might be in the Lord.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.600]   I don't think he meant "might be in the Lord" when he said "only marry in the Lord."
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:12.360]   So the Bible would say to this man's fiancée or future partner, "Don't marry him in
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.880]   this condition.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:21.560]   You need good assurances that he is your soulmate at the most important level of existence,
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.280]   namely is he in Christ like you are in Christ?
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.400]   Is he born again?
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.880]   Is he a child of God?
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.240]   Does he live under God's authority?
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:38.760]   Is he committed to loving you as Christ loved the church because he's in Christ and has
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.320]   that kind of spiritual capacity?"
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:49.400]   And if that's God's good purpose for this woman, then Vincent, for her sake, for her
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:58.600]   sake should put the brakes on his relationship with her and give himself to the spiritual
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.920]   work of having the cloudiness of his spiritual vision taken away.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.800]   That's what he should pray for.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.800]   That's what he should pursue with all of his might.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.280]   So let me close by just encouraging you, Vincent, with a few passages of Scripture.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:23.920]   Number one, "Seek me and you will find me," God says, "when you seek me with all your
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.920]   heart."
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.520]   I want you to be encouraged that you can know.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.080]   He will be found by you.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.240]   Go on seeking.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:40.880]   Or 1 John 5, 13—that was Jeremiah 29, 13—1 John 5, 13, "I write these things to you
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.880]   who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know, that you may know that
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.120]   you have eternal life."
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.120]   God wants you to know, not have your fingers crossed or wonder.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:59.200]   And the last one would be Hosea 6, 3, "Let us know.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.800]   Let us press on to know the Lord.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.440]   His going out is sure as the dawn.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:12.440]   He will come to us as the showers, as the spring rains that water the earth."
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.920]   So make this, Vincent, make this your top priority.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.920]   Not marriage.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.880]   Put marriage down a level.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:27.200]   Make this your top priority, and you will be glad that you settled them in that order.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   Amen.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.760]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.280]   Tomorrow we have an interesting question.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.720]   "There are small bits of the New Testament that are in our Bibles but probably should
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:44.720]   not be there, or at least are seriously contested as to whether they should be there or not."
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.040]   And Pastor John is going to wrestle with that tomorrow.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.320]   What does that do for our confidence in the Bible itself?
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.960]   It's just one of many great, deep, thoughtful questions that we get from listeners like
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.320]   you.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.040]   And if you have a question for us, go to our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn,

[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.240]   You can also find links to our podcast feed as well.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.960]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, Pastor John, and I will see you tomorrow.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:12.960]   Amen.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:12.960]   Amen.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.960]   Amen.
