[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.560]   ♪
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.500]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight,
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.640]   and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.740]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:47.780]   Today's show features the discussion on the freedom of frugality.
[00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.280]   In the most recent two episodes of Radical Personal Finance, I've talked extensively about living rich.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.760]   I've talked about eschewing frugality.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:03.560]   I've talked about focusing on how money is something that is ultimately renewable, but time is not.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.640]   So I want to balance those shows with a discussion on the value of frugality,
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.340]   and what I would say the freedom of frugality.
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.080]   We're going to begin with a thought experiment.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.280]   Here it goes.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:24.820]   Let's pretend that you are enrolled in a program where you're guaranteed to receive,
[00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.120]   for the rest of your life, without question, guaranteed, every single month,
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.900]   to receive a monthly check for $10,000.
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.800]   Call it a UBI payment, right?
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.600]   Universal Basic Income payment.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.400]   UBI is increasingly a point of conversation in our modern world,
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.840]   currently mostly associated with the liberal set of ideas.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.180]   The idea is that, hey, the government should pay everyone a basic income
[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.080]   so that everyone can at least have some kind of living wage that they could live on,
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.580]   and that would free them up.
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.380]   Usually considered to be a liberal idea in the current political climate,
[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.080]   but not necessarily.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.220]   There have been libertarians for decades who've been arguing for UBI.
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.420]   So let's just assume it's UBI, and let's pretend, for the sake of my little thought experiment,
[00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.420]   that you actually trust it.
[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.100]   You actually believe that, yeah, they're actually going to pay me this money every month for the rest of my life.
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.000]   They're not going to stop it when the next administration comes in.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.980]   They're actually going to pay it to me every month for the rest of my life.
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.680]   So pretend that you earn $10,000 or you receive $10,000 every month for the rest of your life.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.180]   Here's my question.
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.980]   How much money would you spend on a monthly basis
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:42.460]   if you knew that you were going to receive $10,000 every month for the rest of your life?
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.600]   How much money would you spend every month on a monthly basis
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:55.100]   if you knew that you were going to receive $10,000 a month every month for the rest of your life?
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.740]   Now, the answers will vary.
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.340]   Answers will vary, and we're going to talk through some of those answers.
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.240]   The first answer that I think is the most common answer,
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.740]   people would say, "Well, Joshua, if I knew I was going to receive $10,000 a month every month for the rest of my life,
[00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.640]   I would spend $10,000 a month every month for the rest of your life.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.740]   I would just spend it."
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.740]   And I think that's a really good answer.
[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.740]   That's an answer that I would give at first before I thought about it more,
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.440]   which we'll get to in a moment.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:33.740]   And to me, the reason I would give an answer like that is because I think that money is designed to move.
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.740]   And when you take away the idea that you somehow have to earn the money,
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.740]   when you somehow realize I'm just going to receive the money,
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.740]   then it puts you in a place where you realize, "You know what? I like spending money."
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.740]   Now, you get to choose what you spend the money on.
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:56.740]   You can spend the money on a new set of fancy designer clothes for you and all those that you love.
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.740]   You can spend the money on Christmas gifts for the less fortunate.
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.740]   You can spend the money on big experiences for you and your family,
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.740]   or you can spend the money on charitable experiences for others, whatever you want.
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:10.740]   You choose how you spend it.
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.740]   But the idea is if you knew that there were an influent flow of money, there was always money coming in,
[00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.740]   then you wouldn't worry about stockpiling money very much.
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.740]   You would just simply let the money flow through.
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.740]   You would be a conduit for the money.
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.740]   It would flow in and it would flow out.
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:34.740]   And you wouldn't try to reserve it just for the rainy day because you knew the money is coming in.
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.740]   Okay, that's the first thing.
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.740]   And to me, when I think that through and realize that what it shows me is, "Yeah, you know what?
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.740]   I do like spending money."
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.740]   I like to play with these numbers.
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.740]   "Okay, Joshua, what if you had $40,000 a month coming in every month for the rest of your life guaranteed
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.740]   or $100,000 a month coming in every month for the rest of your life guaranteed?
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.740]   Then how much money would you spend?"
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.740]   And the point is that we would spend it.
[00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.740]   We would pass it on if we knew we didn't need it for the future.
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:10.740]   Now, that's the first lesson that we have when we go out of our thought experiment.
[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:16.740]   If we come to the real world where very few of us have a guaranteed income no matter what of $10,000 a month
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.740]   for the rest of our life and we think about the fact that I have to earn money,
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.740]   we quickly realize that, "You know what?
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.740]   Something could happen to my income.
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.740]   And so why would I choose to be frugal?
[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.740]   And here I'm going to define frugality as simply spending less money than I have coming in.
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.740]   Why would I choose to be frugal and spend less than I make?
[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:45.740]   Well, because there could be some sense of uncertainty with what I make."
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:46.740]   I think that's true.
[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:47.740]   I think that's right.
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.740]   Notice I had to give all my qualifiers.
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.740]   You actually believe that the money is going to come in the rest of your month.
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.740]   You can do this, by the way.
[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.740]   This is a strategy that I've recommended to many people who are retiring.
[00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.740]   It's just simply buy an annuity.
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.740]   This is what you can do for yourself if you simply go and buy a commercial annuity.
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.740]   You can go to an insurance company.
[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.740]   You can give them a lump sum of money, and they'll give you a payment that's going to come in every single month
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.740]   for the rest of your life.
[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:20.740]   And that can actually help people to feel very confident and feel very able to budget their money
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.740]   because they have a paycheck.
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.740]   It comes in as an annuity payment, like your Social Security is an annuity payment
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.740]   or a pension, a defined benefit pension if you're enrolled in one of those is an annuity payment.
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.740]   But you recognize, "Hey, something could happen."
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.740]   If you bought a commercial annuity, you would probably still want to have a little bit of money on the side,
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.740]   even if you spent most of it, because you recognize there could be a problem with the bank transfer.
[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.740]   There could be an issue from time to time, and that money might not come in.
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.740]   So the first benefit of frugality is it provides against the uncertainty of income,
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.740]   and that's extremely valuable, extremely valuable.
[00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.740]   Let's not minimize that.
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.740]   Now, back to our thought experiment.
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.740]   You got the $10,000 a month coming in.
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:09.740]   Maybe you say, "I'm going to save a little bit of money to take care of any risk of the income stopping,
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.740]   but I have a high degree of confidence in this."
[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.740]   What else would you do?
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.740]   Well, one thing you might do is you might realize that in some months,
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.740]   you might want to spend more than $10,000.
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:27.740]   Maybe your normal spending is $10,000 a month, but there might be months in which you want to spend $15,000.
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.740]   Maybe you want to take an extra trip, right?
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.740]   Go snow skiing or go to the Caribbean in the middle of the winter or whatever.
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:43.740]   And so you would practice some frugality to stockpile some money for big purchases.
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:49.740]   You would save for purchases, and that's a major benefit of frugality.
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:55.740]   When you are frugal and you spend, say, $8,000 a month on an ongoing basis,
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.740]   then every month there's $2,000 a month accumulating.
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.740]   And so after, say, six months, now there's an extra $12,000.
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:08.740]   So in that month, if you want to spend $22,000 per month, you can.
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.740]   And this is a very practical way for you to run your finances.
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.740]   In theory, you might be able to do this to some degree with debt, right,
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.740]   borrowing money and then paying it back off.
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.740]   That's what a lot of people do.
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:23.740]   Instead of saving up for a car, they choose to buy a car and have payments,
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.740]   and they just pay off those payments out of their income.
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.740]   And that works.
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:32.740]   It works very well if you have that guaranteed income and if you have a stable income.
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:38.740]   What doesn't work about that, the reason that plan is usually not the first one that a financial advisor would suggest,
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:45.740]   is, well, if your income goes away, now you have a whole bunch of obligations.
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:50.740]   In addition, when you have everything lined up with payments,
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:55.740]   your wants can often continue to get bigger, but now you can't service those wants.
[00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:02.740]   If you have $10,000 a month coming in and you go and you spend $4,000 a month on leasing an apartment,
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:08.740]   then you go and you get a car lease for $1,000 a month, you get a boat lease for $1,000 a month,
[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:16.740]   you have $1,500 a month of miscellaneous bills and a couple thousand dollars a month on fun and food, etc.
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.740]   Well, now, if you want to do something more, you can't.
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.740]   All those payments stack up.
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:28.740]   Now you can't set aside the $2,000 to save up for the extra $10,000 snowski vacation.
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:35.740]   So that's the second thing that the savings can be used for, is they can be stockpiled for big purchases.
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.740]   So now you start to see that frugality is a tool.
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.740]   One, frugality is a tool that protects you if something happens to your income.
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.740]   And for the vast majority of us, that's a very relevant concern.
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:50.740]   The second thing is that frugality is a tool that allows you to handle lumpy expenses,
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.740]   to make big purchases from time to time.
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.740]   And that's a useful part of life.
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.740]   What's the third point of frugality?
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:05.740]   Well, what if $10,000 a month is not very much money for you?
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:14.740]   I would say that $10,000 a month is not even the median income of radical personal finance.
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:20.740]   And so it might sound like a lot to some people, but to other people it doesn't sound like much at all.
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.740]   And so maybe there's a guy who's used to living on $30,000 a month.
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.740]   For him, $10,000 a month is not fun.
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.740]   His financial thermostat is calibrated very differently.
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.740]   It's in a very different space.
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.740]   And so what would that guy do?
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:43.740]   Imagine a wealthy person that you know and look up to, I don't know, a Warren Buffett or a Bill Gates or an Elon Musk,
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:52.740]   maybe a Mark Cuban or a Donald Trump or, you know, some guy that you look up to and you admire as this is a person who is good with money.
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:57.740]   What would they do if they woke up and they had nothing but they had $10,000 a month?
[00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:07.740]   Do you really think that Warren Buffett, if he woke up and had an income of $10,000 a month, would sit back and just spend the $10,000 a month?
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.740]   Of course not.
[00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:13.740]   Now, in his case, he probably wouldn't ever spend it no matter what.
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:21.740]   But maybe a better example, I don't know, maybe a Mark Cuban or something, somebody who spends money a little bit more of a flashy way.
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.740]   Would he be happy with $10,000 a month?
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.740]   My answer is no.
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:37.740]   If a Mark Cuban woke up and was making $10,000 a month, he'd immediately set a household budget of, say, $3,000 and start saving $7,000 a month and start investing.
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.740]   Why? Why is he investing?
[00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.740]   Well, because he wants to spend more money than $10,000 a month.
[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:48.740]   And so this is the third big reason as to why frugality is so valuable.
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:12:00.740]   Frugality allows you to set money aside, which you can then invest and you can grow, so that you can have more money in the future, more money to spend.
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.740]   Now, notice that that last part, more money to spend, is not automatic.
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:10.740]   Some people simply set aside money and they grow money, grow money, grow money, and they never spend it.
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:17.740]   I think there are a lot of times where you understand that and where you even venerate that a little bit.
[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.740]   I appreciate people who have kind of a frugal instinct.
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.740]   They're conservative.
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:28.740]   I don't personally like to see money wasted, so I appreciate people who are careful, who are thoughtful, etc.
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:39.740]   And what happens is you put that set of habits in place and you see a person live that way and they kind of never really change.
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:43.740]   They just continue living that way on an ongoing basis.
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:49.740]   Now, if they ultimately have a goal for their money that is their goal, then that makes sense to me.
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:59.740]   Like you have people who say, "I want to raise $100 million for the SPCA and leave an endowment of $100 million to the SPCA when I die."
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:00.740]   Okay, fine.
[00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:01.740]   That's their goal.
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.740]   It's their money.
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.740]   They can spend it however they want.
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.740]   If they want to spend it on the SPCA, great.
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.740]   That brings them pleasure, brings them joy.
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:08.740]   That makes sense.
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:15.740]   But I think where I personally have a little pain is if somebody just has a whole lot of money and they don't have any plan for it.
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.740]   They just have a bunch of money and they're not going to spend it.
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.740]   They're not going to enjoy it with others.
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:26.740]   They're not going to – they don't have some really important charitable goal that's important to them and they just have a stack of money.
[00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:27.740]   Well, just because.
[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:32.740]   To me, that seems irresponsible in a sense.
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.740]   And by irresponsible, I mean it just doesn't feel like good stewardship.
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.740]   Like you're taking care of the things that have been entrusted to you.
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:46.740]   I think having a plan for that and saying, "These are the things that I'm going to do with the money," is important.
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.740]   Now, the numbers can get very big, right?
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:56.740]   You can have an investor who's so good that it builds so much money that it's not possible to spend it, right?
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:01.740]   Jeff Bezos can't spend all of his money no matter how hard he might try.
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:06.740]   That's why you find that people give so much money away.
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:09.740]   Number one, it fits their values generally, but they just – you can't spend it.
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:14.740]   What on earth are you going to spend billions and billions of dollars on?
[00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:24.740]   But the point stands that if you had $10,000 per month of income and if you wanted to have more than $10,000 a month of income,
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:40.740]   you could use frugality as a tool to allow you to set money aside so you could invest it and use it to make more money.
[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:44.740]   Now, would you want to do that?
[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:45.740]   Depends, right?
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.740]   How much more money do you want?
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:53.740]   And that's where we get to a very personalized decision.
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:15:03.740]   I could very happily have one person who says, "I make $10,000 a month at my job and I have enough money set aside for big purchases.
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:10.740]   I've taken care of emergencies in case something happens to my income, so I'm just going to spend $10,000,"
[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:12.740]   because I don't want to actually invest for more.
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:13.740]   That would be fine.
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:17.740]   On the other hand, there would be someone who says, "I need more money, so I'm going to invest for a lot more,
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.740]   and I'm going to be very frugal now.
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.740]   I'm going to live like no one else now, so later I can live like no one else."
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.740]   And later I can spend a lot more money.
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:27.740]   These are your choices.
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:35.740]   It's also relevant that you could possibly be able to make a lot more money without actually needing to save money at all.
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:41.740]   So many traditional investments require somebody to have some money up front.
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:45.740]   This is certainly true in the realms of stocks, right?
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.740]   You can't buy stocks unless you have money.
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.740]   This is very true in the world of real estate.
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:59.740]   While in theory you can do no-money-down deals, it's a little bit easier and advisable to be involved in something like real estate if you have some money.
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:10.740]   It's also possible to, if you're going to invest in business, which I think is certainly usually your best way to take a little bit of money and turn it into a lot more,
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.740]   many of the best businesses require some money up front.
