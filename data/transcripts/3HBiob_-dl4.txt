[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160]   This is one of the most important questions we've gotten in the Ask Pastor John inbox,
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.120]   and it comes from a listener named Jesse.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.240]   "Dear Pastor John, in a recent episode," in number 948, "you note that 'God sent
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.000]   his Son into the world to suffer with us and for us.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.720]   This means that if we trust him, none of our suffering is punishment for sin.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.040]   Christ bore all of our punishment for sin.'"
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.400]   But there are very real consequences for sin in this world, both on ourselves and on others,
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.760]   both for believers and unbelievers alike.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.220]   For example, financial hardships follow selfish overspending, or sexually transmitted diseases
[00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.480]   follow promiscuity.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.680]   How do we see this as discipline and not punishment?
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.840]   And what really is the difference between the two?
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:57.440]   The difference between God's discipline of his children and God's judgment on his enemies
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.060]   is an infinite difference.
[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:07.640]   So I hope I can help Jesse feel the difference, because it is so important for his or her
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.640]   own walk of faith.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:18.120]   So let me begin by defining the difference with a couple of biblical passages, just two,
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.160]   and they are massively important.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:28.600]   When I speak of God's judgment upon his enemies, I'm referring to the misery that he brings
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:39.100]   upon them, not for any purifying or restoring or rehabilitating purposes, but solely to
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:46.720]   express his holy justice, his retribution, not restitution.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:54.080]   And it's purely on the basis precisely of what the enemies deserve.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.140]   It's not to demonstrate mercy.
[00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.520]   It's to demonstrate righteousness and justice.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:08.400]   For example, Revelation 16, 5 and 6, "I heard the angel in charge of the water say, 'Just
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:17.800]   are you, O holy one, who is and who was, for you brought these judgments, for they have
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:25.400]   shed the blood of saints and prophets, and you have given them blood to drink.'
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.020]   It is what they deserve."
[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.320]   So there's the mark of pure retributive justice.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.720]   It comes upon the sinner solely because of what they deserve, not because of any good
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.980]   that the punishment will do them.
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.840]   You can see it even more clearly in Revelation 19, 1 to 3, because here the judgments are
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.320]   eternal, not temporary.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.880]   So clearly they're not helping at all for a person to become holy.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.560]   They are punishing him for not being holy.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.560]   Here's what it says.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.680]   "After this I heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.600]   crying, 'Hallelujah!
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:18.920]   Salvation and glory and power belong to our God, for his judgments are true and just,
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.320]   for he has judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her immorality and
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.040]   has avenged on her the blood of his servants.'
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.360]   Once more they cried out, 'Hallelujah!
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.840]   The smoke of her goes up forever and ever.'"
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:48.160]   So this is what I'm talking about when I speak of God's punishment upon sin in contrast
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.860]   to the discipline of God's children.
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.760]   It's what the guilty deserve.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:03.800]   It is holy and just retribution, and it is eternal and therefore is not designed for
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.400]   rehabilitation.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:12.480]   It displays God's justice, and it highlights how valuable mercy is to those who receive
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.480]   it.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:24.480]   On the other hand, God describes his discipline for his children very differently and extensively
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.880]   in Hebrews 12, 5 to 11.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.160]   Listen how different this is.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.680]   Hebrews 12, 5.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.120]   "And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons?
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:44.080]   My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor be weary when reproved by
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.080]   him."
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.480]   Notice, this is discipline, not retribution.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:55.640]   This is happening to God's son, whom he loves and means to improve, even though it
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.600]   involves God's displeasure.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.840]   You can see that in the word "reprove," and it goes on.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:10.000]   "For the Lord disciplines the one whom he loves and chastises every son whom he receives."
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.760]   It is for discipline that you have to endure.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:18.560]   God is treating you as sons, for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.840]   If you are left without discipline in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.040]   children and not sons.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.560]   Besides this, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.680]   Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live?
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.320]   For they disciplined us for a short time, as it seemed best to them, but he disciplines
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:49.440]   us for our good, that we may share his holiness.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.600]   There's the great difference.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.440]   For our good, that we may share his holiness.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.560]   It's different from punishment on God's enemies.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.720]   Verse 11, "For the moment, all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:15.440]   it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who've been trained by it."
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:24.040]   So I say again, there is an infinite difference between the painful things that come into
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:29.600]   our lives as discipline designed for our good, that we may share God's holiness as loved
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:39.040]   children and that terrible experience of pure retribution where we simply bear what we deserve
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.440]   and experience God justice forever.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.560]   It's called hell.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:51.480]   And of course, Jesse, and this may be a stumbling block, Jesse is absolutely right that many
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:58.120]   of the painful things in the Christian's life are owing to our own sins.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.520]   Some that we committed before we were Christians and some that we've committed since we've
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.520]   been Christians.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:11.580]   So when Jesse asks, "How do we see this as discipline and not punishment?"
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:19.160]   It sounds like he may be making the mistake of thinking that God's disciplinary action
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:27.640]   can only be the result of our righteous behavior through persecution maybe, and God's punishment
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.160]   comes only as a result of unrighteous behavior.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.080]   That is not the case.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:41.760]   God's discipline may indeed come from our own sinful behaviors and their consequences
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.160]   as Christians.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.780]   And you can see this in 1 Corinthians 11.30 following.
[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.320]   Some Christians had sinned.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:53.240]   They had really sinned in the way they had treated the Lord's supper.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.720]   And here's God's response.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:04.320]   "That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died, died for their abuse of
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.120]   the Lord's table, their sin, Christian sin.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.240]   They died for it."
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:15.640]   But he goes on, "But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:24.200]   But when we are judged by the Lord," meaning ill, weak, death, "when we are judged by the
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:33.280]   Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world."
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.400]   Amazing.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:44.500]   This is a stunning example of God's disciplinary judgment that goes so far as to bring about
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.600]   the death of his child.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:55.000]   And that death is the disciplinary effect of sin in the child's life because it keeps
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.440]   him from going to hell.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:03.240]   It says that we may not be condemned along with the world.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.400]   That's why he took us out.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.400]   Amazing.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:14.080]   So, Jesse, there is an infinite and precious difference between God's retributive justice
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:19.480]   in punishment and God's purifying discipline in our pain.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:27.700]   And that difference does not lie in the origin, the human origin of the pain, whether good
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.000]   or evil.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.080]   It lies in the purpose and the design of God in our suffering.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.080]   Yes.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.240]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the follow-up question, Jesse.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.460]   We really benefit from these types of follow-up questions where you bring new questions about
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.600]   what we've talked about in the past.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.000]   So thank you for sending those in.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.880]   You can find our audio feeds in our episode archive, and you can reach us via email and
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:56.160]   send us a follow-up question of your own based upon what you've heard, all through our online
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.400]   home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:06.280]   Well there are dozens and dozens of English Bible translations to choose from out there.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.960]   So should we choose just one, or how many different Bible translations should a Christian
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.160]   keep in their regular reading diet?
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.200]   That's a question queued up for discussion on Wednesday with longtime author and pastor
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.200]   John Piper.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.200]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:19.560]   We'll see you then.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.560]   [END]
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.560]   1. What is the Bible?
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.560]   2. What is the Bible?
