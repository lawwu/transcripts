[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   A listener by the name of John writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, can we
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.200]   reasonably draw moral parallels between abortion in America and the
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.400]   extermination of Jews by Nazis in World War II?"
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:24.640]   There are non-parallels, and there are parallels. And it might be good just to
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.880]   name a few, because evidently the question is coming out of a sense of
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.960]   there are people that get upset about this correlation, and there are other
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.400]   people who feel it's natural. So let me try to get inside the skin
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:48.320]   of both people. There are non-parallels. The Holocaust was overwhelmingly a
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.080]   hatred of Jewish people, not only, but overwhelmingly a hatred of an ethnic
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.720]   group and a religious group. This is generally not the case with the unborn.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.920]   The unborn are killed across all ethnicities and religions. Secondly,
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.200]   there's a non-parallel in that the Holocaust was carried out mainly by one
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.520]   nation, while babies are being killed in every nation of the world. There's a
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:26.360]   non-parallel in that the Holocaust was mainly carried out on mature, rationally
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:34.960]   aware human beings, rather than pre-rational babies. And so the horror of
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.360]   contemplating their end was vastly greater for those who were killed in the
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:50.440]   Holocaust. And there's a non-parallel in that the Holocaust had a
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:57.720]   beginning and had an end, though ethnic persecution, of course, hasn't ended while
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.680]   the killing of babies goes on. So those are a few, and I'm sure there are more
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.960]   that we, if you just spent time, we could think of the non-parallels. But here
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.000]   are the parallels that I think are, in fact, completely valid. One, there's a
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.280]   parallel that both involve precious human beings created in the image of God,
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.920]   Jewish people and others that the Nazis despised, and then the unborn. They're
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.640]   both human beings. There's a parallel in the fact that they were slaughtered.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.480]   I'm not even going to say like animals, because it was worse than animals in
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.120]   both cases. It was worse than animals. It happened in the concentration camps with
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.880]   medical experimentation. I've been to Dachau three times, Tony, because it was
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.000]   right outside Munich where I lived for three years. And I've read and seen the
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.280]   pictures of being frozen to death to experiment with how quickly people would
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.480]   freeze to death, or hanging, or asphyxiation, or all kinds of horrible
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.600]   experimentations that were done. And so it was a kind of slaughter that was
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.000]   worse than the killing of animals. And so it is with babies in the womb. Most of
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   them are dismembered limb from limb. There's a parallel in scope. The numbers
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.560]   are in the millions, and they are unimaginable in both cases. There's a
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.320]   parallel in rationale, the diminishment of personhood and dignity. The
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:40.360]   non-Aryan race was deemed increasingly subhuman, or at least not the kind of
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.680]   human who was worthy of life. That's exactly the same rationale for the
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.080]   killing of the unborn. They are subhuman, or at least they're not the kind of
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:59.960]   human that is worthy of life. And I would add one more parallel. The time will come
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:06.640]   when the generations will look back on ours with even more unbelief that we
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.560]   could have let it happen than we look back on Germany in the 1930s and 40s and
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:19.880]   marvel that they could let it happen. God hates murder then, and he hates murder
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:26.720]   now. He condemns it in his Word, and so that's another parallel that God will in
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.600]   the end make everything right. He will settle accounts. Nothing will be swept
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.800]   under the rug in this universe. Yes, amen. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank
