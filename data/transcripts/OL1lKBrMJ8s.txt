[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   All right, Jess, let's do some questions.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   We're kind of a long one here.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   This one comes from Steve.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Steve says, "In the '90s, I had a plan to get my PhD in exercise physiology
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   to teach and dive deep into human performance testing research.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Unfortunately, I allowed my significant other at the time to convince me otherwise,
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   which led me down a path of ever-changing careers,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   always taking different jobs to maintain some sort of financial security.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   At the age of 53, and after listening to most of your Deep Questions episodes,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   I now have the confidence and motivation to go back to school
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   to achieve my previously stated goals.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   However, after doing the math, I would be 60 by the time I graduate with a PhD,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   which would leave me maybe 10 to 15 years to work before retiring.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   One alternative is to start a small human performance testing lab as a side gig,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   slowly building up a strong client base while maintaining my day job as an office manager
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   for a major Southern California university."
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   All right, so that's the question.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   At the age of 53, do you go get your PhD because you have this idea
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   for some sort of performance testing lab?
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Or is it just a vision that you could run?
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Well, Steve, regardless of your age, my graduate school advice applies here.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   My graduate school advice says never start a graduate program
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   unless you have clear evidence that the specific degree you're going to get
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   at the specific school that you're going to get it is needed to unlock
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   a specific step in your career that is appealing to you,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   that you've gotten to a point where you say, "I see this thing I want to do.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   This is why I want to do that.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   But if I can get this degree here, I can do it. Otherwise, I can't."
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   I am not a big believer in get the degree to see what options it opens up.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Now, you have a bit of an idea about what you want to do with this PhD,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   but I think it is too vague to qualify.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I mean, just based off of your question wording, so I'm extrapolating here,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   but just based off your question wording, you have this idea that there's some startup
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   with a human performance testing lab that could be interesting.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   That is super vague. I would not spend six or seven years getting a PhD
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   with the idea that maybe that will help me do this thing that's kind of vague.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I think your side hustle exploration approach is probably the right one here.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   So keeping your good job, starting to explore what would this mean,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   what you even mean by human performance testing lab,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   what are the real opportunities here, what are the real demands here.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And there's two things you'd want to capture from this experimentation on your side.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   One, using money as a neutral indicator of value.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Can you actually get clients? Can you actually get people to give you money
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   for something along these lines? That's a great indicator about whether or not
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   the idea has value or not. Everyone will tell you your idea is good,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   but they will only give you money if it actually is.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Two, it allows you to actually explore the contours of this new territory.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   What exactly do you mean by human performance testing lab?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   You probably aren't quite sure. What is the market opportunity here?
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Is it consulting? Is it content? Is it working with other companies?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   You need to figure that all out before you go get a degree for seven years.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I want you to be at the point where you say, "We're rocking and rolling,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   and I'm being held back, just being held back by not having this degree.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I could just see if I had it, I could do this. I'm so close,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   but I can't do this because I don't know how to do this."
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   I want you to be at that point before you pull the trigger
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   on any sort of higher education.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Start exploring, Steve, and don't get that PhD until you have to have it.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   What would be, outside of your own, what would be a good example of that,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   getting a PhD, clearly elevating your career?
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   It's a good question because PhDs are very specific.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Obviously, academic, you want to be a professor,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   then you're going to need a PhD. We have a question about this coming up.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   If you're going to be a professor, you do need a PhD,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   but that's where the second part of this is,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   this degree from this program is what I need becomes important.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   If you say, "I would love to be an MIT professor,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   so I'm just going to go get a PhD." It's like, "Wait a second,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   you better be getting a PhD from a top two program,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   or it's not going to be the right thing."
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I have this issue also with a lot of military and recent vets
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   that I talked to who are using their GI Bill.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   I think there's a lot of predatory online degrees where they come in,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   "Hey, get your online MBA and we'll suck out your GI Bill benefits for it.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   It's convenient, you do it on the side."
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   It turns out that the employers down the road say,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   "I don't know what this online MBA is,"
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   and you just wasted your money, so the specific degree matters.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   There's other fields that have specific PhD requirements.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   In biomed, biomed research, working for a drug company,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   you want to be on... I have a colleague whose wife
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   works on respiratory virus vaccines at Moderna.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   We always tell him, "Your job for the rest of our culture
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   is to make sure your wife is completely unburdened
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   because we need her working on that. You can help the culture."
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   If you want a job like that, it's not an academic job,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   but you need a PhD for that, be very careful about PhDs
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   is the way I think about it.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   In computer science, this is shifted,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   but the traditional thinking in computer science, for example,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   is if you're just looking at going to industry and making salary,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   getting a master's degree, especially if you do a five-year program
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   where you start your master's classes as an undergrad
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   and just add an extra year, so you do five years
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   and you get an undergrad and a master's degree,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   from a pure economic perspective is probably worth it
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   because with the master's degree, your starting salary is up here,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   with the undergrad, it's down here,
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   and in the time it takes you to get that master's degree,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   you couldn't catch up, so you do start out ahead.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   The math often, or at least it didn't back in my day,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   work out for getting a PhD and going to industry.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   So if you spend five years to get a PhD,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   and then you go to work at Google, you're going to get paid more.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Your starting salary will be more than someone coming in
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   with a master's degree, but it took you five more years.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   And in those five more years, the person who started
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   with the master's degree has been promoted enough
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   that they're making a lot more than you are coming in.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   So you actually have to account for the time it takes to get the degree.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   So that was always the conventional wisdom.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   There is one exception right now that's AI and machine learning.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   If you are able to get a PhD from a real star in the field
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   in a relevant artificial intelligence topic,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   where you are doing, moving the avant-garde of the field forward type research,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   like I'm moving forward what's possible with deep learning,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   I'm working with Greg Hinton in Toronto,
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   and we're sort of innovating the field,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   some of those PhD students are getting close to
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   or exceeding seven-figure salary offers.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   So in some fields like AI, where actually being able
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   to produce original research is going to be
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   a huge competitive advantage, then a PhD might be different.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   But if you're going to go into a development job
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   or an executive job, then in computer science,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   it's not really worth getting a PhD.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   So just be wary about it. Just go in with your eyes open.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   You need evidence. This is the type of thing I want to do.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   I know for a fact it requires a PhD to do it.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   I know for a fact the quality and competitiveness
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   of the program I'm going to go to will satisfy what's necessary there.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   You just want clarity. Never use graduate degrees
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   as a delaying function, as a generic option-opening function.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   No, no, it should be very specific.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   It should be solving a very specific goal.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   [Music]
