[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.880]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.800]   It's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.400]   And in this episode, I'm going to introduce a new concept
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.000]   called Financial SEER, S-E-E-R. It
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.280]   stands for Financial Samurai Equity Exposure Rule.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.760]   And it's a way to quantify risk tolerance
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.240]   and determine appropriate equity exposure.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.240]   So after the fourth quarter of 2018,
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.840]   where we saw basically a hammering of the stock market,
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.840]   I thought it was a good idea to figure out
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.320]   and to help listeners figure out what
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.280]   is the appropriate amount of exposure
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.200]   one should have to equities.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.720]   I've been trying to build meaningful wealth
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.400]   in a risk-appropriate manner ever
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.480]   since I graduated from college.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.720]   And that's what I want all you guys to experience as well.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.920]   I started my career soon after the 1997 Asian financial
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.840]   crisis.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.120]   And that was an interesting one because currencies,
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.360]   from Thailand to Indonesia, they devalued tremendously
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.480]   overnight, causing many international college students
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.720]   to just drop out.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.840]   And I had a couple of those.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.760]   I was like, whoa, what's going on?
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.600]   So I fully appreciate how hazardous the road
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.640]   to building great wealth can be.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.200]   And I think most investors overestimate the risk
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.160]   tolerance, especially investors who've only
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.320]   been investing with a significant amount of capital
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.640]   since 2009.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.240]   We've just seen a phenomenal nine-year-plus run bull market.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.960]   And sequence of risk is pretty real.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.440]   Once the losses started piling up,
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.240]   it's not only the melancholy of losing money
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.520]   that starts getting to you.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.320]   It's the growing fear that your job might also be at risk.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.800]   Some of you might erroneously think the richer you get,
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.320]   the higher your risk tolerance.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.760]   After all, the more money you have, the bigger your buffer.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.520]   This is a fallacy because the more money you have,
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.360]   the larger your potential absolute loss.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.000]   For most rational people, their lifestyles
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.720]   don't inflate commensurately with their wealth.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.400]   They still remember what it's like to be frugal
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.680]   and to save money.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.540]   This is why even rich people can't resist a free rubber
[00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.960]   chicken lunch.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.200]   Further, there will come a time, hopefully, for all of you
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.360]   guys, when your investment returns have a larger
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.940]   impact on your net worth than your earnings and savings.
[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.080]   As a result, the richer you are, the more dismayed
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.200]   you will be to lose money.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.600]   Because no matter what you do, you
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.200]   can't really make a difference through working harder or longer
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.060]   and saving more.
[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.280]   And the reason we all continue to fight
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.720]   in this really difficult world is because we have hope.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.480]   But eventually, our hope fades because our brains
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.040]   and our bodies slow down.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.000]   When we're younger, we often think to ourselves,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.200]   we're invisible.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.600]   We can do anything.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.160]   Nothing's going to hurt us.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.800]   Then eventually, we start experiencing
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.880]   the realities of aging.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.440]   And due to these fading abilities,
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.680]   we must bring down our risk exposure as we age.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.640]   The only way most of us can rescue our investments
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.480]   after a market swoon is through contributions
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.320]   from earned income, i.e.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.520]   our salaries.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.720]   And to understand reward, we must first understand risk.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.040]   Since 1929, the median bear market price decline
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.400]   is about 33.5%, while the average bear market price
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.040]   decline is about 35.4%.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.760]   Therefore, it's reasonable to assume
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.760]   that the bear market could bring equity valuations down by 35%
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.320]   over an 8 to 12-month period.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.400]   And if you look at the post, you can see this chart
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.320]   that chronicles the bear market.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.060]   So most people just regularly invest in stocks over time
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.960]   through dollar cost averaging.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.360]   They have little concept of whether the amount of stocks
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.240]   they have as part of their portfolio or their net worth
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.680]   is risk appropriate.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.360]   Hence, to quantify your risk tolerance based
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.800]   on your existing portfolio, use the following formula.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.560]   And this is part of financial seer.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.120]   Public equity exposure times 35% divided by monthly gross
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.960]   income.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.560]   So let's say you have $500,000 in equities
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.480]   and you make $10,000 a month.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.560]   To quantify your risk tolerance, the formula
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.160]   is simply 500,000 times 35%, where 35% is the average
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.760]   decline in a bear market, and you get $175,000.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.800]   And then you divide that by $10,000,
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.240]   which is your monthly gross income, to get 17.5 months.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.520]   In other words, the formula tells you
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.200]   that to make up for your potential losses,
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:40.320]   you have to work an additional 17.5 months of your life,
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.120]   and that is gross income only.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.000]   So because you have to pay for taxes,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.960]   you're probably going to have to work closer to 22-plus months.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.760]   And then because you have to pay for basic living expenses,
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.600]   you probably need to work more than 22 months
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.400]   to make up for that loss.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.280]   So in other words, that risk tolerance multiple of 17.5
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.760]   is really--
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.680]   well, you probably need to multiply by 1.2 to 3 times
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.040]   to get the real amount of months that you need to work
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.000]   to make up for your losses.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.760]   And just think about this classic scenario--
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.160]   68-year-old guy, retired with a million-dollar portfolio,
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.080]   living off $20,000 a year in Social Security,
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.680]   and $20,000 in dividend income from his portfolio.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.960]   If his portfolio loses 30%, that's
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.320]   going to be really, really, really tough.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.120]   We're talking losing $300,000.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.200]   And if you have a fixed income of $20,000 a year
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.840]   from Social Security, it's practically
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.800]   impossible to make that up.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.040]   The only thing the retiree can do is pray the market
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.720]   eventually goes up while also cutting costs.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.620]   Now, the second part of financial seer
[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.280]   is to figure out what the appropriate equity exposure
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.560]   should be based on the risk tolerance multiple.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.080]   So here's another formula.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.800]   Your max equity exposure equals your monthly salary
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.040]   times 18 divided by 35%.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.720]   So what is 18?
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.800]   18 is my recommended risk tolerance multiple,
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.160]   where on a gross monthly salary basis,
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.960]   you don't want to risk more than 18 months worth of gross salary
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.760]   on your equity investments.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.520]   And 35%, again, is using the average bear market
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.800]   declined in your public investment portfolio.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.600]   In other words, if you make $10,000 a month,
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.560]   the most you should risk is a $180,000 loss
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.160]   on a $514,000 pure equity portfolio.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.720]   Now, your portfolio can obviously
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.620]   be more than $514,000 in this equation.
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.960]   You can have 250,000 in AAA-rated municipal bonds,
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.000]   if you wish, for a reasonable 67%, 33% equity fixed income
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.960]   split with a total portfolio size of 764,000.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.240]   You basically have to adjust assumptions as you see fit.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.400]   Maybe you only think the bear market will only decline by 25%.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.800]   Well, then you can just replace 35% with 25%.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:13.120]   And the result would be $10,000 salary times 18 divided by 25%.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.360]   So you can actually have 720,000 of maximum equity exposure.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.600]   Maybe you see yourself getting promoted
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:24.480]   and earning 20% yearly earnings increases for the next five
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.800]   years.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.520]   Maybe you can increase, therefore,
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:34.080]   your equity risk tolerance multiple to 36, maybe,
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.300]   from 18, and maybe, as a result, you
[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.960]   could have 1.44 million in equity exposure using
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.760]   a 25% denominator as the bear market scenario.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.080]   Just remember, whatever your gross risk tolerance multiple
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.200]   is, you're going to have to increase it by 1.2 to 3 times
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.560]   to truly calculate how many years you
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.180]   will need to work to recover from your bear market
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.500]   losses due to taxes and general living expenses.
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.280]   At the end of the day, it's a judgment call
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.140]   regarding how much equity risk you should take.
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.960]   If you've quadrupled your net worth after a nine-year bull
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.360]   run, it's probably wise to lower your risk exposure multiple.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.840]   Conversely, after 30% correction in equities,
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.400]   it's probably wise to increase your risk exposure multiple.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.280]   Only you can decide how much more
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.080]   you're willing to work to make up for those losses.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.600]   The closer you get to retirement,
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.000]   the lower your multiple should be.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.800]   Nobody wants to get close to being financially free
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.000]   only to break a leg and get carted off in an ambulance.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.200]   I hope the financial samurai equity exposure rule
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.360]   helps you take the subjective term of risk tolerance,
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.160]   because everybody just throws that around,
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.120]   and shapes it into something more quantifiable.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.880]   You now have a concrete way of determining your equity
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.920]   exposure and risk tolerance.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.880]   As for 2019, well, earnings are set
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.800]   to grow by only about 6% to 7% from about 20-plus percent
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.400]   in 2018.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.200]   But the good thing is the market corrected.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.160]   We're back to historical averages on a P level.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.640]   And I could easily see the market go up 10%.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.160]   And at the same time, I could easily see the market go down
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:11.920]   10%.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.700]   So for me, in particular, I'm looking to lock in wins.
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:19.040]   And I'm doing that by paying down some mortgage debt
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.520]   and also taking advantage of shorter-term interest rates.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:27.600]   For example, SITBank has a 2.45% money market account now.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.200]   I mean, that's huge.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:34.080]   And you can sign up at financialsamurai.com/citbank
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.600]   savings to get that 2.45%.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.520]   That's pretty much the same as my 5-1 arm mortgage rate.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.320]   So basically, I'm living for free.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.900]   You really want to lock in some games.
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.520]   Yes, continue to invest, but make sure it's
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.400]   in a risk-appropriate manner.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:57.920]   My current allocation is about 40%, 45% stocks, 50% to 60%,
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:58.840]   fixed income.
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.080]   And it's just going to depend.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.560]   If I see opportunity, I'm going to take it.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.000]   And if S&P 500 gets back to 2,800,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.520]   I'm probably going to sell a lot more equities.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.760]   And hopefully, ironically, hopefully,
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.200]   rates continue to go higher so I can get
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.440]   that risk-free rate of return.
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.960]   Thanks so much, everybody.
