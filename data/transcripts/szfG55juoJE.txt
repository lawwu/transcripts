[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.520]   Today, I'm going to talk about the way that I work
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.680]   in terms of working from anywhere.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.080]   So for the past two years,
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.080]   pretty much since we had the first COVID lockdowns in the UK,
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.720]   I've been working remotely.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.620]   In those two years,
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.300]   I've learned a lot about working from anywhere,
[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.960]   and in particular, the sort of things that you need
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.680]   to consider or the things that you need to take with you
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.800]   when you're working from anywhere.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.800]   Because in reality, it's very different
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.720]   when you are working at home at your desk.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.600]   It's you have built that workspace to suit you,
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.480]   or even in an office, that workspace,
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.720]   maybe it's not built to suit you,
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.000]   but it's built to suit working.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.880]   When you start working remotely from different places,
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.000]   the chances are most places you go,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.040]   or a lot of places you go,
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.480]   are not really going to have good workspaces.
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.320]   That's just how they are,
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.280]   because most places are not really built for working.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.280]   So you really have to get a little bit creative sometimes,
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.620]   but you can avoid that to an extent
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.960]   if you actually take the right kit,
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.840]   if you take pretty much a remote desk setup, okay?
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.800]   So I'm gonna show you my remote desk setup,
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.200]   and we'll just talk through it.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.780]   Now, obviously, I know that not everyone
[00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.200]   is able to work remotely,
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.520]   but I think in the past two years,
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.480]   it has become much more common,
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.800]   and I'm sure at least a few of you
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.080]   are probably working remotely,
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.880]   either full-time or at least part-time.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.360]   So yeah, I hope this is useful.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.120]   This sort of setup for me seems to be working really well.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.000]   I can pretty much go anywhere now
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   and make myself a little workspace, which is pretty cool.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.700]   Okay, so what you can see here is pretty much my workspace,
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.760]   and obviously, as I do all these YouTube videos all the time,
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.640]   I also have this big microphone here,
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.560]   which this week, I have replaced, or not replaced,
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.080]   but I now have an alternative microphone,
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.160]   which should make it a little bit easier for traveling,
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.920]   because taking this massive road stand
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.640]   that you see here around with me, it's not a lot of fun.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.400]   So yeah, this shotgun mic should be a lot better for me.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.120]   But of course, most people are not really gonna need
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.080]   a microphone, so you don't need to worry
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.240]   about that anyway.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.680]   So instead, what you actually need
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.720]   is what you can see here, pretty much.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.760]   So I have this little stand here,
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.200]   and this is super important,
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   because you're gonna be working in a lot of weird places,
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.160]   and most of them are not going to have
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.300]   good workspace setups.
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.300]   So you need your laptop to ideally be at your eye level.
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.680]   This is really important.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.920]   And another thing that's super, super crucial about this
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.160]   is how it packs down to pretty much nothing.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.360]   You fit in this little bag here,
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.800]   and it's incredibly lightweight.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.880]   I don't remember how lightweight exactly,
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.680]   but it weighs nothing.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.600]   I just put it in my bag and go, it's great.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.000]   So another thing that's so important,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.560]   at least for me, a second screen, okay?
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.040]   So I have this second screen.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.640]   Obviously, your mic doesn't come with a second screen.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.160]   I've seen some that do attach to it,
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.760]   so maybe that's worth looking into,
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.360]   but they're super expensive.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.480]   So this screen here,
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.920]   honestly, in terms of how much productivity
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.520]   you're gonna get out of a second screen,
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.600]   in most cases, at least for me,
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.880]   I think it's incredibly important.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.640]   So the one thing I will say this is,
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.640]   if you have a first generation MacBook
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.280]   where they have literally like the two USB ports
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.520]   and nothing else,
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.720]   this specific screen has to be attached
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.160]   to the power adapter.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.920]   So you're probably gonna get like an hour,
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.680]   maybe two hours use out of it
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.480]   before you need to unattach it
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.080]   and plug in your actual power adapter
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.120]   to charge your MacBook again.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.520]   But with the newer MacBooks,
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.280]   maybe the older ones as well,
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.520]   that's not really an issue anymore.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.560]   So that's just to bear in mind.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.960]   Okay, another really important part of the setup here
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.960]   is the separate keyboard and trackpad or a mouse, right?
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.560]   This is obviously, if you have your laptop stand,
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.440]   you need separate keyboard and a mouse or trackpad,
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.600]   but I think this is a pretty obvious one anyway.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.600]   Okay, so other essential things
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.560]   that maybe are less obvious.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.360]   So this power bank here,
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.280]   I think this is pretty important.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.160]   I mean, it's a new thing for me
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.840]   and I've only used it a couple of times,
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.400]   but if you're traveling for long periods of time
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.040]   or you have unreliable electricity,
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.480]   this is really useful.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.160]   So that's really good.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.040]   I'd recommend you buy like a reliable one,
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.720]   like a good one, even if it's a bit more money
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.680]   because you're probably going to need it.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.640]   All right, another super important thing
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.680]   is cable management,
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.440]   but not in the same way that you would manage the cables
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.520]   on your desk.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.240]   So when you're traveling,
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.000]   you probably might not even realize,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.120]   but you have a lot of cables.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.400]   And so it's really important
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.800]   to have those organized in a way,
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.800]   otherwise they're just going to end up in your suitcase
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.840]   or your rucksack all over the place
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.400]   and it becomes an absolute nightmare, I promise.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.840]   So I have this gibbet bag.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.320]   I don't know what you call it.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.920]   It's just a bag and you just put in all of your cables
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.160]   so you can see everything here, right?
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.520]   So yeah, this is useful.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.000]   It's not full yet,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.320]   but I have everything in here.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.560]   So like I have all the normal cables.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.160]   These are like what everyone's going to have,
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.440]   like your laptop charger, phone charger,
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.480]   a few other things.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.960]   And then I like to keep other things in here.
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.480]   So these are the instructions for the new shotgun mic.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.360]   It's better I just leave it there
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.160]   for when I do actually need to read them.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.160]   And yeah, I have another lens for the camera here.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.720]   So that's pretty cool.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.360]   Just slides in there.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.120]   The battery.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.920]   So you can add a lot of things here, right?
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.640]   It doesn't have to just be charging cables.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.200]   So I really mean it when I say this is super important.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.280]   I have all the things here.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.680]   This is one of the best.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.560]   Okay, another thing super important is this bag.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.480]   So obviously you can use any bag you want,
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.800]   but this is, it's a Peak Design bag.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.080]   And you see loads of people, like camera people using them,
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.160]   which obviously helps me because I have a camera,
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.120]   but it's useful for like anything
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.640]   because it's really well-built bag.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.640]   When I bought this bag, like it's expensive,
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.160]   but it felt like I'd never had a good bag before.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.880]   As soon as I got this, it's really useful.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.720]   So you have all of these different compartments.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.720]   So you see in here, you have these different compartments.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.840]   You have the top bit here for,
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.600]   I just usually put like a water bottle
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.640]   and some random things in there.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.160]   Here, I usually put my camera.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.560]   And then in the bottom here, you can fit notepads,
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.240]   a book, other things if you really want.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.840]   And then on the sides,
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.880]   you have all these other things as well,
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.640]   like the cables usually, or before they were for cables.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:10.640]   Now I use this, so it's not really as needed.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:17.520]   So for example, this, my sand will usually go
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.280]   in the side here.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.960]   So I just kind of throw this in.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.680]   Water bottle.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.720]   It's either on the side or on the inside here.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.720]   So either in here, or I can also put it over here.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.440]   So at the moment, I also have this
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.080]   because we're doing like a road trip
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.040]   kind of around Europe at the moment.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.720]   I'm not driving to Madrid, by the way,
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.520]   that's on a flight just for the conference,
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.240]   but everywhere else we're driving.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.040]   So this is just, it's just a light.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.840]   I figured if the car ever broke down,
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.240]   this would be really useful.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:06.320]   I haven't needed it so far, but just a headlight,
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.400]   nothing special.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:13.280]   But what is useful is in here,
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.160]   or is it the other side?
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.360]   Might be the other side.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:23.000]   It is here.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.720]   So they have this little weird thing here.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.240]   I don't know how well you can see that.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.000]   There's this little cable, like elastic cable thing.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.160]   But if you don't want anyone to see your fancy water bottle,
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.360]   this is an expensive water bottle,
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.720]   which is kind of stupid, but it's fine.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.560]   You use this.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.720]   So you just throw it over and it makes it,
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.360]   mainly it's to make sure nothing falls out
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.560]   if you're, I don't know, walking around
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.120]   with your bag upside down or something.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.120]   I don't know.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.080]   And then second screen.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.360]   I don't always put this in my bag.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.200]   It depends.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.800]   Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.960]   Probably, I don't even know if I'm going to take it to,
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.240]   I probably won't even take this to Madrid.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.400]   But if I were taking it, it goes in the back here
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:14.400]   because we have all these multiple components, compartments.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.080]   So,
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:22.440]   see in here, it's nothing special to be honest,
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.840]   but it does fit a lot of stuff in,
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.440]   which is pretty cool.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.160]   So this, actually, I'm probably not going to leave it
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.000]   in there.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.760]   But these, I do.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.240]   So again, being light, being thin,
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.360]   these are really good to just put in here.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:40.920]   You can put the cable bag in here.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.680]   I'm going to this time.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.400]   I just have all my cables with me,
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.560]   but you really don't need to.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.600]   Usually I will just keep like essential cables.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.280]   Like if I feel, if we're going for a long trip,
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.680]   like if you ever fly to Asia,
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.880]   usually a couple of flights,
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.920]   at least during the past two years,
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.920]   it's been a couple of flights to get there.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.280]   And it means that you're going to be traveling for ages,
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:11.160]   like more than a day in some cases.
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.480]   So we're taking a laptop charger in this bag,
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.280]   separately to the gibbet bag,
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.320]   that has what I've been doing,
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.360]   and then just putting the gibbet bag in like a suitcase.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.280]   Laptop goes straight in here.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:31.960]   And usually, despite us traveling
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.200]   for the most of the past two years,
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.520]   Lara still doesn't have like a decent laptop bag,
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.200]   'cause she just likes to have like this tiny backpack,
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.680]   which is, I'm not joking,
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.280]   about this size.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.080]   So you can't fit anything inside it.
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.880]   Or she has a handbag,
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.120]   and neither of those you can put your laptop in.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:56.240]   So she usually, I usually end up carrying that in this bag.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:01.240]   So two MacBooks, the smaller dimension ones,
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.040]   it's like 13 inch maybe,
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.960]   they both go in here and it's fine.
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:12.720]   Okay, and yeah, that's how I pack everything.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.240]   So this works pretty much anywhere,
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.560]   at least for me, it works.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.200]   So that's really good.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.240]   It's all super lightweight, as you can see,
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.840]   there's hardly anything there.
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:27.680]   But with that,
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.880]   you are pretty much going to be able to work anywhere,
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.440]   which today's world is pretty useful
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.960]   for a lot of people, I think.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:40.960]   So yeah, that's it for this video.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.840]   I hope it's been useful,
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.920]   and I will see you again in the next one.
