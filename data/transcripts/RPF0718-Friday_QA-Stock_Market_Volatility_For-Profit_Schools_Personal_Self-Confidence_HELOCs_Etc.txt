[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.760]   We've got our phone lines open here with, looks like, one, two, three, four, five callers.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.560]   So let's go. Let's get to it. I love these Friday shows.

[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.440]   But today we begin, let's see if I can make this work, everything work.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.800]   We begin on the phone with, looks like, Lisa.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.440]   Lisa, welcome to Radical Personal Finance. How are you?
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.360]   I am good. Thank you, Joshua. How are you?
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.960]   I am very well. How can I serve today, Lisa?
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.280]   I thought I was too, but I will go. So I've called in before and you were very helpful.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.000]   Thank you. I enjoy your show. But with the volatility in the markets and
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   with the COVID and everything else, previously I was looking into total stock index funds,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.720]   but once again, I just saw a movie, The Big Short, and with all the volatility and the
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.960]   corruption and the recent pandemic, are total stock index funds even a safe bet these days?
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.520]   And if not, what is your recommendation? And I know that you don't hold that license anymore,
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.880]   but I value your opinion. And so I'm just wondering, in light with everything else
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.880]   that's going on, I know it's a good time to buy. However, the fact is they are.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.080]   What is your opinion on that?
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.000]   Depends on what you mean by safe bet. There are a lot of ways to do that.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.880]   When you think about risk in general and specifically what risk, there's so many
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.680]   different kinds of risks that you have to define what you mean by safe bet. So tell me specifically,
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.320]   what are your concerns about the stock market? What are you specifically concerned about?
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.520]   Well, for instance, I would only invest in something like a total stock index fund,
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:26.480]   like a VTI or something. But after seeing, once again, I'm not a weirdo, but I did watch again,
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.440]   Snowden and The Big Short and things like that. And it does bring light to the fact that we don't
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:38.000]   know really what's going on and buying into the stock market is like a crapshoot. That's why total
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.520]   stock index funds, in my opinion, are the best. And I also purchase, I buy green funds as well.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.920]   But before I put money out there for VTI or anything else, whether it's Vanguard or
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.800]   other total stock index funds, I was just wondering what your opinion is on those because
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:03.360]   I guess my fears are stock market is basically the prices are, they're not real. I mean,
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.360]   they're real, but they're not. And I know you know what I mean by that.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.400]   And so a total stock index fund, yes, it's less volatile because you get the best of the best,
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.760]   however, it's still the stock market. So the other options are, you know, people say
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:26.400]   Bitcoin. Well, you and I both know that's not going to happen. And gold and silver, you know,
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:34.560]   okay. But what other options are as safe, and I'm doing hand quotes in that, as a total stock index
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:41.680]   fund, meaning semi-conservative. - Well, so let me give you some ideas to think about and kind of
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.920]   just to talk through how I think about the subject. So first of all, there are tons of
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.120]   investment options available. Just yesterday, somebody offered me and asked me if I wanted to
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:02.000]   invest $625,000 in a short-term loan for a company that had sold millions and millions of dollars of
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   face masks, millions of face masks to a government, and basically we could pick the terms. And so,
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.800]   you know, I didn't do the deal, but that's the kind of thing that really is available. Like,
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.120]   there are tons of options available for you in the marketplace if you're willing to,
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.920]   I guess, think creatively is a big thing. If you're willing to think creatively and consider
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.160]   what you'd like to invest in and then start talking with people about the different ideas
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.040]   that are available and the different things that can be done, there are tons and tons of
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.960]   investments available. Can you buy gold and silver? Sure. Can you buy Bitcoin? Sure.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.320]   But those are by far from the only worthwhile investments. Now, let's begin with the risks
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:50.640]   of the stock market. Whenever you're working on and talking about risks, you have to identify
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:57.680]   what risks are we dealing with because there is nothing in life that is without risk. The stock
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:04.800]   market is filled with risk, but in some ways it's a lot safer with regard to risk than many other
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:11.200]   things. So, when you're talking about a widespread passive investment, like an index fund, like a
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:18.480]   total stock market index fund, what that represents, your shares of that mutual fund, what
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:27.280]   that represents is it represents thousands and thousands of companies. Thousands and thousands
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:33.200]   of companies. And those companies have active businesses that are profitable. Those companies
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:40.000]   have facilities and land that is all around the world. So, it's globally diversified. They have
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.720]   customers, they have brand equity, their customers like them. Whether it's everything from Coca-Cola
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:53.200]   that I drink Coca-Cola or I drink Pepsi or I use Thai detergent or I use Apple computers or I
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.840]   use Windows or whatever, the customers love them. The customers use their products every day.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.080]   And then by virtue of having an active business, they can adjust to the current environment.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:10.080]   If they're running out of money, they can build new products. If they are going unprofitable,
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.480]   they can fire employees, they can lay off staff, they can do whatever they need to do
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:24.160]   to start to build profits. And so, if you try to get me to believe that investing in the stock
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:32.160]   market is risky, I have a very hard time believing that. Now, what are the risks in the stock market?
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:38.880]   Well, the risk of the stock market is it's highly volatile. And I prefer to use the word volatility
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:45.680]   rather than risk because it's a specific form of volatility. The market is clearly incredibly
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:53.120]   volatile. Clearly, it goes up, it goes down. And it goes up and down with practically no idea from
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:08:05.280]   us of what it is on any particular day. And it's hard sometimes to figure out how to know what's
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.360]   even going on. I do not understand at this point in time, I do not understand the stock market.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.000]   And I'm one who should understand it. I'm one who should understand why it's doing what it's doing,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.040]   but it's not. Because basically, what you see when you look at market volatility, you see
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:25.920]   the expression of millions of people's individual decisions to buy, to sell, to
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:32.160]   you know, just, and it's hard to put all that together. So, the market is very volatile.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:37.760]   Now, it does face significant risks. So, let's say that you did have a scenario where you were
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:45.040]   convinced that the market was going to, that overall, the economic situation was going to be
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:53.840]   really low, that things were, everything was going to be stuck, how it is that companies are not going
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:09:00.000]   to have any profits, that the economy is going to be in recession for many, many years, where you
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.840]   would expect then the stock market to be pretty low in terms of its overall performance. You would
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:12.480]   expect that it wouldn't perform. I'm going a little bit in circles, partly because it's a
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:18.880]   hard question, and partly because I'm broadcasting live at the moment, answering your question,
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.880]   trying to make an intelligent job of it, and then simultaneously handling multiple camera feeds,
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:28.240]   which is an interesting experience. No, no, it's not nothing about you. I'm just acknowledging out
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.960]   loud to the audience that's watching on Facebook and on YouTube and whatnot, that this is a new
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.240]   thing for me. I've got to build, you know, yesterday's show was all about the fact that
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:41.600]   I got to build these new skills, and one of it is, and that's what I'm doing. The point is that
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:47.760]   volatility is not the same as risk. So if you believe fundamentally in the promise of index
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:52.000]   funds, if you believe fundamentally in the promise of the US economy, if you believe fundamentally
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.800]   in those things, then you should invest and you should ignore the volatility. Now, that said,
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:04.560]   I'm going to do a show pretty soon on basically why I don't miss the stock market. And I will
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:09.200]   tell you this, that I have not missed. I sold out of the stock market a number of years ago,
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:16.160]   not out of a market timing or a prediction, but just out of frustration, annoyance, and offense
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:24.240]   at the general kind of stock market, the way that things are done. And I have not missed
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:31.440]   sitting on the sideline. I have not missed the volatility. I have enjoyed sitting back and just
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.400]   having stable money right now. And I'll try to articulate that in a future show where I'll say
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:43.280]   that for me personally, I think I'll probably own some stocks in the future, but it's hard for me to
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:50.320]   imagine ever going back into the market generally. What I have to admit and concede is what the
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:11:01.680]   market itself is really good at is the market is really, really good at giving you the ability to
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:07.120]   invest passively. And because the market is so efficient, as long as you can deal with the
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:12.320]   volatility, the US stock market is in some ways relatively low risk. For example, the risk of
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:17.440]   your being defrauded in the US stock market is relatively low. If I'd taken that deal that a
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:25.120]   friend of mine offered me yesterday to invest $625,000 in short-term loans to a company that
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:30.800]   was trying to do a deal with a national government, they'd already sold the contract. They just needed
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:36.160]   some bridge financing. If I had taken that deal, there's a very real possibility that that kind of
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:42.880]   deal could have resulted in my facing significant, I could have been defrauded. Because I don't know
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.280]   these guys. I don't know what's going on. Whereas when you're dealing with a big publicly traded
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:52.480]   company, it's a very different risk proposition. Go ahead. But the government is, as you know,
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:12:00.000]   is not honest either. We all know that. I just heard that somebody else tried to sell a bunch
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.040]   of masks and they were sold. And then I think Trump put the kibosh on it. So I mean, I'm sure
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:11.760]   that you saw that and you were hesitant. But anything with the word government in it, I'm
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:21.520]   hesitant on. But that's why when I say total stock index funds, even that earnings can be adjusted
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:26.480]   or depending on owners and companies, I don't really trust anything. I'm a little bit like you
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:32.160]   in that camp. But if I was going to do something, that's why I thought the total stock index fund
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:38.160]   is better than betting on certain stocks in individual just because, yeah, you know what I'm
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.400]   talking about. Yeah. And I'm not trying to tear that strategy apart. And that's why it's so hard,
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.560]   because we're trying to have about a five minute conversation or at this point in a 10 minute
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:56.320]   conversation on something that is really complex. What I just point out to you is that, yes,
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:02.160]   an index fund, a broad stock market index fund is going to be far safer than investing in individual
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:07.120]   stocks because your wipe out risk of any one company going bankrupt is extremely low. But
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:14.240]   by that regard, it's far safer. What I will say this is this. Since I don't sell stocks anymore,
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:21.200]   I used to sell stocks and I used to have thus a financial incentive to talk up the stock market.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.680]   I still believe there's value in the stock market, but I'm not nearly as persuaded of the value for
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:34.320]   individuals as I was when I sold stocks professionally. Are they useful? Yes.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:39.440]   My family members own stocks. I'm not trying to get my parents to sell their stocks.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:43.520]   I'm not trying. I'm not on a crusade to get people to sell their stocks. But I am willing
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:48.240]   to say at this point for people who have an interest and who are willing to study and are
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:53.760]   willing to think and willing to work that there are probably other options available that are
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.760]   better. I've been working for the last few years on trying to figure those options out.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:05.360]   I still haven't solved it perfectly, but I'm working on it. And so if you'll stay tuned to
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:10.240]   the show in the coming years, in the coming months, I'll try to keep on giving you some ideas
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:16.720]   that will help you to figure out how to make better decisions and how to provide options that
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:22.800]   are going to be more profitable, but satisfy that risk, that concern that you have. What I'll tell
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:28.000]   you is that if you are concerned, you should probably wait until you're really sold. I think
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.720]   that people get into the stock market far faster than they should, and they get out far slower than
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.800]   they should. We go to Drew in Missouri. Drew, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today,
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:42.640]   sir? Hey, Joshua. I've got a mix of a couple of your favorite topics today. Okay, let's go.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:49.840]   Postmasters and confidence. Okay. So I've committed myself to, I've been to about 10
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:55.840]   postmaster meetings now. I just, yesterday after your Facebook, I signed up for the role of a
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:02.640]   speaking role. I guess it's the icebreaker speech and the pathways. But I'm just really almost kind
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:06.720]   of sick to my stomach. I'm actually much more nervous than my a hundred percent stock portfolio
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:13.840]   about speaking on Monday night. Did I, right? Is it hard to that sounds? Well, they actually say
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:21.680]   that a lot of people are more scared of public speaking than they are of death. I haven't,
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.360]   I haven't fact checked that statistic in a while, but if you're sick to your stomach,
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:31.040]   you should know that's normal. And I'll tell you that it doesn't, it, it, it, that'll never go away.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:38.240]   Right now, as I mentioned on yesterday's show right now, I am live streaming the show on Facebook
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:45.120]   and live streaming and creating video content. And it makes me, I've, I've, I don't get very
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:49.040]   nervous when I'm speaking in front of a crowd these days, cause I've done a lot of it. I don't
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:55.520]   get nervous anymore speaking with a, in a, on the podcast just because I've done it for so long. So
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:00.720]   I don't actually get nervous in that, but I'm nervous as anything right now. When I went to hit,
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.720]   hit go live and I'm saying, okay, I got to perform in front of an audience.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:09.440]   Um, that's all over the world where they can see me. I'm going to lose that, that mystique, that,
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:15.600]   that mystique of it just being my voice. They can see my, my DIY haircut. I cut my hair myself.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:20.960]   They can see my big beard. That's not cool yet, but it's still bushy. Like it's, I got sick to my
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:26.400]   stomach, um, just before the show, um, right now, as I'm talking to you, I'm nervous. Um, my hands
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:31.520]   are shaking. My, my, my blood grows a little bit cold. And so that, but the point is that none of
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:36.720]   that matters. Um, because those are just emotions that I'm experiencing. Those are just physical
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:42.480]   reactions. And as I do it more and more, uh, I will go through that phase. And so if you're going
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.640]   for your first speech at Toastmasters, what you need to know is that every single person at
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:52.720]   Toastmasters has been through that same experience. Every single one of them, um, you know,
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:59.600]   had their knees knocking. And so the, the point of Toastmasters is to provide you with a friendly
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.920]   environment is to provide you with, uh, people who are going to support you, who are going to
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:09.280]   listen to you and you will find no more friendly environment. So even if you completely flub the
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:15.600]   entire thing, even if you put yourself in a situation where you, you, you freeze on the spot
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:20.320]   and you can't, um, you know, you can't do anything. They're going to say that's all right.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:24.160]   Try again next time. And so you're in good company. What will happen is by the end, by the time you
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.480]   get to that 10th speech in your competent communicator workbook, when you get to that 10th
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:33.520]   speech, um, you'll still be nervous. There'll still be butterflies, but it won't be as paralyzing as
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.920]   it is right now. What you've got to commit to is no matter what, no matter how I feel, I'm going
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:45.200]   to do it. Um, and then that, that habit of doing something that invokes just tremendous fear in you
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:51.920]   will revolutionize your life over time. Awesome. That's funny to hear. Um, uh,
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:56.320]   one last thing. I'm also signed up to the word master role. Uh, I'll talk to your head.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:02.160]   Do you have any words that you'd want to represent Monday? Oh, you mean you're going to, um,
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:08.000]   you're going to talk, you're going to bring the word of the day. Is that the key? Yes, exactly.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.320]   Okay. So you need a word of the day. Is that, is that what you're asking? Yes. All right.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:23.280]   Um, let's go with sanctimonious, sanctimonious. Um, there's your word of the day because I think
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:28.400]   it, it, it, um, uh, it applies in today's world. If we look up the definition of sanctimonious,
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.880]   I'm not sure if you're, uh, uh, familiar, but if we look up, um, sanctimonious,
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:41.360]   are you, do you know the word? Uh, no, but I'll be sure. So sanctimonious means behaving with
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:46.160]   sanctimony. That doesn't, um, that doesn't mean anything, but hypocritically pious or devout is
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.960]   the definition that pops up for me when I do a quick look, hypocritically pious or devout.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:57.920]   And so when somebody, um, is just so kind of saccharine sweet, when somebody is so, um,
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:03.520]   hardcore in the fact that they're, um, you know, that they're, uh, Oh, well, they're just perfect,
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.600]   right? They don't have anything to, to applaud for. And I, I view that right now, when I look
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.840]   at all the debates, especially the political debates and whatnot, it's a useful word in
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:18.080]   today's word. So there's your word of the day. Sanctimonious. I'll follow up with you on Facebook.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:23.120]   Yeah, that'd be great. Go for it. All right. We move now to Lucas in New Jersey, Lucas,
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:29.200]   welcome to the show. How can I serve you today? Hey, Joshua. Uh, I called him last week or two
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:36.240]   weeks ago, whatever the last one was, uh, about, uh, starting a childhood, uh, development school
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:42.800]   or, uh, Montessori school. And you had recommended that I go and look up, uh, Nick Kozel's manual,
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:49.920]   which I downloaded it. Um, uh, I went to Gary Norse website and you suggested and bought a copy.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:55.680]   Uh, it's very long. So I got through probably the first 20 pages and, uh, spurred my interest. Um,
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:00.960]   but you would ask that I call back and we could talk a little bit more about the subject. So that's
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:06.960]   what I'm calling for today. Yeah. So, um, I'll tell you kind of, let's start with, uh, I'll give
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:13.200]   you some ideas that I've thought about, and this has been one of my genuine, um, backup plans that
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.280]   I've thought about as far as an interesting business that I would enjoy doing that I would
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:24.000]   think has real meaning. And that would be really, um, up my alley, uh, for me just as an individual.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.080]   Um, the reason it's up my alley is because it combines profit, um, you know, potentially
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:37.200]   massive profit, um, with impact. Um, you know, when you think about the role of a teacher and
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:46.240]   you think about the, the ability that a teacher has to, to influence students, um, I mean,
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:50.320]   is there anything better? Is there anything more? And when I think about it, the re the way that I
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:56.160]   think about it is I start with even just like my thought as a father, right? I consider my work as
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:03.520]   a father to be my most valuable work. Um, I consider that to be probably the biggest part
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:09.840]   of my legacy. I'm optimistic that I'll be able to impact my friends. I'm optimistic. I'll be able to
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:15.600]   impact my family. I'm optimistic that I'll be able to impact your life as a listener positively in
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:20.400]   this context, but at the end of the day, the people that I'm going to have the most impact
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:27.120]   with are my children. And because I can impact them at such a young age, I can chart the course
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:31.520]   of their life. And if you think about that, that's why teachers are so important, which is why the
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:38.800]   choice of a teacher is so fundamentally important. One of the, the major issues that I have personally
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:43.440]   with government schooling is that you don't get a chance to choose your teachers in a government
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:50.320]   school. You are basically accidentally pushed into a place based purely on your geography.
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:56.080]   So you can choose what house you live in, what zip code you live in. Um, but if you,
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:00.960]   at the end of the day, you don't choose that teacher. You don't get to choose what that
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:05.200]   teacher stands for. You don't get to choose, um, the worldview of that teacher. You don't get to
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.040]   choose the education level, that teacher, you don't get to choose that. So if you want a little
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:12.320]   bit of freedom and a little bit control of your children, you have to move out of that system
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:17.360]   where it's forced upon you based upon where you ha you happen to live. And you have to move into a
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:22.160]   system and move into an environment where you can choose. And that's where private schools come in.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:27.520]   So you can be private schools that could be home education. Those are fine. Um, I'm, I'm purely in
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:32.960]   public anyway. I'm purely an anti-government school person. Um, I'm pro any other solution
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:37.200]   that parents want to choose because they'll choose it intentionally. And so when you're choosing
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:42.880]   teachers for your children, you get to choose the philosophy of education that you, um, are
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:49.600]   interested in. You get to choose the, um, belief system of the people. Like, I think it's crazy
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.760]   why any Christian would send their child to a government school. I think it's crazy why any
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:56.880]   Muslim would send their child to a government school or why any Jew would send their child
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:02.880]   to a government school. Like you have this officially, um, secular system that is going
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:06.880]   to do nothing but work to undermine the religious beliefs that you have as a family. And you're
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:10.320]   going to send your child to that school and expect them to come out a good Muslim. Like,
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:14.400]   you're going to spend your child to that school and expect them to come out a, a faithful Orthodox
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:21.840]   Jew. Like it's crazy. And so, um, you can work in that environment and you, if you'll recruit
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:26.400]   other teachers that you're the one who chooses, then it's, then it opens up the doors to you.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:32.640]   So now what about you as somebody who's seeking to, um, to market something in that space? Well,
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:37.760]   I'm going to assume that you have some ideas that you care about. You have a philosophy,
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:45.760]   a religion, a worldview, um, an educational, you know, uh, what do they call it? Just, uh, uh,
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:50.400]   like a system of, of, of development that you care about. And you think this is really going
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:55.920]   to work. This is going to work really well. And so the, you're going to say, um, how can I,
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:01.600]   um, how can I inculcate the Montessori educational philosophy? How can I help my
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:07.040]   child to explore the world around them? How can I help the child to learn in this, this very,
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:13.040]   uh, you know, simple way. That's, that's the kind of philosophy that you have the chance to promote.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:18.320]   And maybe that's super, super influential on a child. So like the educational philosophy that
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:24.320]   we have found to be the most inspiring as a family is the educational philosophy of Charlotte Mason.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:29.120]   Like we're really, I love Charlotte Mason's philosophy and we do kind of a quasi hybrid
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:33.200]   Charlotte Mason approach with our, with our children, but you can market a philosophy and
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:37.600]   you can adjust your children. Um, the classical schools do this really, really well. You can
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:42.080]   have an opportunity to, um, help the classical school in the classical tradition. You can have
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:49.040]   an opportunity to say, listen, we're going to, to inculcate this, um, uh, trivium into your child.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.240]   And it's going to have all these benefits and you can market that really effectively.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:59.760]   So, um, daycare, I think provides you with a really easy way into that. And if you follow
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:04.800]   an approach like Kozel writes about in his manual, where you, and basically for the uninitiated,
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:12.400]   the basic idea is that you go to churches, you, um, ask those churches, if you can use their
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:16.720]   facilities, their church buildings, their, um, you know, their fellowship hall or whatever they
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:21.440]   have, the stuff that's unused during the week, you go to those churches and you ask them, can I use,
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:26.400]   uh, your facilities and, and, and host a daycare for my children, for children in that. And then
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:31.920]   what you do in Kozel's approach, you provide daycare services, which are an increasing need
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.640]   when you have more and more dual income families, you provide daycare services, but then you bring
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:41.120]   into those daycare services, you start to add in additional levels of instruction. So you start to
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:47.680]   add in good amount of teaching and that starts to build the platform for your, um, your student base
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:53.120]   where they actually, the parents want that high level of education for the daycare. So you're not
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.160]   just competing with a daycare that's going to put the pop the kids in front of the TV all day,
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:00.480]   or just let them do nothing. You're starting that education. And in our current society,
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:06.000]   where education is basically thing number one for most people, that ability to, to educate a
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.680]   young child really will, will set you apart in the marketplace. And if you can prove your results,
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:18.880]   you can prove your ability to, um, to actually get results for the child, for the children.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:24.480]   Um, it's, it's really remarkable. Um, as far as a sales process, if you can, if you can keep your
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:30.640]   costs low by using church property at a less expensive rate, and you can keep the quality high,
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:35.760]   you can build a big business. Now, what can that lead into? I think that naturally leads into,
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:40.480]   um, giving parents an opportunity for the next level of schooling. What I would love to do
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.480]   myself, and I don't know, and this is what I was talking about. I don't know if the market actually
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:48.880]   exists for this. You would have to test it. I've never tested it in the actual marketplace,
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:56.240]   but what I would love to do is I would love to provide a place of education and supervision,
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:05.520]   um, for parents, but without the full requirements of school. And so, um, the thing that I've thought
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:11.840]   about is how could I bring together home education and homeschooling parents, but provide a neutral
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:18.240]   place where children can have, um, supervision, a little bit of tutoring, uh, a little bit of
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:26.720]   basically, um, help without necessarily having the need for, um, for certification and accreditation,
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:31.280]   et cetera. And to me, that would seem to be a really good model. Let's say that you had a
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:35.840]   stimulating environment that you could find, might be a big house, um, but you could set up
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:40.880]   students and a place for students to work. And you could arrange a deal with the parents to say,
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:44.800]   you're the teacher, you're in charge of the homeschool environment. We're just here to
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:48.400]   facilitate it. We're just here to help you, but you're the teacher and you're in charge of it.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.680]   But we know that you need to go to work. We know that you're a single parent. We know that you
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:56.720]   can't stay home all day and take care of, of your children. And so what we'll do is we'll give the
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:01.480]   facilities, we'll give you the environment. And in this environment, you'll be able to then, um,
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:07.680]   you'll be able to, uh, get a great education for your child. And what I would do is I would leverage,
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:13.440]   um, workbooks. I would leverage online education and I would try to market that like middle tier
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:18.240]   space because I know a lot of families who would love to homeschool. They don't mind taking on the
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:22.720]   official responsibility of the homeschooling. And by the way, this can be, you could, you could
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:27.200]   actually help them there. So you could provide, um, you could keep the records for them. They're
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:31.440]   the homeschooler. You're just an assistant tutor. Basically you keep all the records for them. So at
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.640]   the end of the year, when they're sitting down with the accredited teacher to fulfill their,
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:38.720]   their requirements with the government, you have the records. They can easily pass that. You're
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:43.120]   supervising the children, you're tutoring them, but you're not taking on the role of a teacher.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:46.960]   I would market that like crazy because I think that's fundamentally good for the student.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:51.840]   I would have an age integrated environment, a safe environment. We'd have a zero tolerance policy on
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.760]   anything, any kind of bullying on anything. It would just be very easy because we don't have the
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:00.640]   same problems that a school has. It'd be very easy to keep the bad kids out and get them somewhere
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:05.440]   else so we can have a really healthy environment. We could do it in a very casual learning
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:11.280]   environment. Again, a big giant house would be great. We could integrate fun. We could integrate
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:15.920]   exercise. We can integrate the child being able to work at a desk, the child being able to work
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:21.600]   outside, sitting under a tree. We could integrate the food, all that stuff really inexpensively,
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:26.560]   but by avoiding the need for the accreditation, we could keep the whole thing really lean and mean
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:32.960]   and just encourage student directed education with parental supervision that we're just there
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:38.640]   as tutors and the parent is responsible. That's the idea that I've had. I think there's so many
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:42.960]   people who are attracted to homeschooling, but who can't handle the logistics of it. They need
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.720]   to work. They're a single parent. They have to work during the day. They don't have the energy
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:51.280]   to do it at night. I think you could do something with a tuition of some thousands of dollars per
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:56.880]   year for those services and have it be really, really effective and also really profitable.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:01.120]   I haven't looked into the law on that, but that was my idea that I was referencing. I'd love to
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.520]   see some people trying that and seeing if that could work on a commercial basis.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:15.040]   Yeah, that sounds really attractive. I really like the idea of being more of a facilitator
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:20.720]   for people who want that difference in education for their children. Then maybe combining it with
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:25.760]   some type of worker space where you can actually develop skills that could be valuable in the
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:35.120]   marketplace as children grow. I guess just in summary, I've been at least nudged in terms of
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:41.600]   convincing of homeschooling since your Seven Rings of Liberty series. That's a pretty attractive
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:46.400]   option. I appreciate you sharing. I think with that, what I would do and how I would handle it
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:55.360]   would just be I would emphasize. Here's what I would lean on as my sales pitch. This would appeal
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:31:00.160]   to people who are inclined in the direction of home education. It would not appeal to people
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:05.680]   who are not inclined in that direction. The number one thing that I would lean on would be
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:14.000]   parent-directed. I would host seminars for the parents. I would say, "Let's talk about philosophy
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.200]   and we'll help you integrate any philosophy that you want." Now, some of the philosophies do require
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.720]   a specialized teacher. If you're going to do modus ori or something like that, they're going
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:27.440]   to say, "Well, we want somebody who's trained in the modus ori method." I would encourage my
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:31.520]   parents that we'll help you with any philosophy that you want. We'll talk about it. That would
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:36.480]   be the first thing. I would let the parents choose the curriculum. I would say, "We'll support any
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:41.280]   curriculum choice that you want." If you want your child to go through, I don't know, Liberty
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:46.800]   University homeschooling or a BECA homeschooling, a BECA classroom, we'll provide a safe environment
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:52.320]   while you're at work. We'll provide an environment. Your child can sit in front of the screen and your
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:58.640]   child can take the lessons from the tutor. If you want to do, I like the Ron Paul curriculum that
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:05.440]   Gary North facilitated with Ron Paul. The Ron Paul curriculum would be a great thing for people to do.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:11.120]   You could easily market that and say, "All the teachers, all the lessons are here, right here
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:16.160]   online. All of the child's work is being performed, and we'll grade the weekly essay, or we'll make
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:20.720]   sure it's sent home to the child." I would allow total freedom with curriculum. You want to have
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:24.720]   a Muslim curriculum? Great. You want to have a Christian curriculum? Great. I think there would
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:31.120]   be naturally that those religious groupings, Jewish schools are a really natural place for
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:36.240]   there to be ideology familiarity, but it doesn't have to be. Someone can say, "We're going to
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:41.120]   have an entirely secular school," because there's tons and tons of secular homeschoolers out there,
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:45.040]   that because there's such a broad influence of Christianity in the homeschool community,
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:48.880]   they would love to have environments where they could come together and have a totally
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:53.920]   kind of secular grouping of people. You could allow the parents to choose whatever curriculum
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:59.520]   they wanted. Number three thing is that you could really, what I would sell is I would sell
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:09.920]   student-directed learning. The idea here is by helping the student to take charge of themselves,
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:14.160]   by telling the student that, "Listen, our job is as proctors or facilitators. We're here to
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.360]   keep you accountable. You've got to do these things. Here's your checklist, but we're not
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:22.640]   going to hover over you and make you switch on this 50-minute schedule. We're going to allow you
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:28.080]   and keep you in a place where you're the one who has to teach yourself." I love the philosophy.
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:35.360]   I always found Art Robinson's work to be really influential. He was a homeschooler.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:42.160]   His family sells a, it's outdated now, but they sell a homeschool curriculum. I think it's
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:48.800]   robinsoncurriculum.com. Robinson was in a situation where he was a research scientist.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:53.600]   He and his wife were both research scientists, PhD research scientists. They had six children.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.800]   They wanted to homeschool. They were ideologically committed to homeschooling,
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:03.040]   but she died unexpectedly when their sixth baby was a child. It was some crazy illness that killed
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:08.240]   her in about two or three days. Here he was as a full-time research scientist with six children,
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:12.480]   ideologically committed to home education, trying to figure out, "How on earth do I do this?"
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:18.000]   What he settled on was basically that he was going to facilitate a schoolroom environment,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.120]   a quiet environment for his children to study, but he was going to require them to teach themselves.
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:27.840]   He refused to teach them math. He required them to teach themselves math through the use of a
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:34.480]   textbook. The educational credentials that his children went on to achieve are simply incredible
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:39.280]   in terms of their ability to function in an academic environment. They taught themselves.
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:43.760]   It's one of the things that's really important to me is that the younger years, I want to help my
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:49.040]   children. I want to help them to learn to read, but once they can read, I refuse to teach my
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:54.080]   children. I want them to learn how to access information from books, because if you can give
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:35:00.480]   the child that skill and you can say, "I will not teach you that, but I will teach you how you can
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:07.120]   teach yourself," then that's the key question that I think can really make all the difference
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:12.000]   in the world. Lucas, I would explore something like that. The cool thing about it is, in my
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.880]   opinion, you can explore that in a really low-cost way that could start very organically. That can
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:23.520]   be a great family business that you start in a home, a large house, and then it could expand,
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:29.040]   and you could eventually grow it to be dozens. Then you can have multiple houses. There's a
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:32.880]   bunch of ways it can do it, but that's what I would love to see somebody explore and see if
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:39.840]   there's more opportunities. Anything else, Lucas? No, I think I have enough research I need to do
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:42.400]   to fill a couple more of these sessions. Thank you very much, Jeffrey.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:46.560]   Go for it. It's interesting because I think there are opportunities. What I see, especially in the
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:52.480]   wake of what's happening right now, especially as we look and say as coronavirus is changing and
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:58.560]   everybody's homeschooling, I think there's tons of room in the marketplace for lots of people to
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:02.960]   explore new options. All right, Sean in Illinois, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today,
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:06.160]   sir? Hey, Joshua. Thanks for having me.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:13.120]   I think, at least for me, I have a lot more time on my hands these days, and I'm sitting in front
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:17.600]   of a stack of money books and at a certain point I'm just looking for something else to learn about.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:23.280]   Just wondered if you had a suggestion as the next subject to pick up if I was just interested in
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:29.280]   something that wasn't money or the coronavirus or the political winds of the day. What are your
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:40.480]   goals? Good question. I think I'm increasingly keen to learn to do, looking to do things with
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:46.080]   my hands. The idea of just some small garden. I live in an apartment in Chicago, so it's hard to
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:50.800]   have a full garden, but something with planters and just starting to learn rudimentary things
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:56.560]   about seeds and soil, just something to do with my hands during this time. I think trying to stay
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:02.320]   away from wealth cold, and that's something I've probably focused on. Health is probably part of
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:07.280]   that as well. I thought about picking up a book on intermittent fasting. I know that you've done
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:16.800]   some work with the ketogenic diet and probably the relationship with my soon-to-be wife. Read a lot
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:23.280]   about relationships, both with regards to money and just how to communicate more effectively.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:30.480]   So I think that those are all excellent. And the answer to it, so money books, let's talk first
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:36.080]   about money books. Most money books are basically the same. They basically have the same ideas. They
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:41.200]   have the same basic advice. You should save some money, depending on whether you're reading at the
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:50.240]   consumer level, where they say, "All right, go ahead and open an IRA. Here's what an IRA is,
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:54.080]   or here's what a Roth IRA is." They're basically all the same, just a slightly different branding.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:38:00.400]   And so once you've read a handful of consumer-level money books, you don't need to read
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:05.520]   anymore. There are different approaches. Maybe there's a book on getting out of debt that's
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:08.560]   going to help you because you're in debt. Well, then you need that book focused on getting out of
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:15.840]   debt. And then maybe there's a book on early retirement, financial independence, the FIRE
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:20.880]   movement. Maybe that's what you do. But once you've read a few mainstream books, you really
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:26.400]   don't need that many more. What you need is you need to specialize. And so with regard to money,
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:32.160]   what I say is that you break things down based upon my framework for wealth. So by way of reminder,
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:37.760]   years ago, I wrote the framework for wealth, and this is what I use to organize everything on.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:43.760]   There are a total of five things you can do with your money, and it takes 10 words. Number one is
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:48.960]   increase income. All else being equal, the higher your income, the more money you're going to have.
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:54.800]   Number two is decrease expenses. All else being equal, the lower your expenses, the more money
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:59.200]   that you're going to have. Number three, invest wisely. All else being equal, the better your
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:03.840]   investment rate of return, the more money you're going to have. Number four is avoid catastrophe.
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:09.040]   So as long as you avoid the big risks, that will insulate you in difficult times. And then number
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:13.120]   five, optimize lifestyle. You want to optimize how you earn your income. You want to optimize
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:19.680]   how you spend money, and you want to optimize how you invest. But within those, there is an infinite
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:26.720]   variety of ways that you can adjust. And what you need to do is you then need to say, "Okay,
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:32.000]   I've read a few books on money. Where is my biggest strength, and where is my biggest weakness?"
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.800]   So an example would be, let's say that you recognize that... Let me ask you, how much money
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:46.400]   do you earn? About 130 a year. All right. So with 130 a year, you have a good, strong,
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:50.160]   kind of upper middle class income. So how much money do you spend per year?
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:40:01.280]   About 40. Okay. So with $40,000 of expenses, you are in a situation where you have a very
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:05.520]   good savings rate. We've got to factor in your taxes, but you're probably at about a 50% savings
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:10.320]   rate, depending on how we include your taxes and your expenses, which is awesome. Now, what kinds
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:18.800]   of things are you investing in? I am primarily invested in the stock market, and I have one
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:24.800]   rental property looking to expand that. Okay. That being the portfolio. Okay. All right. So
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:29.760]   in that situation, the stock market is an interesting area of focus, but it's probably
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:35.440]   not nearly as much of a priority as your rental market. I think, especially given the timing of
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:39.520]   when we're doing this show, that there's going to be a lot of opportunities in the rental market in
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:44.160]   the coming years. And so what I would do is I would go through what I've just did with you,
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:49.040]   as I went through an analysis. If you were making $30,000 a year, I would say that bar none,
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:52.560]   your highest priority in life should be to figure out how to make more money.
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:58.400]   Because at $30,000 a year, you can't get rich, or at least it's going to take you a very long time.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:03.200]   But with $130,000, you can live well and you can save a lot of money. The next thing I did was
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:07.360]   your expenses. If you told me my expenses are $100,000 a year, then I would have said your
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:11.280]   most profitable focus right now is to figure out how to decrease expenses. How can you go from
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:15.920]   $100,000 of expenses to $50,000 of expenses without giving up lifestyle? Because if you're
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:22.640]   spending that much and you're not saving a lot, then you're just wasting time, but you're doing
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:28.240]   great on that. So now it would go to rate of return, because your rate of return is now going
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:33.040]   to be your limiting factor. If you're just getting stock market returns, you bought an index fund,
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:37.680]   you're getting stock market returns, it's going to take you a really long time to get rich at 6%,
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:44.240]   or 7%, or 8% per year. Is it possible? Yes. And are you turbocharging based upon having a high
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:49.280]   savings rate? Yes. But now your biggest weakness is your investment rate of return. And so you've
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:54.480]   got to figure out how do I go from 6% rates of return to 20% rates of return? Sean, have you
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:59.120]   ever done the math on what a 20% rate of return for your portfolio would do versus a 6%?
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.680]   Sean O'Toole
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:07.200]   I've done the math on 6% and 8%, and I know that that impact is huge. So I can't imagine what 20%
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:10.480]   would be. All right, so let's do the math. You're investing, how old are you, Sean?
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:18.320]   28. All right. So you're investing, you're 28 years old. Okay. Let's assume a 40 year
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:22.000]   time horizon, because it's going to make impressive numbers for the radio. Right. So
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:30.720]   we're going to do a 40 year time horizon. Just a second. Let me get my calculator going here. Okay.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:40.080]   All right. So 40 years, let's clear this, 40 years, and you're investing $40,000 per year.
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:46.000]   So let's do that as our $40,000 payments. Let's start with $0. Well, actually, how much money do
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   you have in your investments right now? Sean O'Toole
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.560]   About, call it 100 in the property and 100 in the market.
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:58.080]   All right. So let's call it $200,000 of present value. This is just, of course,
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:02.240]   rough math. I just want to impress upon you how valuable this is. All right. So we've got
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:10.320]   $200,000 of present value. We've got 40 years and we're going to invest $40,000 per year
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:16.160]   as our contributions. And we're going to get 6% in a stock market index fund.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.600]   Well, at the end of 40 years, under those scenarios, you would have $8.2 million,
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:27.840]   $8,247,622. Right. So $8.2 million. That's good. Right. There's nothing wrong with that. That's
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:35.200]   really, that's really helpful. Okay. But what if you could move that to 20%? The number now would
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:39.920]   be $587 million. Let me redo that because I hit a button and let me just make sure that I did that
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:47.440]   right. Okay. Cause that sounds a little bit too high. Let's see if I can redo this. Just a moment.
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:50.880]   Okay. So 40 years.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:44:02.160]   I'm nervous doing performative math. I hate doing math live. 20% per year, $40,000 going in and
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:09.360]   starting with $200,000 to begin with. All right. Yep. $587 million. So the difference between
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:21.840]   20% and 6% is $580 million. Now, am I predicting that you can make 20% every single year for the
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:28.560]   next 40 years? I'm not. No, I'm not. I'm just doing math to show how big of a deal this is.
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:34.480]   What I am saying is that if you could study the market and you could study your opportunities for
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:40.320]   investment and you could move from 6% to 10%, let's just do that. Okay. Let me, let me redo
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:49.600]   this. Okay. So 10% as our interest rate, 10% is $26 million. So if you can go from 6% per year to
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:55.120]   10% per year, that's a difference between $8 million 40 years from now to $26 million 40
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:45:04.000]   years from now at 12% per year, it is. I messed it up. Anyway, it's more. And so the point is
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.400]   that your best area of focus, now that you've solved the income thing, and now that you've
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:13.360]   solved the expenses, your next area of focus needs to be, how do I increase my rate of return?
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:17.920]   How do I go from six to 10? How do I go from 10 to 15? How do I go from 15 to 20?
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:23.120]   Now, I think that this is very doable. I don't think that you can do this every year for the
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:28.880]   rest of your life, because if you've got a $500 million portfolio, it's really hard to invest
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:33.680]   $500 million at 20%. But I think you could definitely invest a few hundred thousand dollars
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:38.880]   at 20%. I think that you can skirt around the edges and I think that you can find some investment
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:43.200]   strategies. So if you want to do that in the real estate market, right, go and start talking to real
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:47.120]   estate investors and work on your real estate strategies, read real estate books. If you want
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:51.440]   to do it in the stock market, try to figure out, is there a stock strategy that I'm really interested
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:56.400]   in that I'm willing to put in the time to develop? But whatever you can do to increase your
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:00.640]   investment return, that's going to be your most profitable area for your personal focus.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:05.120]   Okay. And that's what you read.
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:09.360]   Okay. Thank you for the commentary.
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:13.280]   Yep. My pleasure. The other stuff is also good, Sean. I'm not saying, obviously, reading about
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:22.960]   relationships and all that, that's obviously valuable. And you should do that. Reading about
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:27.360]   relationships is going to be really useful for you. But what you want to do is you want to,
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:33.920]   I answered the financial question. Don't just read money books. Once you've read five of them,
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:38.160]   skip money books for a while, unless it's a narrowing in, a drilling down on something.
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:43.520]   How can I triple my income? How can I 10x my income? How can I live on $10,000 a year? But I
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:47.920]   think for you specifically, you're in this scenario of needing to work on investments.
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:50.640]   Matilda in Florida, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today, Matilda?
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:57.200]   Hi, Joshua. I'm new to your show, so thank you for having me.
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:58.240]   My pleasure.
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:06.080]   My question is, let's see. So my income is not as high, kind of bouncing off from your previous
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:14.320]   conversation. I make about $50,000 a year and I own my own property right now. My mortgage is very
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:22.960]   small. It's about $450 a month. So I'm trying to get a homemaking line of credit in order to
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:32.400]   pretty much bank on the money until prices drop. And my question is, if I do that, first of all,
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:37.120]   the line of credit I can pull money from, I know that at any time, but the bank can take that away
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:45.440]   from me at any time as well. So do I take the money out? And if I do, how do I make up the
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:52.080]   difference between the 3% interest that I'm being charged and the payment that I'm making every
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:52.480]   month?
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:54.880]   Why do you want to take out a home equity line of credit? What are you going to do with it?
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:59.680]   Reinvest it for another property.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:01.120]   Okay. So into a rental property.
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:02.800]   Correct.
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:05.280]   Okay. If you sold the house, how much is it worth?
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:08.400]   $450,000.
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:11.520]   And what's the current mortgage balance?
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:14.960]   About $50,000.
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:17.200]   And what's the current interest rate on the mortgage?
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.280]   4%.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:24.400]   All right. Do you have other savings, other cash savings?
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:24.880]   Yes.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:25.280]   How much?
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.680]   About $50,000.
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:31.200]   All right. And do you have other credit card debt or other debt?
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.640]   No debt except for a vehicle.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.720]   Okay. And how much is the vehicle worth if you sold it?
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:40.400]   20 grand.
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:41.760]   And how much is the loan on it?
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:45.520]   $370 a month.
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:46.880]   How much is the loan balance?
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:52.240]   Oh, balance. $21,000, $22,000.
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:57.440]   Okay. And do you have any other investment assets? Do you have any other rental properties? Do you
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:58.640]   have any other 401ks?
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:07.120]   Yes. So if I were to put all of the investments together from 401k and IRA would be another
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:08.720]   maybe 50 or 60,000.
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:10.000]   And do you have any other debts?
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.160]   No.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:14.320]   And how much is your annual income at the moment?
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:16.480]   50 grand.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:17.120]   $50,000.
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:25.760]   Okay. So your question, your idea is I should take out, I have $100,000 of potential equity
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:29.920]   available in my house that I could use it for a down payment on a rental house. Is that
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:30.640]   the basic idea?
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.480]   Correct.
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:33.760]   Okay. And so what's your question?
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:40.160]   So my question is, does it make sense for me to take out the HomeMade Free Line of Credit
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:46.000]   that's available, but to already like take the cash out completely and then keep that
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:51.680]   in like a savings account? Because if it just sits available, I wouldn't know exactly the
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:56.880]   timing of the market dropping and them allowing me to take the money out.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:58.800]   So it's like the risk versus...
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:03.360]   Right. Right. So does it make sense? Yes, if you're going to invest the money and if
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:09.840]   you can be disciplined. Your big risks are number one, your personal discipline. The
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:15.280]   reason most people get really hurt by doing a cash out refinance or by taking out a Home
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:19.200]   Equity Line of Credit is they take out the money and then they go and spend it on a
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:24.720]   consumption item. They spend it on fixing up their kitchen. They spend it on a fancy
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:29.520]   trip. And because of that, they don't wind up actually investing the money. And so they
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:37.840]   had some equity, they had some savings, but then they wind up using it up on consumption.
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:42.400]   So you have to ask yourself, honestly, am I in a good situation where I'm going to not
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:49.120]   use the money? Am I a person of discipline? Am I able to resist the siren song of a fancy
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:54.560]   your car or a fancy vacation or something like that? If you are, then yes, it does make
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:51:00.320]   sense to use some of it for investment. The second risk is, of course, that what do you
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:07.440]   invest it in? Do you have the ability to find something that's going to be a better investment?
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:14.880]   Does something emerge? And at this point, you don't know. So if you're going in that
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:18.160]   direction and you're studying it diligently, you're studying the local rental market,
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:24.400]   you're planning ahead, you're saying, I'm really going to invest into, I'm really going
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:30.560]   to do this, then yes, I think it does make sense to prepare for it. So is there a cost?
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:32.880]   Yes. What was the homemaker line of credit interest that you got quoted?
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:35.440]   A three and a quarter.
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:42.480]   Okay. So that's basically negligible for a while. I mean, if you recognize how that we're
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:46.320]   talking fairly short term, let's say that you take out, I don't know, how much will
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:48.240]   they give you? $80,000?
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:54.400]   No, a little bit less than that. Probably, I'm thinking about 65 based on my income and
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:55.040]   my debt.
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:52:03.200]   Okay. So your maximum cost on $65,000 is going to be three and a, your maximum cost is going
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:09.760]   to be about $2,100. So when you're in a situation like you are, where you've got
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:18.480]   $65,000, they charge you three and a quarter, your annual cost on that is going to be $2,100
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:26.320]   of interest. So the question is, is it worth it to me to pay $2,100 for the opportunity
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:30.480]   to have this money, given that the market may go down, they may shrink my home equity
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:34.320]   line of credit, et cetera. I don't know the answer to that. I would think about doing
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:39.440]   it if it were me and I were really serious about investing, I probably would do it.
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:43.200]   The second thing that you should think about is just simply refinancing. You should just
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:46.800]   talk to a traditional mortgage broker and think about just simply refinancing your mortgage
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:54.080]   as a basic mortgage. And then that might give you more money cheaper and be simpler than
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:57.920]   the home equity line of credit possibly. But would I do it conceptually? Yeah, I would
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:59.040]   if I were serious about investing.
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:07.280]   The only reason why I was thinking the line of credit is because of the liquidity factor
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:12.880]   of doing, instead of doing a cash out rate by having the funds available. So if there
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:22.640]   is an investment opportunity to buy a property, I can get it cash versus being able to get
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:29.280]   a mortgage at a later time. So that was pretty much my risk on having to get a mortgage in
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:34.000]   the future versus buying something with a line of credit and purchasing it with a better
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.640]   deal. Does that make sense?
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:44.560]   Not really. I think that either one could be fine. But I think the home equity line
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:48.960]   of credit is more flexible. The whole point is just simply how can I get some money out
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:52.720]   of the house that I could use for a down payment on the property? That's the basic point,
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:58.000]   right? Yeah. Okay. So I don't see that it matters. It's just a matter of getting a quote.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   I would talk to a mortgage broker, find out the cost of refinancing, how much fees do
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.200]   they want to charge, what interest rate, and then find out the fees on the home equity
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:09.200]   line of credit. The home equity line of credit would be more convenient because you could
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:15.680]   put money in and out. So I don't know the answer. I would just get some quotes from
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:16.880]   the mortgage broker and go from there.
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:19.760]   Great. Thank you so much.
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:25.040]   My pleasure. All right. We go now to, looks like James. Is that you, James? Welcome to
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:26.240]   the show. I'm going to serve you today, sir.
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:31.520]   Hi, Josh. I'm going to keep this quick. I got to hop off for another call. But my main
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:38.320]   question is, so a bit of background. So my wife and I did a pretty good job of following
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:43.760]   your prepping advice from your course, How to Survive and Thrive in the Coming Economic
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:52.000]   Collapse, well before this COVID thing started. We got our emergency savings out to maybe
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:58.640]   like six to eight months. And we both are still working remotely, fortunately. We lost
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:05.040]   our daycare, as with a lot of parents. So we're struggling to keep up with that. My
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:11.280]   question philosophically for you is, my wife and I make approximately the same amount of
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:18.000]   money. Each of us are about 80k a year. Hers is the one with, her job is the one with the
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:27.440]   healthcare. And my job is a startup. And so I have a bit more room to increase my income.
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:32.400]   But there's obviously more instability. And so we've sort of been talking about like,
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:37.360]   how nice it would be if one of us wasn't working, my wife would like to not work. But
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:44.960]   right now, with the economic climate, keeping in mind what you always say, keep your income
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:50.560]   as high as possible. Just kind of like, just weighing on my mind about whether I should be
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:59.040]   thinking about getting her, my wife staying home with my son full time. Or whether we should just
[00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:03.680]   stay on the path we're at now, keep saving money and be in a better position when this all blows
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:08.960]   over. I'm going to leave it with you. Oh, I'm sorry. My son's 2.5 years old.
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:09.520]   One child?
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:10.960]   Yes.
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:12.560]   Do you hope to have more children in the future?
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:15.280]   We don't plan on it.
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:20.640]   Okay. I know you got to go.
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:23.200]   I got a couple more minutes.
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:27.680]   Hang up when you need to. I guess I would just say that it's going to come down to
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:32.400]   what's your vision? I'm convinced it's not a financial question. I'm convinced it's an
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:37.440]   ideological question. If I were in your shoes, what would we do? We've got a two and a half
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:42.000]   year old, the two and a half year old, that is the most important time in our child's life
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:48.240]   for him to have parental input. And so we would probably go to...
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:54.480]   My wife would quit her job, at least for this period of time.
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:57:01.840]   Just because to me, that's the best investment we can make. And especially if I've got more
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:06.160]   opportunities to make more money because I'm in a startup, if I'm competent as an individual,
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:11.440]   I'm have a lot of potential in my income, I can quickly make up the difference in income.
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:17.760]   I can double my income within a few years and the money can always be replaced, but the time cannot.
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:23.360]   And so right in that precious, really crucial time of two and a half to four or five years old,
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:28.000]   I think that's really, really valuable time. But that's an ideological question. It's not
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:33.120]   a financial question. I think the answer is just simply, you've got to think about
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:40.560]   your specific ideology, what you and your wife, what your dreams are for your family,
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:44.320]   and then ask yourself what the price of those dreams is. And I can't answer that.
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:47.360]   All I know is that it's not a financial question. It's an ideological question.
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:53.120]   I just want to follow up and say that my wife and I have been switching off during the day.
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:57.520]   We both work from home and caring for our son exclusively, not multitasking,
[00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:04.640]   just spending time with him and spend unbelievable. It makes us want homeschooling so much more or
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:08.720]   something like that. And we're trying to figure out how to make it work now. And I just really
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:11.680]   wanted to air that out and sort of get some advice. Thank you.
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:15.840]   Yeah, my pleasure. I know you got to go, so I'll mute you out here so you can go. But
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:20.720]   I would focus on just saying kind of what's sustainable. Because it might be sustainable
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:24.960]   for you to keep doing what you're doing. If she can make 80 grand and you can make 80 grand and
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:29.440]   you can pass off childcare back and forth while you're working, or maybe if you can hire a nanny
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:34.320]   who comes into your home, a part-time nanny. We have a nanny right now, which helps out.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:38.640]   It allows me to work more during the day and it allows my wife to care for, do homeschooling
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:45.440]   and whatnot. So if you can hire a nanny who comes into your home, that's an ideal mixture, I think.
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:50.400]   If you can find, there are also then think about what you want as far as schooling,
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:55.680]   but you could do some kind of co-op, you could do some kind of sharing. There's lots of ways to do
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:59:02.880]   it. It doesn't have to be all of us all the time or partway. It's just a matter of what are the
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:08.480]   options. And so if you have flexible jobs, I don't see why in a flexible job scenario,
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:13.680]   why you can't do a combination of those things.
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:24.000]   I guess I would just point out that it's an ideological decision based upon your vision
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:31.120]   for your family and not a financial decision. My wife and I have a clear vision for our family.
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:36.160]   I've had a clear vision of how I wanted my family life to be structured for a very long time. I
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:41.040]   never even considered the money. It was just never even a consideration because it was an
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:47.680]   ideological commitment. And because of that lifestyle that I want, I want the lifestyle
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:53.040]   of flexibility. I want the lifestyle of that. And because I have a business that can generate
[00:59:53.040 --> 01:00:00.720]   enough money to make that doable, that just was never really a calculation. So those are my
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:06.080]   thoughts. I think you think about your vision and then you go from there. Matt in California.
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:09.760]   Oh Matt, hold on. You said you didn't have a question and yet here you are hanging out
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.720]   on my phone call. You better go with a question or have some topic of conversation.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:23.280]   Well, Matt's playing quiet. All right. That is it for the callers. And look at that. I did that
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:29.040]   in an hour. I'm going live on Facebook here today. And so as a special bonus, try to get you
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:34.080]   guys to come watch my live streams, which you can do at facebook.com/radicalpersonalfinance. Find
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:41.760]   the Facebook page. I would love for you guys to join me there and watch these live streams. So
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:47.120]   I'll answer a couple of questions from Facebook that are coming in as well. Usually these Q&A
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:51.520]   shows are for patrons, but I'll answer some questions and hopefully incentivize you to come
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:58.560]   on over and join me there. Adam says, "Hi Joshua, if you have time today, would you give us your
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:03.120]   thoughts and strategies for staying productive while working from home? I'm sure many in the
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:12.720]   audience are new to the virtual work environment." Well, I'll tell you yes, but the answer is it
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:21.840]   depends on what facilities you actually have. So the first thing is, and also what your scenarios
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:28.880]   are. I've worked from home. My dad worked from home before. It was cool a long time ago. And so
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:34.800]   I think one of the most valuable things is do you simply have a place that you can work? Sorry for
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:41.920]   the siren guys. I'll record over it because I got no choice. Do you have a place that you can work?
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:48.240]   If you've got five children, six and under, and you're trying to work in your home office that's
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:52.480]   at your living room, that's going to be really tough. And so the first thing is you have to
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:58.400]   think about what place do I have to work? Where can I actually go and do the work? If you have
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:02.320]   a home office, then that's really valuable. Or do you have a corner of the bedroom? But at the end
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:09.280]   of the day, you cannot work and supervise children. If you're a couple and both of you work from home,
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:12.640]   then I don't see that you really have any problem. You just put your laptops on the kitchen table
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:19.600]   and you work there. But if you have children, that's a really tough scenario. So my tips are,
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:23.440]   number one, is I make sure that I have a quiet place to work. I will often leave the house
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:31.440]   because at this point in time, I have four children, six and under. It's very noisy. And
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:37.200]   so I will often leave the house and I'll work in a lot of different places. Over the last few years,
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:42.160]   I've worked on picnic tables. Even when we had a house, at one point my house, my office,
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:46.800]   I had an office, but I didn't have good sound insulation. I moved into the master bedroom closet
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:50.640]   because I had a bunch of clothes in there. I put a desk in there and that gave me enough sound
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:55.360]   insulation to work. Now, of course, my work is unique because I'm creating audio. And so I do
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:03:01.600]   my best to make that high quality. I have gone and worked in a parking lot. I actually did that
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:06.160]   for some of my courses have been recorded in a parking lot at a local park. And what I would do
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:13.360]   is I set up a mobile office that I really didn't need anything except, I didn't even need an
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:16.960]   internet connection. I just needed a computer. And so I would take a deep cycle battery with me
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:22.400]   and have an inverter. And I would set up a deep cycle battery, grab, or I would just use the
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:27.360]   battery on my car too with an inverter. And so I would use that to power my stuff. I would set up,
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:35.120]   I would carry a table with me that I carried a plastic folding table. And I would set up a
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:40.000]   plastic folding table, set up my laptop. I would set up a soundboard. I would set up microphones
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.520]   and I would power everything from my car battery with an inverter, or sometimes I would carry an
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:49.520]   external battery along with me as well. And so a lot of my courses have been recorded in a parking
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:56.480]   lot under a tree. So that's one thing that I have done with internet access. If you have a high data
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:03.520]   plan and you don't need to do a ton of live video or streaming video, you can get away with tethering
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:08.160]   a phone. I've done that a lot of times. I traveled for six months around the United States and I did
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:13.200]   all my work tethered from a cell phone. So I just have a cell phone, computer and my audio stuff and
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:18.160]   my audio gear. And as long as you've got a decent connection on your cell phone, that can work as
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:23.920]   well. So all that to say that a lot of times my strategy is to leave home. And I think that that's
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:29.920]   important with children. I simply can get far more work done outside of the home. Now, if I'm
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:34.160]   working on quiet stuff, then I also, then I will work in, or sorry, if I'm working on places where
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:38.480]   the noise is not going to bother me, where the noise is not going to destroy my, my audio,
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:42.880]   destroy my, my course, et cetera, that I'm building, then I will work from home. And I do,
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:46.720]   I do prefer to be at home. It's so nice to just be able to come and go from your home office.
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:52.560]   I love to be there with my children. I really like that. But my strategy is it, my strategies
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:57.440]   have been to, to develop a mobile office for the live watchers here. I'll pop up the,
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:03.040]   the screen that shows you my, my office. If you look at my office my office is totally,
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:10.400]   is totally mobile, totally virtual. And so I have, you know, my gear that I use, I have a,
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:15.600]   I have a couple of laptops. I have an audio recorder that's mobile and I can set the whole
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:19.520]   thing up anywhere in the world. And so the whole thing goes in a backpack. And for me, that has
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:25.280]   been an important strategy with regard to my, my travel schedule, just simply to be able to do
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.960]   my work from anywhere in the world that I travel with a backpack. But long winded way of saying
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:39.440]   that the answer is I don't really work from home a lot of times just because I just because it's,
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:44.640]   it's too loud. All right. Bill says Joshua just started doing the carnivore diet. How's it been
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:51.600]   going for you? Any updates for us for us on that? I went off the carnivore diet for a while because
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:59.040]   I was curious to see if I could go to some normal way of eating and see if that would help me to be
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:06.400]   not fat. I went on the carnivore diet strict for a while, lost a bunch of weight. And I was curious,
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:11.680]   is there some way that I can go back to a more normal style of eating? Because I, I didn't
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:15.760]   experience any dramatic improvement in my health by eating only meat. Some people do, but some
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:21.040]   people vegetables seem to make them sick, but not me. I like vegetables. I'm good at eating them.
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:25.600]   I like all the food. And so I wondered, is there a way that I could go back to some normal eating?
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:30.800]   And I was curious based upon if I just simply don't have a good reference point, because I
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:37.440]   should be able to eat using a normal, varied quote unquote healthy diet. Like I should be able to
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:43.520]   eat that kind of diet and not be fat. And so maybe I'm just used to eating like a fat man, and I just
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:49.120]   eat too much food. And so maybe what I need to do is just do a really careful counting of stuff.
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:57.040]   So I got a food scale and I started eating kind of normal food, a mixture of meat, vegetables,
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:01.120]   carbohydrates, all the food, but I counted every calorie and counted all the macronutrients.
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:10.160]   And what I did find is that I did indeed have, I did indeed have kind of a misplaced judgment of
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:16.240]   what's normal. That I ate more, it was easy for me to eat way more calories than I should have.
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:21.040]   And so the calorie thesis, I think made sense. I found that it was easy for me, relatively easy
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:26.320]   for me to eat 3,500 or 4,000 calories in a day. And if I'm maintaining a sedentary lifestyle,
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:33.840]   that's just too much. And so I did find out based upon that experiment that I was getting fatter
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:41.920]   based upon eating too much food. So in theory, I could reduce my food intake and not gain weight,
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:46.960]   but I couldn't figure out how to lose weight because if I dropped the calories down and I
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:52.560]   ate meat and vegetables and carbohydrates and I dropped the calories down, I just wound up
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:57.280]   still hungry all the time and kind of miserable. I didn't enjoy it. It wasn't satiating.
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:06.720]   And so I gained weight again. I gained another 15 pounds. And so I just found that's not working for
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:13.920]   me and I still want to lose about 50 pounds. And so I went back to kind of low carbing, just eating
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:19.200]   kind of more ketogenic with vegetables. And then I found that also it was just frustrating to keep
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:24.880]   going. So I went back to carnivore. And so I don't think I'll go strict carnivore. I don't think that
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:29.760]   I'll go strict carnivore for very long or necessarily forever, but I do find it really
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:34.240]   useful. It's so simple. So carnivore plus fasting is good. What I'm doing right now is eating
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:40.240]   one meal every two days and eating a carnivore and the weight goes off very quickly under that.
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:46.480]   So it's a combination of fasting, carnivore, low carb, et cetera. That's it for today's show. Thank
