[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   Hey guys, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and it's good to hear from you guys again.
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.320]   I took a nice little break to recharge, to rest, to do a lot more writing and I do appreciate all
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.360]   the positive reviews you've given me on iTunes, Spotify, Google Play. It's motivating and it's
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.280]   also very encouraging to keep on going because goodness knows it's a rough, rough time right now
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.920]   given everything is still closed in the middle of July. And frankly I thought things would be better
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.400]   by July. I thought more things would be open but at least here in California we're rolling back,
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.800]   I don't know, one or two phases. So now not even outdoor zoos are open anymore so that's a bummer.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.400]   But what are you going to do right? What are you going to do when let's say your baby is crying at
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:57.600]   11 p.m and wakes up your toddler and then after about 30 minutes of soothing your baby finally
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.920]   goes to sleep but your toddler's wide awake and then he just can't go to sleep and he's just
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.560]   playing around and then he bonks his head and he starts crying and then he wakes up your baby.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.800]   It's like oh my goodness. I've talked to so many parents trying to just chuggle
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.560]   parenthood and work. I mean we don't have official work but we do like to write. I love to write.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.480]   I love to address business opportunities that come my way on Financial Samurai and I like to do these
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:36.320]   podcasts but it's kind of crazy folks. Everybody really needs to take a step back and pace yourself.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.120]   Pace yourself because there's just an endless amount of things you could do because you're
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.600]   just stuck at home. We're stuck at home and I'm thinking well why don't I work on the forums and
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:53.120]   the podcast and write posts and write a new book. We need to take a step back and think about what
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.840]   our priorities are so we don't push ourselves too hard and burn out and we don't feel too much
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.880]   anxiety. I definitely feel this anxiety like oh man I got to do this this and that or I just
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.520]   need to take a step back and think about the top two maybe three things I need to focus on
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.760]   and those two things are my children and writing. So if you're feeling a little bit burnt out
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.800]   I totally feel how you're feeling and to make yourself feel better and to make me feel better
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.600]   I think we've got to look at the bright side of things and one of the bright sides is the stock
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:38.000]   market. I mean the Nasdaq is up over 20% year to date. We're 20% higher than before the pandemic
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.640]   began. That's crazy and now the S&P 500 at 3200 is about back to where we started at the beginning
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.040]   of the year. So it's as if nothing has happened at all at least in terms of our public stock
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.520]   investments at least and frankly this feels really really weird. It feels like we're in this dream
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:07.840]   world where if we wake up we're gonna see devastation in the streets, buildings collapsed,
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.600]   and our true net worth down 50 to 80 percent and we're hoping we're hoping we don't wake up from
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:21.280]   this dream but the reality is this is real. This is real that the stock market is doing okay in 2020
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.680]   despite all that is going on. So one of the things I want you guys to think about
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.480]   is what the stock market represents. There are probably literally millions of variables that go
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.720]   into determining the value of the S&P 500 because there's 500 companies and each company has
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.200]   different variables to determine earnings and growth rates and forecast assumptions and so
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.800]   forth and it can get very very difficult and complicated to try to forecast the future.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.480]   I've always told all of y'all to try to forecast the future six months, 12 months. It's very hard
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.400]   to do but it's a good exercise to think about the future so you can plan ahead and let's be frank
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.640]   the future is murky right now. It's maximum uncertainty. If you watch the news which I don't
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.160]   recommend you watch too much of or if you stay on social media especially Twitter you will see
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:21.680]   a tremendous amount of fear, terror, arguments, debates that have really brought to the forefront
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.880]   a lot of suffering if you pay a lot of attention. Now I don't know if this is good for your mental
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.840]   health. Actually it can be good for your mental health looking at this stuff all day long so I
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:39.040]   recommend you to take a social media break, take a news break, turn off your electronics, maybe
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:46.320]   listen to a more soothing calm podcast or read a book or something but I want to say that out of
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.080]   all the variables that go into determining the S&P 500 just pay attention to the one which is
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.040]   the level it is right now and the level it is right now is saying things are going to get better.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:04.640]   Everything will be okay. There will be progress. Believe in capitalism and you know these firms
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:13.360]   like Moderna, Pfizer, Gilead trying to search for that vaccine to release by the end of the year
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:19.360]   or by 2021 at the latest. Things are going to get better folks and you have to believe it'll get
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.600]   better and there's really a good chance that the stock market knows something more than what we
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.840]   know, more than all the talking heads, the bulls and the bears out there arguing their positions
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.840]   and arguing their books. The stock market generally knows more than we do if you look at history and
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:44.720]   so I believe things will be okay. Now in terms of the stock market it's very interesting because I
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:52.080]   think most of us would agree that investing passively in index funds or ETFs is the way to go
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:58.400]   and we know this is the way to go because the data says it's the way to go. The large majority
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:05.680]   of actively run equity mutual funds and bond funds have underperformed their respective indices,
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:12.320]   their respective benchmarks. We're talking 80 plus percent of actively run equity mutual funds have
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:18.480]   underperformed the S&P 500 and other various indices. So with this data in mind you would
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:26.480]   kind of be a fool to invest the majority of your investable assets in an actively run fund. Yet
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:33.120]   despite the data actively run funds still account for something like 45-50 percent of all the funds
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.600]   out there and all the assets under management out there. So if you want to get rich, actually the
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.600]   better way is to study finance, to study investing, to study cash flows and income statements and
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.800]   balance sheets and try to be an analyst or a portfolio manager at one of these actively run
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.640]   money management firms. These folks make bank. They're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars,
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.920]   if not millions of dollars if you're a partner at one of these private money management firms.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.600]   They're really going to get paid regardless if they underperform or outperform. Now obviously
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.120]   they're going to make even more if they outperform, but even if they're underperforming
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.440]   they're still making hundreds of thousands of dollars. And if you want to join the sell side,
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:20.320]   well it's also quite lucrative as well. There's this one fellow, a Tesla analyst at J.P. Morgan,
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:28.000]   and he has been negative on the stock and he's had a sell rating something like four years in a row
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:36.480]   and he just upgraded the target price to $290 a share when the stock is at $1,500 a share or
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:43.040]   thereabouts. We're talking about a 5x difference, folks, and he's still sticking to his $290 target
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:48.160]   price. Well, it's a new one. I mean, that's a joke. But he's still going to get paid probably
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:55.440]   a $250,000 base and he's probably going to get a bonus of maybe, I don't know, $100,000 to $500,000,
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:03.200]   maybe more. So the other lesson is never doubt yourself. There are people out there making lots
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:10.560]   of money every single day without the proper experience or the results. So you have got to
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:17.680]   believe in yourself because if you actually do deliver on incredible product, incredible service,
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.640]   you're actually going to do even better. So back to the original thesis of this podcast, which is
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:30.640]   what should be the right split between active and passive or passive and active. And I think we
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.840]   should all agree that the majority of our investable assets should be in passive investing.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:41.120]   And so there's different splits for different types of personalities. I think the vast majority
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.000]   of people, the average person who is not a professional stock picker, doesn't work in
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.200]   finance and so forth, should probably have 80 to 90% of his or her investable assets in passive
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:09:02.480]   index funds or ETFs. And for the remaining 10 to 20%, you can invest in actively run mutual funds
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:08.960]   that have historically done well, that are 5 star, morning star rated, and so forth. In addition,
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:15.440]   you can use part of the 10 to 20% to actively invest in individual stocks. I've been doing
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:21.440]   this since 1996, I believe, when I first opened up my first online brokerage account. And the
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:28.480]   idea was quite simple. Why not invest in companies you love, whose products you use,
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:36.160]   and then invest a majority of your funds in an index fund. So it's an index plus or a passive
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:43.200]   plus strategy. I like this strategy a lot for several reasons. One, if you just invest 100%
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:49.360]   in the S&P 500, for example, you're going to ride the ups and downs of the S&P 500, which is great
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:56.160]   over the long term, because the S&P 500 has proven to return about 8 to 10% a year since about 1926.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.920]   But you're not going to be able to outperform the masses who invest all of their assets in the S&P
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:08.080]   500. You will outperform those who don't bother investing, who don't listen to Financial Samurai,
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:15.840]   or read any other financial websites or news sites. That's fine. But you're also trying to
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:22.640]   outperform the masses who do invest, because wealth is relative. And if you just stick 100%
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:27.760]   to index funds, you're always going to be part of the average person who invests in index funds.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:36.320]   Now, if you can invest 10% to 20%, you have a chance. You have a chance of outperforming. And
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:42.480]   that hope and that chance is predominantly the reason why there are still so many actively run
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:48.960]   funds out there. People are hoping that they choose the right fund. The fund managers themselves are
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:54.720]   hoping that they outperform, because sometimes they will. 20%, 30% of the time, they will
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:00.320]   outperform in one year, or over five years, or three years, or whatnot. And so long as there's
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:06.160]   hope and as long as there's a chance, people are always going to try to risk their money into
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.720]   thinking they can outperform the market. But we all know we can't. Now, if you just allocate 10%
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:15.520]   to 20%, even if you lose all your money, which you're probably not going to if you have a
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:21.920]   relatively diversified portfolio of at least 5% to 10% positions in your 10% to 20% active investing
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:26.320]   allocation. Even if you lose all your money, you're still going to have 90% to 80% of your
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:31.840]   money left that's going to go up and down with the S&P 500. But there are chances. There are
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:37.200]   opportunities where you could be able to significantly outperform the S&P 500 if you
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.760]   invest in the right stock. And we all know that tech stocks have done tremendously well over the
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:48.080]   past 10, 15 years, actually for longer than that. There's names like Google, Facebook, Apple,
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:55.280]   Amazon, Tesla. And there will continue to be great outperformers out there. So why not go hunting?
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:00.000]   And if you go hunting, maybe you start with just one position, a small position. You learn about
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.800]   the company. You learn how to analyze the company. You learn how visionaries and leaders think and
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.760]   how they plan ahead. You might get better investing over time. You might get lucky.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:17.600]   You might want to own the stocks or the very products you use every single day. As soon as we
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:24.160]   had our baby, we decided to go Amazon Prime. And we're thinking, "Man, Amazon Prime is a lifesaver
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:29.120]   because we don't have to go out and get stuff like diapers and so forth anymore. We just have
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:35.040]   everything delivered." So we started aggressively buying Amazon stock. And so whatever that company
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:41.360]   is, it actually feels great to use the product and then invest in the product and hopefully make
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:47.440]   money in the product to then pay for more of the product for free. Not bad if you can make it
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:54.320]   happen. However, we all know that we cannot consistently outperform the index, which is why
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:13:00.240]   we need to keep that active investment portion to a minimum. There was an interesting JP Morgan study
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:09.280]   that said that the average investor returned 1.9% between 1999 and 2018. So that's a 20-year period.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:14.880]   1.9% a year. I mean, that doesn't even beat inflation during that time or money market
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:21.120]   funds or the 10-year Treasury bond yield. So we investors, we retail investors, are terrible at
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:27.200]   picking stocks. Let's just be aware of that. And we also, most of us are not professional investors.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:32.320]   We don't have time to wake up an hour before the stock market opens at 5.30 here on the West Coast
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:38.800]   and read up all the research, get on earnings conference calls and analyze income statements.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:44.160]   We don't have time. We have other day jobs. We have kids to take care of. We have friends to
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:50.240]   hang out with. Well, maybe not too many friends now with the lockdowns, but you get what I'm saying.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.480]   We've got other things to do. So let's not kid ourselves about being able to consistently
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:14:01.840]   outperform. Time and time again, folks, I have seen our investment winners get into our heads.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:08.080]   We start suddenly confusing brains with a bull market, which is a classic saying on Wall Street.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:14.880]   And then we start taking excess risk with our money. And then, surprise, surprise, things kind
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:20.880]   of shock us into losing money and bad things, exogenous things happen. And then we're left
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:28.320]   in tears trying to pick up the pieces. So 80 to 90 percent in passive investing, the rest
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:34.960]   in active investing. You know, obviously, do your due diligence, do your work, make calculated bets,
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:41.520]   diversify your portfolio and good luck to you. It is an absolutely absurd time in the stock market
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:48.480]   right now with tech stocks going up like crazy. The S&P 500 almost back to even and still so much
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:54.960]   uncertainty. So please, folks, be responsible when you're investing. Take calculated bets.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:59.680]   The last thing I want you guys to do is lose more money than you can afford.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:04.240]   Thanks so much, everyone, again, for all the positive reviews. It keeps me going.
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.760]   and I'll talk to you guys later from the hot tub hopefully in a week or two.
