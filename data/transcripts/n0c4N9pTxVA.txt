[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   At this very moment in time, what do you think the AI industry is getting wrong?
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.900]   Everything changed December last year when ChatGPT was released.
[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.720]   Now you got to like think what really happened there.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.640]   It wasn't like we didn't have these models.
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.720]   It's like the interface and the RLHF tuning to make it like a real joy to interact with
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.760]   suddenly unlocked people's ability to see what was possible.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.760]   Now we've got a lot of just application developers.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.920]   They're coming in using these things, seeing it just as another API they can hit.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.400]   Probably one of the more common mistakes is like not putting a standard way to actually
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.480]   measure this stuff in a way that can be shared with folks, which is, I mean, that happens
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.760]   to be really good for weights and biases because we build a lot of tools to help do that.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.600]   But I think we're going to find it being more and more critical as the space gets more complicated
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.600]   and there's more iteration.
