[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   Humans, why do you think we are the worst breathers in the animal kingdom?
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.400]   What are we doing wrong?
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.460]   I won't tell you why I think we are the worst breathers.
[00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.900]   I will tell you why we are the worst breathers.
[00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.700]   So there's a number of different things.
[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.960]   I'll start with the most obvious.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.160]   And to me, it was the most revelatory thing.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.760]   The fact that our faces have changed.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.500]   Our mouths have changed.
[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.900]   Our airways have changed.
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.160]   Our sinus cavities have changed in the past around 300 to 400 years.
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.600]   And this has been caused by industrialized food.
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.700]   We don't chew and everything's shrunk, which is why we have crooked teeth.
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.660]   And with crooked teeth, you have a smaller mouth, smaller mouth,
[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.700]   smaller airway breathing problems.
[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.900]   That's the first of a multifaceted series of reasons
[00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.140]   why we are such terrible breathers.
