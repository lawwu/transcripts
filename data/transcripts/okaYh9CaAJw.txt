[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520]   Well, if you enjoy reading books and reading for an extended period of time and getting
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.000]   lost in a story, thank God for this gift, because it is a gift not all Christians can
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.120]   enjoy.
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.840]   For many believers, reading is made painfully hard by dyslexia, as is the case for a podcast
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.520]   listener named Henry, who writes in to us today.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.960]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.120]   I recently discovered that I suffer from a learning disability that impairs my reading
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.120]   ability.
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.440]   I can only read a short amount of material, I lose my concentration after a few minutes
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.420]   and then develop serious headaches from reading on past that.
[00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.080]   At first I thought I was just lazy, but it is actually a learning disability I have had
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.360]   almost my entire life.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.720]   I want to read the Bible and read it fully, but I find it incredibly difficult.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.300]   At times it's almost impossible.
[00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.800]   How can someone who can only read for a very short amount of time read the entire Bible
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.280]   and glean truth from it?"
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.040]   "I recently wrote an article that I called 'Sanctification and Senility.'
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:14.280]   The question I raised was, 'How do you fight for faith and the obedience that comes from
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.500]   faith when your memory has weakened to the point where you don't remember the promises
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.040]   of God after you read them?'
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:31.600]   And part of my answer was that we should see senility and the loss of memory, eventually
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.880]   loss of eyesight and the ability to read and loss of hearing and ultimately perhaps being
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.080]   in a coma, we should see all of this as a progressive state of disability."
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.640]   Henry's drawing attention to disability.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:56.440]   "And that we not be passive, but that we multiply our personal efforts as much as we
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.600]   can and make up the difference for what we're losing.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.360]   And finally, that we involve other people, the precious friends in the body of Christ
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.000]   to do for us what we can no longer do for ourselves, like bending over us in our final
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.560]   coma and with a loud voice," I remember doing this with my grandfather, "with a loud
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:31.160]   voice shouting into our ear, 'Even to your old age I am He, and to gray hairs I will
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.400]   carry you.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.480]   I have made, and I will bear.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.560]   I will carry and will save.'"
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.760]   Everybody thought my grandfather was gone.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.760]   He wasn't even there.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.680]   He probably weighed 90 pounds and curled up like a fetus and wore a diaper and hadn't
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.080]   spoken for weeks, and his eyes were all crusty.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.480]   And when my father and I got done shouting our prayer in his ear, his whole body convulsed
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:06.240]   and he said, "Amen," which so shocked me, I've never, ever ceased to pray and read
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.440]   into a comatose ear.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:16.400]   So all that to say, if it gets that bad, don't even give up hearing the Word of God then.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.280]   Surround yourself with people who can help you.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:26.000]   So maybe I need to make explicit an assumption about the importance and means of sanctification,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.280]   because I don't know where Henry is on that.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.160]   Henry may be only asking about how he can read the whole Bible as a kind of spiritual
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.680]   discipline, but I want to stress that hearing the Word of God from Scripture, by whatever
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.200]   means we can, is not a mere spiritual discipline.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.780]   It is a matter of life and death.
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.780]   We live by faith, or we don't live at all.
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.760]   And faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.120]   Romans 10, 17.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.400]   "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes out of the mouth of
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.400]   God."
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.400]   Matthew 4.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:10.480]   Jesus said all of that and more about hearing and depending on the Word of God.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:17.680]   Faith, however, cannot be sustained without the Word of God.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.680]   And holiness comes from faith, and holiness is essential for salvation.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.680]   Like it says in Hebrews 12, 14, "Strive for the holiness without which we will not
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.680]   see the Lord."
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:37.920]   So you can see, Henry, that for me, the question you're raising is not peripheral, it's
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.920]   not marginal.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:46.400]   It goes right to the heart of what it means to be a Christian and how to sustain faith.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.120]   And there are huge obstacles standing in the way of hearing the Word of God, and those
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.560]   huge obstacles are there for all of us, not just those with learning disabilities.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.840]   The big ones are sin and indifference and love for the world and spiritual blindness
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.560]   to the glory of Christ.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.740]   These are all huge obstacles to hearing the Word of God.
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:15.720]   But there are also obstacles like senility and, in Henry's case, a learning disability.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.920]   So I take Henry's question very seriously.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:27.200]   How do you, Henry, maintain faith, what Paul calls fighting the good fight of faith, and
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.680]   how do you fight for holiness, which comes through faith, when there's a learning disability
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.000]   standing between you and hearing the Word of God?
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.200]   And let me just make four suggestions.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:46.360]   Number one, be sure that your mindset is not simply to put a certain amount of time in
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:54.400]   on the Bible or read a certain amount of the Bible, but to feed your faith on the blood-bought
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.080]   promises of God.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:02.060]   Faith lives by standing on the gospel and trusting the promises.
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:08.200]   The goal of reading the Bible is to know God, what he's done for us in Christ, and what
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:15.340]   he has secured for our future, whether it's five hours or 5,000 years from now.
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:22.520]   And we need to see the beauty and the glory and the certainty of spiritual things in the
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.520]   Bible.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.600]   So the goal is not just to put in a certain amount of time or to cover a certain amount
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.240]   of material.
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.720]   The goal is to see and savor God and his ways and his promises.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:41.600]   The goal is to fight for faith and to walk in obedience by faith.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.360]   So be sure to keep that mindset.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.960]   Go to the Bible to get food for your faith.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.280]   Now here's the second one.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:58.720]   Earnestly ask God to help you, to give you wisdom in dealing with your learning disability
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.040]   or whatever the obstacle may be.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.520]   Ask him for supernatural help.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:13.400]   I'm dismayed at how many Christians are fatalistic, materialistic, humanistic when it comes about
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.120]   their disability, when it comes to do with their disabilities.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.200]   That is, don't just think in terms of medicines.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.280]   Don't just think in terms of therapy.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.360]   Don't just think in terms of human discipline.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.280]   Those are all important.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:39.160]   Think in terms also of what a sovereign God can do if he acts on your behalf supernaturally.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.320]   He may not take away the disability.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.820]   He usually doesn't.
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:52.200]   But who knows what he may do if you ask him in regard to reading the Bible with your disability.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.880]   Here's number three.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:08:00.600]   Feel it, that with a disability, you're going to have to work harder than most people to
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.320]   attain the same ends.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:07.880]   All of us have weaknesses that are different from other people's strengths.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:14.960]   And if we spend our time in self-pity, treating those weaknesses as excuses, we will waste
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.120]   our lives.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:23.800]   There are some strengths we'll never have and some things we'll never accomplish.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:34.280]   But oh, oh, what amazing things people with disabilities have accomplished by refusing
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:40.200]   to be dominated by the negative implications of their weaknesses.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.920]   It's amazing.
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:47.880]   For example, instead of reading the Bible for half an hour, you may need to read the
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:55.600]   Bible three minutes, ten times a day by setting the reminder on your smartphone.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:01.560]   Or you may work harder to memorize scripture so that you have it in your mind and heart
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.040]   when you're not reading because of how hard it is to read.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.640]   Here's number four.
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.300]   Don't neglect the use of audio Bibles.
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.960]   They are a glorious gift of modern technology.
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.200]   You may discover.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.200]   Try this.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:24.640]   You may discover that turning on the audio of your Bible on your iPad or smartphone or
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:34.840]   CD player and following the text with your eyes, that kind of reading may actually overcome
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.120]   some of the negative effects of your disability.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.880]   I do that when I'm especially tired.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:48.320]   I let the audio read for me while I read with my eyes.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.100]   Or you can just shut your eyes and listen.
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.720]   Or you can listen in the car.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.200]   Or you can listen while you're making dinner.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:58.200]   Or you can listen while you're going to sleep or while you're waking up.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.920]   I think that's really important.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.520]   Go to sleep and wake up to the Bible instead of goodness knows what else people use to
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.880]   go to sleep on.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:15.360]   And lastly, I would say, by all means, spend a lifetime cultivating deep friendships in
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:23.080]   the body of Christ and in your family if you can, so that when you're old and can do hardly
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:30.400]   anything for yourself, others will be there for you to read to you and to perhaps in that
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:39.560]   last comatose hour say glorious words really loud into your seemingly deaf ear, even to
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.600]   your old age, I am he, into gray hairs, I will carry you.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.880]   I have made and I will bear.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.720]   I will carry and will save.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.720]   Amen.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.040]   That is a good and helpful word for struggling Bible readers.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.120]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.680]   And if you have a question about Bible reading, please send it to us.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.680]   There's not many more precious questions to us than questions about how to read the Bible
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.680]   better.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.400]   So keep those questions coming to us.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.000]   And thank you for listening and making the podcast part of your day and a part of your
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   commute.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.800]   It's an honor to tag along with you and to be part of your day.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.000]   Three times a week we publish and you can subscribe to our audio feeds, search our past
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.380]   episode archive, even reach us by email with a question you may be facing about the struggles
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.160]   you face in Bible reading like this one today from Henry.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.880]   It is a very good question.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:25.880]   Thank you, Henry.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:32.840]   We do all of those things through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:38.060]   Well what is the difference between unholy anger and holy anger?
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.160]   And does this difference have any real application in our own lives?
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:46.080]   It is a question that will lead us into a deeper discussion on the dangers of anger
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.240]   in our lives and anger in our marriages.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.400]   That's when we return on Friday.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.080]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we will see you then.
