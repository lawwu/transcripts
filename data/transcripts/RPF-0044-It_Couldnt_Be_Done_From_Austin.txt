[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:38.480]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast for Monday, August 18, 2014. I thank you for
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.200]   being here. Mobile podcasting today. I am on the road, but I wasn't going to leave you without a
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.840]   show. I wouldn't do that to you. What would you do without your daily dose of Radical Personal
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:01:05.760]   Finance Podcast? I couldn't leave you without a daily dose. I know, I know. Maybe you're not
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.600]   quite that addicted that you could go one day without a show, but I'm doing my best to bring
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.200]   you a show every day. And I just want to give you something thought provoking. Today's show is going
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.640]   to be very different than any show we have ever done, and it will be shorter than any show we have
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.880]   ever done. I am currently sitting here on the shores of Lake Austin in Austin, Texas. I've been
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.520]   this weekend at the Podcast Movement Conference in Dallas and then came up to, or down to Austin to
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.040]   visit a friend of mine. And I'll be back with you soon with full length shows. But today I am going
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.840]   to share with you a thought provoking poem. I've had a wonderful weekend. I will do, I'll give you
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.960]   some information and some of the things that I learned attending this conference. I've had an
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.720]   awesome time and it was really a great experience for me. But I don't have time today to record
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.920]   that. So I'm going to leave you today with one of my favorite poems. This is a poem entitled,
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.040]   "It Couldn't Be Done." And the author is Edgar Albert Guest. I won't give you any commentary or
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.560]   interpret it for you. I will leave that up to you. Somebody said that it couldn't be done, but
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.640]   he with a chuckle replied that maybe it couldn't, but he would be one who wouldn't say so
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.200]   till he tried. So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin on his face. If he worried,
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.120]   he hid it. He started to sing as he tackled the thing that couldn't be done. And he did it.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.720]   Somebody scoffed, "Oh, you'll never do that. At least no one has done it." But he took off his
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.360]   coat and he took off his hat. And the first thing we knew he'd begun it. With a lift of his chin and
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.520]   a bit of a grin without any doubting or quit it, he started to sing as he tackled the thing
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.960]   that couldn't be done. And he did it. There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.840]   There are thousands to prophesy failure. There are thousands to point out to you one by one
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.120]   the dangers that wait to assail you. But just buckle it in with a bit of a grin.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.520]   Just take off your coat and go to it. Just start to sing as you tackle the thing
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.560]   that couldn't be done. And you'll do it.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.720]   Enjoy your Monday, everybody.
