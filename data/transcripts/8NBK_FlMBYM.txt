[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740]   All right, Jesse, let's do some deep life related questions.
[00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.020]   Who do we have first today?
[00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.740]   - All right, first question's from Mark,
[00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.220]   a 38 year old sales director.
[00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.500]   I spend many hours a week taking care of my kids,
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.860]   cooking, cleaning, gardening, doing chores,
[00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.740]   fixing up my house and so on.
[00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.820]   Between this and my work, I have little to no free time.
[00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.760]   The same applies to my wife.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.300]   When we do have free time, we are generally tired.
[00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.660]   The idea that we could each find energy and time
[00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.980]   to consistently take long walks, work out,
[00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.220]   or read for hours seems fantastical.
[00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.500]   Do we need to be able to afford to outsource mundane tasks
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.580]   to cultivate a deep life?
[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.180]   - Well, Mark, we could reword this question to say,
[00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.500]   is it possible for a family with,
[00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.260]   and he gave a little more details about his work,
[00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.480]   but a family with lower, upper middle class jobs
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.800]   to take walks or exercise or read?
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.820]   I don't think that's a fantastical goal.
[00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.300]   I think there's a lot of families
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.500]   in similar professional situations
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.380]   where people still take walks,
[00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.060]   still exercise, and still read.
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.660]   I think that is definitely possible,
[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.980]   but what I also recognize that right now in your life,
[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.500]   it doesn't.
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.060]   I think that's important.
[00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.140]   And this is where I think the fuller deep life stack
[00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.500]   we introduced earlier is much more helpful
[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.280]   than the way we used to talk about the deep life
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.460]   where we would just focus on the final changes
[00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.520]   because what's happening here,
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.660]   and I'm very empathetic to this.
[00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.160]   I've been in this situation before.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.760]   Many of our listeners are in the same situation
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.900]   where your time just feels completely out of your control.
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.260]   And it puts you in a defensive mood.
[00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.800]   It puts you in a mood where you're just sort of down
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.540]   on the prospects for doing anything with any control.
[00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.560]   We're exhausted all the time.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.540]   We're working all the time.
[00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.140]   When are things gonna happen?
[00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.180]   How could I possibly think about carefully overhauling
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.020]   other parts of my life?
[00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.600]   So let's go back to the deep life stack.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.980]   What I'm gonna suggest here
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.820]   is actually working the deep life stack.
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.740]   Even though this might seem like I'm giving you more work,
[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.700]   it's going to help.
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.780]   So I'm gonna think about the stack.
[00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.860]   I have it here in front of me.
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.020]   Jesse, may let's load this back up on the screen.
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.860]   - Okay.
[00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.700]   - All right, let's think this through.
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.540]   All right, Mark.
[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.360]   So what would this mean for you?
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.860]   Well, one, discipline.
[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.180]   Well, the key thing here is really gonna be,
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.060]   here's my place, my drawer, my folder.
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.180]   We're gonna keep track of everything we're about to do.
[00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.940]   That doesn't take time.
[00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.580]   Here's a folder, here's a desk drawer, that's fine.
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.980]   And we're gonna throw something into our life here.
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.860]   Not super time consuming, but kind of hard.
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.380]   And maybe you're gonna have to stretch a little bit.
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.580]   Okay, I can do this during my lunch hour every day,
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.700]   or before I go to work,
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.020]   it's gonna be maybe a fitness thing or something else,
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.220]   but just something.
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.740]   Something that is optional, but meaningful to you,
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.940]   that you're just gonna commit to,
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.100]   whatever it takes, I'm gonna find time to do this.
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.660]   I think that's worth doing.
[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.460]   'Cause we're gonna start changing that mindset.
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.860]   And once that succeeds, you're gonna say,
[00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.120]   okay, at least it's possible.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.500]   I am the type of person that's possible
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.060]   that I can find time to make something happen
[00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.140]   that's important to me, even though my life is busy.
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.060]   Then we get up to values.
[00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.020]   You're clarifying what's important to you and your wife,
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.020]   and you should do this together.
[00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.740]   And we'll talk more about that in a later question.
[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.620]   What's our code?
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.740]   What are the rituals?
[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.580]   What are the routines?
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.420]   Keep the rituals and routines very simple right now
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.340]   because you're feeling overwhelmed.
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.340]   But they can still be in there.
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.420]   There can still be that moment of prayer every day.
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.820]   If you're religious, there can still be that
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.700]   meditative moment, the gratitude journaling routines.
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.500]   There can still be something you do,
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.800]   even if it's just, look, it's Saturday morning.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.020]   There's a one-hour volunteer thing or a charitable thing.
[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.260]   You just have set up, I give money to this cause,
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.580]   not a lot of money, but I do it.
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.820]   And every month we do it.
[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.860]   And it's not very time-consuming, but it's concrete,
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.940]   and it's driven by your code.
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:40.760]   And you get that in place.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.460]   We're not adding a lot of things in your schedule yet.
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.380]   Now you're ready for the thing
[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.580]   I think is gonna help you most,
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.860]   which is the calm layer of the stack.
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.660]   So now, buoyed by your discipline,
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.300]   so the idea that you can make changes
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.400]   and have control over things even when it's difficult,
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.700]   buoyed by your values that are really pushing you
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.240]   towards what matters and what's not,
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.500]   so you have a compass that gives you
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.300]   a very strong north reading,
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.020]   you can start to put in place some organizational system.
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.860]   What's on our plate?
[00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.260]   How do we manage our time?
[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.740]   What is this load?
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.500]   And then more crucially,
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.940]   where should we start pruning or simplifying?
[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.380]   Driven by your values, driven by your discipline,
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.580]   you piece by piece try to take what sounds
[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.540]   like a whirlwind in your life right now
[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.000]   and make it into a much more orderly flow.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.480]   We do this on these days, not this.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.060]   We finish here, we do this in advance.
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.780]   We get all the paperwork for the kids done
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.380]   in a, you know, over lunch on Thursday.
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.540]   You would be surprised, Mark,
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.000]   when you're driven by a sense of self-efficacy,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.540]   when you're driven by values you trust,
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.860]   by how much control and breathing room
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.720]   even a standard busy middle class
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.500]   or upper middle class life can seem,
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.660]   how much room you can find,
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.620]   how much breathing room you can find.
[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.740]   And I don't want you to go right to this.
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.160]   I mean, I want you to follow the stack.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.460]   I think there's a, the discipline stack is key
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.300]   because you have to have the sense of,
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.820]   I'm able to do things that are hard
[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.020]   and I have a place I keep track of them
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.020]   and I follow what I write down.
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.520]   You need the value stack because it's hard to prune.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.540]   It's hard to take things back
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.980]   when you don't have the bigger values driving you.
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.220]   But once this column is in place,
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.980]   then and only then do I think you're ready
[00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.300]   to think about the planning step.
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.020]   And I think by the time you get to the planning step,
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.440]   you're now gonna have the control
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.940]   and breathing room necessary
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.140]   to make the changes that right now seem impossible.
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.800]   And they might not be major,
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.020]   but it might be some sort of routine.
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.820]   You're walking, you're exercising, you're reading more.
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.900]   I think that's gonna be completely on the table.
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.700]   More importantly, you're also now well set up.
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.260]   If you discover what's really holding us back here
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.060]   is maybe the nature of our jobs.
[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.860]   Maybe the demands of this jobs,
[00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.020]   maybe that's making things impossible
[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.740]   to really overhaul the other areas of my life
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:43.560]   the way I want.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.740]   Or maybe it's to have these jobs, we have to live here.
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:46.660]   The schools here aren't good.
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.460]   So our kids have to go over to this private school.
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.960]   The private school means we have to work more
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.500]   and the private school is really difficult to get to
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.620]   and we're driving back and forth.
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.700]   And that's what's stopping us from overhauling
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.900]   these other parts of our life.
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.180]   Oh, this is all really clear now.
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.400]   And we're driven by our values
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.780]   and our sense of self-efficacy
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.260]   and our control over what's going on.
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.380]   So we really can understand what's causing our time famine,
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.180]   what's causing our issues with our schedule.
[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.460]   With all of this in place,
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.860]   you might get clarity that you wouldn't have right now.
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.280]   We should move and take a different job.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.660]   Oh, we need to leave the city.
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.100]   Let's go here.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.580]   They could go to this public school.
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.720]   They could walk to the middle school
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.860]   and the cost of living here is cheaper.
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.580]   And actually I could go down the halftime
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.340]   and do my old job remote while my wife still did full-time.
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.180]   But now we have a lot more.
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.500]   Now there's someone here after school.
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.300]   Oh my God, all the pieces fit in the place.
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.420]   And I can overhaul these other parts of my life
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.620]   and everything is deeper.
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.140]   But you can't get to that type of clarity
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.640]   without the other pieces first.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.860]   So I feel your pain, Mark.
[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.780]   I also think that you can find more depth
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.860]   and by control and intention and satisfaction
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.660]   with your life, you can find it and you should.
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.020]   And I think work to full stack.
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.220]   My apologies for presenting this earlier in past episodes
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.700]   as just start overhauling your fitness routine.
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.460]   Work the whole stack and have confidence.
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.300]   More intentional, satisfying, meaningful life
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.220]   is absolutely available to you and in your situation.
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.380]   This is not something that's unovercomeable.
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.500]   You're not a refugee in a war torn nation.
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.060]   You're not scrambling for jobs
[00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.140]   just to try to keep the heat on.
[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.540]   You actually have a foundation more leveraged
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.860]   than you think, but it's also much harder
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.220]   than we often let on to take advantage of that leverage.
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.140]   So hopefully the stack there is gonna help.
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.660]   By the way, send me a note.
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:27.780]   If you start making some changes,
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.700]   I wanna hear what's going on.
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.780]   You can send the note right over to
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.900]   interesting@calnewport.com, keep me posted.
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.580]   - In terms of the mundane tasks, like outsourcing those.
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.860]   - I mean, that's all gonna happen in calm.
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.580]   But I think his point is he's frustrated
[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.260]   that I have no time, so I can't imagine
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.860]   anyone reading or exercising or doing anything else
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.740]   unless I suppose there's just someone I hired
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.780]   to do all these things.
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.860]   And my point is most people don't outsource all that stuff.
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.700]   And yet many, many people who don't have,
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.140]   I don't even know who you outsource most of this stuff to,
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.460]   they still exercise and walk.
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:08.460]   It could feel as if your obligations
[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.460]   are leaving no time right now.
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.260]   And it could be the case that without having
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.860]   to majorly change your material situation,
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.340]   you could feel three times better
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.460]   by just how you control and track the situation
[00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.340]   and keep track of things with some strategic pruning.
[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.620]   So I don't think, I mean, maybe in the calm step,
[00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:26.220]   they'll realize, because again,
[00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:31.540]   having this precision understanding of where your time goes
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.220]   and how different things interact with each other
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.260]   allows you so precisely to see where the pain points are.
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.100]   So if there is gonna be a little bit of outsourcing
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.540]   that happens, the calm layer is what's gonna give you
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:43.860]   that precision to say, the thing that's screwing this all up
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.700]   is driving back and forth to school across town.
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.580]   Or the thing that's making the schedule impossible
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.020]   is this terrible giant yard we have with all these beds
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.420]   and we're always out there.
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.580]   And if we stop doing this and use that money
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.140]   for a yard crew, everything else becomes possible.
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.460]   Or that's where you say, we need to move,
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.700]   we have to get a different job.
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.420]   It's again, an interesting point that doesn't come up
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.220]   as much in lifestyle design is organizing yourself,
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.620]   tracking your time, being intentional
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.100]   about the deployment of time.
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.660]   Getting that sophisticated awareness of your time
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.700]   is often critical for actually making decisions
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.300]   about what you wanna change in your life.
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.980]   People really don't realize, when you're chaotic,
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.500]   they don't really realize what actually
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.660]   is causing the trouble.
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.580]   And they might flail in different directions
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.580]   or think I have to have a nanny and a full-time whatever
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.620]   to ever get anything done.
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:30.460]   And they don't realize, no,
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.300]   the problem is actually the commute.
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.780]   The problem is actually you live in the wrong house.
[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.140]   Why do you have two acres?
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.660]   And whatever it is, you don't live near your parents,
[00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.700]   you're always having to drive over there.
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.020]   We don't always know the problem
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:43.660]   until we actually get a good awareness
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.620]   of how our time's actually being spent.
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.580]   I mean, that's one of my insights is a book
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.220]   on the deep life actually has to talk a lot
[00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.220]   about time management, which for me
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.260]   was a bit of a breakthrough to think about.
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.320]   (upbeat music)
