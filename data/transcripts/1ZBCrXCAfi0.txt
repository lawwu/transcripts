[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   (projector whirring)
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:18.440]   - Welcome back to Portfolio Rescuer.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.300]   We always appreciate your questions, comments,
[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.140]   and feedback.
[00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.920]   Remember our email here, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.880]   As always, thanks to all the little viewers
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.300]   in the chat here watching live.
[00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.600]   We appreciate it.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.860]   Today's Animal Spirit, or today, ooh, Animal Spirits.
[00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.000]   Sorry, Duncan. - Oh, wow, wow.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.840]   - Wrong show.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.140]   Portfolio Rescue is sponsored by Innovator ETFs.
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.200]   On this week's Animal Spirits,
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.040]   I talked about how everyone in the market
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.880]   wants a resolution.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.360]   They want new highs or they want new lows, right?
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.360]   People just aren't comfortable in the middle anymore.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.440]   They want something to happen fast.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.960]   But what if we just chop for a while?
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.680]   Hey, maybe some bear market rallies,
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.600]   mix in with some corrections.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.440]   What if you think we're going 10 or 15% somewhere,
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.760]   but you don't know which way?
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.400]   Okay, Innovator ETFs has a strategy for this.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.160]   Their Equity Power Buffer ETF
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.840]   gives you downside protection of 15%.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.060]   So that first 50% of losses from when you buy it,
[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.480]   you're covered.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.800]   Upside cap is like 15.6%.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.880]   So you basically have 15% on the upside,
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.400]   15% on the downside.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.720]   So you have some downside protection,
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.740]   but some room to the upside if things happen.
[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.840]   So you're basically giving yourself a range
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.280]   where you have some protection,
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.520]   but you still have some upside.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.240]   So if you wanna learn more about this fund
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.960]   and all the innovators to find ETF strategies,
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.600]   go to innovatoretfs.com.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.080]   - Yeah, I'd say along with taxes,
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.720]   another thing people hate is uncertainty, right?
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.220]   - Yeah, so this is giving you some kind of definitions
[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.060]   and bookending things.
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.500]   All right, last week we had a question from a viewer
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.700]   who asked, I have a sub 3% mortgage rate.
[00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.000]   If I move to a bigger house 'cause I have three kids now,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.800]   it's gonna be closer to six.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.280]   Lots of good feedback and opinions on this one.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.760]   Some people very certain, right?
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.840]   So some people said,
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.760]   there is no way you can get out of that mortgage.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.480]   Do whatever you can, renovate, add a bedroom,
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.260]   make the kids sleep in bunk beds,
[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.900]   which doesn't seem to happen much anymore.
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.260]   You do everything you possibly can
[00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.900]   to keep that mortgage, right?
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.740]   Then we had other people say, no, no, no.
[00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.020]   It doesn't matter, family Trump spreadsheets.
[00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.240]   Who cares about the low mortgage rate?
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.900]   If you can afford it, you move.
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.620]   I think both valid arguments.
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.460]   Here's the thing,
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.500]   neither argument is necessarily right or wrong, right?
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.140]   It's all circumstantial, right?
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.100]   And the problem is most big financial decisions like this
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.300]   exist in the gray area where it's very difficult.
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.260]   And the problem is we don't have a lot of practice
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.440]   with big financial decisions like this.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.560]   It's sort of like we have a couple opportunities to do it.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.760]   You don't get to practice over and over again.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.280]   So I just wanted to offer a friendly reminder
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.200]   that these decisions aren't often easy
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.560]   and often require trade-offs.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.960]   And what's right for you and your family
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.000]   could be completely wrong for someone else
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.640]   and their family or their financial circumstances.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.320]   A lot of it is circumstantial.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.840]   And most of the time, there's no right or wrong answer here.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.880]   It depends on what works for you.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.000]   - I will say though, I'm a big fan of bunk beds.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.800]   I think they're underrated.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.640]   - It's true.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.280]   - Yeah, I always enjoyed climbing up on the top one.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.120]   It's fun.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.240]   - All right, let's get to, I was a bunk bed kid
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.440]   for the first 10 years of my life, probably.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.360]   Top bunk guy here.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.320]   All right, let's do some questions
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.880]   from our wonderful audience.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.280]   - Okay, so up first today we have,
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.700]   "Hey guys, can you please explain
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.920]   "how an inflation-linked bond could have lost money
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.180]   "this year with inflation at 9%?"
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.020]   Good question.
[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.920]   - We've got a lot of questions like this from people
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.600]   because, John, let's do a chart on a 2021 performance.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.000]   So what this is showing is the iShares tips bond ETF,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.640]   TIP versus the aggregate bond.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.040]   So that's basically the total bond fund.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.800]   You can see in 2021, tips outperform, they're up almost 6%.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.520]   The regular bond fund, the bond market was down 2%,
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.000]   call it, right?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.240]   So everyone says, all right,
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.280]   inflation's gonna keep going up, let's load up on tips.
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.000]   John, let's do 2022 now.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.280]   Okay, the aggregate bond market is down 10%,
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.880]   but wait a minute, tips are down 7%.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.740]   How could this be, right?
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.800]   Over the past year, inflation is 8.5%, tips are down 5%.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.760]   Well, so these treasury-protected securities or tips
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.100]   are one of the most peculiar assets
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.720]   in the whole investment universe.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.640]   They're also relatively new.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.800]   So I think a lot of people probably don't understand
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.680]   how they work.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.720]   They've been in the UK since like the '80s.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.000]   I think they didn't come around until 1996 or 1997
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.600]   in the US, so they're still relatively new.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.440]   The way that they work,
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.480]   the principal value of the bond is tied to inflation.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.320]   Inflation goes up,
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.320]   the principal value of the bond goes up as well.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.040]   So whatever interest rate you have on that
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.480]   goes up with principal, right?
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.320]   So that makes sense.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.200]   The problem is you don't get paid that higher principal
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.040]   until maturity.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.120]   So from now into maturity, a lot of things could happen,
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.960]   right?
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.960]   So there's two main reasons for the losses this year.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.520]   One, tips can help protect, excuse me,
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.600]   tips can help protect investors
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.960]   against unexpected inflation.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.120]   So if inflation has already baked into the pie
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.960]   in those rates, it doesn't help much.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.160]   So in 2021, we got unexpected inflation, tips did well.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.120]   In 2022, investors said, okay,
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.720]   we're building inflation into these expectations
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.080]   and the yields went down, right?
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.520]   Number two, sometimes tips act like inflation hedges
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.720]   and sometimes they act like bonds.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.320]   When interest rates rise, tips act like bonds.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.760]   So rates went from, I think the 10-year went from 1.5%
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.140]   at the beginning of the year to 3% now.
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.440]   So rates doubled.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.780]   When that happens, tips are gonna act more like bonds
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.860]   than they are an inflation protection hedge.
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.400]   So the TIP ETF, this is the biggest one that I share as fun
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.740]   that everyone always talks about.
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.760]   It has an average maturity of like seven and a half years,
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.360]   an average duration of seven years.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.280]   Duration is simply a way
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.680]   to measure interest rate sensitivity.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.480]   So interest rates go up or down 1%.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.520]   You expect the price of the bond or bond fund
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.560]   to go up or down 7%.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.280]   So interest rates rise 1%.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.440]   You would expect the bonds to go down 7%,
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.100]   which is kind of what happened this year, right?
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.560]   So tips have sold off.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.920]   The good news for investors from here
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.640]   is you now have higher rates.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.780]   Real rates are actually positive
[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.620]   for the first time in a while.
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.960]   The bad news is you had to eat some losses
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.440]   to get to this point.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.680]   So I think there is one other way
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.000]   investors can potentially make it
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.720]   so the inflation protected hedge is a bigger part of it.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.240]   And that's short-term tips.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.980]   So John, throw up the next chart
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.040]   of the Vanguard short-term tips fund here.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.400]   So this is inflation really took off in April of 2021.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.680]   It's the first time it went above 3%,
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.880]   which is the long-term average.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.360]   And this is the performance since then of the VTIP fund,
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.080]   which is Vanguard short-term tips versus the TIP fund.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.400]   You can see short-term tips have outperformed
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.760]   and they've done so as much less volatility.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.860]   And the reason is because that fund
[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.320]   is not nearly as sensitive to interest rate changes.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.660]   The inflation kicker matters more for short-term tips.
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.140]   So that's one way that you can actually protect a little bit
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.580]   and kind of have that inflation hedge
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.100]   be a bigger part of it than the interest rates.
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.180]   So longer-term tips are gonna have a lot more volatility.
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.860]   So if you wanna narrow down more to that inflation piece,
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.700]   that's how you do it.
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.460]   And I'll be remiss if I didn't mention
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.540]   Series I savings bonds,
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.700]   which we spent a whole episode talking about here,
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.560]   one of our favorites.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.380]   There's a capital I want you to put in those.
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.120]   Though that is the best one-for-one inflation hedge
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.860]   you can get 'cause you have no interest rate risk.
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.180]   So short-term tips still have a little bit
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.260]   of interest rate risk,
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.300]   but Series I savings bonds have none.
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.280]   So find that episode, we talked about that.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.120]   I know it's confusing,
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.060]   but it's kind of important to understand all the risks here
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.220]   where you have these securities
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.820]   that can act like two different things at once,
[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.760]   and sometimes one thing matters more than the other.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.260]   - Yeah, bond math is one of the more confusing things
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.240]   I've ever looked into.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.080]   - It is, so yeah.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.660]   So I think short-term tips are probably a good solution
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.300]   for people who are worried about TIPs losing money right now
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.500]   if rates continue to go higher.
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.920]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.980]   Okay, up next we have a question from Scott.
[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.080]   My wife and I are in our early 60s.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.020]   My wife is retired and I plan to retire in about five years.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.660]   Our retirement savings are pretty solid
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.780]   relative to our anticipated expenses,
[00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.920]   and my wife also receives pension income.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.000]   My question is about how to invest the bond portion
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.400]   of my 401k, especially as I get closer to retirement.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.360]   It's 50/50 now.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.660]   We also have Roth IRAs and are 100% equity in those
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.940]   because we're targeting those accounts
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.500]   for our longer-term needs.
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.700]   The fixed income portion of my 401k
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.260]   is in an intermediate-term core bond fund.
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.860]   Is that a reasonable place for these funds,
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.500]   or should I consider diversifying across different funds
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.860]   or individual bonds?
[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.980]   I currently plan to delay Social Security until age 70,
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.780]   so we may need somewhat higher withdrawals from my 401k
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.180]   to cover expenses in the first few years of a retirement.
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.260]   Would it be worth considering a bond ladder approach?
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.540]   How easy is that to manage within a 401k account?
[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.940]   And I gotta be honest, it sounds cool,
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.420]   but I don't know what a bond ladder is.
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.540]   - Two questions about bond funds.
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.220]   We're coming in hot today, right?
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.340]   - Right.
[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.820]   - I think fixed income was probably
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.580]   one of the easiest asset classes to allocate to
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:15.860]   for the last 40 years or so
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.200]   because you basically put your money in anything,
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.740]   a core bond fund, U.S. Treasuries, whatever.
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.580]   It did fine.
[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.700]   Interest rates fell.
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.740]   Corey Hofstein actually wrote this piece in 2017
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.580]   that has kind of stuck with me ever since,
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.100]   and he said from 1981 to 2017,
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.860]   10-year U.S. Treasury went from 15% to 2%.
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:34.780]   By my calculations,
[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.300]   the average annual return there was 7 1/2%,
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.580]   which is phenomenal for bonds
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.580]   or these boring bonds over four decades.
[00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.940]   I think the worst year ever was down 11%,
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.140]   and that was 2009 after bonds sold off
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.180]   following the Great Financial Crisis.
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.260]   So that 40-year bond bull market
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.140]   might go down as one of the greatest in history,
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.820]   but most people assume the reason bonds did so well
[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.020]   is 'cause interest rates fell the whole time.
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.180]   And Corey said, "Well, let's look at the attribution here
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.020]   "and figure it out."
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:58.940]   Duncan, if you had to guess,
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.500]   so there's two components to bond fund returns.
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.740]   One is basically the starting yield.
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.580]   The other one is interest rates rising or falling, right?
[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.660]   So if you had to guess over that 40-year period,
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.460]   how much did falling rates have to do
[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:13.020]   with the total return for 10-year treasures over that time?
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.260]   I'm going to say a lot.
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.060]   Okay, less than you'd think.
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.580]   3/4 of the total return came from the starting yield.
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.420]   Only about 25% came from falling rates.
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.540]   So falling rates helped,
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:27.820]   but it was basically you had high starting yields
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.300]   that entire time.
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.180]   So anything you can put your money in in terms of bonds
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.020]   was fine.
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:33.980]   You could buy a core bond fund,
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.580]   government bonds need to be fine.
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.340]   Now, right now, it's a lot harder
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:38.820]   because you have much lower rates
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.940]   and things are choppier and more volatile in interest rates,
[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.620]   and that means things move around a little more.
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.540]   So you could simply let a bond fund manager
[00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.060]   choose where to put you in,
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.100]   which segment to invest in, what duration.
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.620]   The problem is a lot of these core bond fund managers
[00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.660]   have some caps on things like maturity and duration
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:54.500]   that they can invest in.
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.780]   So I think more interest rate volatility
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.220]   means it's probably more important than ever
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.100]   to diversify your bonds,
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.980]   which is something most investors didn't have to do.
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.100]   So that could be, we talked about tips today,
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.020]   short-term bonds, corporates.
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.500]   If you're in a 401(k), maybe a stable value fund.
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.340]   If you're out of a 401(k),
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.940]   that could be some more cash
[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.380]   than series I savings bond you mentioned.
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.220]   So I think there's no guarantee
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.340]   that broader diversification
[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.580]   is gonna improve your risk-adjusted returns
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.980]   or whatever you wanna think about it or your income even.
[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.820]   But I think that helps make sure you don't put your money
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.580]   in the wrong segment of fixed income
[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.180]   or the wrong bond fund manager who really screws things up.
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.460]   The other thing is if you don't have a lot of good options
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.420]   in your 401(k), you can always, when you retire,
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.460]   roll it over into IRA,
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.140]   which will have tons of options for you.
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.540]   So I do think that diversifying in bond funds
[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.060]   is something investors haven't had to think about
[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.380]   for a long time.
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.180]   And that's something people are gonna have to think about
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.580]   now for sure.
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.540]   - It's kind of funny that we've come so far
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.220]   that we're talking, we're getting all these questions
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.500]   about bonds and bond funds
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.580]   when it was like triple-levered ETFs and crypto,
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.940]   you know, like a year and a half ago.
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.100]   - Still a bear market, right?
[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.260]   But it makes sense that people wanna figure out,
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.820]   especially getting close to retirement,
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.700]   you know, how to protect their capital a little bit.
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:01.540]   - Right.
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:02.780]   - Let's do another one. - Smart.
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.820]   Okay, up next we have a question from Charlie.
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.060]   I live in Nashville, Tennessee
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.860]   and run a successful financial advisory practice here.
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.540]   When I look at my client base, the average age is 61.
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:16.160]   I'm 39 and I'm wondering what suggestions you would have
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.100]   for marketing my services to younger clients,
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.420]   as I don't have that many.
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.940]   I would be perfectly fine to accept smaller accounts,
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.780]   but I don't love pitching close friends and family.
[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.320]   What methods besides this would you recommend?
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.160]   - Good question.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.000]   You don't have to brag.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.300]   Successful financial advisory.
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.140]   Good job.
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:31.960]   - Yeah, good job.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.800]   - Let's bring in the person I know
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.740]   who knows more about financial advisory business
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.220]   than anyone I know.
[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.060]   Josh Brown.
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.580]   - Hey, Josh. - Hey, Josh.
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.580]   - Hi, everybody. - All right.
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:42.420]   All right, this is a younger person.
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.240]   - Thanks for having me on the show.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.540]   Wait, can I do, I have bunk bed material.
[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.780]   - Okay, yeah, let's hear it. - So I can't believe,
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.340]   I'm sorry, I can't believe like the obvious,
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.400]   neither one of you,
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.600]   we were talking about the merits of bunk beds.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.300]   So much room for activities.
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.260]   I don't know.
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.900]   No stepbrothers fans here?
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:02.380]   I thought that was a layup.
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.220]   I was muted.
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.140]   I was trying to get in.
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.220]   - It's been too long since I've seen that.
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.420]   - All right, fine.
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:09.520]   - All right, so you have a young person
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.780]   wants to bring in younger clients.
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.420]   The funny thing is usually young clients
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.820]   have a hard time working with older clients, right?
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.820]   Because an older client sometimes doesn't wanna work
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:18.660]   with someone who's younger.
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.980]   So how do you figure out a way to break through
[00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.220]   and sort of change the sales cycle here?
[00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.920]   - This is not gonna be a satisfying answer.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.220]   The truth is that you really can't
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.980]   because you wanna work with young people,
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.220]   but young people are not looking for retirement solutions.
[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.280]   And I think as an advisor,
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.940]   your sweet spot for financial planning work
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.380]   really doesn't come until like after 35.
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:48.940]   And even then, it's mostly like how many kids do you have?
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:49.940]   Do you have life insurance?
[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.720]   Like that's the extent of the hardcore financial planning
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.780]   that someone would need.
[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.580]   What people need prior to that age
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.700]   is asset allocation really.
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.100]   They just need like an easy, systematic way
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:06.780]   to continuously put money aside that they're not spending.
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.540]   Like they don't really need
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.260]   a lot of financial planning work.
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:16.040]   So it's gonna be really tough to attract clients
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.780]   in a demographic that are like way before
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:20.320]   they actually need your help.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.920]   So a couple of things I would consider.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.120]   The first is like just accept the fact
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.080]   that if you're gonna do content marketing
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.800]   to that demographic,
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.440]   you have to count on there being a really long tail.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:38.640]   And like a lot of these people will come to you way later
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.360]   than when you're actually reaching them for the first time.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.880]   So not only do you have to reach them
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.320]   and get in front of them somehow and get their attention,
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.640]   you have to like hold their attention.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:52.640]   So you can do that with email, newsletter type of thing
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.400]   or have them follow you on social media.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.320]   And then you just have to like make that mental investment.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.840]   Like, all right, I'm getting to young people
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.560]   through the platforms they like,
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.160]   whether it's TikTok or Instagram or LinkedIn.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.200]   And then like I can't make them all of a sudden
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.320]   wanna hire a financial advisor.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.280]   Like one day something's gonna happen in their life
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.620]   where they need one.
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.760]   Maybe they got married, maybe they got divorced,
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.920]   maybe they are about to launch a company
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.520]   and leave a steady income behind.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.280]   Maybe they started a company and they're about to sell it.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.960]   Maybe they just got a huge raise.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.600]   Maybe a father or a mother or a grandfather
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.700]   or a grandmother passed away and left an inheritance.
[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:37.560]   That's the moment that somebody in their 30s says,
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.900]   "I need a professional now to help me."
[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.160]   You can't manufacture that.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.280]   You just have to be front of mind
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.600]   so that when that moment happens
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.840]   to the people who are aware of you,
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.720]   you're the person that they wanna call.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.200]   - Well, I think the way to do that
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.520]   is probably to find a niche.
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.800]   So you wanna be the person that I help young people
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.800]   invest their inheritance, right?
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.160]   Or I help people who, young people who are doctors.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.040]   Or I think you have to find some sort of,
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.360]   we have people who, so like Doug Bonaparte,
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.940]   who is a friend of the show,
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.080]   he works with high earning millennials
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.380]   who are going to have, who don't have a lot
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.320]   of financial assets now but are going to.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.620]   I think you have to have some sort of way
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.920]   to specialize in a certain group of people
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.580]   if you want them to seek you out.
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:19.420]   It can't just be general financial planning.
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.720]   - The millennials are, right, the millennials are 40 now.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.840]   - Right, yeah, I just turned 41.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.240]   I'm the oldest millennial in the world, right?
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.640]   - It's nice to meet you, I'm the youngest,
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.380]   I'm the youngest Gen X in the world.
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:33.320]   Very nice to meet you. - State planning,
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.240]   and yeah, I don't know.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.840]   - Is there an advisor focusing on Instagram
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.320]   and TikTok influencers?
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.680]   - Listen, I'm just like,
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.480]   this is something that I know really well.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:46.160]   I'm just gonna tell you, the strategy has to be,
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.160]   I'm going to reach these people,
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.840]   I'm going to become relevant to these people,
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:55.840]   and I'm going to be patient as catalysts
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.240]   arise in their lives.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.040]   And it'll happen on a different schedule
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.920]   for whatever fan base that you manage to build
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.780]   or whatever influence you manage to have.
[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.880]   It's like, you're gonna sit back
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.280]   and no one's gonna need you, no one's gonna need you.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.120]   I'm reaching out, I'm doing this, I'm doing that,
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.740]   I'm taking lunches, I'm speaking at events.
[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.420]   And then it'll be a trickle at first.
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.620]   Somebody will say, "Hey, you and I had lunch
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.700]   "a few years ago and I wasn't a good fit at the time,
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.640]   "but here's my situation today."
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.780]   I mean, that is like a long-term investment.
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.720]   If you really want to reach a younger clientele,
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.100]   that's a long-term investment
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.660]   that you're gonna have to make in somehow,
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.980]   A, getting their attention for the first time,
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:42.800]   and B, maintaining it for all of that period of time
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.040]   before they actually need your help.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.460]   When I first started getting into the content game,
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.940]   that's the one thing I under-appreciated
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.120]   is the fact that I assumed,
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.600]   okay, I'm gonna join Riddle 12,
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.320]   I'm gonna work with Josh and Barry and Michael,
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.700]   and everyone who's reading my stuff
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:55.860]   is gonna come on day one
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.900]   that wants to work with a financial planner.
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:58.780]   But it was the opposite.
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.040]   It's like a long burn.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.760]   People don't come just because, hey, they know you.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.300]   They come because they have something happen in their life
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.840]   that makes them need to get financial advice.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.900]   And that's the thing I didn't appreciate.
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.860]   - Right, and you can't manufacture that moment.
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.500]   Like, you're not gonna write the blog post
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.440]   or do the podcast appearance or whatever
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.000]   where people are like, that's the guy.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.520]   Like, that's not how it works.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:26.220]   What ends up happening is real-life events occur
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.500]   that prompt somebody to say,
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.440]   okay, I now need a professional.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.840]   Or I have somebody managing my money,
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.840]   but I don't think they're up to the challenge
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.060]   of what is currently going on for me.
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:43.200]   Like, that's the catalyst that you can't bring about.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.600]   You just have to be there.
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.880]   So it's not a, you know, I wish I could say,
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.400]   go do X, Y, and Z, and all of a sudden,
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.400]   all these people in their 30s are gonna start calling you.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.360]   It's just not how it works.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.480]   - Yeah, it's gonna take some time.
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.560]   All right, Duncan, next one.
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:01.520]   - Okay, up next, we have a question from John.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.400]   Four years ago, I invested in a stock
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.600]   that has since increased more than 10 times.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.860]   All things considered, it has held up relatively well
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.480]   during the market downturn.
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.520]   I believe even more strongly in this company
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.000]   than I did four years ago, but the unrealized gains
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.360]   would be enough to pay off my wife's $200,000
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.780]   in medical school debt.
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.400]   When her student loan repayments resume,
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.480]   the interest will be around 8%.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.560]   Do I stay true to my convictions and hold the stock
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.720]   and try to refinance my wife's student loan debt
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.080]   at a lower rate while we still can,
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.640]   or do I sell the stock and pay off the loans?
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.480]   I'm early 30s and have a relatively high risk appetite,
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.960]   but I hate debt and paying high interest rates.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.560]   What are your thoughts?
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.560]   - We gotta know the stock here.
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.760]   I can't believe he didn't tell us the stock.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:40.600]   - I know, I know.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.600]   It's Tesla. - It's in the box.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.200]   - It's Tesla.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.120]   There's a very small list of stocks
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:50.000]   that are up 10X in that period of time.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   I mean, it's not a big list.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.340]   It's like Chipotle, Tesla, Netflix, maybe.
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:59.520]   - Netflix has not held up relatively well, but.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.520]   - Yeah, but it's still up, like, it's still up huge.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.840]   - So we got the student loan stuff yesterday.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.080]   He has a few more months to make this decision
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.360]   'cause we have the moratorium extended
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.780]   'til the end of the year.
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.920]   Assuming you're not over the income threshold,
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.320]   you're getting $10,000 knocked off that 200K.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.980]   That's not gonna help a whole lot.
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.900]   My first thing here is I think that 8% on a loan
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.300]   is ridiculous for student loans.
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.380]   I don't wanna get into the whole student loan thing here,
[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:26.380]   but my whole idea was just cancel the debt
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.480]   or cancel the interest.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.160]   Don't charge anyone interest.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.420]   Make 'em pay their principal back.
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.660]   But I calculated this.
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.280]   If you paid this off over 10 years, 200K,
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.400]   that's at 8%, that's $90,000 in interest costs alone.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.880]   So this is a ton of money,
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.520]   and I'm a huge believer in regret minimization,
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.160]   and I just don't know that you're going to regret
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.280]   paying off this debt and being free and clear of it
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.480]   even if the stock continues to go up.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.320]   - Well, wait a minute,
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.160]   but let's define continues to go up.
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.480]   What are the chances, probabilistically,
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.540]   based on everything we know about stock market history,
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.600]   that a stock that's just gone up 10X
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.960]   in a relatively compressed period of time
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.360]   can go up another 10X?
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.720]   So could the stock double from here?
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.200]   Totally, and you'll be really upset.
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.000]   But is it gonna do another 10X?
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.440]   It's definitely not.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:20.340]   So the mental calculus has to change here.
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:23.120]   - 8% is a very high hurdle rate, too.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.080]   - Yeah. - That's right.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:24.900]   It's not right.
[00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:25.740]   It's not the risk-free rate.
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:29.320]   It's not a 3% two-year treasury.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.900]   - So what's the next 10X they should move to, you think?
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.720]   - Right, that's what you wanna do, actually.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.160]   You wanna switch into the next stock that's gonna 10X.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.560]   - No, but just probabilistically,
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:43.000]   how many companies have 10X and then 10X'd again?
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.360]   It's not a big number.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.300]   It's probably a much higher number
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.920]   of companies that have 10X'd, matured,
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.040]   and maybe went on to do okay or poorly,
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:57.840]   but the same opportunity does not currently exist
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.640]   as the opportunity that you've already had.
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.820]   So congratulations, you're one of the few,
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.640]   the proud, the many. - You've won.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.080]   - Now do something with it. - Let's see if it's held up.
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:07.920]   - And the other thing is,
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.440]   you hear from a lot of doctors who say,
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.120]   I have all this debt around me.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.160]   It's like I'm wearing a weight around my,
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.520]   it's just, it consumes me.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.560]   And then I go to residency
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:17.720]   and I don't make very much money.
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.880]   And so the reason a lot of doctors
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:19.920]   don't have as much money as you think
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.040]   is because they have this ball and chain
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.240]   just stuck to their leg for years and years.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.960]   You can totally get rid of that
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.920]   and have that free and clear.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.120]   I can't imagine regretting that decision.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.080]   - Right.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.340]   - Last thing, I get you're in love with the stock
[00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.360]   and you're even more bullish on it now.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.280]   Everybody is even more bullish on the thing
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.920]   that just made them a ton of money.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.120]   - Of course.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.880]   - Everybody is because there's something called the,
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.200]   is it the, I got company.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.840]   There's something called the--
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:50.680]   - Get this beer.
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.920]   - Get the fuck out of here.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.120]   - There's something called the endowment effect
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.280]   where, I forget the full story,
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:01.280]   but a professor gave coffee mugs to half the class
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.360]   and then the other half the class didn't have coffee mugs.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.080]   And then there was, they asked the people that had the mug,
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.760]   how much would you sell it for?
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.800]   And the people that didn't have the mug
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.800]   were asked how much would you bid for the mug?
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.320]   And there was a big gap between what the person
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.320]   who had it was willing to sell it for
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.360]   versus what the people who wanted to buy it
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.800]   were willing to buy it for.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.600]   And I think they call that the endowment fund.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.720]   It's like, all right, I already have this thing.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.520]   Therefore, I think it's a lot more valuable
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.680]   than I otherwise would think if I didn't have it.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.440]   I don't know how fully that applies here,
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.400]   but like, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.200]   This kid just totally distracted me.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.000]   (laughing)
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.240]   I'm gonna let him have it later.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.880]   - If you're really that worried
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.040]   about another 10 bagger from here,
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.480]   take all of your gains off the table
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.400]   and leave the cost basis and then let it run again.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.520]   And then you pay off the majority of that loan.
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.160]   - Yes, why does it have to be all or nothing?
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.120]   - Yeah, do some of it.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:55.960]   Pay off the majority of this loan.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.160]   - Because we're a polarized society.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.440]   Everything has to be one way or the other, right?
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.720]   - It doesn't have to be all or nothing.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.640]   Yeah, but pay off a decent amount.
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.320]   All right, Duncan, last question.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:09.480]   - Okay, last but not least is a question from David.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.360]   I'm 22 years old and got my first real job at a large bank.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.640]   In setting up my 401(k),
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.760]   I was given a bunch of options to choose from.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.600]   Among the options were target date funds,
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.720]   various equity and bond funds, mutual funds, the works.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.920]   As a financial advisor, I felt the impetus
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:26.440]   to allocate some percentage to bond funds
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.520]   to have some fixed income exposure.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.720]   But then I thought, why would I, a 22-year-old
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.280]   with potentially 40-plus year time horizon,
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.600]   buy bonds right now?
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.640]   Even with rising rates, it doesn't seem to make sense
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.840]   for me to allocate to something
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.640]   that's going to get eaten by inflation
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.960]   and deprive me of capital appreciation.
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.440]   I ended up allocating 100% to equity funds.
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.480]   What are your thoughts on this?
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.120]   I kind of like they already did it,
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.000]   and now they're asking your thoughts on it.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:49.840]   - Yeah, do you want to--
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:50.880]   - Make me feel better about it.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.800]   - Yeah.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.040]   - I mean, young people for their retirement portfolios
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.480]   probably should have 100% in equities.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.480]   Unless you need an emotional hedge
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.320]   or an emotional crutch from bonds or cash or something.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:04.480]   In that 401(k), I mean, I guess a target date fund
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.080]   probably has five to 10% in bonds.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.120]   But I think just because you're a financial advisor,
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.120]   maybe you recommend bonds to some of your clients.
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.800]   As a 22-year-old, risk means different things
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.680]   to different people.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.000]   And people who are older and retired
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.240]   probably need some bonds for either an emotional hedge
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.960]   or just to help out the volatility
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.440]   of their retirement portfolio
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.000]   when things get hairy in the stock market.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.440]   But if you're young, textbook says 100%,
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.480]   and I think as long as you can handle it, stomach it,
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.520]   you have to do it.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.680]   - This gets back to what we were talking about
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.880]   with the financial advisor
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.740]   who wants to reach more young people.
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:45.680]   What are you going to tell a 22-year-old
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.880]   about asset allocation?
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.960]   It should be, you're 22,
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.920]   focus on getting a girlfriend or a boyfriend.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.760]   Like that's not, don't, your asset allocation
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.680]   should be the furthest thing from your mind.
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:03.040]   Like be in the gym, go to clubs, experience life,
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.880]   go to Ibiza, like do those things.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.080]   Your asset allocation doesn't matter.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.440]   And pray to God the stock market falls.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.280]   - Yes, you should hope it falls.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.040]   - 22, what's the difference?
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.840]   Listen, we had a client, we had a client,
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.840]   it was a long time ago, it was like 2011, 2012,
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.760]   very smart kid, worked in finance.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.400]   I think he worked, he was like one of the last employees
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.680]   of Lehman Brothers, if you could believe that.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.720]   So like there was like a section within Lehman Brothers
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.840]   that was doing electricity trading
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.000]   and they couldn't shut that down during bankruptcy,
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.440]   they had to keep it going
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.420]   'cause they were like counterparties
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:39.560]   with people that had long-term contracts on electricity.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.160]   I think he was like one of the last 50 people
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.760]   to work at Lehman Brothers.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.820]   And he was making a lot of money
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:45.960]   and he had tons of companies
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.040]   that were ready to hire him immediately
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.120]   as soon as he was done, like he would be fine.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.320]   And I remember like in 2011
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.140]   when like the European debt crisis
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.360]   was causing huge volatility in the stock market,
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:02.360]   he's like, "I wanna take 20% and go to bonds."
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.680]   I'm telling you, this kid was like 25 years old or something.
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:09.080]   He's like, "I wanna take a big chunk of my portfolio,
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.520]   "I can't take this anymore, I'm gonna go to bonds."
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.840]   I'm like, "Listen to me, here's what you're gonna do.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.060]   "I'm gonna hang up the phone with you,
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:17.580]   "take a deep breath, we're gonna talk tomorrow.
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.300]   "And just like go to sleep tonight, right?"
[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:24.520]   Like the VIX was 60, it was just an out of control period.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.600]   I'm like, "We're gonna talk tomorrow,
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.320]   "but here I'm telling you sneak preview,
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.200]   "here's what I'm gonna tell you tomorrow.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.520]   "Not only am I not gonna do that,
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.000]   "I want you to think about where the rest of your money is
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.520]   "that you could send me right now.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.580]   "I'm gonna buy even more stocks for you."
[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:39.180]   And that's if I'm your advisor,
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.440]   you're paying me for my advice.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.680]   When you see a VIX at 50,
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:46.160]   I don't want you to think about, should I go to cash now?
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.480]   I want you to think about,
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.120]   how can I get Josh even more money
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.720]   to put into, and this is an IRA.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.360]   Like you can't have it anyway.
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.400]   - You can't touch it, right.
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.040]   - What the hell are we talking about?
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.600]   You're gonna use this money in 40 years.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.720]   I want you to go to sleep tonight
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.880]   thinking about how you can get me
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.760]   even more money to put to work.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.620]   And I don't know if that's gonna look smart
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:09.320]   for six months or for six years,
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.160]   but what's the difference?
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.080]   Don't tell me you wanna swing the bond.
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:14.760]   What are you gonna do with the bonds?
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.700]   Besides lose money in real terms.
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.740]   - I probably didn't start saving my 401k for real
[00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:21.200]   until 2006, 2007.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.000]   And I had a colleague in 2008 who said,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.240]   I'm putting everything into money markets
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.140]   because the financial system is blowing up.
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.320]   I think you should put all of your 401k contributions
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.160]   into money markets.
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.480]   And I'm thinking to myself,
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.680]   even though I didn't know as much back then,
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:33.960]   I'm never gonna have the opportunity
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.720]   to buy at prices this low again in my life.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.960]   These are gonna be the lowest prices I will ever see.
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.120]   The other thing for young people,
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.880]   if you, I've calculated this
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.100]   using some conservative estimates before.
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:44.440]   If you figure out how much money
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.720]   you put into your retirement accounts
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.920]   versus how much you're getting kicked out
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:51.000]   by investment gains, it's not until like age 45 or 50
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.060]   that the gains become a bigger part of the portfolio
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:53.900]   than the amount you put in.
[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:54.920]   - It starts to matter.
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:58.440]   - Yeah, so the stuff you, the savings you put in
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.940]   matters way more than your investments.
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:02.480]   And so you have to just keep putting money in,
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.320]   putting money in.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.400]   And you said, if you're a young person,
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.480]   you should get on your hands and knees
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.680]   and pray for lower prices
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.240]   because that's a good thing for you.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.860]   You're gonna have seven or eight bear markets
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.000]   in your career that you're gonna have
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.980]   to keep investing through.
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.800]   - My 401k is 100% stocks.
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:16.640]   - Me too.
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.120]   - There's no cash and there's no bonds.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.820]   It's the same strategies we own for clients,
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:25.160]   but I pulled out the fixed income because I'm 45
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.520]   and I can't touch it for 20 years.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.680]   So in 10 years, it might be a different allocation.
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.580]   But if I have a 20 year time horizon,
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:35.280]   what good is that current income doing for me?
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.120]   I don't want it.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.560]   And I'm still adding.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.280]   I'm still investing into the 401k.
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.480]   So like, I don't root for the market to go down,
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.360]   but when it does, the last thing I'm thinking is,
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.280]   all right, let me now go to bonds.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.520]   I'm thinking, all right, cool.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.020]   I'm making more contributions for the balance this year.
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:55.080]   See, a lot of this, Ben, and you know this,
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.160]   but the audience might not.
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:00.720]   The architecture of just like the financial media
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.320]   and the wealth management businesses
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.440]   is still so geared toward boomers
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:10.080]   because that's the horse that brought them here.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.880]   Like the boomer audience, it's different for them.
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.760]   But like when you're on financial television,
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:18.720]   it's like, oh, the market's down, that's terrible.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.640]   Terrible for who?
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.680]   Terrible for the 50% of the audience that's in retirement,
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.560]   but for the other 50% of the audience
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:30.400]   that's making ongoing retirement account contributions,
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.660]   it's great.
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:35.720]   But it's hard to conceptualize
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:39.200]   that everyone in the audience has different circumstances.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.820]   - And risk means different things to different people.
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.760]   The risk of a bear market is totally different
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.160]   for someone who's 65 versus someone who's 25.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.960]   It's completely different. - Obviously, right.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:50.400]   So to the 22-year-old, no bonds.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.480]   - Right. - No bonds.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.640]   You might be mad at me in six months for saying that,
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.560]   but you're gonna be very happy with me in 10 years
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.120]   and you're 22.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.720]   What are you even thinking about this for?
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.960]   - In 50 years, you're gonna be really happy.
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.760]   - Don't you TikTok audience, dude.
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.520]   That's what you need to be doing right now.
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.680]   - Giancarlo in the chat has a funny comment.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.280]   They say, "I have more gold bond than actual bonds."
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.360]   (laughing)
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.560]   - Big surprise, the episode I'm on went over time.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:16.480]   Look at that.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.320]   - All right. - Can't believe it.
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.480]   - Thanks to Josh for joining us.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.620]   We appreciate it.

[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:26.320]   Thanks to Duncan.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.040]   Duncan, is that a soccer jersey today?
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.640]   - It is, I got this in Glasgow.
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.600]   It's a Glasgow Celtic jersey.
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:33.440]   - Oh, nice.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.360]   I'm still waiting for my present from your honeymoon.
