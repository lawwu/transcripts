[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   All right, everybody, welcome to the 54th Annual World Economic Forum here in Davos.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.480]   You guys didn't know this, but as elites ourselves, we were invited to kick off the festivities.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.120]   Surplus elites.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.080]   Yeah. You know, the all-in podcast, very popular. And so they wanted us to come and represent the
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.480]   pod and our audience there. And it's been amazing. If you haven't seen some of the great musical
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.200]   performances this year, I mean, they're so notable. Let's just start off here. I mean,
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.640]   guys, we were here for this live.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.840]   Soak it in. I mean, on the replay.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.320]   There's the air flute.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:46.960]   Wait, wait, there's a great moment where she really starts vibing. Wait for the head shake.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.360]   The eyebrows are great, but the head shake comes in at about there.
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.760]   There it is.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.320]   I like your muumuu. I like your muumuu.
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.200]   Have you ever played the air flute or just the skin flute?
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.320]   Just the skin flute.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:08.320]   But guys, guys, this isn't it. There were other, there was a witch doctor or something. I'm not
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.120]   sure exactly what's going on here. I'm going to just apologize in advance for mocking this.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.800]   Or for Sax mocking it, I should say.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:24.400]   This was incredible. I don't know exactly what's going on here with the blowing of the hair.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.880]   But it's kind of like you are fluffing.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.520]   We've come a long way from COVID, that's for sure.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.400]   So they're blowing the COVID on each person's forehead here to spread the COVID.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.880]   They've all taken the mRNA vaccine. But you know, we each have a speaking gig. Each of us is
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.240]   speaking. And so I thought to kick us off here, gentlemen, instead of us just telling everybody
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.400]   our schedule, I would sing our schedule. And so let me just grab a, let me see if I got my guitar
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.000]   here. Hold on. Let me just grab it here. Oh, here it is. Okay. Hold on. It's happened to have the
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.600]   guitar. Is that an air guitar or a real guitar? Oh, no, it's a real guitar. It's actually a real
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.720]   guitar here. So, but I thought, you know, everybody is really excited about each of our speaking gigs.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.080]   So I thought we would just kick it off here. Let me just see if it's in tune.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.040]   You guys hear that? Oh, okay. All right. What was that? I think we got it.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.360]   Kumbaya, my lord, Kumbaya.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:33.280]   Sax is interviewing Putin, my lord, Kumbaya. In the dictator lounge at noon, Kumbaya.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:42.960]   Conquering Europe, Kumbaya. And now I'm gonna, there's a little audience participation in here,
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.640]   besties. I need you each to sing with me. Okay. It's, we're gonna start here. It's gonna be just
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.960]   listen one time and then you're gonna repeat. Okay, here we go.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:03:01.920]   Oh, Davos, Kumbaya. So just Oh, Davos, Kumbaya. Ready? Three, two.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.440]   Okay, very good. Very good. Okay. Now go to the next verse here.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:27.920]   Hosting Steve Bannon at 1pm, Kumbaya. Friedbergs at 2pm, Kumbaya.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:39.200]   Billionaire bunker panel, Kumbaya. Teal just bought one, Kumbaya.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:50.960]   Hunter Biden after party at 1am. Eight balls and escorts for everyone brought to you by Barisima.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:01.200]   And now you all sing. Oh, Davos, Kumbaya.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:08.880]   Wow. Fabulous. You really are the world's greatest moderator.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.680]   Let your winners ride.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.560]   Rain Man David Saks.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.960]   And it said, we open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.760]   Love you.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:32.640]   All right, everybody. Yes, the World Economic Forum is wrapping up in Davos. If you don't know
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.760]   what the WF is, I'll just give you the brief overview. 3000 people, five days, tons of parties
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.280]   happens in Davos, Switzerland. It's run by a foundation. They call these non government
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.120]   organizations NGOs. I can think of it kind of like the TED conference topic this year was rebuilding
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.600]   trust. It's politicians, business leaders, economists, journalists, all the elites,
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.680]   the mission statement of the WF improving the state of the world by engaging business,
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.680]   political, academic and other leaders of society to shape global regional and industry agendas.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.760]   It's money printing machine. I'll give you a funny backstory later if you care to know,
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.200]   but basically, they try to shake it down for about 40 grand a year to go to this thing.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:18.400]   Tons of notable moments that we can get to on the docket here. Free break any highlights for you
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.080]   watching this, you know, get mocked on social media this year. It's been a slow unraveling
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:31.120]   from this being something that people used to flex about going to Davos. Now people are literally
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.680]   apologizing on social media, Twitter, etc. explaining why they're going because they're
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.360]   kind of feeling shame and going to this event. So, what are your thoughts on the sort of whole
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.280]   flipping of this from being a flex to requiring an apology in advance?
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:55.280]   You guys know, Andrew Ross Sorkin, the journalist for CNBC, I think he posted on Twitter, you know,
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.640]   I know, I know, forgive me, I got to go to Davos. It's almost like, embarrassing now
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:07.920]   that you are associating yourself with the elite cabal in the Swiss Alps, during a time of rising
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.800]   global populism and all the criticism that's been rained down on Davos in the last couple of years.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:20.960]   And then Davos is trying to adapt by trying to be more cool and appeal to the populist notions
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:28.080]   that have criticized them. Thus, the flute playing, thus the shamanism, you know, and thus,
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.720]   I think a lot of what Javier Millet has called general economic support for what he defines as
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.320]   collectivism, which I'd love to talk about, but why don't we just say that? So, I think, yeah,
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.600]   there's generally been like a response from the community that attends Davos. But there's a lot
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.960]   of conflict here with the fact that folks are flying in on private jets and telling everyone
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.160]   to stop producing carbon. The fact that they're all dining and spending lots of money and telling
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.920]   everyone that we should move to more towards socialist conditions and higher taxation. It's
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.360]   all a lot of irony wound up in this whole thing. It's almost like a, like a, like a Simpsons show.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.400]   It's what it's become.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.880]   Well, and the theme rebuilding trust is kind of
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:12.560]   insulting at its face, at least to me, like, we don't trust you. You don't need to rebuild trust
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.760]   with us. We're not going to trust you. There's no way for you to do that, especially after what
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:22.720]   happened with COVID. Sax, did you have any sort of reaction to this year's Davos and just how
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:28.000]   people are reacting to it? You heard Freyberg sort of thoughts on it.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.520]   Well, Davos has become a parody of itself. And that's why you saw these clips go viral of these
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:40.720]   ridiculous antics of the priestess doing, I don't know what she was doing. But the only two sets of
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:46.720]   remarks that actually were taken seriously on their own terms was the speech by Millet from
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:54.240]   Argentina, and then also comments by Jamie Dimon. And the reason why they went viral is because
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:00.480]   they were actually saying sensible things that contradicted the sort of established wisdom or
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:07.200]   consensus at Davos. I mean, they were effectively subtweeting the other elites at Davos. I mean,
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.640]   Millet gets up there, and I think he was introduced by Klaus Schwab, and he immediately starts
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:20.240]   denouncing collectivist experiments and says that the West is in danger because its elites have been
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:26.000]   co-opted by a vision of the world, which leads inexorably to socialism and thereby to poverty.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.920]   So Millet basically says this right in front of Klaus Schwab. I mean, he's describing
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.480]   the people at Davos. That's why that took off and went viral.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.920]   It was incredible. I mean, yeah.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.240]   In a similar way...
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.360]   And he flew their commercial.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:48.400]   I didn't know that. Yeah, kudos to him. Jamie Dimon gave this interview, I think it was on CNBC,
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.440]   where he basically went full Chamath. He basically admitted that Trump had been right
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:59.520]   and that a lot of the criticism of Trump and all the derogatory comments for years
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:07.840]   were basically just lazy. And he said that Trump was largely right on NATO, on immigration,
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.240]   on tax reform. He grew the economy well.
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.360]   Immigration.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.000]   Immigration. He was mostly right on China, he said.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:20.080]   Dimon said he didn't always like how Trump said things or talked about people, but he said his
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:26.880]   policies were largely sound and only look better in time since we've abandoned them. And he's
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.600]   basically saying that, "Look at where we are right now." And he questioned the kind of everything is
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:36.720]   hunky-dory narrative that the Biden campaign is pushing out. So he really went off script there.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.880]   And like I said, I think Chamath said it first here on this pod three months ago,
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:47.840]   and now Jamie Dimon is accepting that. So that was a huge subtweet, you could say, of all the
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:54.000]   elites at Davos and the accepted wisdom and the narrative that they're all pushing out.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.920]   So that was the other big interview that went viral. And I think that's really saying something,
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:09.680]   that the elites now have parodied themselves to the point where Davos has become a joke,
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:17.600]   and the only talks or remarks out of Davos that people pay attention to are the ones talking sense
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.400]   to the people at Davos because they're not listening.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.560]   Chamath, your thoughts?
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.040]   Look, everything has a season. And I think that when
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:35.440]   there was a much more singular hierarchy of status, Davos played a very important role
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.880]   to signal to other people that you had made it. But these things come and go. And I think that
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:50.240]   this is sort of in the back half of its usefulness and half-life. What is it probably more than
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:56.400]   anything else now? A glorified enterprise software sales conference, where the reason to go to these
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:02.320]   conferences for a lot of these companies, I suspect, is that it allows you to close very big
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:07.520]   deals, multi-million dollar licenses of this, that, and the other thing, where you can get the
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.640]   leaders of that counterparty across the table from you and hammer out a deal. And I think you pay
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:18.160]   40 grand a ticket for the right to get everybody together to do that. So I think they want to
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.960]   pretend that it's a lot more than what it is. And I think what it is, is that. And I think whenever
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:29.600]   you have the ability to convene people to close business, that's valuable. Beyond that, I think
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.320]   it's sort of in the eye of the beholder. And it used to be that the beholder thought that this
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:41.120]   was important. And now I think we realize it's much of nothing. It's shame in and air flutes and
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.600]   all kinds of stupidity, which is why people have the courage to go and mock it. And I think that
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:52.000]   Malay's comments and Jamie Dimon's comments exemplify that. The only other thing I would
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.880]   say is that I had heard although I haven't seen it, so I don't know, is that Alex Karp apparently
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:03.840]   did a very thoughtful speech about anti semitism. And it is also, which is also very countercultural
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:09.760]   to the established logic that the the surplus elites at Davos want to believe, which is the
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:15.360]   anti Israel pro Palestine line. I haven't heard of those. I don't know. Yeah, how impactful that
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:20.400]   was. But those are the three things that I that I've just seen on Twitter, just kind of speech,
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:25.600]   I think is the one that everybody is keying on. And, and correctly. So, you know, obviously,
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:32.240]   he's the he's the new president of Argentina. And this speech was amazing. People might not,
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:39.040]   people might not also know that he was an economics teacher. And so this talk about
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.920]   collectivism leading to suffering and regulatory capture and bloat, which we'll talk a little bit
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:49.920]   about when we talk about Boeing today, was incredibly powerful. It's super basic, you know,
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:54.400]   listen, free markets work, there are people opting into either side of it, he went over essentially
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:13:00.240]   without saying it, the rule of 72. And like 200 years of GDP growth, and how GDP growth under
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:07.120]   capitalism rises everybody up, and then collectivism, aka socialism is a bit of a disaster.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:13.280]   But it's well worth watching it, there was a really cool thing that a company called Hagen
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:19.280]   did he y g n, with their AI tool, they just immediately took his speech, put it in his own
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:25.840]   words, and published it and translated it as if he was speaking English, because he was he was
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:32.240]   speaking in his native tongue. So really worth checking it out. And yeah, it was super notable.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:37.040]   It's pretty basic. But I think it's everybody wants to hear this right now, which is,
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.560]   if you're picking collectivism and socialism and redistribution of wealth,
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:47.360]   Argentina has like a really good history of watching this fail. And now they're in the
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:53.280]   process of dismantling say something else before free bird says something here, which I think is
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:57.600]   going to be very thoughtful. Jason, the other reason why Argentina is a really good example to
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:07.920]   use is that what does Davos represent at a different level? Well, what it is, is old Europe
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:13.360]   getting together in a way that allows them to continue to coalesce power. And what's interesting
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:18.240]   is if you had presented the case of any other country, trying collectivism and failing,
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:23.840]   it wouldn't get nearly the same attention as Argentina. And the reason is that Argentina
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:29.120]   has so many ethnic Europeans. And I think that's another reason which is like, when you present
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:33.520]   people that are telling you it didn't work that, frankly, look like you speak the same language as
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:39.040]   you. I think it actually goes further in making the point than if you found somebody in South
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.840]   Asia or Africa that said the same thing to these folks, which they have, which they've not listened
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:48.960]   to. And so this is why I think Malay is so interesting and important, because he looks
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:54.480]   the part of a Western leader. And I think that that, unfortunately, is what it's going to take
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.240]   for some of these folks to listen. Yeah, and everyone's acutely aware. I mean, I'll say three
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.600]   things on this one is just talking to your point, you're not about the history of Argentina and how
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:07.360]   it relates to this position that Malay holds and being able to speak credibly to this. Second is
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.960]   what he said, which I think is really important. And third is how it relates to the United States.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.200]   But this was clearly to my, from my view, one of the most important media events of the year.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.960]   I do think that anyone that's listening to us right now should go watch it and go listen to
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:24.560]   the entirety of the speech. It is so important. I hope everyone really takes in what he said.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.800]   Just briefly on Argentina in the mid 19th century, Argentina was a colonial
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:35.600]   nation, very agricultural, but a lot of free market, pioneerism going on,
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:42.640]   businesses were built, and an economy flourished in Argentina. This photo I put up here is from
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:49.280]   1913. Buenos Aires, which at the time was called Paris of the West. I was about to say it looks
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.960]   like Paris, right? The architecture, everything's beautiful. And stunning. But here's here's some
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:58.400]   statistics. A lot of people don't know, Argentina at this time was wealthier than France or Germany,
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:05.280]   twice as wealthy as Spain, and had one of the top 10 highest GDP per capita of any nation on earth
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:13.280]   in 1913. And so it was this flourishing, vibrant economy with a lot of innovation, a lot of arts,
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:20.560]   a lot of building, a lot of employment, a lot of immigration. And then as the series of military
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:27.280]   coups began, I don't know if you guys are aware, but there was a military coup in 1930 1943 1955
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:35.360]   1962 1966 1976. And in every one of these cases, the essence of the coup was one of relativism,
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:39.520]   which is some people have benefited more than others. As a result, we need to change the way
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:44.080]   that the government and the social structure is functioning. And it has to be taken by force.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:50.160]   And I think this is the big story of Argentina that says so much more than any other nation
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:56.480]   of the past century, century and a half, which is that these cycles happen based on not
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:02.000]   absolutism, but on relativism. And I'll just give you what I mean by that. Millie made this point,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.960]   which is so important. From the year 1800 to the year 2020. In the year 1800, we saw 95% of the
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:17.200]   world's population in extreme poverty by 2020. It was less than 5%. And this was driven by free
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:23.360]   market capitalism democracies that allowed people individuals to pursue their own self interest and
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:28.800]   as a result, deliver products into a marketplace that people wanted and were willing to pay for.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:34.160]   And that incentive that market based system allowed the entire world to move forward.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:39.040]   The relativism problem is that some people move forward faster than others. And that causes this
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:43.040]   great cycle of what some people might call envy or jealousy. And Malay said it best,
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:48.240]   the West is in jeopardy, which is the key statement he was trying to make in his point
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.560]   that countries are no longer defending free markets. This is a quote, private property
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:57.360]   and other institutions of libertarian libertarianism due to errors in their theoretical
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:03.600]   framework and ambition for power, opening doors to socialism and condemning us to poverty, misery
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:08.800]   and stagnation. Socialism has failed in all countries where it was attempted. And then he
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.640]   started to harp on about neoclassical economic theory and the issues with that. But I want to
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:17.360]   show you one last image, which speaks so clearly to the point that he's making, which is as these
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.360]   governments that are well intentioned, and the people that elect the governments and put them
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:26.240]   in power are well intentioned, then try to redistribute wealth by getting the governments
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:32.720]   to step in and play a market role. The market role that they play causes inflation causes
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:38.560]   degradation and economic opportunity, economic mobility and prosperity for most people. And you
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:43.040]   can see this in this chart, which we've looked at many times. But everything on the top of this
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:47.360]   chart, this is a chart that shows the 20 years of price changes of various goods and services in
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:53.520]   the United States. Everything that's gone up in price is something that the US government has a
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:59.680]   role in buying or paying for. Yeah, controlling. Yeah. And everything that's gone down in price
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:04.720]   is where there is a free market that has allowed people to access goods and services at a lower
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:08.960]   price over time as opposed to a higher price over time. And while the intention is that the
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:15.440]   government is doing good for people by making education, healthcare, and other goods and
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:20.160]   services available to them, the government stepping in and intervening in the free market
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:25.200]   causes the price to go up. And ultimately, you end up in a really negative cycle that resolves in
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:29.040]   this collectivism approach that he's talking about. And that's why I just wanted to tie back
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.120]   what he said to what's going on in the US today. And the and I've harped on this a lot, but the
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:38.400]   growing role that the federal government is playing, and the intention is good, but the impact
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:43.040]   is bad over time. And that's really, I think why it was such an important speech. He was so clear,
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.560]   it was so important for me to hear it. I'm sorry, I harped on but I just really know.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:52.080]   It's the highlight the key of his speeches, hey, good intentions can lead to a bad outcome here.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.880]   Yeah, you want everybody to have healthcare, you want everybody to have education,
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:59.040]   the government is providing it. And there's no customer and there's no market, there's no
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:04.000]   competition. And the products and services that you are referring to, they include medicine,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.920]   they include college, they include tutoring, they they don't just include and include air
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:12.640]   conditioning, they include refrigerators and televisions, smartphones, all of that. And
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.480]   picking which system and which set of problems you want to have, I guess,
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:20.480]   is what societies need to do. And free markets.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.360]   It's a weird reflexive loop, though, for governments, because these people,
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:27.280]   what he also said was, these aren't just well intentioned people. They're also a small class
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:32.320]   of elites that wanted to feel like they were better than everybody else by implementing
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:36.800]   things at work. And so there is a dark part of this as well, which is their desire for power.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.800]   And I think it's important to not gloss that over. So this wasn't just a bunch of
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.880]   bumbling do gooders that screwed things up. This was also a bunch of folks that,
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:51.360]   that irrespective of the data, had an opportunity to gain influence and power. And I think that
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:57.520]   that's that's an important thing to acknowledge, because it created a very negative reflexive loop
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:04.400]   that governments used. Meaning, if you look at freebergs charts, why did that happen? Well,
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:10.320]   part of what happened was, the administrative state became more and more powerful, they were
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:16.080]   able to pass laws, they were there to decide who the winners and losers were. That is a drug. And
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:22.320]   that drug is very addictive. And so what happened as this happened, was the laws went and reinforced
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:28.080]   those dynamics of those people being able to decide winners and losers. The thing that it has
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:32.960]   that has not happened yet, though, and we're maybe we're beginning to see it in some of these markets
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:38.400]   that the government is too involved in, is that it is bred a level of incompetence and incapability
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:46.560]   that we now have to unwind because the average everyday citizens lives are either at risk,
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:52.320]   or the services are just so expensive that it's just untenable. And I think that's where we are
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:57.520]   now. It's a great segue, I think, into this Boeing issue that we've seen, because here's an issue of
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:02.160]   regulation and safety, where you want the government and you want safe planes, and you want
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.360]   some level of regulation, but then you get regulatory capture. So maybe the government,
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:10.720]   the government has not been the supporter of the safety agenda that citizens think.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.040]   Yes.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:18.720]   Meaning when you look at what has happened in the US airline industry, there are a handful of end
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:25.760]   user providers, but those are all using OEM equipment from one of two vendors, Boeing or
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:31.840]   Airbus. So it's a duopoly, but in many ways, it's a monopoly, the way that these folks fight with
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:38.400]   respect to tariffs and imports and incentives. So the United States airline industry is a monopoly
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.880]   of one company. Now, if you look at what's happened, what they would say is, well, planes
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:50.000]   have become safer and safer and safer. Yes, but they've become safer, in some ways, in the most
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.600]   simple and obvious ways, but they've become unsafe in that you have these fleets of planes that are
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:02.800]   now behaving very unpredictably. And if you look under the hood, what happens is Boeing as an
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:07.840]   example, in like the last four years, how much money do you think they've spent on lobbyists and
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:14.000]   PACs? I'll tell you $65 million. How much have they spent just in the last year? Almost $11
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:20.720]   million. They're like the 15th most active spender in in politics in Washington. Now,
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.560]   what did they use that money for? Well, that's also documented. See, the crazy thing is this
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:29.840]   stuff happens in plain in plain sight. So they were able to water down the safety regulations.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:34.000]   What does that allow you to do? It allows you to have a situation like this unfold.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.080]   And then on the other side, the pilots unions can lobby those same politicians who are taking
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:46.880]   money from Boeing and prevent systems that would actually make these planes safer.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:53.120]   You can have more improvements in the guide by wire technology, you can have more improvements
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:59.200]   in GPS, you can have more improvements in a computer's ability to help improve and augment
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:05.040]   the capability of the pilot. Unfortunately, that will result either in fewer pilots or less pay.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:09.680]   And so that doesn't happen nearly as fast and obviously as it should. It's the same for air
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:14.640]   traffic control. And all of these issues build up because we've allowed monopolies to build up. So
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:21.840]   as much as we think we are a capitalist society, we have veered into this collectivism in certain
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:26.720]   markets and where it's measurable and obvious. We need to point at it and say, let's go fix.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:30.800]   Yeah. And this would be let me just tee up a little bit of what you're referring to in case
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:35.760]   people don't know, but everybody probably saw the news that on January 5, the door blew off of
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:41.360]   one of these Boeing 737 Max jets. If you've heard that name before, it's because this isn't the
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:46.720]   first time that the Max jets have had problems. This plane safely landed, thank God, and there
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:52.720]   was nobody sitting in the row where the door blew off. And this has to do with some bolts on the
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:57.920]   doors. But this is just the start of problems with the 737 Max. There's an incredible documentary,
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:03.440]   if you haven't seen it, we'll put it in the show notes, Boeing's fatal flaw. And the version before
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:09.040]   this, the 737 Max 9 is the one that had the bolts come off, Jamal. The Max 8, if you remember,
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:15.200]   there were two really harrowing instances where tragically 346 people died in these two instances
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:20.720]   because the plane, literally the software on the plane, which is called Max maneuvering
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:25.360]   characteristics augmentation system, which was designed, because they were trying to get more
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:32.080]   fuel efficiency, and they had positioned the engines in a weird way on the wings.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:37.040]   So they had to kind of help pilots level this stuff. And to your point about regulatory capture,
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:43.920]   there was all this behind the scenes manipulation of the market to try to get these planes built to
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:48.240]   try to get them out the door because there was so much money at stake. Well, on these two terrible
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:53.600]   accidents, the plane the nose literally dove and the pilots were fighting it in both cases,
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:26:00.960]   right, they just crashed and everybody on board died. And for 20 months, the 737 Max models were
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:08.240]   grounded. And that cost the company over $21 billion. So there is no competition to your point.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.520]   And then in a free market, if there were 10 providers, would this be much different to mouth?
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:16.000]   And absolutely, yeah. So I mean, that's what you have to realize here is that these duopolies,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.960]   you think there's competition in a duopoly, there isn't competition.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:23.360]   No, I mean, like, for example, like, if you look at the car market, how many instances I think the
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:28.640]   last big incidents that I remember was, I think, Ford had an issue with the fuel tanks of some
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:32.640]   cars that were exploding, right? Yeah. But the reality is, when that happens,
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:38.560]   there are alternatives. One is that there's a legal requirement for Ford to just fix these
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:44.400]   things quickly. There are lawsuits that happened, there was class actions, there was settlements,
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.560]   but there's also the ability for folks that can afford it is just to switch vendor and of which
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:53.680]   there are 50 other vendors to choose from. That is a healthy dynamic. So today, when you look
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:59.440]   at the auto market, what do you see a plethora of choice. And when you see fatalities or safety
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:05.760]   issues, they are overwhelmingly driver error. Yes, we assume that and we get insurance to deal with
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:12.560]   that. When you look at airplanes, you have these three sections of risk that each are compounding
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:18.960]   because there is no competition. Number one is that the monopoly vendor has zero pressure to
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:24.560]   actually test these things adequately. Because on the other side of building something well,
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:30.080]   is shareholder pressure to deliver something sooner and faster so that they can reap more profits.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:36.320]   Then second is you have a regulatory infrastructure that puts rules on top of rules, but then will bend
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:41.680]   the rules if you donate to them. Right? And that's measured and known. And then the third are the
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:46.960]   folks that actually operate the planes, who have this actual incentive to not see technical
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:52.400]   improvements because it defends their job for longer. And in all of these cases, there isn't
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:57.680]   enough competition to shine a light on this to say, how does society actually want this market
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:01.440]   to operate? This is collectivism. It's not working.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:01.920]   Doug Birkey
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:05.520]   Freeberg, you have thoughts on this Boeing regulatory capture and the issue of only
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:12.880]   having two vendors there. And the complexity of these machines now in relation to that,
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.440]   Freeberg Nick, you can pull this up. This is an audit
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:21.120]   of the business model for a company called TransTime Group. TransTime Group is a
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:30.640]   aircraft aerospace parts manufacturer. They sell certified, regulated aircraft parts
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:36.720]   to aviation companies as well as to airlines, private pilots and also the government.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:42.640]   And they do about 7 billion in revenue, three and a half billion in EBITDA.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:48.960]   So to your point a couple weeks ago about what's the appropriate competitive EBITDA
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:54.560]   margin that a company can ultimately achieve their EBITDA margins 53% this company better
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:59.360]   than Facebook insane on 7 billion of revenue and growing. Nick, if you want to pull up their stock
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:03.760]   chart, and you guys can see how the business has performed over the years and their business model
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:10.000]   has been relatively simple. They've acquired aerospace companies got that have certified parts,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.680]   they drop the cost and raise the price. And they do that over and over again. And here's
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:19.200]   the business over the last 10 years. This thing is, you know, roughly 10 bagger,
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:26.480]   eight to 10 bagger in the last 10 years. The market cap is 60 billion today, no end in sight.
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:32.400]   And so there was a government audit done of the business by using uncertified cost data,
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.920]   which is one of the most reliable sources of information to perform cost analysis, we found
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:42.240]   that trans time earned excess profit profit of at least $21 million on 105 spare parts
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:47.760]   on 150 contracts. So they're selling spare parts into the government. The government auditor came
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:53.440]   in, audited them and identified because there's no real audit, there's no real accountability
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:57.760]   in government as purchasers. But there is regulatory authority on deciding who are the
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.240]   winners and who are the losers in the market. Trans time has been elected a winner because
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:07.200]   they have regulatory approval to make and sell these parts. The cost to get approval to make and
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:12.400]   sell these parts is so high, that it makes it prohibitive for startups to come in and compete
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:16.720]   in this marketplace. And now that they're a preferred supplier, and they get the single
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:22.080]   contracts, where there's no competition to be a supplier, they can raise the price every year.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:26.320]   Multiple audit reports over the last 23 years have highlighted the problem of the Department
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:31.200]   of Defense paying excess profits on sole source contracts, where cost analysis was not used to
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:36.560]   determine fair and reasonable prices. And this problem continues to occur. Now, I'm not necessarily
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:40.880]   saying that this is a negative on trans time. It's a fantastic business. It's well run. It's one of
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:46.080]   the best run public companies with a multi $10 billion market cap in the world. But the condition
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:50.000]   is that the US government comes in and picks and chooses through its regulatory authority,
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.440]   which companies can make products, the cost to enter and compete becomes prohibitively high.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:58.640]   And then the company has complete pricing power, and there's very little accountability in the
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:03.360]   overall system. And I think that this plays out not just with this company, but obviously also
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:08.160]   with Boeing and the fact that we've narrowed down the competitive market space to just a few sole
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:12.000]   source providers that have very little accountability. And eventually, these sorts of
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.560]   conditions arise, either prices get too high quality degrades all the other things that natural
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:20.480]   market forces would keep a check on. Yeah. And in terms of competition,
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:28.080]   Chamath, the I guess the only thing you could say is consumers could potentially maybe try to avoid
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:34.320]   the 737. Max, I know I did when all these accidents happen. I just told you know, my person who books
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:39.360]   the flights, hey, do not put me on a 737. Max period full stop. And you know what, you're
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.560]   going to wind up paying a lot more, you're going to have a hard time getting certain routes, you're
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:48.320]   going to reduce it because, you know, most airlines, I think, have these 737. Max is in
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:52.640]   there. So you when you have such a few number of providers to your point about it's not like cars,
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:57.360]   it's not fragmented like that you can't avoid a certain car type, a plane type the way you can
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:03.680]   avoid a car type. So just wrapping up your Chamath, what changes should we see in terms of
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:09.920]   late stage capitalism, something the example like air travel and manufacturers, is there any way to
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:18.960]   unwind this reasonably? Or is it too late? Because we're at this? Well, I go back to some of the
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:25.520]   examples that we've made fun of before, you have to rely on the government to actually be competent
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:31.600]   in key moments in time. I think this is one of them, the organization that could do something
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:40.480]   about it, for example, take the FTC, or even take the DOJ. We are investigating Amazon's
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:47.600]   purchase of the portable vacuum cleaner Roomba, right? critically important issue.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:56.000]   And that is apparently for the American people, higher than the sclerosis that the government has
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:03.600]   enabled, enabled in the airline industry, which affects everybody. So could the right government
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:10.000]   agencies choose to actually focus on something important here and actually figure out why is
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.560]   this happening? Because I think the door plugs issue is endemic of a much bigger problem. This
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:21.040]   is a company that's rotting because there is no accountability. And the reason there's no
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:26.480]   accountability is there's no real functional competition. And I have not seen any good answer
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:33.440]   to accountability other than competition. Yeah, I mean, the the good news is the FAA
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:41.680]   really took quick action to ground these 171 Boeing 737 nine max airplanes, but they don't
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:46.000]   they do not understand the scope of the problem if they let them back in the fleet. And this is
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.800]   happening. The bigger picture problem of lack of competition. Yeah, they're no, no, no, my
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:56.800]   my safety of these. Yeah, my point is like, you had to adjudicate the interaction of very
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:04.720]   complicated hardware and software. In that first go around. Here is just a pure, systemic hardware
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:13.600]   failure. So the point is that whether it's them or their suppliers, there's just some complacency
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:19.280]   that sets in when you know you will always have the business to Friedberg's point, it is a very
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:28.800]   corrosive thing in running a business, trying to have motivated employees, when they know on the
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:33.920]   back end of it that they could make anything in the world. And they'll just be able to sell it
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:39.200]   to somebody and they'll have to take it. That's that example that Friedberg just cited 20 odd
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:46.240]   million dollars for just random stuff for what is it 15 pieces. That's crazy. That's just straight
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:51.680]   up theft. And so when you have that, how do you expect the employees of that organization to give
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:58.240]   a I don't see how I don't see how you could expect that. And so my point is the FAA has a much bigger
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:04.080]   problem. So for example, like the D o E has a loan program to try to create a diverse energy
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:08.240]   infrastructure in the United States. Maybe we need to look at some of these sectors and instead of
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:13.360]   building the administrative state, take some of that money instead and just create programs to
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:19.360]   get more competition. All right. In other news, Adam Neumann, you remember from WeWork infamy
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:24.640]   slash fame, it has a new startup, you may have heard of it flow, they've raised a ton of money,
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:29.680]   he started buying a bunch of apartment buildings, the idea, people can rent nice apartments in cool
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:35.920]   cities, that focus more on social interaction, and hanging out in common spaces, all that great
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:41.360]   stuff. And there's also allegedly or reportedly some sort of rent to own, where renters can
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:47.600]   receive equity in the company over time. And I don't think this has ever been released. But the
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:53.040]   idea would be maybe you own shares in flow, flow manages around 3000 units, most of which were
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:58.400]   purchased by Newman after he left, we work and you know, he took down a windfall as an exit package.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:02.880]   And so according to the real deal, this real estate publication, Newman had a 60 million
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:07.840]   variable rate mortgage on one of these properties in June, sex, maybe you could explain to us what's
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:12.640]   going on here, since you have a lot of experience in real estate. Well, it's pretty simple,
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:18.240]   he can't make his interest payments. Okay, so the reason is, is because he had floating rate debt.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:25.440]   So if he had locked in his dad over, say 10 years back in when he bought this building in 2021,
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:30.400]   or whenever it was, when interest rates were extremely low, you know, that was during the
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:36.960]   desert period, probably could have locked in long term debt at maybe even 3%, three or 4%.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:42.080]   And instead, he got floating rate debt. And if you look at where commercial debt is now,
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:46.240]   I mean, it's seven, eight, 9%, if you can get it, which is pretty hard.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:50.800]   So he maxed out on debt when he bought these buildings, he bought them top of market.
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:58.240]   It sounds like in 2021, because real estate, like a lot of things moves inversely to interest rates.
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:04.800]   So when interest rates spiked over the last year or so, then real estate valuations went down. So
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:09.680]   he bought a bunch of buildings, top of market using a lot of debt that was floating rate,
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:13.920]   interest rates spike, perfect storm, now he can't make his interest payments.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:18.480]   The crazy part about this, when I was watching it happen, we talked about it, I think on the
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:24.160]   program at the time was Andreessen Horowitz put in like, over 300 million at a billion dollar
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:29.040]   valuation. But they didn't do that in peak Zurb. They did that in 2022. And the writing was on the
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:36.480]   wall. What are your thoughts on why they would make a bet like that? And yeah, just tech VCs
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.680]   betting on real estate for a second time? How does that occur?
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:45.360]   Well, I don't think it occurs because they cared about real estate. I think it allows them to
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:53.600]   take $300 million of committed capital and put it out there so that they're $300 million less
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:58.160]   available, which means that they're $300 million closer to raising a new fund,
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:02.720]   which means that they can raise they can charge 2% on more money. That's why they did it.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:08.000]   Got it. Yeah. So just keep the money train deploying capital. It's a place where you
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.520]   can put a big huge check. And you can raise your next fund. And yeah, why not? Okay, well,
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:19.120]   they have. Let me let me offer. I mean, I don't disagree. I think that candidly, what you've said
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:23.440]   is exactly how mega funds are thinking about it. We have to deploy capital to raise our next fund.
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:27.520]   And if we still have capital in our last fund, then we can't deploy freeberg.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:30.640]   Well, if you're gonna have to deploy large amounts of capital,
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:37.120]   wouldn't you feel better deploying that capital with an entrepreneur who's actually run a big
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:41.120]   business before even though the business failed? No, no, no, if you're if you're if you if you
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.800]   were not optimized for fees, you would do a Peter Thiel did and just have the fund and return the
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:52.080]   money. Right? And for further because he's already won, but everybody else that's trying to win the
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:58.880]   only way to win in a world where your your exits are not that great is to actually generate money
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:03.280]   via fees, even though that fees are taxed at current income. That's the way to win in venture
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:10.640]   is not carry. It's by fees. And so it's and I don't blame Andreessen. I think like that's that's
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:15.360]   smart for them to do. And if they have folks that are willing to enable that by giving them money,
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:21.200]   they should do it. But are they going to generate huge rates of return? Probably not because that's
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:27.520]   not what real estate is known for real estate is known for long steady tax arms that slowly compound
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:33.120]   for the for the owner of the company over 20 or the owner of the business over 25 to 35 years.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:38.000]   That's not what a venture fund is supposed to be doing for a 10 year 12 year return cycle. So
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.960]   obviously, they're doing it for fees. That's okay. I think that's capitalism.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:46.400]   What are the LPS then think sacks if we look at this, you know, you're an LP in a technology
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:50.400]   firm. I'll take Andreessen out of it for a second. But let's just say some giant LP gives
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:56.320]   giant amounts of money to a venture capital firm, and then they're deployed in real estate.
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:01.040]   What happens, you know, in their minds? And is there any kind of tension that would occur?
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:06.960]   Well, handy having the situation, you can never judge a VC based on one investment.
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:11.360]   If we were to do that, every VC would have a lot of egg on their face, because we're supposed to
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:16.160]   take big swings and swing for the fences and try and hit home runs and grand slams. And a lot of
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:21.440]   them are going to make you look foolish, you have to look at an investment portfolio and track
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:27.120]   returns over time. So I wouldn't judge any particular investor based on one investment.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:32.560]   So I don't think that's fair. Now, in the case of this investment, if you want me to explain what I
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:39.520]   think went wrong. I think Adam Newman had a compelling vision. His vision was to create a
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:45.120]   new experience in in, I guess you'd call it apartment living, and that people will be willing
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:50.800]   to pay more for that, because he would create this national brand in apartments. And right now,
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:57.200]   apartments are super local, and there is no brand in, you know, apartment living. So I think as a
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:02.640]   entrepreneur, as an operator, he had a great vision. And I think he actually achieved his
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:07.840]   vision. If you read these articles carefully, what they say is that his occupancy was high,
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:13.200]   and people were willing to pay at least a little bit more for the experience of being in a flow
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:20.800]   apartment. The problem for Adam Newman is that at the end of the day, his plan to raise rents by
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:26.240]   creating experience, even though it worked, it just didn't raise rents that much. And what ended
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:32.720]   up being much more important were the moves in interest rates and how he capitalized these
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:37.520]   acquisitions and the price he paid on the acquisitions. So there's an old saying in real
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:43.360]   estate that you make money based on the buy, not on the sell, meaning that, you know, when you go
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:49.200]   and sell your apartment building, office building, or whatever, you're monetizing an acquisition that
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:53.040]   you did correctly. And if you don't buy at the right price, you're never going to be able to
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:57.680]   make money on the sale. And I think this is a really good example of this, where he bought
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:05.120]   at top of market, his capital stack was over reliant on debt, and he had floating rate debt.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:10.400]   I mean, those are just financial mistakes and timing mistakes that you can't make up for,
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:15.520]   no matter how good an operator you are in real estate. And in a way, I mean, this is the same
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:20.320]   thing that happened with WeWork, which is he delivered an excellent product. I mean, people
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:27.040]   love WeWork offices. Absolutely. Yeah, they pick them over other offices because of the vibes,
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:32.880]   because of the culture, because of the community. So he has some mastery of that. But to your point,
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:37.920]   entry price matters, and the economics matter. If you look at WeWork, it didn't fail because
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:42.000]   the product wasn't good. It was because he didn't pay enough attention to the financial
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.600]   aspects of the business. With WeWork, he leased a bunch of offices at the absolute top of the market,
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:52.000]   and then over invested in TI's, tenant improvements. With Flow, he bought a bunch
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.320]   of real estate at the top of the market and sort of did it with the wrong capital stack.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:02.080]   So this is the problem is that when you get into a real estate business, it doesn't really matter
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:09.040]   how great you are as an entrepreneur operator if you're not good at sort of the legacy,
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:16.160]   old school real estate part of it. And the old school real estate guys were saying during WeWork,
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:22.160]   "This is not going to work. This is Regis, but with a bad capital structure." And the old school
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:28.080]   real estate guys were saying something similar about this. And it just goes to show that if you
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:32.880]   are going to try and disrupt a legacy industry, you do have to kind of understand the ins and
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:38.000]   outs of that legacy industry. And the great paradox of this, Sax, was when he did Green
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.400]   Desk, which was the precursor to WeWork, when he did the first WeWorks in San Francisco and other
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:48.880]   places, his playbook was find a building that's empty that cannot be leased. So he got 25 Taylor
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:53.600]   Street, like 6th and Market, the worst area by the Tenderloin, and we had an office there for
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:57.760]   a little bit. And I had my podcasting studio there for a little bit. This was a terrible off, this was
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:03.280]   a terrible area, but he made it hip and cool. And it was really cheap. And man, it sold out and it
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:08.160]   was packed and the vibes were great. But then as you're saying, then he moved all of a sudden to
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:13.760]   Soma, and he started opening up these glass filled ones. And, you know, the he was renting them for
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:18.080]   less with all their giveaways and six months free and all this stuff than they could ever afford.
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:22.800]   So he kind of had mission drift, right? The playbook, they just they changed the playbook.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:25.200]   And it economically was not viable.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:29.840]   Well, the timing, the timing got really bad. And again, they didn't pay attention to the
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:36.000]   financial aspects as much as they should. In this case, I think that if he was trying to execute
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.200]   this play today, and doing his acquisitions today, he could actually make it where he would,
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:44.640]   he would need a lot more equity because he wouldn't be able to get as much debt financing.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:49.120]   But if he had the equity and could do more of an acquisition based on equity, the prices he'd pay
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:54.080]   right now would be much lower. And then as interest rates come down, he could ride that
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:45:00.800]   wave, he could refi, pull his equity out, and put debt on it that is cheaper as the price goes down.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:05.520]   So there was a way to maybe make this work. But you know, with real estate,
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:10.800]   the timing is just so important. Again, your cost basis of when you get in the investment
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:15.520]   is probably the most important thing in terms of whether you make money or not.
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:19.520]   Did you see this by chance, the real estate piece in 60 minutes, the package they did
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:23.520]   last week, Saks? It was basically what we were talking about here a year ago.
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:27.680]   Super compelling, if you haven't seen it. It's basically the all in podcast from 12 or 18 months
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:33.600]   ago. Has anything changed on the field in terms of commercial real estate? Or is it just continuing
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:37.360]   to collapse? No, I mean, nothing's changed. I think that all the commercial real estate
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:43.120]   guys, the sponsors and the dealmakers and so forth, they're all kind of hanging on by their
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:48.720]   fingernails waiting for interest rates to come down. And all the leases are still coming off,
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:52.720]   right? Like people are still who had six, seven, eight year leases that were signed pre-COVID.
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:59.200]   It depends on the market. I mean, some of the markets are coming back. But again, what this
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:07.040]   flow news showed, this Adam Neumann news shows is that you could be fully occupied and you could
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:11.440]   still default. And the reason is because of your capital structure, the interest rates have spiked
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:19.360]   up. You're now paying all of your operating income is being eaten up by your debt service.
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:23.520]   The only way to make it through that is you go to your bank, it's one of these regional
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:30.480]   banks, and you work out a deal to extend. They call it pretend and extend. And they let you
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:35.440]   hang on there. You'll extend the term of your- Kick the can down the road, yeah.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:38.960]   Yeah. They'll lower your debt payments in exchange for more term. And you just try to
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:44.160]   get to the other side of these high interest rates. And then once you get to the other side,
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:49.280]   again, you're hanging on, you're not defaulting. That's what everyone's doing. So, if rates don't
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:55.360]   come down as expected this year, I think the market's expecting 150 basis points of rate cuts.
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:47:00.080]   If that doesn't actually happen, there's a lot of real estate sponsors who are in trouble.
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:04.640]   And in turn, there's a lot of regional banks who are in trouble because they're the ones
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:08.640]   who made all these loans to these sponsors. So, everyone's trying to, like you said,
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:13.440]   kick the can down the road. Yeah. And the 60 Minutes piece also
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:17.920]   talked about how there's some emergency rezoning going on in New York specifically where
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:21.920]   they take the floor plate in the middle, which I think you talked about, Sach, you have to have
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:27.040]   windows if you want to convert to residential. And they just make an empty space, the void,
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:31.840]   they call it, in the middle of the building that they'll deal with in the future. But they just
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:35.600]   have this empty space in the middle of the building that's not going to get used. And
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:40.400]   then the rest that has windows gets used to be converted into lofts, etc, in New York. So,
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:44.560]   people are starting to think creatively. If people don't come back to office. Okay,
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:49.440]   let me ask you a question just based on that comp, the set of comments, given Adam Newman's
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:54.720]   experience as an investor in this space, and this general opportunity, wouldn't you rather back a
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:59.760]   known someone who knows and has been through the market and has experience versus some founder
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:03.440]   who shows up and has never run a business in this space? I mean, this guy has more experience.
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:08.400]   It's such a great point. Well, here's the thing, Freeberg, the great point about that is,
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:13.120]   you don't see a lot of founders who explicitly come out and say, I want to build $100 billion
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:19.040]   business, I want to build a giant business. They're so rare, that VCs who have a lot of chips,
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:24.320]   they would like to back those, you know, swing for the fences, folks. And so, I do understand
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:27.840]   why people would back him again. And they've run out of before they've done it. To some degree.
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:31.840]   So, maybe they learned from mistakes, and this time around, he learned from those mistakes.
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:33.200]   Yeah, but this is the exact same mistake.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.840]   So, therefore, they made the bad bet.
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:38.080]   I'm not advocating, by the way. I'm just asking.
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:41.920]   No, I understand. But to your point, Freeberg, I can understand. People want to bet on somebody
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:46.960]   who is crazy and swings for the fences. This entrepreneur clearly does not learn from their
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:50.000]   mistakes. I think both of those things could be true. Right, Shama?
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:55.040]   What I would say is that I think that where I've made the biggest mistakes in my investing career
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:02.000]   is when I confused what I was investing in for one thing when it was the other. And so,
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:08.480]   when I look back, and I had a small dallyance in biotech, because I thought, oh, this is going to
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:14.080]   be more computational biology, and I understand computation. So, this gives me an edge. Turned
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:19.280]   out I was wrong. There was another time where I've invested in certain sectors of the economy,
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:23.040]   because I thought they were technology businesses, and at best, they were tech-enabled
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:28.960]   versions of an existing industry. And when I look at those investments, the thing that I got wrong
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:37.200]   was not listening to the very experienced investors in those sectors and why they passed.
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:45.040]   And that has caused me no shortage of headache and grief. And so, if I had to learn anything
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:50.160]   from all of this, it would be that if it looks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it's a
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:56.240]   duck. It's not a tech company. And so, if that duck means it's a real estate business, I would
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:00.400]   talk to a real estate investor and wonder to myself why they wouldn't have done this deal.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:05.200]   Similarly, you know, when it's a biotech business, I have to ask myself,
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:10.240]   why wouldn't they have done it? They know more than I ever will in this space. And so, similarly,
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:16.160]   I kind of look at this as an example of that, which is, could be a very talented person in an
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:22.080]   industry. I think just like it's important for us to be very clear and lucid and intellectually
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:25.760]   honest about what industry that is. I think it's a great point. I mean, look, I think whenever
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:31.600]   you're dealing with a tech-enabled business, which I would define as a more traditional
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:40.160]   business model with some sort of software layer, you know, on top of it, you have to kind of assess
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:45.680]   like how much of a difference does that software really make at the end of the day. In this case,
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:53.360]   this is a real estate business with a very thin kind of software slash operating technology.
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:51:02.000]   Yeah, the experience layer is a very small part of the overall, let's call it P&L of this business.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.560]   Such a great point. Saks, I mean, a perfect analogy would be like if you have, if you're
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:10.800]   taking a flight on United, the United app is delightful now. It's a really good app. I don't
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:14.480]   use this as a commercial airline. It's called United Airlines, Saks. You pay for one ticket
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:17.680]   instead of the whole plane. But have you been to a McDonald's recently? I actually went to
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:21.360]   McDonald's. Yeah. You order through an app now and there's a big screen. The point is you walk
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:26.480]   in there and it's probably not the McDonald's you knew 15 or 20 years ago. It's not about waiting in
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:32.000]   line and ordering and that's not how it works anymore. There. So the point is, is that a tech
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.040]   enabled business or is that still a restaurant? Well, if you spend a lot of your time intellectually
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:42.080]   contorting yourself to try to justify why the next version of McDonald's is a tech enabled
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:46.880]   business, you're just going to lose a lot of money. It's a restaurant. Now all restaurants
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:52.240]   need technology. And what you see by McDonald's is even the oldest and most established are running
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:57.840]   forward very quickly to implement technology because they know that it creates efficiency,
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:02.720]   which then flows to the bottom line for them. Yeah. So the reality is that we have lived in
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:07.680]   this wonderland where we've looked at these software businesses that have 80 and 90% gross
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:12.480]   margins and impose that expectation on other markets and then made investment decisions by
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:18.000]   trying to justify how that it's a tech enabled real estate business, a tech enabled healthcare
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:23.120]   business, a tech enabled energy business without being honest with ourselves that those businesses
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:30.400]   have over decades because of lots of competition found a consistent and reliable
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:38.320]   resting place in terms of gross margins far below 80 and 90%. And so instead of willing
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:43.120]   tech enabled businesses to be at 80 and 90 and tricking oneself, I think it's more realistic
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:48.800]   to ask yourself why aren't 80 and 90% gross margin businesses decaying to 30 and 40% gross
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:53.600]   margins like every other part of the economy, when everything will be technology enabled? I think that
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:58.320]   that's a very reasonable question. And I think the answer is, there is no safe place. I don't think
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:03.520]   that you can justify 80 90% gross margins in software, when you can use a model and whip up
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:08.960]   a competitor. I just think that we are all going to a place where everything is a tech enabled
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:14.320]   version of some marketplaces would be a notable exception there with network effects. So DoorDash
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:18.640]   versus the tech enabled restaurant, asset light marketplaces, you and I and sacks have been
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:22.560]   involved in a bunch of different marketplaces together. Sometimes they're asset heavy,
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:26.240]   sometimes they're asset light when they're asset heavy, man, it's really hard to make those
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:33.200]   businesses work on sacks. Yeah, I mean, I think we should differentiate between gross margin and then
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:40.560]   the net operating margin or profit, right. And so, you know, gross margin is what is the cost
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:47.120]   on the margin of providing one incremental unit. And the thing about pure software businesses
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:51.760]   is that on the margin, you can provision another instance of the product almost for free. I mean,
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:57.120]   there's a little bit of hosting costs at AWS or whatever. So on the margins, it's, you know,
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:01.440]   it's like the perfect gross margin business, as opposed to a hamburger, as opposed to a,
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:09.360]   yeah, a restaurant is going to have very large costs of goods sold or cogs. The simple heuristic
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:16.800]   that I use is just does this company have large cogs, costs of goods sold? And are they physical
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:23.920]   world cogs? If they are, it's not a software business, it's at best a tech enabled business.
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:30.960]   So just look for that. You know, does this business have large physical world cogs? Now,
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:36.240]   what I would say is if the cogs are virtual, like, you know, it could be hosting costs,
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:43.120]   or it could be paying Twilio for telephony or something like that, then at least it's still
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:48.800]   not like as good a business because the margins aren't as good, but it's very scalable, right?
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:53.120]   Because you're not you don't have that like huge friction of needing to scale up physical world
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:58.480]   infrastructure, physical world, supply chains, that kind of stuff. So I like virtual cogs a
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:02.800]   lot better. There are digital cogs a lot better than physical cogs.
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:05.920]   I love it when marketplaces though, I mean, we could speak to that, too. You know,
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:10.480]   when I had Dara on the pod the other week, and when he launches an adjacency,
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:13.680]   hey, we're going to sell alcohol, hey, we're going to sell groceries, hey, we're gonna
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:18.800]   add this thing that's right next to the already, you know, portfolio of Uber offerings,
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:21.840]   doesn't cost them much, right? They just have to get the supply side up and running,
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:24.720]   but they already have the demand side. And I think that's where like, these super apps are
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:30.240]   doing really well, or Airbnb adding, you know, some inventory in a new city that they unlock,
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:34.720]   right? Well, true, true marketplaces are perfect gross margin businesses as well,
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:38.960]   because they don't have physical inventory that they themselves own. What you'll see is with a
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:46.400]   lot of marketplaces, they'll cheat by buying the inventory themselves, at least to jumpstart the
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:52.240]   market and then selling it. And so when you see that line item on the P&L, you know, that they
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:57.840]   have real cost of goods sold, you know, oh, wait a second, this isn't a true marketplace, they're
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:03.760]   providing the service. And so again, it's just a way to like catch whether the business is truly
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:10.240]   one of these great, high gross margin businesses, or whether it's more of a tech enabled business
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:15.040]   that's pretending to be a pure software business. Yeah, direct to consumer got people in a lot of
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:21.920]   trouble during the last cycle in venture capital. If you look at a lot of these companies,
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:31.120]   even the best SaaS businesses have seen their gross margins erode by about 15 to 20%. It used
[00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:38.400]   to be that best in class software business can generate 90 91% 88 high 80s to low 90s gross
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:41.760]   margins. Now that's not true. You see a lot of these best in class companies that are in the
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:47.200]   high 60s, low 70s. So it already just shows you that that pressure has has come upon the market.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:52.960]   And so is it that the software enabled business goes towards 85? Or is that the 85% gross margin
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:56.880]   business goes towards 30? It looks like it's the latter. That's just what the data says.
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:57:01.200]   Well, ma'am, just categorizing certain costs differently than you are. But I don't know why
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:04.560]   software business would go all the way to 30. Right? Because again, sales and marketing don't
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:10.640]   count in the gross margin. GNA doesn't count even R&D doesn't count in the gross margin has to be,
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:17.520]   you know, a unit cost that you can attribute on the margin to that incremental instance of the
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:24.800]   product. So things like, again, paying Twilio for meter telephony or paying open AI for like
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:31.120]   metered API access, all of that is definitely in cogs. And I think some customer support costs
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:37.280]   that can be attributed on kind of a per instance basis that goes in there. But if if sales and
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:43.120]   marketing and R&D and GNA aren't going in there, I mean, I don't know why I go all the way to 30.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:47.520]   I guess I'm just saying that I still think software businesses and marketplaces for that
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:53.520]   matter are still the best kinds of businesses on a margin profile basis. The problem is that
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:59.120]   there's a lot of fake software businesses or fake marketplaces out there that are pretending
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:05.280]   to be pure tech businesses when actually, they're they're more like old school businesses that have
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:11.920]   the veneer of technology. And I think, to your point there, like the trick of saying I'm an 80%
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:18.640]   gross margin business, but having no profitability is then who cares? So when you look at the profit,
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:23.200]   when you look at the profitability of these businesses, again, you'll be in the 20 to 30%.
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:30.240]   That's why when you see companies that are in the high 30s to low 50s, they're a very unique.
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:37.680]   And be, you should expect that there is something fundamentally monopolistic about them.
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:43.600]   And that is the simplest way to filter out these companies, because in a highly competitive market,
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:48.720]   you cannot extract those kinds of profit dollars. Capitalism says you can't do that. So you can only
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:54.880]   do it when when you have an N of one or N of two kind of competitive dynamic where there's essentially
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:59:00.160]   a mutual to talk with your biggest competitor. Yeah, it is it is a good point that just because
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:05.680]   you have good unit economics or good gross margins doesn't mean that the business is profitable at
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:10.320]   the end of the day. Yeah, it could be totally 80% gross margins and still be losing a ton of money
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:14.960]   because you've got too much overhead. You've got too much sales and marketing. You're too much R&D.
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:18.800]   Yes. So you're selling to customers who don't really need it. And then they eventually cancel,
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:23.280]   right? Like we see that a lot. Look at the streamers. Look at the streamers. That's just
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:27.360]   a big recycling exercise. It's just like people come to the top of the funnel, they use the product,
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:31.760]   and then they leave and then you have to reacquire them over and over again. And it and it could be
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:35.200]   the case that SAS actually looks a little bit like that too, at the bottom level,
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:38.240]   but when you hit your natural audience, it does get challenging.
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:42.800]   Well, this is why in SAS, there's a heuristic called the rule of 40,
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:48.480]   which is for public market SAS companies, you want to see that their operating margin
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:54.560]   plus their growth rate equals 40 or is greater than 40, ideally. So in other words, you could
[00:59:54.560 --> 01:00:01.200]   have a SAS business with a 20% operating margin and a 20% growth rate, and that would hit rule
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:06.080]   of 40 and that would be a very attractive business. Or you could have, I don't know,
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:10.400]   it could be growing 50% year over year, and its operating margin could be negative 10%.
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:17.040]   And that'd be okay too, because they're losing money, but at least the investment is leading to
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:23.360]   well above average growth. Or you could be growing, you could be growing slower, you could
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:28.160]   have a 10% growth rate and have a 30% operating margin, and that would also be hitting the rule
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:34.640]   of 40. So it's just a simple way of tracking whether this is a good business at scale.
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:38.880]   I don't think startups have to worry about this until they get to the later growth stage.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:42.880]   Yeah. When you're in your BC round, you're making 50, 100 million. Yeah, you got to be
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.520]   really thoughtful about this. In the beginning, you're trying to get product market fit and
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:50.240]   triangulate on something. So Chamath just mentioned streaming, NBCUniversal, if you
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:56.880]   didn't know it, paid the NFL $100 million for the exclusive streaming rights to one,
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:01.680]   that's right, one first round playoff game for the NFL. That happened last weekend between the
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:07.280]   Chiefs and the Dolphins. That was on their service Peacock, NBC's app, basically their
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:12.880]   version of Netflix or Disney Plus. It garnered 23 million viewers, which makes it the most streamed
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:22.080]   live event in US history. Even so, that's almost half of what the Packers and Cowboys had about 40
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:28.800]   million. Lions versus Rams, same weekend, 36 million. And so this has brought into question
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:32.320]   what's going on with streaming? Have these businesses gotten ahead of their skis? Just
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:38.640]   to give you a couple of charts. Disney Plus took off like a massive rocket peaked in q4 of 2022 at
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:45.760]   164 million subscribers are now at 150 million. Here's a chart. I mean, just amazing how quickly
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:52.640]   they got to Netflix ish numbers. Here's Netflix's chart. Again, this is quarterly, they're up to
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:59.680]   now an all time high 247 million subscribers, and the annual growth rate all the way back to 2001
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:06.640]   still pretty spectacular. And their revenue also very respectable for Netflix. However, they
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:13.200]   overspent massively during the peak streaming era 2019 to 2022. And that's when subscriber growth
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:19.200]   started to slow. Obviously, they were spending way too much and other entrants came in like Apple
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:23.920]   Plus and Amazon Prime where they really didn't even think that they had to make a profit. They
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:31.040]   were using streaming maybe to sell more iPhones or to get more Amazon Prime subscribers. So here is
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:36.080]   the major problem. Here's the churn chart. Basically churn means people cancel, right. And
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:42.240]   so as these services have cut what they're offering the number of Marvel shows or Disney,
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:48.640]   you know, having Star Wars shows, the churn goes way up. People are also having subscription
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:53.120]   overload. I don't know how many of these I subscribe to, but I think it's all of them.
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:03:00.400]   Or maybe out of these 123456789 on the chart, I think I have seven of these. So there is definitely
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:08.000]   some unbelievable subscription burnout. And the streamers in order to get these businesses above
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.440]   water have raised their prices. We all know that you've probably seen your streaming bills,
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:15.200]   you know, have three, four or five bucks added to them every month. And at the same time,
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:18.320]   they're cutting how much they're spending. So you're paying more for less. Chamath,
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:22.480]   your thoughts on this dynamic? If you bring the chart back up, here's the
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:28.640]   most important thing that's worth noting. Let's take stars as an example, it turns 12% of their
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:33.680]   users every month, which means that over a year, they've turned 144% of their user base.
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:41.280]   That means that they have to basically turn their entire membership base one and a half times in
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:47.920]   order just to tread water. Right. So if you start with 100, it's a lot of money that you have to
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:53.520]   spend to make sure you end the year at 100. Forget about growing. If you look at peacock,
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:57.760]   they're going to lose 100% of their subscribers in a year. If you look at
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:06.800]   discovery, they're going to lose 75%. If you look at max, they're going to lose 50 odd percent
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:13.680]   Apple TV, same Hulu and Disney plus will lose 60%. Netflix will lose almost 40%.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:21.360]   So the only winner in all of this is Facebook and Google. The only winners are Facebook and Google,
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:27.200]   because that's where the ads will appear to try to reacquire these folks, right? So I guess that's
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:32.720]   a positive indication. But the reality is that money isn't infinite. And so what happens in a
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:38.240]   dynamic where you have a category, where there's just a lot of consumer churn, I think what happens
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:43.120]   is it evolves in phases. And in phase one, which is sort of where we are now where there's a bunch
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:49.920]   of relatively well established folks, is that they are going to initially overspend on content,
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:54.960]   because they are going to try to differentiate the cost of acquisition based on content, right,
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:59.120]   which makes sense. I have a tentpole, come and watch it here. You can't watch it anywhere else.
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:04.480]   And I think that was the peacock example, where they had this football game and all these people
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:10.160]   showed up. And they thought this is exactly why we're paying so much money for these rights,
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:14.400]   because people will show up. I think the problem is that when everybody is doing it,
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:20.880]   everybody's doing it. And so you don't know how to differentiate even in our group chat.
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:24.640]   Look at the number of times when somebody randomly says, Is there something to watch? And everybody's
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:30.640]   got 50 recommendations. Guess what I do, I tune it all out, because I'm like 50 across six different
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:36.160]   services, I have no way to track it. And then I lose interest. And I'm like, you know, I'll just
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:42.320]   stick to YouTube. So I think what happens is in phase one, folks spend a lot of content in phase
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:49.200]   two, they realize that actually, what you need to do is spend on a long tail of content in a much
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:53.920]   more disciplined way. So there's a company that that I know about, for example, they just signed a
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:06:00.720]   pretty big deal with Amazon. Hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:07.920]   And I was trying to figure out is that a lot or a little. And it turns out that Amazon's trying to
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:13.920]   get three or four or five versions of these going. Which means that before we probably could have
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:18.560]   gotten five or 600 million and instead you get two or 300 million still an incredible thing,
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:22.400]   but it just goes to show you that there's a lot of competition. And so instead of having
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:27.840]   a single mode, right, if you were to graph something, where there's a few pieces that
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:34.320]   just get all the money, now you're smearing this content across all kinds of stuff. And I think
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:40.000]   that that makes it very difficult to keep folks so I suspect that you're just going to see a lot
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.560]   of churn. I don't I don't like this category at all as an investor. Clearly, there's been
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:48.400]   an overspend here, but consolidation is coming freeberg. Any thoughts on the streaming space?
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:52.880]   I just think this is the opposite of what we were talking about earlier,
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:57.120]   where there's a free market competing, and it's benefiting consumers. I mean,
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:00.560]   the point that you made is a really good one that there's a lot of great content to watch.
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:06.160]   Folks that raise prices, people cancel. So you got to drop prices, you got to offer good content.
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:12.240]   And I actually think this is a really good and healthy thing to see happen is competition that
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:16.160]   benefits consumers. And there'll be some set of winners here and some set of losers. But I think
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:21.360]   ultimately, it's just really good to see this how it all shakes out, who's willing to put up the big
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:26.400]   bucks, who's got the smarter algorithm that predicts how fresh your content has to be and
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:31.040]   how unique it has to be relative to other platforms to keep the audience attention.
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:34.400]   I would argue if you look at those numbers, and you look at the performance over time,
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:38.400]   Netflix absolutely rules the roost in the sense they're an incredible operating team.
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:43.040]   They have an incredible capability of predicting what content will work, how quickly they have to
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:47.280]   refresh content, how much they should be investing in content per quarter per month. And they're
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:51.920]   clearly retaining users and making money. And others maybe that are newer to the game haven't
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:55.760]   figured that out yet. But it's just very good to see the competition. So I don't know how to predict
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.520]   what's going to happen here. But it's good to see.
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:00.560]   It's clearly going to be massive consolidation. Also, these folks are
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:05.120]   launching advertising based version. So you probably saw Netflix has an advertising tier.
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:10.000]   And so a lot of these folks didn't have those Disney plus, I think is going to have one as well.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.920]   You know what no one's paying attention to is YouTube TV. I don't know,
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:15.360]   you guys subscribe to YouTube TV.
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.040]   I'm a Hulu person.
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:21.040]   Yeah, I think it's fantastic. If you look at some third party data on YouTube TV,
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:25.280]   the subscriptions are going through the friggin roof. And it's really interesting to see because
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:30.480]   with YouTube TV, you're basically re bundling the unbundling that happened in cable, except you're
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:34.720]   doing it over the internet, you can access it anywhere. So they've basically converted the pipe
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:39.520]   as the value to the service itself as the value which you can access anywhere you want on any TV
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:44.960]   in any room without boxes while you're on the road on your phone on your laptop. And it seems to be
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:50.160]   kind of highlighting that maybe it wasn't necessarily the bundling that was the problem,
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:55.600]   but the way that the service was being offered. So who knows maybe bundling versus all of this
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:00.240]   part and parcel, you got to pick five different providers and buy content on the fly. Maybe
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:01.600]   that's not what consumers want.
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:07.280]   Young people don't care about the live channels old people do. But yeah, Hulu and YouTube TV
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:12.320]   are really wonderful products because they work really well on Apple TV. The apps work great,
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:17.120]   but they also work great on your iPhone, your iPad. So yeah, you know, they're really spectacular
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:18.560]   in that way. Saks.
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:24.400]   Well, this is tie this conversation back to what we were talking about with margins and SAS and
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:31.040]   tech enabled versus real software businesses. I personally have never seen a B2C subscription
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:36.880]   business that works the churn is just too high. I mean, what I've seen is that the monthly churn
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:43.360]   rates on a software subscription for consumers is somewhere in the five to 10% range. So on a
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:47.600]   full year basis, you're attaining maybe 50% of your customer base, you're effectively rebuilding
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:52.160]   your business from scratch every two years. It's a very tough place to be. This is why I basically
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:10:00.000]   skewed towards B2B SAS is because a good B2B SAS business will have net expansion instead of 50%
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.920]   churn, you'll do 120% expansion. And so you're actually building a subscriber base with long
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:11.920]   term value. Now, how did Netflix do it? I mean, Netflix avoided that prohibitive level of churn
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:17.360]   by spending literally billions of dollars on content and original programming. And again,
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:23.680]   it goes back to the point, this is not a pure software, pure tech business. It includes an
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:31.920]   old school studio, which is very capital intensive. And they financed a lot of the
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:37.360]   content acquisition with billions and billions of dollars raised during that ZURP period,
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:43.760]   from I think, both equity and debt. And you have to wonder if that could be done again in this
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:48.320]   post ZURP period, where capital is just a lot scarcer. I think this is going to work really
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:52.560]   well, though, for Netflix and Disney, man, these huge archives that they own, these libraries
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:58.400]   are going to get them to three, four, 500 million global subs, and has become money printing machines
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:02.480]   that I don't think they're going to need a ton of new content. The question is whether you could
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:08.320]   recreate an archive of that level today, given how much more expensive capital is. My point is that
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:14.560]   ZURP helped Netflix catch up to these studios and create this huge library. But still, I think that
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:19.440]   what the streaming services have shown in their churn is that if you don't provide original
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:26.240]   content and original programming, then users will churn off that. So, you have to kind of have both.
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:31.840]   You kind of have like the library as filler, but if you don't have a hot show come along every
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:36.800]   so often, the subscribers will churn off that. Yeah, you need to have some new content, depending
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:40.000]   on how deep the library is. It feels like Netflix and Disney+ have done a great job with their
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:49.120]   libraries, just to give you an idea. Revenue for Netflix for 2023, 33.5 billion, 247 million subs,
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:55.760]   that's ARPU yearly revenue for those folks, 136 bucks a year. Now, the reason you're seeing that
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:00.320]   number not make sense if you're paying 15 bucks a month is because internationally,
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:05.280]   Netflix is a lot, lot cheaper. But I love those two businesses. I think they're going to be
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:12.640]   extraordinary over time. Netflix has to acquire 100 million people a year just to stay even.
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:16.880]   What's their churn rate? 4% a month. I think it's fine. Right. So, they're churning half their
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:23.760]   customer base every year. That's my point. 100 million people. They're rebuilding their customer
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:28.080]   base from scratch every two years. How does that make sense? It's totally fine because what happens
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:33.440]   is you have people coming off their parents plan, getting their own, people go through a bad beat,
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:36.240]   they don't like it, you know, whatever, they unsubscribe, but they all come back,
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:42.240]   back and forth, back and forth. And then it just keeps growing over time. I think you're describing
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:48.480]   something that's true. I think David is describing why it's a shit business. I mean, if they make
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:52.640]   more money than they spend, and I don't think they need to do a ton of advertising. Eventually,
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:57.440]   you churn through so much of the market that actually you can't maintain that growth rate.
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:02.000]   I mean, if you reactivate, maybe you can do it. But I think that's what's happening.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.120]   From a business perspective, the only logical thing that I would do if I was running one of
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:13.520]   these businesses is attach it to another business where you can think about it in terms of LTV. So,
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:18.880]   the only obvious example of that, I think, is Amazon Video, because you can stick it beside
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:23.200]   Prime and a bunch of other things. And now you have a very different way of justifying
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:30.080]   LTV and minimizing churn. And that seems like a I buy that argument, Jason, I don't buy like
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:35.360]   a standalone business like this trying to do it. Yucky. I know. Sorry, real quick. Have you guys
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:41.440]   dug into Netflix's business? I mean, they're still growing top line, the EBITDA margin continues to
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:46.160]   expand. I mean, all those facts might be true. But that churn engine and that recapture engine
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:51.200]   seems to be working in a way that they're printing cash and growing. It's pretty impressive. I don't
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:54.720]   know if there's a limit there. But I mean, I haven't looked at the analyst. I think that is
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:14:01.200]   the key. Yeah, to the bundling point, Apple Plus, which is the TV component, not the hardware
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:06.640]   product, is bundled as part of this Apple One program, which is kind of like Amazon Prime.
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:11.040]   And so I think you're seeing a little bundling there. Netflix also added video games to make
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:15.760]   it even more sticky. So I think there's like a subscription, super app coming, which the New
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:20.880]   York Times is kind of done right with wordle, crosswords, the athletic wire cutter and the New
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:25.440]   York Times. So I think you're going to start to see honestly, you just had a jumble of names that
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:28.480]   went in one year and out the other. I don't remember a single one. You said this is my
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:32.800]   point for most people, Jason, not a media aficionado like New York Times is doing fantastic
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:36.320]   doing this bundling. Some people come for the crosswords and wordle. And that's why they
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:40.000]   subscribe and they like the news. Other people come for the news, they discover crosswords and
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000]   wire cutter and the athletic and they stay for that. So I do think there's going to be an
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.240]   incredible business here. I'll take the other side of it. Yeah, they spent a lot on content
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:53.200]   though during that period where Disney plus came in. I think everybody's now has a little more
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:59.200]   discipline and the budgets came way down. If you didn't know the Hulk cost 250 million or something,
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:03.440]   the She-Hulk rather, that cost 225 million for nine episodes. What? The first Avengers,
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:09.920]   225 million. Wait, sorry, 250 million for nine episodes? Of the She-Hulk. Oh my lord. And people
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:14.080]   criticize it for having bad CGI. So it's, I think there's like new discipline coming to Hollywood.
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:17.440]   Was this a Netflix show? A Disney plus show. A Disney plus show.
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:20.800]   Yeah. I don't know about you guys. I've been rewatching the Sopranos. I find some of the
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:24.640]   content on HBO max to be the best content out there. Oh my God. I've watched it twice.
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:28.400]   There's so much rewatchability on it. Disney doesn't have that much rewatchability. I don't
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:32.480]   know. The only reason I keep my max subscription is because I'm waiting for a house of the dragon
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:36.960]   season two. I mean, if they didn't have that one show, I'd be like, yeah, cut it. You know?
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:41.760]   Yeah. I do think this could help Netflix because a lot of these streaming services came along.
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:46.880]   We had way too many, right? We got saturated with streaming services and most of them,
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:51.200]   you subscribe to, you may not even remember subscribing. You may just subscribe to a free
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:55.280]   trial to get an NFL game and then you get billed because you forgot to cancel it.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:16:02.080]   By the way. Yeah. Have you guys ever gone into Apple iCloud settings and looked at your
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:09.280]   subscriptions? Oh boy. Yeah. Get in there and guys just go, if you have like an extra five
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:14.880]   minutes, you will save so much money by going into subscriptions in your settings and just
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:19.440]   turning them all off. I was shocked. I was shocked. I mean, this is part of your austerity
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:22.800]   measure. Absolutely. You know how many subscriptions to Disney plus I had?
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:27.280]   How many? This is what's so gross is why they even let me do this. I had three.
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:33.040]   What? Three. How's it even possible?
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:40.080]   For the plane one, but I had, I had three, I had three, I had two HBOs. I had
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:45.440]   two Netflix. Oh no. Netflix keeps sending you a message saying, Hey, you need to update your
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:50.080]   payment information. But then I'm watching Netflix on my Apple TV. So I'm like,
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:57.120]   I'm clearly playing for paying for it somehow. It's so confusing and I have the perfect solution
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:02.000]   for you. There are credit cards now where you can set a spending limit. And so what I do is every
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.920]   year I just turn off the limit on that credit card. I just take it from unlimited or on cap
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:11.760]   down to zero. And I do this for business as well. And then all the subscriptions timeout,
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:15.680]   you know what I call that? What Jeff, Jeff does that from Jeff.
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:20.880]   But I mean, having somebody go in there and then you have a Jeff average,
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:24.240]   just know, but it's very simple. You only use one card for subscriptions and then you turn it off
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:27.840]   every year. Which ones you want to keep going. It works really well. And then you move the other
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:31.840]   ones to a new car. I don't even want to say how many thousands of dollars I was wasting on like
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:36.480]   duolingo. I was like, I'm paying for duolingo. And then I was paying for Italian. It's still
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:41.760]   terrible. Yeah, terrible. And then I had, I had like a case against them. No, then I had duolingo
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:47.120]   and I had Babel and I had Rosetta stone. So I'm like, my Italian is not improving because of any
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:51.840]   of these three apps, but I was paying them collectively like $400. I had a whoop subscription.
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:57.840]   I don't even have a loop. When Rick Thompson started manscaped, I was, I signed up for
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:02.720]   manscaped. I get all this ball deodorant. I've never used it once. We know, we know we sit
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:08.720]   next to you in poker. We know it's not working, bro. Just a message to manscaped. I have tried
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:15.040]   to cancel. I have called, I have emailed, I took it upon myself to try. It's impossible to cancel.
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:20.080]   They won't even let you reset your account so that you can get a link to cancel. It's so hard.
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:26.640]   And still your balls are terrible. Yeah, my balls are phenomenal. I've sat next to you in
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:32.480]   poker, man. Not real. Okay. Let's get into plastics and get off Chamath balls. I mean,
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:38.640]   how did we get here? Subscription services, subscription services. Yes. Streaming is at a
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:44.400]   crosswords, a crossroads apparently. So they're really trying to make that ball deodorant happen,
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:47.760]   aren't they? They're trying to make it happen. Well, they're trying to make fetch happen. Ball
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:51.680]   deodorant's not happening. I'm sorry. I mean, what are you supposed to do? Squat and swipe?
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:56.480]   How does that work? Is it a spray? Are you lifting and spraying?
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:00.640]   I mean, you gotta give him points for creativity, trying to create like a new thing, but yeah.
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:04.400]   I was trying to support my friend in signing up for a subscription service,
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:08.080]   and now I can't cancel. That's my problem. That's my predicament.
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:12.240]   Could you also take a shower and use soap? I don't know. Just putting it out there.
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:15.200]   What's going on down there, Chamath?
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:19.600]   Does it have to do with the product? I signed up because Rick was the venture investor that
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:22.640]   seeded it and started. I supported my friend. Yes.
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:25.840]   And now I want out and I cannot get out. You can't get out.
[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:30.880]   Every time I try to get out, they pull me back in. I'm just going to say when it comes to Manscaped,
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:36.240]   no, no testimonials, please. No testimonials. The worst part is like, you know, it comes to the house
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:40.640]   and... Oh, somebody opens your ball deodorant and puts it on your desk.
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:44.080]   They do. No, they put it right on the kitchen. Now the entire staff knows you have stinky balls.
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:47.680]   Well, that's what's so funny. They put it right on the kitchen counter. So as I walk through the
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:53.520]   bathroom, I grab it and I'm like, who's seen this bottle? Oh, there it is.
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:54.320]   What is it? There it is.
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:55.040]   Cold bottles.
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:20:04.640]   Oh my God. Oh man.
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:08.000]   So how do you apply it? Is it just a little dab will do you?
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.040]   No, I mean, you know, I just...
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:12.480]   It's not a spray. It's apparently an ointment, Sax. It's an ointment.
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:14.960]   This is far too much information.
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:16.400]   Nah, I'll try it.
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:17.760]   Don't you?
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:19.760]   I'll try it.
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:20.960]   It's coming to me on Christmas.
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:23.680]   You know what? I'm going to give you my subscription.
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:27.360]   It's got a drop-off ball deodorant.
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:30.800]   Why not?
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:34.640]   Use the promo code Chamath for 10% off your...
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:36.640]   Use the promo code Dictator. You get 10%.
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:41.120]   You can never cancel, but you can get...
[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:43.200]   It's D-I-C-K-tator.
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:50.960]   Dictator. Yeah, use the promo code Dictator. You get 10% off your ball deodorant at Manscaped.
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:54.640]   All right, Freeberg, it's your turn to shine. No, not ball deodorant.
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:21:00.000]   We wanted to talk about microplastics. A study came out. It's terrifying. We've known plastics
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.080]   have been terrible for years. Obviously, it's been turned into some sort of political discourse
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:07.920]   with straws and everything, but plastics are horrible. We shouldn't be using them,
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:12.640]   but this study confirms a bunch about drinking microplastics. Educate us on this study
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:17.040]   that everybody's talking about right now. Dr. Freedberg.
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:20.320]   I wouldn't start with the statement that plastics are awful.
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:27.200]   Plastics are polymers, which are long chains of what are called monomers. This is hydrogen,
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:31.440]   carbon, and oxygen that comes together to form these specific molecules.
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:37.120]   And then we can kind of bake them into crystal-like structures. And the reason the plastic
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:41.120]   industry took off is because it ended up being very cheap to create materials that we could
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:45.760]   turn into chairs, that we could turn into bottles to move stuff around. A lot of applications,
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:51.280]   everything from solar photovoltaics to our computers, to our laptops, to our phones,
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:57.040]   everything has some form of these polymers in it. The polymers that are commonly used for
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:04.800]   making bottles that we consume beverages out of are PET plastics. These PET plastics are made from
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:10.240]   a combination of natural gas and crude oil. So we kind of have a production process where we
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:16.000]   get the carbon, hydrogen and oxygen that's naturally found in natural gas and crude oil,
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.560]   convert it into these molecules that we turn into long chains, and we turn them into bottles,
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:27.040]   and fill those bottles and they end up being a lower carbon footprint than using glass about
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:34.800]   5x the carbon footprint to use glass instead of plastic and in making a bottle to store stuff and
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:41.360]   move liquids around 40% cheaper. And a lot of other kind of reasons why the industry and the
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:46.480]   world adopted plastics not just for bottle beverages, but for other applications. So in
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:50.800]   bottle beverages, because these are polymers, there are these long chains of little molecules
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:55.760]   that are stuck together, some of those chains break. And then some of those little chunks of
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:23:01.520]   those molecules end up floating around in the liquid that we're consuming. And what this study
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:06.960]   did that kind of highlighted a set of data that hadn't really been studied well before is they
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:12.640]   used a form of spectroscopy. So kind of a multi spectral light system shining light at different
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:17.920]   wavelengths on the liquid in a bottle in plastic bottle to figure out how many of these little
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:22.720]   plastic particles there were in the liquid. And in doing that, they found that there was on the order
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:30.640]   of 10,000 little plastic particles per liter of water or per liter of soda or drink or Gatorade
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:34.960]   or whatever beverages that you're drinking. The real question then is, well, how risky is that?
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:42.160]   So if you look at a lot of the health agency studies, the kind of well adopted and well
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:47.600]   researched efforts on is there toxicity associated with PT plastics on its own,
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:51.520]   they find that there's very little genotoxicity or no genotoxicity, meaning it doesn't doesn't
[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:57.200]   change your DNA. There's no carcinogen missing. It doesn't cause cancer. But there are other
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:02.240]   studies recently, that have shown different mechanisms by which these little tiny micro
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:06.720]   plastics might end up in yourself, because they absorb into your body, and they're small enough
[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:10.880]   that they can cross into barriers, they can get into your brain, they can get into your cells,
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:14.640]   when they're in your cells. There are other mechanistic studies that are done in a petri
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:18.720]   dish, as opposed to being studied in the body, where they've demonstrated that they could
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:23.040]   actually disrupt the function of organelles like mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum,
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:26.320]   so all these little things that operate in your cell, they can cause irritation,
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:31.760]   they can trigger chemicals to be produced that might cause allergies, that might cause inflammation,
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:37.840]   and so on and so forth. So while the general molecule of PT itself isn't known or shown in
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:42.880]   any way to cause cancer or to cause changes in your DNA, there are other mechanisms by which
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:47.120]   these little tiny plastics might be disrupting cellular function might be causing other health
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:52.880]   issues. And that's now going to open up a big area of research that that's going to be predicated,
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:58.080]   I think, on the fact that this study now shows that there are 1000s, hundreds of 1000s of little
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:02.560]   pieces of tiny plastic in these plastic bottles that we're drinking water, and soda and juice
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:08.880]   from that are getting into our body and into ourselves. 240,000 little pieces in the average
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:14.240]   one liter plastic bottle. It's a pretty scary statistic. When you hear that number enough to
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:20.480]   cross the blood brain barrier, right? And in rats and mice, they've shown that these little
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:24.960]   micro plastics can actually accumulate in the brain if they consume enough of them. Now, the
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:29.200]   reason this hasn't been well understood or studied in the past is we kind of look at the aggregate
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:32.880]   amount of plastic that's in a liquid. And it's like, oh, the amount is so small, it doesn't
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:38.480]   matter. But when you start to look at how small these little pieces of plastic are, and add them
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:43.520]   up the cumulative effect over time, that they can actually cross into cells cross the blood brain
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:47.760]   barrier, maybe you're not getting removed from the body. That's opening up a whole lot of research,
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:51.920]   because there's no easy way to just scan a body and say, is there plastic in it? How much plastic
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:55.920]   is there? Because there isn't a good chemical signature for it. And what these guys did is
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:00.880]   they use light to look in the liquid to find the plastics, which we can't easily do in the body
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:05.520]   today. So free burger, you're going to drink plastic bottle water anymore. I'm not. Okay,
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:11.120]   Jamal, I've already stopped this started for me about four months ago. My wife basically said
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:15.200]   we're getting rid of all plastic. And at first I really pushed back and I'm like, this is crazy.
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:20.800]   And she just kept talking to me about it and showing me all this data. And yeah, about a
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:27.440]   month ago, I would say I switched. So now use glass and a craft like this. Yeah, much better.
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:31.920]   We got rid of all of the plastic in our in our house in the gym, no more bottles.
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:35.760]   It's wasteful anyway. Like why not? You have beautiful filtered water at home, put it in a
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:41.200]   craft. Sure. But the scary thing, I mean, it's a little bit more inconvenient, I'll be honest with
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:48.400]   you. But it is very scary. And I think that it does alter the phenotype of the human body over
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:54.880]   time. And I think you'd have to be insane to bet against that. And I suspect when you look at the
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:27:00.080]   rates of depression and autism and Alzheimer's and dementia and autoimmune diseases, Crohn's
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:07.040]   rheumatoid arthritis, to think that all of these environmental factors have no impact, I think is,
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:12.160]   is taking a very scary bet. Here's what I do. I buy these glass bottles on Amazon.
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:16.800]   You know, two or three cases of them, I have the best water filter system at home.
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:21.920]   We fill them, we put them in the refrigerator, and we haven't bought plastic in years.
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:27.760]   So in years, in years, only because I care about the environment, because I'm a good person.
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:35.120]   Jason, I'll also say like that, that application is a pretty small, like, I think on the order,
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:41.440]   if I'm right, 80% of bottle beverages are drunk outside the home. So people are buying stuff at
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:46.720]   convenience stores at gas stations at markets, taking them with them to work. And that's how a
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:51.600]   lot of plastic bottles are can carry a container. Remember, I have us is such a small percentage of
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:56.240]   the global population, you go to Africa, you go to Brazil, you go to China, there isn't a great
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:28:00.400]   like people don't have these amenities that we have in our upper and middle class America,
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:05.600]   that plastic bottles have provided access to products that consumers around the world
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:09.760]   otherwise wouldn't be able to afford. So there's a reason they exist. But by the way, I also want
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:14.880]   to just be really clear, there isn't conclusive evidence or science that shows these plastic
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:19.600]   micro particles or nanoparticles are causing these health effects. There's certainly a lot
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:23.280]   of questions that it brings on. Well, what is the cumulative effect of these little things getting
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:27.040]   into cells? Do they get into cells? Why do they do when they're in there? Why would anybody bet
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:31.840]   that it's zero? Right? So that is the upside, right? Well, the upside is that people get to
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:36.400]   access cheap beverages on the street that otherwise, people that are living on $13,000 a year
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:43.680]   that can buy a, you know, a plastic soda for 25 cents. You can also buy a candle. Yeah, so that's
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:47.200]   that's definitely an alternative. They're a little more expensive. Generally plastic just became the
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:54.080]   cheapest container. Saks your thoughts. Sorry, guys, I stepped out to get a drink here. Don't
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:59.200]   miss anything. It would be better if you had put a straw in your water bottle.
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:05.200]   Now I understand your level of depression.
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:10.960]   Saks you just telling those arrow water bottles. Yeah, I missed something.
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:19.840]   Also, I use these beautiful contigo. So I think some people use yetis or other kind of things.
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:24.960]   And I actually carry them with me only because I try to like think about the environment,
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:28.960]   just the amount of plaques is being created. I don't know if you've seen this, but like you
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:34.080]   go to Whole Foods now or you go to any supermarket and you see this wall of salads.
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:41.760]   Freiburg like this is unconscionable. Like the we're literally giving people salad in a giant
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:47.360]   plastic box. Yeah, let me just say a couple things about this because there's this conception that
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:53.120]   this is just awful, awful, awful, but plastics there, there is a degradation of these PTS when
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:58.400]   they're exposed to sunlight. There is a recycling system that many of much of this material ends up
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:03.280]   in much of it. Yeah, I mean, I don't think that's actually correct. Not a lot. But what would the
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:07.920]   alternative be? Right? So the alternative is you put in a glass thing and you charge people $15
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:12.560]   for a couple pieces of lettuce. The reason the reason plastic the plastic industry emerged is
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:17.680]   because it provided a low cost way to transport materials. And that we're all very wealthy. So we
[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:22.080]   have to just step outside of our bubble for a second and recognize that most people, you know,
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:26.080]   the dollar difference is a huge difference for most consumers, they're not going to make that
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:31.360]   dollar leap. So you know, the fact that plastics emerged is to support a consumer market that's
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:35.120]   grown up all over the world. Yeah, but how does this make sense? Look at these bananas, just as
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:41.440]   an example, to give people an idea bananas already come with a case called crazy. And they're
[01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:47.600]   literally wrapping bananas in plastic now. And you know, I think this is where regulation makes
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:51.280]   sense. No, there must be a gas in here or something because they're trying to keep the
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:55.680]   bananas from going bad. That's why I want to shout out like this is where I think regulations
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:31:01.040]   actually do work France, Spain, a lot of countries now are just saying you know what for fruits,
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:06.000]   vegetables like yeah, don't put them in plastic, please. We're not going to allow you to do that.
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:10.480]   And I think I'm not pro plastic, by the way, I'm not drinking plastic from plastic bottles.
[01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:14.880]   But we have to be cognizant of where this industry emerged from what the science says about it. Like
[01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:18.960]   I don't want to just be flipping about it. What is doing to all plastics? What is doing in the
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:24.640]   oceans? freeberg is unconscionable. Like this, this is not a do gooder thing. It's just awful.
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:32.080]   There's no reason that we need to tell you. I'll give you some good optimism around this.
[01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:36.480]   There's a lot of efforts right now to develop microbes that can actually biodegrade these
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:42.800]   pt plastics. So there's, so we're engineering these microbes that will produce enzymes,
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:48.480]   these little bacteria that will produce enzymes, those enzymes can then be made in the plastic
[01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:53.680]   itself. So then the plastic will biodegrade within a year after you use it. So there's a lot of this
[01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:57.920]   kind of effort on how do you make naturally biodegrading plastics using bio sources and
[01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:02.800]   biological molecules as part of the production process. And a lot of big plastic packaging
[01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:06.960]   companies and industrial biotech companies are investing in this area. This is where
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:13.200]   collectivism can do good. You know, like, if we actually, as a society say we want to do sustainable
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:16.880]   packaging, like because of the tragedy of the commons, like you're saying freeberg because
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:22.880]   it's cheaper capitalism, like there's no floor here, you know, to stop people from doing this
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:27.360]   and stop from using plastics unnecessarily like wrapping bananas, etc. All right, listen,
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:34.080]   it's been an amazing episode of the all in podcast for the dictator. Wish me luck today,
[01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:38.880]   boys. Wish me luck. Use the promo code Dick will be following the live stream on the chat following
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:43.760]   the live stream. Use promo code deck to get 20% off your ball deodorant. What do you guys think
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:50.240]   about actually like running some poker tournaments through the year called all in 100% That would be
[01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:57.040]   super fun, though. 100% I think we could replace the WSOP pretty quick. I mean, it'd be pretty
[01:32:57.040 --> 01:33:02.240]   cool. So I'm not kidding. We have still help me with on our school. I think Jason's right.
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:06.080]   I'm not just tell me if I think you can get all the pros because I think the problem is like those
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:12.560]   championships have been so watered down, right? There's 52 of them, just in Vegas in June and
[01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:18.080]   July. And then now you have like the circuit rings so that there's bracelets and rings. And
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:24.720]   then there's the European one. And there's this one, there's the Bahamas. You can't have I think
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:30.240]   in order to be a world champion. Can you really have like 150 winners a year?
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:34.000]   Sacks, are you bored with Holden? Well, I'll play with you guys. But yeah,
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.080]   I'm kind of bored with it. Yeah, I played a tournament yesterday. Big Oh,
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:43.120]   37 players. I came in first. I don't know if you play where did you play? I had a speaking
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:47.200]   gig yesterday in LA after the speaking gig. I was going to the airport. I had a little time.
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:53.840]   And I just stopped by Hollywood Park where I wanted to see the new one.
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:57.200]   You're the best. And I don't know, there's nothing more boring.
[01:33:57.200 --> 01:33:58.320]   Big Oh is a lot of fun.
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:00.160]   Playing in a tournament with people you don't know.
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:02.320]   Oh, it was great. It was great. There was like a fight.
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:05.920]   The tournament's gone forever. I mean, I did the WSOP a couple of times. And you know,
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:10.800]   I think I lasted like three days. It's a long time to be playing poker at tables with people.
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:15.120]   This was one day, Chamath, I got to the final table. And they wanted to chop and I was the
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:19.120]   short stack. I was like, well, you know, my flights in a couple hours, I'd rather not chop.
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:24.400]   And this woman, I got in a fight at the casino almost, this woman was wearing a mask. And she
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:34.400]   goes, this mother ever won't chop. And I said, Ma'am, it's my option to not shop.
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:35.520]   Madam, Madam.
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:40.800]   I said, Madam, Madam, whatever, say them. And she went crazy. And the floor came over,
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:45.360]   said, Ma'am, you have to sit down. She called me a mother effort twice to my face.
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:47.280]   You went on to win?
[01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:50.640]   I was the short stack and I went on to win the tournament. I kid you not.
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:51.360]   How much did you win?
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:52.320]   1400 bucks.
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:57.440]   What was the hourly rate on that? You make like $14 an hour.
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:01.520]   It was a hundred dollar buy in. So yeah, it was 200 bucks an hour, but here's what happened.
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:02.720]   So I had this guy massively-
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:04.400]   You played for seven hours?
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:09.200]   Six hours, maybe. It was awesome. It was great. I had the time of my life. It was the first time
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:13.440]   I played in a tournament for like, since we played the one drop that time. I haven't played
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:17.040]   in a tournament since then. It was so much fun.
[01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:21.440]   Jason goes from playing the hundred K buy into the hundred dollar buy.
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:25.840]   I had a time of my life because I've never played big O before. It's where you have five cards and
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:28.080]   it was high low. It was so dynamic and fun.
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:29.280]   Oh yeah, yeah. Big O, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:34.320]   Big O is so fun. You have five pull cards and it's high low. So I was like, I'll learn big O.
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:39.440]   I've never, I've literally not played one orbit of big O. I won the tournament. It was awesome.
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:45.760]   And so then it's me and this one guy and I've got him like three to one or whatever.
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:49.760]   And he's like, "Listen, I got to go. Please. I got my kids." I was like, "No problem. I'll
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:54.480]   chop it with you if we take 400 off the top for the dealers." The dealer cried. She was like,
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:59.760]   "What?" And I was like, "Yeah, I'll chop it with you evenly." And so I won and I just
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:00.960]   chopped it up and gave a big tip.
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:04.000]   What did you, did you get like a certificate or like-
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000]   I think they put you on the website or something like that.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.200]   Let's look it up.
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:10.880]   Yeah. It's on the Poker Classic website that I, or I don't know if it's called the Poker
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:15.120]   Classic, whatever it is. But my point is we would have a great tournament. We do each of the games.
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:19.280]   Each of us gets a free roll into the game and then everybody else buys in. I like it.
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:21.360]   Sax, you like PLO or you just like Chess now?
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:26.480]   No, I like Hold'em, but I'm just saying I wouldn't play with a bunch of strangers.
[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:29.360]   I like playing with friends, but-
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:30.480]   To goof off and have fun.
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:33.840]   Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like sitting, the problem with tournaments-
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:38.000]   You'll RSVP to my game to show up at six and show up at 830.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.200]   And then listen to yourself on the pod and then leave.
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:43.840]   Yeah. He's editing the pod at the table.
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:45.840]   There's a lot of things you can do while at a poker game.
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:49.520]   You can watch your podcast. You can edit your podcast.
[01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:56.080]   For the Sultan of Science, the King of Beep, David Freeburg, and yeah, definitely the Rain
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:59.600]   Man himself. We're live from Davos. We'll see you next year. Bye-bye.

[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:23.360]   It's like 10 bucks a month. It's just 10 bucks a month. I'll give you the money.
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:25.600]   I just don't want to get- I want to be able to cancel.

[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:42.720]   and they've just gone crazy with it. Love you, Weston.

[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:51.840]   Besties are gone.
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:55.520]   That is my dog taking a notice in your driveway.
[01:37:56.480 --> 01:37:59.280]   Wait, no, no. Oh, man.
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:02.880]   My avatar will meet me at the place. We should all just get a room and just have
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:06.720]   one big huge orgy because they're all just useless. It's like this sexual tension that
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:11.120]   they just need to release somehow. What the beep?
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:12.160]   What the beep? What the beep?
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:15.360]   What the beep? We need to get merch.
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:17.600]   Besties are gone. I'm going all in.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000]   I'm going all in
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000]   You
