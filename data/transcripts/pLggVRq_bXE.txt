[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.680]   finance concepts.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.240]   Tonight, Christine will be discussing and presenting investing and planning at every
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.240]   life stage.
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.280]   Christine, thanks for joining us.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.460]   Thank you so much, Bob.
[00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.720]   It's great to be here tonight.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.080]   I have enjoyed being part of Bogle Heads for longer than I care to admit.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.000]   It's been a long time, but I'm so honored to have both Taylor and Mel in attendance
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.980]   tonight as well as a really nice group of Bogle Heads.
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.540]   I'll be talking about investing across the life stages, starting with the '20s, moving
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:09.000]   on to the '30s, '40s, and getting into investing later in life, investing in decumulation mode,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.520]   which is really a key focus of my work on Morningstar.com.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.580]   Bob mentioned that I am part of the John C. Bogle Center for Financial Literacy, and we
[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:28.040]   are planning to host a conference next fall, fall of 2022, fingers crossed, that that will
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.160]   happen and that we'll all be able to gather because that is always such a highlight of
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.440]   my year.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.800]   In the interim, it's really fantastic that all of these chapters are up and running and
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.400]   having regular events and getting people together and keeping the education flowing, even though
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.440]   we aren't having the live conference this year.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.620]   It's terrific to take part in these events.
[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.100]   I had been talking to Gail about wanting to do some presentations for some of these groups
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.580]   because I felt like I was doing presentations for everyone else, and one of the groups that
[00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.020]   I respected most hadn't yet invited me.
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.740]   So I insinuated myself into the lineup, and I hope you can all come away with some good
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.620]   food for thought.
[00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.620]   And I will make the presentation available to all of you afterwards, so you won't have
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.020]   to take notes if you would prefer not to.
[00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.460]   I'll make it available and you can just download the PDF at your leisure.
[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:33.220]   So I'm going to go ahead and share my screen here and start with the presentation from
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.780]   the beginning.
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.660]   This is a presentation that I've created actually for some of our internal groups at Morningstar.
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:49.020]   So the initial focus was a little bit more on some of the younger investors, but I amplified
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.540]   the section on mid-career accumulators, knowing that one of the target audiences for tonight's
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.080]   event is that mid-career accumulator group.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.500]   So I'll hit that section pretty hard, but I'll also talk about some financial planning
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.980]   and portfolio planning ideas for people who are approaching retirement, as well as for
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.620]   people who are in active decumulation mode.
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.780]   So some key principles that I think cut across all of these life stages.
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:26.400]   My personal philosophy is that life is complicated, so whatever you can do for your financial
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.540]   life to simplify, I think is a step in the right direction.
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:37.220]   You should try to have the least complicated, most uncluttered financial life that you possibly
[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:43.460]   can, and really keep that editing process up as you go along.
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.420]   And things necessarily become a little bit more complicated as we marry, and perhaps
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.820]   our spouse has assets, and then we all have assets that fall into different tax silos,
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.020]   so you can only streamline so much.
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.220]   But I love the idea of sort of ruthlessly editing as you go along, so that you're not
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.540]   carrying around a more complicated portfolio or a more complicated financial plan that
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.660]   you need.
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.340]   Another key part of the presentation I think you'll pick up on is just that multitasking
[00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.260]   is a way of life, no matter your life stage.
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.380]   So when you're just starting out, you're inevitably trying to save for retirement, but you're
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.620]   also probably trying to hit some shorter and intermediate-term goals, whether buying that
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:34.300]   first home or paying for a wedding or paying for graduate school or whatever it might be.
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.580]   The multitasking starts there, and it never really lets up.
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:45.300]   So once you're married, and perhaps if you have a family, college funding certainly gets
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:51.700]   on your radar alongside retirement planning, and the multitasking just continues throughout
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.020]   our investment life.
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.420]   So I think the sooner you can get comfortable with knowing that it's not just allocating
[00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:04.900]   your assets to a single account type, but sort of allocating across multiple account
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.700]   types, I think the more comfortable you'll be.
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.780]   One key principle that I like to keep in mind when you are doing multitasking is this idea
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.480]   of letting your return on investment guide the way.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.820]   So that can help you determine where to allocate your capital.
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.460]   So a really easy example would be the person who has high interest rate credit card debt.
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.460]   Well, guess what?
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:32.780]   You're not going to out-earn that by investing in the market, and that's a guaranteed high
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.060]   return that you earn by paying that stuff down.
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.540]   So that's an easy one.
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.780]   A lot of other decisions that we might make are kind of on the bubble, where you might
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:48.620]   have, say, a 3% mortgage, and you also have some short-term bonds or intermediate-term
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.980]   bonds in your portfolio that might, in a good year, be in that general vicinity.
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:07:00.420]   So you might do sort of a balanced allocation, prepay some of your mortgage and invest some
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.740]   in the bond fund if you've determined that you need more conservative investments in
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.220]   your portfolio.
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:11.380]   But I think kind of thinking about the potential return on investment can be an instructive
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:17.100]   way to determine how you make those capital allocation choices, so where you allocate
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.700]   your dollars.
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.860]   And then another key point I would make is that even though at Morningstar we have a
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:28.940]   lot of resources about investing, about setting your asset allocation, and certainly about
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.820]   selecting specific investments, I think it's really important to remember just how many
[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:40.380]   levers that we have as investors and as people in charge of our own financial plans.
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:45.580]   So certainly, investment selection and asset allocation are up there, but there's also
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.140]   tax management.
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.020]   There's also insurance planning.
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.780]   There's also estate planning.
[00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:55.260]   There are also capital allocation choices, as I was talking about, so deciding whether
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.780]   to retire debt or invest in the market.
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.680]   That's an example of a capital allocation choice.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:08.580]   So I think it really is a healthy thing to focus on those levers that we can control
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:13.740]   and sort of disregard the things that we have absolutely no control over, so the direction
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:17.900]   of the market, the direction of the economy, the rate of inflation.
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:22.260]   Those are things that, as investors, we have no power to influence or control.
[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:27.340]   So I would argue that a lot of what you see on financial news channels just isn't a productive
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:32.340]   use of your time because those things, even though they all influence the world that we
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:37.420]   live in, they just do not fall within our sphere of control.
[00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:43.500]   So this is a pyramid that I came up with to illustrate, I think, sort of this hierarchy
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:49.620]   of priorities for investors, and the base of the pyramid is what I think is the most
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:55.100]   important part of all of this, which is having some sort of a goal that you're saving toward
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.620]   and quantifying that goal.
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.460]   And then moving up, certainly your savings rate will be more influential than almost
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.920]   anything else that you'll do within your plan.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:11.060]   And you can see at the tippy top of the pyramid, there we've got investment selection, and
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:16.260]   it's certainly important, it matters a lot whether you select a very inexpensive Vanguard
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:23.180]   fund or a fund that charges a percent and a half, but it's the other stuff, the items
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:29.700]   on the bottom of the pyramid that, in my opinion, are the most impactful in terms of influencing
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.780]   whether you achieve your goals or not.
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:37.140]   So I like to keep this in mind when kind of thinking about how to allocate my time, not
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:42.740]   just in my own financial life, but in the things that I work on on Morningstar.com.
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:47.060]   And you can see that I have behavior sort of in the middle of the pyramid.
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:52.140]   That's another factor that I think is super important as we go about our financial lives
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:59.540]   and our investment lives, just having a disposition where we're willing to sit in our seats, even
[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:04.060]   when the going gets tough, that can just be incredibly important in terms of helping us
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.900]   reach our financial goals.
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:11.620]   So just kind of a hierarchy that you can think of as you're sort of allocating your time
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.820]   and deciding what to spend that time on.
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:20.100]   This is another slide that I think falls into the realm of kind of an overarching principle
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:24.060]   that cuts across all of the life stages.
[00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:30.180]   So this is the interrelationship between human capital and your financial capital.
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:34.540]   So human capital refers to your personal earnings power.
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:39.340]   So when we're young and just starting out, we're typically long on human capital because
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:47.660]   we, especially if we have some higher education behind us, we have a long life of earnings,
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:52.500]   potentially even earnings that grow higher and higher as the years go by.
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.400]   And we're oftentimes short on financial capital at that life stage.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.700]   We may even be negative on the financial capital if we've taken out debt to pay for higher
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.440]   education.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:09.700]   But as we advance in our careers and as we get closer to retirement, our earnings power
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:14.960]   ebbs away, our human capital ebbs away, and that's what our investment is there for.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:20.360]   It's there to pick up the slack for the period when we no longer have earnings power.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.620]   We wish not to continue working.
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:28.620]   And so a related concept is the asset allocation of the portfolio.
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:35.200]   So as you're just starting out, because you're really long on that human capital, it makes
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:40.220]   sense that your financial capital could be invested very, very aggressively because you're
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:45.940]   not going to need that, chances are, until later in your life.
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:51.940]   So hopefully you will just invest aggressively, have a stock-heavy portfolio, and let that
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:57.660]   stock-heavy portfolio continue to ride until you get closer to retirement and you may want
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:04.360]   to take some risk off the table in that portion of the portfolio before you begin to draw
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.420]   upon it in retirement.
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:11.700]   So this is something that we all know as investors, but I think it's just kind of an elegant illustration
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:17.980]   of how, at some point in our lives, human capital declines, but our financial capital
[00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:24.160]   picks up the slack, and we need to de-risk that financial capital as we get closer to
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.680]   needing our money.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:30.960]   We need to de-risk our financial capital as we get close to any goal that we might have,
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:35.000]   whether it's retirement or something shorter term in our lives.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   We need to take risk off the table.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.040]   So young investors, what are the key things that they should focus on?
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:48.160]   Well, one at the top of the list would be making those investments in human capital.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:54.240]   So this is just a tremendous life stage to make additional investments in higher education.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:59.040]   I remember this is the life stage when my husband went through the MBA program, and
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:05.440]   I remember literally painting a closet with my headphones on listening to a Chicago Bulls
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.700]   game because I couldn't disturb him.
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:13.880]   But it was such a great life stage for him to have done that degree because we were in
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:20.400]   a position in our lives where our careers were demanding, but not yet seriously demanding.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.360]   Our parents were well.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:29.440]   We just didn't have that much going on in our lives, and it wasn't an easy lift, but
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:34.400]   it was a really great life stage for him to have gone through that.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:39.560]   And he was able to benefit from having that advanced degree throughout his career.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:46.240]   So at this life stage, I just think it's a tremendous period to think about investments
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.840]   in additional higher education.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:55.560]   It's a really great time to embellish human capital, and if it entails taking on debt
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:00.920]   to pay for that additional education, this is the right time to do it.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:07.440]   We all know that many young adults do come into their careers with debt, so it's absolutely
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:14.620]   incumbent upon them to figure out how to pay down that student loan debt and how to juggle
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:21.680]   that debt alongside getting started on a savings program for retirement, for short and intermediate
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:26.080]   term goals, as well as for setting aside an emergency fund.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.960]   And that's another key thing that should be on the punch list for people who are just
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:35.380]   getting going in their financial lives, building that emergency fund.
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:41.160]   Also on the list would be kickstarting the retirement plan and for people who are starting
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.500]   to have children college savings for them.
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.200]   So let's just take a closer look at some of these items.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.800]   Closer look at emergency funding.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:55.440]   I think all good bogleheads understand the importance of having that baseline in liquid
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.440]   reserves.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:00.980]   I remember when I went through the certified financial planner program, three to six months
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:06.160]   worth of liquid reserves was the baseline, and I think that's a good starting point.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:11.200]   I think oftentimes that can be kind of a daunting figure for people just starting out, but the
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.500]   thing I always remind them or try to remind them is it's not actually what you're spending
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.800]   currently as you're employed.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.200]   You're really thinking about what you could get by on in a pinch.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.700]   And the nice thing is that for young adults just kind of starting their investment lives,
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:33.360]   they're often pretty flexible in terms of their lives in that they could move home if
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.080]   they needed to, or they could get a roommate.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:41.800]   Those are things that you might be less comfortable with as you advance in your investing life
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:46.000]   and advance in the rest of your life, but when you're just starting out, you might have
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.820]   some flexibility in terms of adjusting your expenses.
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:53.500]   Building up a credit history is super important at this life stage.
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:59.120]   And I also like to talk about as you're thinking about that emergency fund, I think you can
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.060]   be a little bit creative about it.
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:05.980]   So ideally you would amass that three to six months worth of liquid reserves in just a
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:12.220]   taxable sort of brokerage account or some sort of high yield savings account separate
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.380]   from your retirement accounts.
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:19.420]   But I think for people who are truly constrained in terms of their capital allocations, one
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:26.200]   idea might be to use a Roth IRA as sort of an emergency fund with training wheels.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:31.500]   So ideally you would put the money in a Roth IRA, you'd invest it in long-term assets and
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.060]   you'd never touch it.
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:37.740]   But I think while you're sort of getting the plan off the ground, it's worth potentially
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:46.420]   using the Roth IRA as a multitasking emergency fund/long-term retirement savings vehicle.
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:52.060]   And the idea is that you can withdraw your contributions to that Roth IRA at any time
[00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:56.060]   and for any reason without owing any taxes or penalties.
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:01.100]   So I think it's a nice starter vehicle for people who are just getting their plans off
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.860]   the ground.
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:09.380]   So in terms of kick-starting retirement funding, I would urge people just getting started in
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:15.420]   their plans to kind of think about the following hierarchy when deciding which account types
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.620]   to fund.
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:23.420]   So assuming they have sort of a 401(k) match or a 403(b) match in place, I would invest
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:29.900]   at least enough to earn those matching funds in that company retirement plan.
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:36.620]   Then I would probably move on to a Roth IRA where you can get away with no additional
[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:42.820]   layers of fees and you can also populate that IRA with whatever funds that you might choose.
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:47.380]   You could use nice low-cost Vanguard index funds or ETFs.
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:52.500]   And then assuming that you still have money, additional money to invest for retirement,
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:57.760]   then I would go back to the 401(k) and make additional contributions.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:02.600]   And that's assuming that the 401(k) is at least somewhat decent.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:09.820]   If it's truly horrible, you may be inclined to invest in a nonretirement account and a
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:12.060]   taxable brokerage account.
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:16.300]   But I think there's a lot to be said for those automated payroll deductions that you get
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:24.660]   with a 401(k) plan and with that ability to either contribute dollars on a pre-tax basis
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:31.300]   if you're making traditional 401(k) contributions or contribute Roth dollars and be able to
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:37.060]   pull the money out tax-free as you could with a Roth 401(k).
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:42.700]   So in terms of whether to do Roth or traditional, the key thing you want to think about is whether
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:49.660]   you expect that your tax bracket now will be higher or lower than it will be at the
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.140]   time of retirement.
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:57.820]   So I often speak to our new employees at Morningstar who are bright and shiny, 20-somethings.
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:02.660]   And to them, I say, a Roth probably makes pretty good sense for you.
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:06.620]   You probably are early in your careers.
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:12.060]   We might be paying you a decent salary, but chances are you will grow that salary over
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:13.060]   time.
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:16.020]   This is a good time to think about making Roth contributions.
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.640]   So pay the tax on the contribution.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:23.820]   In exchange, you'll be able to take tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.200]   It's not always black and white.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:32.380]   There may be situations where the tax break, when they make the contribution, will be more
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.620]   valuable to them than at the time of withdrawal.
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:40.340]   So this would be the case for people later in life who really haven't saved much, who
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:46.080]   are kind of playing catch-up on their plans, but earn a good salary at this point in time.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:53.380]   For them, making pre-tax contributions may, in fact, be the better bet than making traditional
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:57.140]   contributions, or than making Roth contributions.
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:01.740]   And if you're not sure, and a lot of people in their 20s and 30s might say, "How on earth
[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.660]   can I begin to forecast my tax bracket in retirement?"
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.900]   Well, you can split the difference.
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:14.300]   You can invest a portion of your assets in traditional and a portion in the Roth.
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.380]   And many 401(k) plans will let you make that split.
[00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:25.220]   I just wanted to have a little sidebar here on something super topical, which is the proposal
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:31.540]   that's been advanced by the House Ways and Means Committee that would have some implications
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:38.740]   for retirement funding, one of which is what's called the Backdoor Roth IRA and the Mega
[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.620]   Backdoor Roth IRA.
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:46.160]   I'm guessing some of you in attendance have been using this strategy, but the basic idea
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:52.700]   is that if you are shut out of making direct Roth IRA contributions because you're over
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:59.860]   the income thresholds for those Roth IRA contributions, since 2010, what people have been able to
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:07.740]   do is make a contribution to a traditional IRA with after-tax dollars and then convert
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:14.180]   those funds to a Roth even shortly after the initial contribution.
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:19.240]   And so even though you're shut out of the direct Roth IRA contribution, you're able
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.220]   to get in the backdoor using this maneuver.
[00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:27.220]   My husband and I have been doing this maneuver for the past several years, and it's a great
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:34.340]   strategy, but it is a backdoor, so it's probably not surprising that Congress is taking a look
[00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:41.260]   at it, because if executed correctly, you really pay very little in taxes in order to
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:46.920]   enlarge the assets that you have that are in the Roth column.
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:51.700]   And so I think that's why Congress has been looking at this loophole, and that's why the
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:58.820]   House Ways and Means Committee proposal did target these after-tax contributions.
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:06.180]   So if, indeed, this tax package is passed by Congress, and I have heard that this particular
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:12.060]   part of the proposal looks likely to see passage by Congress, in part because it doesn't really
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:19.560]   raise revenue, this strategy, as it's currently in effect, that would effectively end the
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:28.120]   conversion of these after-tax dollars to Roth starting in 2022, so starting next year.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:34.300]   So if you've been taking advantage of this, I think the key message is that you can still
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:40.980]   make the contributions for the 2021 tax year, but you would just need to have those funds
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:47.220]   converted before the end of this year in order to have that be a valid maneuver.
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:55.380]   I want to just touch real quickly on the mega backdoor Roth IRA, and what that is is some
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:03.020]   people have available to them the opportunity to make after-tax 401(k) contributions.
[00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:10.220]   So the idea there is oftentimes you can make these after-tax 401(k) contributions.
[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:16.740]   Oftentimes participants can convert to Roth inside the 401(k) plan, so the money can stay
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:26.420]   in the Roth 401(k), and at retirement, that Roth 401(k) in turn could be rolled over to
[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:28.140]   a Roth IRA.
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:32.820]   The reason that this is such an interesting strategy, especially for fairly high-income
[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:39.980]   people, is that you can get quite a lot altogether into a 401(k) each year.
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:45.860]   So the contribution limits are over $50,000 in terms of total contributions, so this would
[00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:52.900]   be your Roth or traditional 401(k) contributions, your employer-matching contributions, and
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.980]   then these contributions of after-tax dollars.
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:24:01.460]   As long as you're not over that $50,000-plus threshold, you could get that much money into
[00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.180]   the 401(k).
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:09.400]   High-income investors have been loving this, but I think that this after-tax provision
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:14.140]   would put the kibosh on starting in 2022.
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.140]   So watch this space.
[00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.740]   We'll be writing about this.
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:23.420]   I'm sure the bogleheads.org will have plenty of information about this, but this is something
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:29.340]   to keep an eye on, especially if you have amounts of after-tax dollars either in your
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:34.260]   401(k) or in your IRA that haven't yet been converted.
[00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:38.860]   Think about getting them converted before the end of 2021, because you may not be able
[00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.740]   to do so after that.
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:45.580]   So in terms of asset allocation for folks at this life stage, and again we're talking
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:50.780]   about people in their 20s and 30s, I think being globally diversified makes a ton of
[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:52.780]   sense at this life stage.
[00:24:52.780 --> 00:25:00.140]   Here I think you can either use a target date fund or use a very simple bogleheads mix.
[00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:05.380]   Taylor's three-fund portfolio I think is another great strategy, but I think you'd want to
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:13.940]   have the preponderance of assets, assuming you're saving for retirement in a stock portfolio
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:19.820]   and a globally diversified equity portfolio, using target date funds as a guide, using
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:26.660]   2060 target date funds as a guide, you can see that they have 90% of their asset allocations
[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:30.300]   in equities, another 10% in bonds.
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:34.660]   The bonds are there mainly to be a little bit of a shock absorber, and really when we
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:40.660]   look at historical performance, we see that you can add a little bit of fixed income exposure
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:46.980]   to take risk down just a little bit without really reducing your return potential.
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:53.300]   So certainly for people who are just starting out who have short and intermediate term goals,
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:57.780]   I think it's important to remember that you'd want to allocate those investments much more
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:02.140]   conservatively than you would your longer term assets.
[00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:08.140]   I think oftentimes at this life stage, people get mixed up about risk capacity, which is
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:14.220]   how much risk you can take given your proximity to spending, and risk tolerance, which is
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.900]   how you feel about investing in the market.
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:22.780]   A lot of young investors feel positively risk tolerant, they probably haven't lived through
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:23.780]   a bear market.
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:28.940]   Well, they did in March of 2020, but it was really almost over before it began.
[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:34.420]   So many of them feel incredibly risk tolerant and think that well, if I'm saving for a home
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.900]   that I hope to buy in three years, I might as well be all equity.
[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.260]   Well, you probably shouldn't.
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:45.020]   So even though your risk tolerance for that long term portfolio calls for a very high
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:49.980]   equity weighting, for your shorter term goals, you need to be more conservative.
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:56.300]   College savings is often top of mind for people who are starting to have families and it definitely
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:03.380]   makes sense to get started on the college savings plan while your children are young.
[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:12.460]   Morningstar provides an annual report on 529 plans with the best and worst 529 plans.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:18.500]   In the most recent data run, Illinois, Michigan, and Utah had the highest rated plans.
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:24.100]   But the good news is that 529 plans, I like to think because of the scrutiny that Morningstar
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:29.460]   and some other services, especially Morningstar, I would say have been shining on 529s.
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:33.780]   We've seen them get a lot better over the years.
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:37.820]   So it's unusual to see a truly bad plan.
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:42.300]   So it often makes sense to start with your home state's plan, see if you can't earn a
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:46.680]   tax break before looking at other states' plans.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:51.500]   But we have a nice college savings center on Morningstar.com that you can use to help
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.580]   navigate the best 529 plans.
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:28:01.560]   And I think it's also important to help family members who are interested in helping your
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:06.620]   kids, help them be aware of how they can contribute to the cause.
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:13.100]   So perhaps instead of writing a check, they can contribute to the 529 or they can write
[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.060]   you a check and you can contribute to the 529.
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:20.260]   However you want to do it, I think it's really helpful to know that college savings is a
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:26.620]   goal for your family and that you want and would welcome any help that anyone feels like
[00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:31.120]   giving even if it's a smaller check of 20 or $25.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:36.220]   If you're starting young, it can really make a difference.
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:40.740]   Additional college savings vehicles, I won't spend much time on these, except it's important
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:46.020]   to be aware that there is a little bit of an interplay with financial aid, especially
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:51.880]   as college approaches, and especially with respect to certain types of these vehicles.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:57.340]   So the UGMA, UTMA accounts, for example, they're certainly quite flexible.
[00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:02.420]   You can put almost anything inside of a UGMA, UTMA account.
[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:05.620]   They're sometimes called a kiddie trust account.
[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:11.300]   A couple of big drawbacks are that they do tend to work against students from the standpoint
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.020]   of financial aid.
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:18.320]   And the other key thing to know is that the assets do become the possession of the child
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.940]   once the child reaches the age of majority.
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:26.300]   And that will depend on the specific age of majority will depend on the state in which
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:27.620]   you live.
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:33.160]   But if you're not perfectly comfortable with that idea of your child having control over
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:37.300]   those assets, you could A, potentially not tell them, which I've known parents who have
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.940]   done that, or just use another vehicle.
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:44.700]   If you definitely want to earmark funds for college funding, I think a 529 would tend
[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.060]   to be the best mousetrap.
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:51.180]   I wanted to recommend a book here, and I know Ron Lieber was kind enough to take part in
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:56.220]   one of our Bogleheads Saturday chats with Rick Ferry.
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:30:01.340]   Ron has written an absolutely superb book about paying for college, the price you pay
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:02.820]   for college.
[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:10.020]   It really almost reads like a thriller, because it's just interesting to read about the psychological
[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:14.140]   games that schools play in terms of doling out financial aid.
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:19.740]   I consider it a must-read for anyone with college on the horizon, or even if you're
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:26.740]   interested in helping a grandchild or a niece or nephew pay for college, I would read the
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:30.980]   book, because it's just incredibly illuminating, one of the best financial books I've read
[00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:33.860]   over the past year.
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:39.380]   At a minimum, for people who are just starting out, you do need some basic estate planning
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:40.740]   work done.
[00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:45.660]   If you have minor children, by all means, get the guardianships set up.
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:49.660]   Be thoughtful about who you appoint as guardians.
[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:52.320]   Don't necessarily go with the sentimental choice.
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:58.220]   Go with the real choice in terms of who you would really want to entrust with raising
[00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:01.980]   your child in the unlikely event that that needed to happen.
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:08.180]   You also need to have powers of attorney set up for financial and healthcare matters.
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:13.500]   A will is a good estate planning mechanism, even when you're just starting out.
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:21.020]   A living will, specifying your views on life-extending care is also important.
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.020]   Beneficiary designations.
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:27.660]   I think people sometimes don't realize just how important an estate planning mechanism,
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:32.900]   beneficiary designations are, but if you were to die, beneficiary designations actually
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:39.340]   override what you might have set out in your will and in other estate planning documents,
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.180]   even trust documents.
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:45.220]   I sometimes shake my head when people go to the trouble of setting up these complicated
[00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:52.960]   estate planning documents and pay attorneys, and do not take that next step of properly
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:57.580]   setting their beneficiary designations and revisiting beneficiary designations on an
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:58.580]   ongoing basis.
[00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:03.300]   I put that on my annual to-do list of something to check up on.
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:08.620]   Sometimes if your employer, for example, has changed providers, those beneficiary designations
[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:13.780]   might not port over automatically, so it's important to check up on them.
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:18.260]   And then also parents of minor children, life insurance is also important.
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:24.220]   If you have anyone whose well-being is riding on your ability to earn a salary, it's important
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.220]   to have life insurance.
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:31.940]   I tend to be in the buy term and invest a difference camp, rather than looking at any
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.900]   sort of permanent policy.
[00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:39.540]   Moving on to mid-career accumulators, I'll just hit the highlights real quickly before
[00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:43.100]   we get into some specific aspects of this.
[00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:48.420]   So here, if you're hitting your stride in terms of your earnings potential, you should
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:54.260]   also be hitting your stride in terms of your retirement funding contributions, so maximizing
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:57.500]   your contributions to tax-sheltered accounts.
[00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:03.940]   Higher earners should also be investing additional amounts in taxable accounts.
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:10.020]   In terms of the asset allocation of the portfolio, I think a long-term biased portfolio should
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:15.600]   still have a globally diversified equity-heavy emphasis.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:21.140]   Saving for college is on the radar of many people at this life stage, so continuing to
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:24.100]   fund those college accounts.
[00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:28.700]   I think people at this life stage are often in that sandwich generation, though, where
[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:37.080]   they are trying to help their kids and raising young kids or young adult kids, but they're
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:44.660]   also in the position of helping mom and dad navigate, where parents might need more of
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:46.460]   their help and attention.
[00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:51.540]   So I'll share some thoughts on how to do that if you're at this life stage, if you're part
[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:57.820]   of the sandwich generation, or maybe you're someone without kids who has parents who are
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:03.740]   aging, I'll share some thoughts that you might keep in mind as you are helping them navigate.
[00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:08.780]   And finally, at this life stage, when you're in your, say, 40s and 50s, this is an age
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:14.000]   where I would start thinking about a long-term care plan.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.560]   So I know it sounds terribly early, but the earlier you think about this, the better off
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:23.460]   your plan will be in the long run, so I'll share some thoughts on that.
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:28.960]   So maximizing your contribution to tax-sheltered accounts, well, certainly if you can hit the
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:37.460]   max for 401(k)s, 403(b)s, 457(s), if you're self-employed, perhaps you're using a SEP IRA
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:43.060]   or a solo 401(k), if you can hit the maximum allowable contributions, that's certainly
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:48.940]   a worthy goal, especially if you have access to a good quality plan.
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:54.820]   Making the maximum allowable contribution to an IRA is also absolutely key, and I think
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:58.780]   it's also important to talk about health savings accounts, and certainly these can come into
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:01.580]   play for younger investors as well.
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:08.940]   In fact, increasingly, we're seeing high-deductible plans come online, which oftentimes come paired
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:13.680]   with the ability to make a contribution to a health savings account.
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:20.780]   And I'll just touch quickly on the really prodigious tax benefits of a health savings
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.420]   account.
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:29.780]   Just quickly, they are the only triple-tax-advantaged vehicle in the whole tax code.
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:35.660]   So money going in is pre-tax, you can often contribute right through payroll deductions,
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:41.020]   so that's a relatively painless way to save.
[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:46.480]   As long as the money stays in the account, it is not taxed, and when the money comes
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:53.860]   out and is used for qualified medical expenses, it is not taxed either.
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:59.500]   If you do use the money for non-medical expenses, it is taxed.
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:05.580]   In retirement, if you use the funds in this way, it's essentially like it's a traditional
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:12.660]   IRA, so you will owe taxes on the investment gains as well as your pre-tax contributions
[00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:17.960]   because you have enjoyed tax-deferred compounding on your money, but there's not a free lunch
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.220]   unless you're paying for health care expenses.
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:28.900]   So HSAs are a much-loved vehicle among people who care about financial planning matters
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:31.900]   because of these three tax advantages.
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.620]   I'll just go back really quickly.
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:40.220]   In terms of the contribution limits, it's for 2021, 3,600 for people who are covered
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:41.860]   by a single plan.
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:46.580]   If you have family coverage or if you are part of a married couple and your spouse is
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:52.180]   covered, you are able to put double that amount in the HSA.
[00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:57.860]   So it's definitely something to reach for, especially if your HSA is decent, but even
[00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:00.080]   if it's not.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:07.100]   One point I would make is that if you do have a company-provided health savings account,
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:15.980]   a good workaround is to set up a parallel HSA alongside your company-provided HSA.
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:22.980]   So you can make the contributions to the company-provided HSA, but then periodically transfer the funds
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:25.320]   to the HSA of your choice.
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:31.340]   A lot of people think that if they're stuck in a high-cost or otherwise lousy HSA that
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:36.460]   they're truly stuck, but you have quite an escape hatch in terms of being able to have
[00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:39.640]   multiple HSAs set up at one time.
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:46.060]   So this is something to consider if your company-provided HSA isn't so great.
[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:50.780]   Morningstar has begun providing research on health savings accounts, understanding that
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:55.700]   these are an increasingly important part of people's financial plans.
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:38:00.680]   And so we've evaluated HSAs based on two use cases.
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:07.220]   One would be for people who are using the HSA as kind of a spend-as-I-go type vehicle.
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:09.640]   So that's how most people use their HSAs.
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:16.000]   In fact, I think about 80% of HSA dollars are just held in the short-term savings account
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.700]   without an intention of being used for long-term investments.
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:28.860]   And so when we look at HSAs for those types of savers who just plan to exit very quickly,
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.420]   we have two favorites.
[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:33.660]   One is Fidelity, and the other is Lively.
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:38.980]   So those would be firms that have what we think are decent interest-bearing accounts
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:42.260]   for people who are using their HSAs in this fashion.
[00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:49.780]   For people who are using HSAs as long-term investment vehicles, we think Fidelity's HSA
[00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:51.900]   is best in class.
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:58.180]   You can invest in a lot of low-cost investment funds, lots of index funds through Fidelity's
[00:38:58.180 --> 00:38:59.500]   HSAs.
[00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:06.820]   So we think that, actually, regardless of use case, Fidelity is quite top-of-the-line
[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:08.740]   in terms of HSAs.
[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:14.340]   So just something to think about, especially if you want to get away from a lousy employer-provided
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:19.940]   HSA, check out our research on various HSA providers.
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:24.340]   If you have additional funds to invest, so you've maxed out all of those tax-sheltered
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:30.860]   receptacles, I think it's absolutely a great idea to consider investing additional funds
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:36.340]   in taxable accounts, in just a taxable non-retirement brokerage account.
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:37.780]   There are some big benefits.
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:43.260]   One is that income limits don't apply, so you can put as much as you want into such
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:46.340]   an account regardless of how much you earn.
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:52.460]   There are no strictures on withdrawals, so you can withdraw the money and use it for
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:40:00.260]   whatever you want, and you can actually invest pretty tax-efficiently inside of a taxable
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:01.260]   account.
[00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:05.840]   So index funds are absolutely top-notch in this context.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:12.100]   Exchange-traded funds, also a terrific tax-efficient option, to the extent that you have individual
[00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:16.100]   stocks, and I know that's anathema to many bogal heads, but to the extent that you do
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:21.740]   have individual stocks, they can be a nice fit for a taxable account because you have
[00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:26.260]   a lot of control over the capital gains realization.
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:32.180]   To the extent that you have fixed income assets in your taxable account, you might want to
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:36.500]   consider municipal bonds, especially if you're a higher-income earner.
[00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:43.140]   It can often make sense on an after-tax basis to have municipal rather than taxable bonds,
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:49.380]   but you also want to be thoughtful about asset location, so where you place different investment
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:50.380]   types.
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:54.640]   So all else being equal, assuming that you don't have any shorter-term goals for those
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:41:02.960]   taxable assets, you should be pretty equity-heavy in order to keep that portfolio as tax-efficient
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.200]   as possible.
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:10.200]   So when you begin pulling from the money in retirement, you would owe just capital gains
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.100]   tax on your appreciation.
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:16.940]   The funds that you put in, you've already paid taxes on, so you won't be taxed on those
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:23.060]   again, but any gains, you'll owe taxes at the capital gains rate, which today is substantially
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:26.960]   lower than the ordinary income tax rate.
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:33.120]   Another nice aspect of taxable accounts is that under current tax law, and it appears
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:39.460]   under tax law for the foreseeable future, there is what's called an unlimited step-up
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:45.220]   that's available for people who inherit taxable assets from you, and what that means is that
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:54.740]   if they inherit a bunch of, say, Microsoft stock or something that has appreciated a
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:42:01.860]   lot since your initial purchase or Apple stock or whatever it might be, the people who inherit
[00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:09.460]   the assets from you are eligible to take a new cost basis based on your date of death,
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:15.100]   and so when they eventually sell the asset, the tax bill that they will owe will be based
[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:21.940]   on that new higher cost basis on the date of your death, not on what you paid for the
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:22.940]   asset.
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:27.180]   That tax bill on your gain is essentially washed out.
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:32.700]   There was a wide expectation that that would be in the tax proposal that we saw from the
[00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:37.100]   House Ways and Means Committee.
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:43.100]   It was not actually in the tax proposal, so for people who have a lot of wealth, who want
[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:48.860]   to pass it to the next generation while they have this very nice tax provision that they're
[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:51.900]   able to take advantage of.
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:56.500]   In terms of asset allocation at this life stage, kind of sound like a broken record
[00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:02.020]   on this, but sizable equity allocation still makes sense at this life stage.
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:06.780]   Global diversification, I think, makes a world of sense.
[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:13.700]   Just using the 2050 and 2040 funds, you can still see that they are very heavily equity
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:15.740]   allocated.
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:25.300]   They have 80% equity exposure for the 2040 cohort and 90% equity exposure for the 2050
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:26.300]   cohort.
[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:33.660]   As your kids age, I think it's a great idea, in addition to continue to stoke those college
[00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:39.460]   funds, to start having a discussion about paying for college funding.
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:44.580]   And Ron Lieber, in his book about paying for college, has some great ideas about talking
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:51.860]   to your kids about paying for college, involving them in the discussion about what you and
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:44:00.500]   your spouse will pay for, what the family will do to pay for college, and what the expectations
[00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:07.300]   are of what the child will pay, whether you expect the child to take on debt or work during
[00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:09.620]   school or whatever it might be.
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:13.860]   This is a great stage while your kids are just sort of formulating their views about
[00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:19.340]   college to bring them into the discussion about how expensive college is and how you
[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:24.500]   want them to be part of the process and how the financial piece of the process, paying
[00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:27.420]   for college, needs to be part of the discussion.
[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:34.580]   I think it's a great life stage when your kids are ready to start thinking about investing.
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:39.340]   I think it's a great idea to start talking about some basic investment lessons.
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:45.180]   There's been a lot of debate on social media, I've certainly been in a lot of active debates
[00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:49.100]   about how best to teach young people about investing.
[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:55.980]   I know a lot of people who focus on financial planning think the only way to do it is to
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:59.500]   start letting your kids experiment with individual stocks.
[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:02.580]   I happen to think that that's not really necessary.
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:09.220]   I like the idea of sticking with the bogelheads mentality, perhaps buying to the extent that
[00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:19.060]   you want to do a little bit of education, perhaps letting your child buy like a Vanguard
[00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:27.300]   Total World Stock Index inside of a UGMA, UTMA account, or even inside a Roth IRA if
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:32.220]   your child has some earned income from lawn mowing or babysitting or cashiering or whatever
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:33.900]   it might be.
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:41.060]   I think you can use that Total World Stock Market Index Fund, but talk about some of
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:42.380]   the holdings.
[00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:47.260]   Look at the holdings that get top billing and see, well, you know what?
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:52.700]   You own a little piece of Amazon, you own some Apple here, you own all of those marquee
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:46:01.500]   names that you think highly of, and you are actively participating in their growth.
[00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:05.380]   Here another book by Ron Lieber, I think is an excellent resource.
[00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:09.220]   He has a book called The Opposite of Spoiled that I think is a terrific way to teach young
[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:14.860]   people about investing in the market.
[00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:19.700]   In terms of caring for older adults, this is a topic that I've spoken about at various
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:24.800]   bogelheads conferences in the past, in part because I was so actively involved with my
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:31.580]   mom and dad as they aged, and I was so glad I could be there as their investment partners.
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:38.020]   My dad was always an engaged investor, but developed cognitive decline as he moved into
[00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:44.100]   his mid-80s, and I was so glad that the process for him was relatively seamless and that I
[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:47.540]   was on all of my parents' accounts.
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:53.580]   I was able to oversee their investments, and so the handoff to me to manage their assets
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:56.780]   was relatively straightforward.
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:02.300]   I would say if you're that financially savvy adult child, it's really valuable, assuming
[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:08.080]   you have a good relationship with your mom and dad, to help them navigate this life stage
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:14.260]   and start asking them some basic questions about how you might help.
[00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:19.020]   I think oftentimes a good way to begin the discussion is just to talk about some things
[00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:21.660]   that you might be doing in your own life.
[00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:27.140]   If you want to have a sense of whether your parents have a state plan set up, for example,
[00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:34.900]   you might say, "Well, my spouse and I are thinking about getting an estate plan.
[00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:36.860]   We recognize that we need a will.
[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:39.380]   We recognize we need powers of attorney.
[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:43.900]   Who did you and mom use to navigate that?
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:45.540]   When did you last see him or her?"
[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:52.300]   Just start the discussion by sharing your own experience, sharing some of your own questions,
[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:54.220]   and certainly this is really personal.
[00:47:54.220 --> 00:48:01.260]   I think it depends on your relationship with your parents, but ideally if you can help
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:06.180]   your parents as a trusted partner, it can be tremendously beneficial and it can just
[00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:14.540]   be another way to bond with them and a way to be helpful to them in their later years.
[00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:19.220]   Another key thing that you might do if you really decide that managing their financial
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:25.500]   lives is more than you care to bite off at this life stage, maybe you're busy with your
[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:30.540]   job and raising your kids and whatever it might be, I think a key thing you can do as
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:37.340]   a financially savvy adult child is help your parents identify a good financial advisor.
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:42.260]   Bill Bernstein once quipped that in order to find a good financial advisor, you could
[00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:48.260]   practically be a financial advisor and unfortunately, I don't think that's too far off, but I do
[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:53.260]   think that you can help your parents do their due diligence.
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:57.580]   Focus on finding someone who has the CFP credentials.
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:03.220]   Focus on finding someone who is a fiduciary, no hemming or hawing if you ask about that.
[00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:09.500]   Focus on someone who is fee only, so who is not going to charge a commission.
[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:15.540]   I personally have a bias toward the hourly model in part because that's how my husband
[00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:19.100]   and I have chosen to pay for financial advice.
[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:24.520]   We feel comfortable managing our investment portfolio, but we have engaged with a financial
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:30.780]   planner to help us with a couple of things that are sort of above our pay grade.
[00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:37.140]   One relates to employer stock and how to divest of that in a tax efficient manner and the
[00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:40.700]   other has related to some long-term care planning that we've been doing.
[00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:45.660]   But for us, we've decided that because we are comfortable and hands-off with our investment
[00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:50.860]   portfolio, we like the hourly model, even though it entails writing a check and it's
[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:59.700]   not a low hourly rate by any stretch, we like that it aligns our needs with our outlays.
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:05.220]   So help your parents identify a good quality financial advisor.
[00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:09.020]   Sometimes people who aren't sure what to look for in a financial advisor might latch on
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:14.780]   to the person with whom they feel comfortable, and unfortunately, that's not necessarily
[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:23.900]   the person who is going to be the best person to be entrusted with their resources.
[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:29.380]   Late career folks, just a couple of things to think about, and I'll just move on because
[00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:34.820]   I think in the interest of time, we might be running a little bit late.
[00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:38.940]   So I'll just quickly cycle through what I want to cover here.
[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:45.220]   So turbocharging your investments, this is not the luxury that all of us have or not
[00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:51.380]   a luxury that all of us have, but some people do come into the late part of their careers
[00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:56.880]   at the highest income level that they'll ever have, and people at this life stage are oftentimes
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.940]   in the empty nest phase.
[00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:02.140]   So college funding is in the rear view mirror.
[00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:08.580]   Perhaps you had a single earner family where one partner was mainly engaged in raising
[00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:12.580]   the kids and keeping things up and running at home while the other was earning while
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:14.260]   the kids were young.
[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:18.580]   Later in life, oftentimes two spouses are able to work.
[00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:23.340]   So Michael Kitsis, the financial planning guru, wrote a great piece a number of years
[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:29.660]   ago where he talked about just how big a dent the empty nesters can make in terms of their
[00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:35.220]   retirement savings program that they can really make up for some lost time with turbocharging
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:37.580]   contributions at this life stage.
[00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:42.300]   It's worth noting that catch-up contributions come into play at this life stage.
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:48.300]   So if you're over 50, you can make additional 401(k) contributions.
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:55.980]   In fact, going back to those total contributions that you can make, including either pre-tax
[00:51:55.980 --> 00:52:03.260]   or Roth 401(k) contributions, employer matching, and after-tax contributions, you're up at
[00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:07.500]   almost $65,000 if you're over age 50.
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:15.300]   If you are contributing to an IRA, you're able to make an additional $1,000 contribution.
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:21.760]   HSA contributions are also eligible for catch-up contributions once you pass age 55.
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:27.900]   So all of those things allow you to put additional funds into tax-sheltered retirement savings
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:29.140]   vehicles.
[00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:35.420]   In terms of the asset allocation at this life stage, well, here you still want to have ample
[00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:37.060]   equities in your portfolio.
[00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:43.620]   You're not yet retired, and even in retirement, you may be retired for 30 years or more.
[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:50.740]   So you still need to have ample equity exposure, but here is where we start to see equity allocations
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:54.820]   stepping down a little bit and bonds beginning to come into play.
[00:52:54.820 --> 00:53:00.780]   So if we look at the typical 2030 target date fund, so for someone who is planning to retire
[00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:08.340]   in about nine years, eight or nine years from now, you can see that they have about 60%
[00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:10.860]   equity, 40% bond.
[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:16.360]   But here's a life stage where I think it's important to kind of fine-tune your own asset
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:19.960]   allocation based on what you have going on.
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:24.500]   So at one extreme would be the person who's going to be lucky enough to retire with a
[00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:29.500]   full pension that will meet all of his or her living expenses in retirement.
[00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:34.420]   Well, that person really doesn't have a need for 40% bond exposure, right?
[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:39.540]   They have a need for more growth in their portfolio because in retirement, they'll just
[00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:45.860]   be practically sipping from that portfolio, assuming that they have pretty good risk tolerance.
[00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:51.060]   On the other hand, if someone is expecting to retire early, they might want to have an
[00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:58.260]   even more de-risked portfolio because they plan to tap that portfolio soon.
[00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:02.780]   So they'd want to have perhaps a little bit more cash in the portfolio, a little bit more
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:04.520]   in safe assets.
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:09.800]   So I think this is a life stage where you'd really want to give some thought to your own
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:16.340]   personal portfolio mix, how it relates to the rest of the income sources that you'll
[00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:19.400]   have in retirement.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:24.520]   In terms of other things to think about at this life stage, you want to think about your
[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:26.720]   retirement date.
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:32.080]   There's certainly been a lot of research about the benefits, the financial benefits of working
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:37.840]   longer, pretty obvious in that you're able to make ongoing contributions, you're able
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:43.160]   to benefit from additional compounding, additional tax deferral.
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:48.160]   Assuming that you've got the money in some sort of tax-sheltered account, you won't be
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:50.740]   making any demands on your portfolio.
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:55.800]   And so that is another feather in the cap of delaying retirement.
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:55:04.920]   You may be able to delay social security filing, and you'd want to keep that in mind.
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:10.080]   And incidentally, when we look at the data on things that contribute to happiness in
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:16.220]   retirement, we see that having some sort of sense of purpose and engagement can be really
[00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:20.940]   impactful in terms of contributing to people's satisfaction in retirement.
[00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:26.580]   And for some of us, not all of us, certainly, but some of us, we get a lot of engagement
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:27.580]   from our work.
[00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:28.940]   We get that sense of purpose.
[00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:33.560]   I know for my own part, I feel like that is a reason why I'd like to continue working
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:39.420]   in some capacity, even past retirement age, because my work has always given me that sense
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:41.000]   of engagement.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.020]   And it gives you a social outlet, kind of a built-in social outlet, especially if you're
[00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:50.820]   an introvert and you don't necessarily have a lot of people who you're in regular contact
[00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:51.820]   with.
[00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:55.600]   The nice thing about continuing to work is that you have that social network.
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:59.900]   You have those built-in social engagements.
[00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:04.740]   So working longer is something to consider, but I think it's also worth noting that when
[00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:11.540]   we look at the data on retirement and when people thought they would retire versus when
[00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:15.460]   they actually did retire, we see a little bit of a disconnect.
[00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:20.540]   So we see that many people aspirationally think that they will work longer, and that's
[00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:22.580]   what we're seeing on this slide.
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:31.700]   So we're seeing, like, on that 65 to 69 cohort, we can see that 42% of those folks thought
[00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:37.620]   that they would retire -- 42% in the pre-retirement stage thought that they would retire at that
[00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:45.820]   life stage, when, in fact, just 16% were able to delay past age 65.
[00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:51.340]   So in general, people tend to overestimate their ability to continue working longer.
[00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:54.180]   That's because of ageism.
[00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:58.940]   It's because of health considerations, either the individual's own health considerations
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:05.260]   or partners or parents, whatever it might be, or maybe just the physical demands of
[00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:06.260]   the job.
[00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:09.260]   People are not able to consider -- to continue working.
[00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:11.940]   So keep that in mind as you think about your plan.
[00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:17.620]   In fact, Mark Miller, who's a contributor on Morningstar.com, has a great soundbite,
[00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:23.180]   which is that working longer is a worthy aspiration, but it's not a plan.
[00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:26.980]   Sometimes I get really worried when I talk to older adults where they tell me their plan
[00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:32.180]   is just to continue working and that their plan completely depends on them continuing
[00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:33.460]   to work.
[00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:36.720]   Not a great plan if you can avoid it.
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:41.020]   At this life stage, I think it's also a great idea to begin sketching out total spending
[00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:47.060]   needs using an actual budget, starting to think about how your lifestyle might or might
[00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:54.020]   not change in retirement, so thinking about just sort of capturing what are our anticipated
[00:57:54.020 --> 00:58:00.620]   total spending needs in retirement, subtracting out non-portfolio income sources that you
[00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:06.980]   might be able to rely on, so doing some preliminary work on what those non-portfolio income sources
[00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:11.180]   might be, and then taking a hard look at the amount that's left over.
[00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:14.980]   That's your draw upon your portfolio.
[00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:21.500]   Divide that by your total portfolio value to arrive at your withdrawal rate.
[00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:28.100]   So start doing that basic work on whether the amount that you would need to take out
[00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:32.700]   of your portfolio is a sustainable withdrawal rate.
[00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:37.100]   So this is just a simple sketch of how this would work in practice.
[00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:47.660]   Let's assume a couple is using a $60,000 annual income that they're expecting to spend in
[00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:48.660]   retirement.
[00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:51.280]   Social Security is supplying half of that.
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:56.560]   That means that their portfolio needs to supply the other $30,000.
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:02.480]   If their portfolio is $800,000 and they're using the 4% guideline, and I know we could
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:09.880]   debate the viability of the 4% guideline, their initial withdrawal would be $32,000.
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:14.460]   Then they would just inflation adjust that dollar amount as the years go by.
[00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:20.400]   So in year two, assuming a 3% inflation adjustment, they'd be close to $33,000.
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:25.820]   There's a lot of confusion about what 4% means, but what it doesn't mean is that you get to
[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:28.560]   withdraw 4% in perpetuity.
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:32.080]   It means that you're taking a fixed real dollar withdrawal.
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:41.820]   I'm just going to cough and take a sip here real quick.
[00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:45.960]   This is also a great life stage to talk about, think about long-term care.
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:51.480]   We could spend this whole session on long-term care, but certainly when you're in your 50s,
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:57.360]   that is the age to start thinking about what you will do to fund these costs should you
[00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:58.360]   incur them.
[00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:05.080]   I know for a lot of bogleheads, the answer may be to self-fund long-term care, but I
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:09.960]   think it's important to the extent that that's your plan and you haven't purchased insurance
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:17.760]   to set aside those funds in, it doesn't need to be a separate account, but at least separate
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:21.480]   those assets from your spendable assets.
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:26.360]   The idea is that those assets would be there later in life if you should need them.
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:32.640]   It's also a good time to revisit those estate planning documents.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:35.120]   In retirement, I'll just touch on this really quickly.
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:41.800]   I gave a whole presentation about retirement decumulation to another chapter, and you can
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:48.640]   find that on the Bogleheads YouTube site, which is a terrific resource, and I definitely
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:51.280]   go deeper on all of this stuff in that one.
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:56.000]   So if this life stage describes you, you might want to check out that presentation.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.240]   But just to touch real quickly on the highlights, some of the key things to be thinking about
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:04.560]   would be to start thinking hard about your retirement cash flow plan.
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:09.720]   So if the rubber is hitting the road and you're ready to retire, you're thinking hard about
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:15.280]   how you're funding retirement, how you're replacing the cash flows that you once had
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:16.560]   from work.
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:21.880]   You'll think about establishing an appropriate asset allocation given your spending plan,
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:23.920]   and you're also revisiting your estate plan.
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:27.440]   So I'll just cycle through this really quickly.
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:33.120]   This life stage is certainly a period where you want to think about how non-portfolio
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:39.600]   cash flows fit into your overall plan, so how Social Security fits in, whether or whether
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:44.400]   not annuities might fit in as a portion of your plan.
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:48.280]   Annuities are another topic that we could indeed do a whole session about, but my bias
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:55.640]   is toward the very vanilla, low-cost products, either a single premium, immediate annuity,
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:58.240]   or a deferred income annuity.
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:06.280]   You can do quick comparisons online using annuity tools to figure out what the approximate
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:11.840]   payout would be from these products, but certainly the more I look at these very vanilla annuities,
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:16.520]   the more I'm quite certain that I'm going to buy one for my own retirement, because
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:23.680]   I like the idea of really supplanting with Social Security the paycheck or something
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:30.080]   like our basic living expenses with these certain income sources in retirement.
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:34.120]   It's not for everyone, and it's certainly a topic worthy of further research, and you're
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:40.120]   right to have the high-cost variable annuities marked with a skull and crossbones, but I
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:43.960]   think the very basic annuities can be a nice addition to the plan.
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:46.880]   You also want to think hard about your planned withdrawals.
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:53.240]   I've been working on some forthcoming research on this topic on sustainable withdrawal rates.
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:58.360]   It's also a good life stage to think about the sequence that you'll use as you tap your
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:01.260]   various accounts.
[01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:06.680]   If you're not really comfortable with tax matters, this is a great spot to get some
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:12.960]   tax advice, either from a tax advisor or a tax-savvy financial advisor.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:20.640]   Sit down and get a plan for deciding how to withdraw from your various retirement accounts,
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:27.480]   and the basic idea there is to try to limit the tax bill over the whole of your retirement
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:29.120]   time horizon.
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:33.480]   Just a quick shout-out for the bucket approach that I often talk about, but I just think
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:39.560]   it's a really nice, intuitive way to think about allocating your in-retirement portfolio,
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:46.760]   because it uses your cash flow needs as the driver of how much to drop into each of these
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.400]   asset classes.
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:55.960]   So near-term expenditures go into that cash bucket, mid-term expenditures go into that
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:04:02.600]   intermediate term bucket, and then the longer-term expenditures go into the long-term bucket.
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:08.440]   The basic idea is that with bucket one and two, you set up kind of a bulwark against
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:10.080]   a bad equity market.
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:15.280]   So in a worst-case scenario and you need to withdraw from your portfolio at a time when
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:19.960]   your equities have taken a tumble, you could withdraw from bucket one.
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:23.600]   If it's depleted, you could move on to bucket two.
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:28.320]   So this is just a sample bucket portfolio, and I've got a lot of different variations
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:34.840]   of these on Morningstar.com, including some that are all Vanguard funds.
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:38.400]   This is kind of a basic bucket portfolio.
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:48.120]   I think it's geared toward people who have a $60,000 initial withdrawal on a $1.5 million
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:53.760]   portfolio, but you can actually right-size this based on your own portfolio size.
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:58.660]   But it's really just a framework there to illustrate what I think is kind of a sensible
[01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:04.040]   way to go about asset allocation for in-retirement decumulation.
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:12.120]   This is a very basic version of that kind of a three-fund portfolio meets the buckets.
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:15.840]   And you can see the key difference with the three-fund portfolio is that it simply has
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:20.000]   that cash bucket there for near-term liquid reserves.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:26.560]   This is another time to revisit estate planning documents, certainly all those basic documents.
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:32.520]   But certainly as we age, I also love the idea of coming up with kind of what I call a master
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:37.160]   directory, and I've got a template for this on Morningstar.com, but you can just create
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:44.520]   your own either Word document or Excel spreadsheet that basically says what you have, where you
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:49.840]   hold accounts, what financial intermediaries you deal with.
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:54.980]   And this is something that you would want to let your executor know that I've created
[01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:58.160]   this document, here's how to access it.
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:04.960]   Word protect it certainly if it's some sort of an electronic document or if it's a hard
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:07.980]   copy thing that you'd want to print out, you'd want to keep it safe.
[01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:15.360]   So keep it in some sort of a fireproof box or in the safe deposit box at the bank.
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:21.460]   Also I think it's a good idea to develop a succession plan for your financial plan.
[01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:27.120]   So if you don't have a trusted adult child on board with your plan, identify that financial
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:33.160]   advisor who could serve as sort of that second set of eyes on your plan.
[01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:38.420]   It's also a great idea if you're part of a couple where your spouse has no interest in
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:42.760]   any of this stuff, do that due diligence for him or her.
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:48.400]   Find that person, make that introduction, make sure that your spouse likes that person
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.700]   and feels comfortable with him or her.
[01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:55.160]   Don't just leave the name, take that next step and see if you've got a connection there
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:07:00.160]   before deciding that this is definitely the person that I will instruct my spouse to call
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.160]   up.
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:07.240]   Finally, as an animal lover and a person who has loved my pets in my life, I think it makes
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:13.240]   a lot of sense to identify a plan for your pets, especially as you age and they're such
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.140]   great company for you.
[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:18.960]   I think it's worthwhile to figure out what your plan is.
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:24.780]   You can get really elaborate in terms of estate planning for pets, but at a minimum identify
[01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:26.920]   what the plan is for the pets.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:30.920]   It's also a great idea at this life stage or really at any life stage that you're drawing
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:36.560]   up estate planning documents to articulate your attitudes toward long-term care and end
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:38.200]   of life care.
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:42.720]   Share that with the person who is your healthcare power of attorney who will make those decisions
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:46.560]   on your behalf if you're unable to make them on your own.
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:52.020]   Have that discussion, not a fun discussion, but nonetheless one that I think families
[01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:55.040]   can definitely benefit from.
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:08:00.000]   I'm just going to project, here's my info.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.720]   Can't answer anyone's personal questions about their financial plans, but if you want to
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:10.880]   reach out and tell me you enjoyed the presentation or tell me that you have an idea for something
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:17.960]   that I should be working on, my email address is here, LinkedIn info, Twitter info, and
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:25.360]   I also work on a weekly podcast with my colleague Jeff Patak, which is an interview format.
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:28.400]   It's called The Long View.
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:46.480]   Thanks for listening.
