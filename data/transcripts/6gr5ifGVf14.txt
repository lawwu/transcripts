[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.080]   I'm Cal Newport and this is In Depth, a semi-regular series where I talk to interesting people
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.680]   about the quest to cultivate a deep life.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.560]   Today's episode is presented by Defender, a vehicle designed for those of us seeking
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.440]   adventure in a distracted world.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.760]   Now we're trying something different today.
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.200]   For the first time, I am having two guests at the same time.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.480]   The first is longtime friend of the show, writer Brad Stolberg.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.280]   He's the co-founder of The Growth Equation and the author of Practice of Groundedness
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.760]   and Master of Change.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.960]   I'll also be joined by Clay Skipper, longtime writer for GQ, who has interviewed me actually
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.800]   multiple times for that magazine, but is also the host of The Farewell Podcast, which is
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.720]   produced by The Growth Equation.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.920]   All right, so why are the three of us talking?
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:02.320]   Well, the other day, Brad texted us on a group chat, a New York Times op-ed, this was from
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.800]   last week, and it was titled, "Elon Musk is the World's Richest Man.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.040]   Why is He Sleeping on an Office Floor?"
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.840]   This was written by Eric Baker.
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.600]   Now this op-ed was adapted from Baker's book, Make Your Own Job, How the Entrepreneurial
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.000]   Work Ethic Exhausted America.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.080]   In this piece, Baker takes, you could think of it as a critical stance on the constructed
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.920]   idea of greatness.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.920]   Core to Baker's book is this notion that sort of post-war, we had a notion of industriousness
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.720]   as an ideal for labor in the American context, that you work hard and do your job well, and
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.960]   that this evolved over time to a culture of entrepreneurialism, where it was much more
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.980]   important that you pursued greatness, you became a sort of self-created mogul, that
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.280]   there is more of this pressure on you to do something really noteworthy with your professional
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.280]   lives.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.600]   From a sort of typical critical standpoint, Baker talks about how there's a constructed
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.480]   nature to entrepreneurialism that helps, for example, paper over certain issues in the
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.400]   economy or a certain precariousness about the way that a post-industrial economy has
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.260]   evolved, and that as long as we have this myth of entrepreneurialism, we'll all put
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.120]   up with this difficulty because we say, "Yeah, that might be true, but I am going to be the
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.840]   next Bill Gates.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.520]   I'm going to be the next Elon Musk, so I don't worry about it."
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.960]   So the article had a bit of a critical take on greatness, and we were debating this in
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.440]   the text thread because we also have issues with some of the way greatness is discussed
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.520]   as a topic.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.960]   We also, however, think that the pursuit of mastery and craft and quality is something
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.060]   that obviously goes through a lot of my writing, a lot of Brad's writing, it goes in a lot
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.060]   of Clay's interviews.
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.740]   We were trying to make sense of this conflicted relationship we had with greatness, and it
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.040]   occurred to me, this topic is perfect for those of us who are thinking about the broader
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.600]   idea of cultivating a deep life in a distracted world.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.040]   So Brad was like, "Maybe we should just record this."
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.040]   I said, "Yes."
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.120]   We jumped on to a bunch of microphones, and we recorded this conversation.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.120]   I think it's really interesting.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.460]   We get it a lot of points, and I think that you will enjoy it.
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.360]   But first, I wanted to say a word about today's presenting sponsor, Defender, which is allowing
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.480]   us to present the discussion that follows in its entirety without any interruption.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.440]   The iconic Defender line of vehicles has been reimagined for a new generation of explorers.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.600]   The Defender 90, 110, and 130, which can seat up to eight passengers, all maintained a legendary
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.740]   off-road capability for which Defender is known, but is now combined with new on-road
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.120]   capabilities that gives you a modern, luxurious ride.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.040]   Aesthetically, they feature compelling proportions and precise detailing, but these are combined
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.960]   with a tough, rigid body design that makes them so famously durable.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.340]   Funny story, the other day, I was recording here in the studio with Jesse, and we did
[00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.240]   a Defender ad read, and then I walked downstairs, and parked right outside of the Deep Work
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.040]   HQ was a white Defender.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.960]   So I texted a picture, and I sent it to Jesse, and I wrote something about it, but the picture
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.520]   sent, but not the text I wrote about it.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.560]   So Jesse just, I walked downstairs and texted him a picture of a Defender right outside
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.400]   the studio, and he texted back basically, "Oh, I'm surprised they got you your car so
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.440]   quick after doing the ad read."
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.440]   I wish.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.040]   It's a good-looking car, but it was just a coincidence.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.100]   Anyways, this is a good-looking vehicle that performs.
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.360]   It's perfect for finding adventure as you cultivate your own idea of the deep life.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.320]   Visit LandRoverUSA.com to learn more about the Defender, or even just to see what this
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.320]   thing looks like.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.480]   I keep coming across them.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.480]   It's a cool car.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.720]   So go to LandRoverUSA.com to learn more about the Defender.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:53.440]   And now, on to my conversation with Brad and Clay.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.160]   I'm kicking us off again?
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.160]   Okay.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:05.840]   Brad, Cal, great to see you fellows for a little special edition of Deep Questions Meets
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.720]   Farewell.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.240]   We are gathered here to talk about a New York Times article, that opinion piece that we
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.560]   had been reflecting on in our text thread, and we thought, "Hey, if we're talking about
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.760]   it here, it might be worth talking about on the podcast."
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.160]   I'm going to briefly summarize that article.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.980]   The article is from New York Times Opinion section.
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.920]   As I mentioned, it's by Eric Baker.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.540]   It is titled, "Elon Musk is the World's Richest Man.
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.640]   Why is He Sleeping on the Floor?"
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.640]   Biggest upshot of this piece, basically, is that Musk and his Department of Government
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.760]   – is it Department of Governmental Efficiency or Government Efficiency?
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.520]   I don't even know.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.600]   It's one of the two.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.800]   Whatever word's more efficient to say, I guess.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.080]   Not to interrupt, but there's something I did find funny about the email that said,
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.040]   "What did you do last week?"
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.840]   In the text of that email, it said, "Can you send a prox five bullet points you did
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.840]   last week?"
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.880]   They were abbreviating the word approximately because it would be a profound lack of productivity
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.040]   to write out the whole word productivity.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:13.320]   That shows how efficient Doge is, so we can only be thankful for that type of hard-hitting
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.320]   efficiency.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.320]   Sorry to interrupt, Clay.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.320]   Go ahead.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.320]   No, that's incredible.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.480]   Biggest upshot of this is that Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency – because
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.960]   that's more efficient – have been championing how much they work.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.720]   They have reported to be working 120-hour weeks.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.560]   For those doing some quick math, that is a little over 17 hours a day.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.200]   I know I can speak for myself and say I'm skeptical of that number.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.440]   I assume you guys are, too, but Musk is talking about why that makes them better, more effective
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.440]   than other bureaucracies.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.760]   He has this quote in there where he says, "It's like the opposing team just leaves
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.880]   the field for two days.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.360]   Working the weekend is a superpower."
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.700]   Basically, the upshot, Baker, the writer, says that he turns this into an argument of
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:59.440]   how we've elevated billionaires to be superheroes in America and we've valorized work.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.000]   I think we probably agree that billionaires should not be elevated to the role of superheroes
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   in society.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.240]   Maybe you shouldn't also be government employees.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.400]   But the other part of the question is sort of interesting.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.240]   I think what we're here to discuss today, is it a bad thing to valorize work?
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.040]   Is hard work a bad thing?
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.400]   I know this is something that you think a lot about, Cal, and we think a lot about.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:25.080]   How do we be productive in a way that allows us to be great and excellent, but doesn't
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.640]   get in the way of all the other things we want to do in our life?
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.360]   I think that's the question we're trying to answer, most simply stated, is hard work
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.360]   a bad thing?
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.280]   I'll kick it over to you, Brad, because I feel like you were the one who sent this article
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.880]   and had the strongest reaction to it.
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.960]   Yeah, I'm excited to hear what you think.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:45.120]   Well, I find a couple of things very interesting here, and they're worth pulling apart.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:52.800]   The first is the difference between pseudo-greatness and pseudo-hard work, and actual greatness
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.800]   and actual hard work.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.240]   This article comes out in the context of Elon Musk at the CPAC conference, marching around
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:04.840]   the stage with a chainsaw to signify how hard he's working, how much he's cutting up the
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:11.260]   government, and how efficient he is, like a WWE wrestling character.
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.560]   I think that a lot of people see that, and I'm painting in broad strokes here, but a
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.360]   lot of people on the right see that, and they say, "This is awesome.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.360]   He's our guy.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.040]   He's finally working hard.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.360]   Someone in government that cares about efficiency, that is sleeping on the floor, that is willing
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.760]   to grind, that is working hard."
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.480]   Then again, in broad strokes, people on the left see that, and they're like, "This is
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.760]   all kabuki.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.840]   This is nonsense."
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.760]   I tend to be more in the kabuki nonsense camp.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:42.660]   However, what gets swept up in that camp so often is that now all hard work is bad, and
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.360]   there I completely disagree.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:49.440]   I think the performance of hard work when you're not really doing anything meaningful
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.980]   is bad, but if someone wants to come into government and sleep on the floor and be passionate
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:59.240]   about making things better and actually do it and do it in an ethical way, that might
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.240]   be great.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.760]   I'll cap it off before turning it over to Cal with a really interesting observation.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.720]   Around the same time that this article comes out, around the same time that there's this
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.880]   vibe happening where the right is all about, "Yeah, he's our guy with the chainsaw, hard
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.700]   work," and on the left, it's, "Eh, hard work is bad.
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:21.320]   It's all just capitalist, and it's terrible," the actor Timothee Chalamet gives a speech
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:27.920]   at the SAG Awards that goes absolutely viral around the same time that Elon's work goes
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:28.920]   viral.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.260]   I'm going to quote from his speech.
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:35.720]   What this young actor says, "I appreciate the award, but it's not about the award.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:40.440]   I know this sounds weird, but I'm really into the pursuit of greatness.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.760]   I'm inspired by the greats."
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.840]   Everyone's like, "That's so cool.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.000]   He's athlete-coded.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.160]   He just wants to grind.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.640]   He wants to devote his entire life to the craft."
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:56.760]   I think that, to me, is this tension between, on the one hand, we admire greatness and we
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:04.240]   admire hard work, but on the other hand, we say, "Oh, I don't know about hard work," or
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.680]   is hard work just a product of a capitalist system that is supposed to grind us all down
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:16.000]   to the bone and essentially appropriate our time, energy, and attention?
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.100]   I think those are the table stakes.
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.240]   Those are the things to pull apart.
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:23.680]   There's performative hard work versus actual hard work, and I think what all too often
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:28.160]   happens is people get swept up in performative hard work, but then they throw out the baby
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.160]   with the bathwater.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:34.440]   Especially on the elite left, again, broad strokes, I sound like a broken record.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:39.040]   Then it just becomes, "Oh, hard work is bad.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.040]   It's bad.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.040]   We shouldn't be for it."
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:48.000]   Yet, we love these athletes and actors that are essentially obsessed with their craft.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.680]   I agree with you there's a language thing going on.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:56.360]   I think it's easy to jump from what you're saying, which is there's a certain type of
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.520]   performative hard work that I don't know how to put my finger on the terminology, but this
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:05.840]   rubs me the wrong way, and it's easier just to say hard work is wrong.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.840]   Here's a comment.
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.320]   I want to read a comment from the New York Times op-ed.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.360]   A commenter left this comment, which I think gets at the core of what's really going on
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.360]   here.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:19.840]   A commenter on that Eric Barker op-ed said, "I come from a position of being able to observe
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:24.760]   more than a few of these 'masters of the universe' day in and day out.
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:29.640]   Much of this so-called work ethic is performative and on closer scrutiny, dissembles into a
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.680]   scramble of unfocused, disorganized, and half-baked decision-making.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.880]   They waste untold hours in the gyre of aimless meetings while consuming the time of their
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.120]   acolytes and employees.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.280]   It's not an advantage.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.600]   It's slogging through cement."
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.160]   I did a lot of research for that New Yorker piece we mentioned about Elon Musk's, for
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.840]   example, his first weeks being in charge of Twitter.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:58.080]   What we see is exactly that, because we have a good tick-tock of not the social platform
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.840]   but T-I-C-K, the journalist term, a point-by-point timeline of what happened.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.880]   There was great reporting in The Verge.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:08.760]   The story about what happened is that he comes in like a whirlwind to Twitter in 2022 after
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.200]   he takes it over.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:16.160]   He just starts doing random things and abandoning those things and moving on to something else.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.920]   He comes in, he fires the CEO.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.000]   That's where he first uses this phrase, "What did you do last week?"
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.120]   He texted that to the then-CEO, Agarwal, and then fired him soon after.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.800]   Then he comes in and says, "I want every engineer to print out the last 50 lines of
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.440]   code that you programmed and bring it to me."
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.440]   Then they're like, "Actually, wait.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.440]   Don't do that.
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.440]   Shred it if you've already done it.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.440]   I'm not going to review that.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.440]   No, here's what we're going to do.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:43.160]   We're going to enforce these deadlines now from our OKRs.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.720]   If you don't do the deadlines, we're going to fire you.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.720]   No, forget that.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:50.600]   What I want you to do is managers will rank order your employees so that I can see who
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.440]   the lower-ranking employees are."
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.440]   He's like, "No, actually, forget that."
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.320]   He just fired half the staff basically without explanation.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.200]   It was just random.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:04.720]   That I think is what people are picking up hard work means for some of the people coming
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:11.920]   out of Silicon Valley right now, for the iconoclastic founder types coming out of Silicon Valley.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.560]   We're picking up this doesn't feel right.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:20.360]   Another way we know that's not right is that you can derive the opposite conclusion from
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:24.200]   Elon Musk to what he's saying right now, which is, "Wait a second.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:29.360]   He has seven different major concerns he's running right now.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.560]   He's added Doge on top of Tesla, on top of SpaceX, on top of Neuralink, on top of what's
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.460]   happening with the Starlink product, on top of what's happening with the Boring Company."
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:43.200]   The fact that he has that many things going on, he could be working 120 hours a week,
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.000]   but you have to divide that now by, what, six or seven different companies.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.120]   So actually, you could take away the opposite, which is somehow SpaceX is successfully launching
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.700]   rockets when at most it could be getting 10 hours a time from Elon Musk a week.
[00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:03.900]   You could almost take the opposite conclusion from this, which is effective hard work doesn't
[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.440]   necessarily mean I'm sleeping on the floor of that office.
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:13.280]   So anyways, I think this is what's really going on here, is the real intuitive complaint
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:18.760]   is what is being called hard work by a small group of people is not that, and it's annoying,
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.700]   and I wish they would stop valorizing it.
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:25.080]   But it's a mistake, as you said, Brad, to say, "Well, maybe just this means that hard
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.360]   work itself is somehow broken," and then we go down the typical sort of left-wing social
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.300]   conflict lane of like, "Okay, so all of hard work is a construct.
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:37.000]   It was invented by capitalists to try to blind us from the misery of our precarious economic
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   situation."
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.640]   It's like we don't have to go down the conflict theory sort of academic left theorizing in
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:49.680]   order to actually say, "Musk with the chainsaw, that feels like nonsense."
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:55.400]   I think that's right, but then how do you explain this very real vibe that everyone
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.400]   feels?
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:01.960]   Like listeners of the show, I bet all of you feel this vibe, which is generally speaking
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:06.760]   on the right, hard work, whether it's performative or real, and it's often performative, is
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.160]   extremely valorized.
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.840]   It's how we grow our character.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.680]   It's how we contribute to society.
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.560]   It's productive, and it's what you should do.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:21.080]   You should work hard, and on the left, there is this kind of anti-work or don't strive
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:26.960]   for greatness or don't give something your all.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.200]   Don't become obsessed with a craft.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.240]   How many people have called you out on your productivity books, which are the opposite
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.740]   of performative or pseudo-greatness?
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:40.200]   You literally use the term pseudo-productivity in contrast to the real thing, yet people
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.160]   are like, "Oh, productivity is bad.
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.800]   It's just a capitalist construct," or, "We shouldn't be working hard."
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:52.560]   I think that in my world, when I talk to people who are actually excellent at what they do,
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:56.800]   whether they're professional athletes, whether they're award-winning artists or chefs or
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:01.360]   musicians or transplant surgeons, they all say, "All of this is nonsense.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.640]   These are a bunch of clowns yelling at each other."
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:08.880]   Real hard work comes with sacrifice and trade-offs, but it is a source of deep fulfillment and
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.720]   satisfaction, and it makes the world go round.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.280]   That's why we admire the transplant surgeon that sleeps on the floor of the OR.
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:20.080]   That's why the Timothee Chalamet speech, where you see an actor that's not just about being
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.800]   famous but seems to genuinely be about greatness.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.640]   That's why we love LeBron James.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:31.080]   We do love hard work, and we ought to love hard work, yet it feels like genuine hard
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.440]   work gets crowded out by the polarized vibes.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.920]   Go ahead, Clay.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:36.920]   Go ahead.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:41.640]   I was going to say, or it gets crowded out by performative hard work, right?
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:48.320]   I think people working hard in busyness, Cal, you've written about this wonderfully.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:54.240]   The idea of being busy has replaced actually doing good work, and I think that's an interesting
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:17:01.680]   thing to unpack here, too, which is people want to look at LeBron James and say, "I want
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.360]   to work like that," but instead of actually working like that, they just perform busy
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.120]   work in place of actually doing excellent work.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.240]   I think that's interesting, too.
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:15.760]   How did busyness become a metric for productivity as opposed to doing good work being the metric
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.760]   for productivity?
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.840]   Does that make sense?
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.440]   Quality instead of busyness.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.040]   I'll jump in on that because you're right.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.000]   This is what I wrote about in the last book.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.840]   I think there's two things going on here.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.000]   I think, one, you're right.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.400]   People who have just standard office jobs have to face this dynamic all the time.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.040]   It's not just Elon Musk on the stage talking about it.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:40.440]   This is the central productivity crisis I've written about, which is the fact that knowledge
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:45.080]   work has largely embraced the notion of pseudo productivity as its main measure of useful
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.080]   effort.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.620]   That is, visible activity will be my proxy for your doing something useful, which has
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:54.640]   created this culture of performative busyness just in knowledge work in general.
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:18:00.480]   I think this vibe is out there more commonly than just the Silicon Valley types talking
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.480]   about it.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:05.240]   So many people's jobs now, you say, "Why do I have to answer all these emails and jump
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.440]   on all these calls?
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.800]   This whole thing feels like performance.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.360]   I'm not actually producing something."
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:16.640]   There's a skepticism of productivity that comes out of the fact that the way we're defining
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.120]   productivity in so many organizations is flawed.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:25.800]   I think it's coming from a good place, but I think the conclusion is often wrong.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.880]   This is often where I try to go, is what I was trying to say before, is we have these
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.000]   real reasons to be suspicious about what's happening now.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.160]   We have a real reason to be suspicious about what Musk is saying.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.960]   We have a real reason if you just work in a large office building, you have a real reason
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:45.080]   to be suspicious of what is being treated as productive.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:51.600]   But the instinct to say what's happening here is that all of these notions of hard worker
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:58.840]   productivity are constructed by a small cabal to our disadvantage.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:03.900]   That is where I think we get stuck because what do we really need to do is we really
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.600]   need this because if that's the answer, what are we going to do?
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.600]   Overthrow capitalism?
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.600]   What are we going to do?
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.600]   Right?
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:15.280]   But if the answer is like, no, Musk is a moron, so we could ignore him, right?
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.400]   And what's going on in these offices over here?
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.560]   Well, we have a terrible definition of productivity because it's complicated and we're being lazy
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.560]   about it.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.120]   We have to demand that we get smarter about what matters, what doesn't, how we want to
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.800]   reinvent work, what work should be.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:32.780]   I mean, I think if we just, when we just demonize the concept, I think it's very good if you're
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:36.800]   writing about the concept that could be useful for you, but it's not useful for anyone else.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.760]   I think something like that's going on here.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.760]   - Yes.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:40.760]   I love that.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:44.640]   I think it's essentially, you've got pseudo greatness versus real greatness, pseudo productivity
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:50.480]   versus real productivity, pseudo excellence versus real excellence, and the work or at
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:56.280]   least our work needs to be to tease those things apart and say that they're very different
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:03.740]   in that the pseudo version is not something to aspire towards or is not something to valorize,
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.740]   but the real version, which gets crowded out by the pseudo version, is actually a huge
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:11.700]   part of what makes the world go round and what makes life worth living.
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:18.100]   Recently on an Ezra Klein podcast, he talked about how the right is all about excellence
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.540]   and how the right has kind of like become the party of excellence.
[00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.540]   And I'm like, no, like that's absurd.
[00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.300]   Like anyone can be excellent.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.100]   Excellent ought not to be politically coded.
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:30.980]   Excellence is trying to be the best that you can possibly be at something and getting intimate
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:35.740]   and close in overcoming alienation to find something that you love and to give it your
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:36.740]   all.
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:42.220]   Like, how did excellence become a vibe thing?
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:47.220]   And I think like it's about reclaiming these words that really are true to who we are,
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:54.180]   but to your point, they can't be the fake performative version.
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:57.900]   - Can I throw out two quick factors that might be involved, I'm interested in both your takes
[00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:02.900]   on this too, all right, to like auxiliary factors that could be happening in this tension
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.260]   going back and forth.
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:10.100]   One, I wonder if there's something going on here with like an uncanny valley effect.
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:16.340]   So if I see LeBron James crushing it on the court, right, shot 50 recently and he's like
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:18.980]   my age, which is crazy.
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:22.460]   I don't, there's no threat to me and what I've done in my life.
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:27.420]   Like there was never a possibility that I also could be like an NBA basketball star.
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:28.900]   So we can kind of admire that from afar.
[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.500]   I can watch an Olympic skier.
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:34.420]   There's no threat to like where I am in my own accomplishments, it's a completely different
[00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.420]   other world.
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:39.580]   But if it's in the realm of like roughly speaking knowledge work, you're like, well, I'm in
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.540]   that world as well.
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:45.380]   And they are doing, they're claiming they're doing better.
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:46.380]   They're very rich.
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.420]   It's, they're like, they're famous for what they're doing.
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:51.820]   That somehow seems like, hey, we're started at the same starting line and I'm lapping
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:52.820]   you on the track.
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.340]   Like there's more of a threat there.
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.320]   And this threat might be particularly acute.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:01.620]   I'm going to, I'm going to pathologize, you know, my own class right now, but for well-educated
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:06.580]   academic and journalists like my grad, my class, you're often coming from the exact
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.420]   same cohort as the Silicon Valley masters of the universe.
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.540]   And you're probably smarter than them and know that.
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:18.720]   Like I went to Harvard with this guy and he's not that smart and yet they have the billion
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.140]   dollar net worth.
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:22.740]   And you know, so what, I don't feel like they're better.
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.980]   I know they're not better than me and I know they don't have some sort of superpower I
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:26.980]   don't have.
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:29.980]   So maybe, you know, you're looking for a pathology there.
[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:32.180]   So I wonder if that's part of it.
[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:37.820]   And then the other thing I'm wondering if might be involved here is just language, being
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:39.140]   a little more careful with language.
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.500]   Like athletes are very good at this.
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:45.060]   You will never see an athlete at the post-game interview be like, yeah, I crushed it because
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.140]   I work so hard, right?
[00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:50.820]   Like Jalen Hurt is not like, you know, you know how long I'm in the gym and like how
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:54.540]   much I had to study these playbooks and how hard I worked.
[00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.860]   That's always like my team is great.
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.860]   Like I'm so happy to be there, whatever.
[00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:01.740]   And maybe the left picks up this sophistication a little bit more.
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:06.780]   Like this is unseemly to post a picture, the equivalent of posting a picture of your bicep
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:07.780]   on Instagram.
[00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:11.260]   Like it's kind of unseemly that try to brag about your work.
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.060]   So there's like this other sort of unseemliness that goes around.
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:18.100]   These are secondary factors at best, but I'm curious about them.
[00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.100]   I have thoughts on that.
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:25.220]   The first one is I think part of the problem with the comparison game is just like everyone's
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.140]   success is way more available to us now, right?
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:31.300]   Like it's very easy to see who, you know, obviously the top of the top has always been
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:35.620]   available to us, but now we can see all of our peers on Instagram, on social media, how
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:36.620]   they're doing.
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:38.900]   And it's just an endless comparison game.
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.700]   And I think that is probably exacerbating this problem.
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:46.660]   As to your second point, I wonder if part of the problem there specifically with athletes
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:49.940]   is like they have an objective, sports is super objective, right?
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.780]   You win or you lose, you have more points or you have less points.
[00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:56.660]   And Jalen Hurts can point to like, "I won the Super Bowl, so I'm clearly great at my
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.660]   job."
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:03.260]   Whereas a lot of people in knowledge work don't have that sort of objective metric.
[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:09.220]   So the closest thing they have is, "I worked 17 hours a day and I worked 120 hours a week."
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:14.980]   And I think that sort of blends into another thing at play here that a friend of both of
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:20.020]   our pods, Derek Thompson wrote a great story on last year in the Atlantic on workism and
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:26.220]   like how work has essentially become not so much about, to quote him, I believe he said
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:28.780]   this, not so much about material production as identity production.
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:33.940]   Like now that we have less places of belonging in our lives, we've turned to work as sort
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.780]   of our religion, our cathedral.
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.940]   And again, if that's where you're getting all your self-worth from, I think Elon Musk
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:45.540]   probably gets all of his self-worth from working, then it behooves you to be like, "Yeah, I'm
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:49.060]   working 17 hours a day and sleeping three and I don't know I'm doing the other four
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:50.300]   playing video games."
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:55.140]   Because then it makes you look like that's where all your self-worth is tied to.
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:25:02.380]   I think that ultimately what we're circling around here is like security versus insecurity
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.460]   in many ways.
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:08.100]   So if you're secure about your process, then you don't have to tell people that you were
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:12.580]   in the gym for six hours a day studying the playbook because you have confidence.
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:14.420]   You don't need to showcase it.
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:18.740]   If you're secure about your life, you don't have to compare yourself to other people,
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:22.620]   whether it's real or performative because you're secure about what you've done.
[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:27.640]   If you're secure about your values, you can admire greatness even if you are not obsessed
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:28.640]   with what you do.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:33.460]   And you can say, "You know, Timothee Chalamet is a great actor or LeBron James is a great
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:38.860]   athlete or Cal Newport is a great writer, but I'm not willing to make the trade-offs
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:42.660]   that they're willing to make and that's okay and I can still admire their greatness because
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:47.300]   I bet that they wish that they had more time with their kids or I bet that they wish they
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:51.020]   could just turn off their minds and have more hobbies."
[00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:55.780]   But all of that comes from a place of being secure with who you are and your values.
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.700]   And I think that maybe that's the second dairy problem here.
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:03.740]   So again, to retread where we've been, the first problem is when performative, elaborate
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:07.980]   kabuki steps in for the real thing and people see that and they get disgusted by that.
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:09.520]   I agree with that.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:13.020]   But then the second problem is when there's the real thing, when there's genuine greatness,
[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:17.320]   if people are insecure about themselves or their choices, then it's very inconvenient
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:22.340]   for them to acknowledge genuine greatness and instead of admiring it as a thing of beauty,
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:30.700]   they say, "Well, that person must just have a miserable life," or, "That's just capitalism,"
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:34.100]   and actually like by going to medical school and becoming a transplant surgeon, they're
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:38.240]   just part of a system, even though that system might very well save your grandma's life the
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.020]   next week.
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:44.200]   But if you're secure in your values and you're secure in your own life, then if you choose
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:48.440]   to pursue your own version of greatness, you'll do so from a place of security and you won't
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:52.320]   have to parade around with a chainsaw, and that might mean posting pictures of yourself
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.320]   on Instagram.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.520]   Like we all have our own personal version of parading around with a chainsaw.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.800]   And if you don't choose to pursue greatness because you don't want to accept the trade-offs
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:06.560]   and the sacrifices that come with it, then you can still admire it in other people, and
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.460]   to me, that's what this comes down to.
[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.400]   So this goes back to Eric's article.
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.720]   Would this explain part of what you're talking about?
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:17.020]   This was a very smart part from his article, which comes from the book he's writing.
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:20.520]   He said part of what's different about that, like we're worried about this, we're having
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:24.860]   this conversation now, we wouldn't have had this conversation in 1955.
[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:32.520]   And his argument was we shifted our understanding of work from industriousness to entrepreneurialism.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:38.920]   So in the age of industriousness, what mattered was I did, I'm a good worker.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.360]   Like I do my job well, right?
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:46.360]   Like here I have my job, I'm a GM, I think this was in Anna Wiener's review of his book
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.040]   from The New Yorker, and I do it really well, and I'm proud of that.
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:53.160]   But there's no notion of, there's a notion of greatness, but it wasn't something that
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.160]   most people pursued.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.760]   And then yeah, some athletes did or some such.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:00.160]   And then the shift that he argues in his book is that as we shifted to an entrepreneurial
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:05.680]   culture, part of the shift was culturally now the idea of you are in charge of your
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.880]   own career, there is no limit to you.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.920]   You can and probably should try to get after it and make a name for yourself.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.920]   This became on the plate of almost everyone.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:20.320]   A lot more people did it, but more importantly, it put a lot more people into a context where
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:23.320]   you could have done it, or at least that became the cultural change.
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.960]   So now I'm thinking back, I'm thinking, "Eric, actually, your book is pretty smart," because
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:32.040]   this idea is starting to help me make sense of what we're talking about, is that maybe
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:40.080]   we have whiplash from a culture that suddenly says, "You know, you could think about trying
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:44.400]   to be quote-unquote great," in a way that I don't think my grandparents would have thought
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.400]   about.
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.240]   It just was like, "No, I do my job well, and I'm a deacon at the church, and my kids are
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.800]   raised right, and I'm respected in my town.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:51.800]   What else?
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.800]   I'm killing it.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.800]   What are we talking about here?
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.400]   The generation that went through the Great Depression, that's killing it.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:29:02.640]   Our generation is like, "Well, how many sub-stack subscribers do I have?
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.880]   Heather Cox has a million.
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:04.880]   What am I doing here?"
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:09.320]   So I mean, I'm wondering how much of that's actually going on here.
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:10.320]   I think that's right.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:14.200]   It seems to me just like an obsession with winning, because you think about the way you're
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.560]   characterizing your grandparents.
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:21.680]   I don't think they would have been ... It just feels to me like that switch from industriousness
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:25.400]   to entrepreneurialism, it all of a sudden becomes about who's on top.
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.640]   Am I winning?
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.080]   I think that is a big shift from just being like, "I go to work.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.080]   I find meaning in work.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:34.440]   I find meaning in coming home, and being a dad, and being a father, and being the coach
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:40.200]   of my son's sixth grade basketball team," there was no concept of, "I'm going to win."
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:44.520]   But now, I think a lot of people probably look at Elon Musk or Donald Trump, and they
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.320]   think, "That guy won.
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.360]   He won."
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.320]   Even we do this to some extent, right, Brad?
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:55.800]   We're always talking about, "Why are we not Andrew Huberman?"
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.440]   There's a sense of wanting to get to the top.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:02.900]   I think there probably used to be more tolerance for, "I'm in the middle, and I'm feeling pretty
[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:07.720]   good about finding meaning in the middle here," as opposed to being on the top of the mountain.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.520]   >>Corey: Yeah, I have a long list of reasons for why we're not Andrew Huberman, but best
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.480]   I don't go into those right now.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.480]   I think that's right.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:19.840]   I think that in the 1940s and '50s, there was no LinkedIn.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:23.440]   Cal, I know you're a fan of the Google Ngram.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:28.480]   I bet you could look this up while I talk, but my guess is personal brand wasn't a word
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.360]   that appeared in anything that was published.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.840]   I don't think anybody thought about having their own personal brand.
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:39.360]   You weren't measured in the number of followers you have.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:43.360]   Because there's no internet, you're not comparing yourself to everyone in the world in their
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.760]   GPA and their degree.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:50.160]   You're comparing yourself to the eight people that live in your neighborhood.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:54.400]   Maybe when you saw greatness, it wasn't a threat to your own ego or your own sense of
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.600]   self in the way that it is now, because now you see greatness, and a part of you is like,
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:02.360]   "Oh, if I'm not doing that, what does that say about me?"
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:05.760]   What I would say is all that that says about you is that you're at a stage of your life
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:12.160]   where you've chosen not to make the sacrifices required to pursue that level of greatness.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.800]   There's all kinds of different greatness too.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.080]   There's greatness as the deacon at your church, there's greatness as a parent, there's greatness
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.960]   as a kindergarten teacher.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:23.960]   We just happen to valorize very specific examples of that, and the examples that we valorize
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:28.560]   are entrepreneur, billionaires, professional athletes, and musicians.
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:33.040]   I'm going to bring up, this is from our latest Farewell episode, so regular listeners of
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:39.360]   Farewell, you heard this last week, perhaps my favorite quote ever, and I think the greatest
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:44.600]   line in all of literature is the last line of the novel Middlemarch, describing Dorothea
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:49.560]   Brooke, the main character of the book, and it is, "For the growing good of the world
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:54.960]   is partly dependent on unhistoric acts, and that things are not so ill with you and me
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:59.960]   as they might have been is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:03.000]   in rest in unvisited tombs."
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.600]   What that essentially means is a big part of the reason that the world goes round is
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:11.320]   because people are just living their life and being good, decent people, and I think
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:17.960]   that maybe that gets swept out a lot with this current obsession with winning in public
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:18.960]   greatness.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:22.800]   How broad is this interest, I wonder, as well?
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.080]   Okay, so we're thinking demographically.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.080]   Are we in a bubble?
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:31.760]   I mean, it's a bubble where whatever, we're well-educated sort of media-adjacent figures
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.220]   with like audiences.
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:36.720]   How representative are we?
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:41.040]   And the writers, Eric, at the New York Times, the Anna Wiener Review from the New Yorker,
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.320]   we're all in this like similar bubble.
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:47.040]   We write for elite publications, we write books, we have podcasts.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:52.160]   How broad, I wonder, does this increased interest in greatness or this increased insecurity
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.760]   about am I doing enough, how broad does that go?
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.480]   I really don't know.
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.880]   I think that the interest in greatness goes very broad.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.420]   I don't know about the insecurity, and the reason I think the interest in greatness goes
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:09.560]   very broad is I think, and I'm putting on my armchair political scientist hat, I think
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:14.900]   Obama represented greatness, and Obama was a very popular president because people voted
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:19.400]   for someone that wanted to build things and be great and was aspirational for individuals
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.880]   in a country.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:25.080]   And then I think for a million different reasons, the left lost that, and the left is all about
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:26.160]   here, all the things that's wrong.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:30.440]   There's very little talk about building or being excellent or about being great, and
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.720]   whether it's the real or the performative version, that depends on your politics, but
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:39.080]   the right picked that up, at least the perception of that up, and now people love that.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:42.640]   I mean, Vivek Ramaswamy is running for governor in Ohio, I don't know if he lives there, and
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.980]   his whole campaign is like excellence.
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:50.260]   Now my definition of excellence is very different than his, but I'm sure he spent a good chunk
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:54.420]   of change doing market research and chose that the thing to run on is excellence, why?
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:57.560]   Because people see the left as somehow opposed to excellence.
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:04.220]   So I think that it's very big in the culture, and make America great again, he literally
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:08.980]   chose the word great, and I think that you could argue that that does two things.
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:13.740]   I think that one is it codes and says that America has become something that it wasn't,
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:18.500]   and I want to go back to the 50s, and I think a lot of people get value in that, but I think
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:22.620]   other people see it as we should be great, we should be proud of our hard work, we should
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:24.500]   be proud of our industriousness.
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:29.580]   I think that it's also like, we should be great, and we should work hard, and we should
[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:36.620]   be leaders, and we should strive to build things, and people are inherently attracted
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:42.780]   to that, and I think that there's a vibe that elites like, "Ugh, we don't like that unless
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:46.700]   it's on our terms," and I think that's a real thing.
[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:47.700]   So what do you think about this prescription?
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:52.460]   Because I'm thinking through what we're talking about, okay, so what are some prescriptions?
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:58.700]   One, I think it's useful to say we got to understand that the thing that we're talking
[00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:01.340]   about, like the real issue is performative versus real.
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:05.220]   We got to talk about pseudo productivity is a problem, it is really annoying, but there
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:11.540]   is such thing as actual meaningful productivity, that performative greatness is annoying, but
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:14.700]   there's such thing as real greatness that should be lauded.
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:16.060]   We recognize that.
[00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:23.620]   The right response, here's a proposed prescription, the right response then is to try to push
[00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:32.840]   back on, define, and reject the pseudo, as opposed to try to build a sort of theoretical
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:40.740]   framework that just makes productivity or greatness writ large something that's a problem.
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:41.740]   That's easier.
[00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:47.660]   Also, it's like a flex, if you're really smart, because you have about 150 years' worth of
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:51.380]   post-Marxian theory to draw from and talk about.
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:54.860]   Eric kind of goes there in his book to some degree, the degree to which, well, entrepreneurialism
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:58.740]   is somehow a construct of the capitalist class to try to paper over the sort of economic
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:05.340]   precarity that we're in, but I think that is getting in the way.
[00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:11.020]   Yeah, none of these people deadlift, none of these people run 800s, none of these people
[00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:14.180]   make beautiful music, none of these people do woodwork.
[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:15.180]   It's true.
[00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:20.180]   Well, if they ran 800s, they would be so upset at life that they wouldn't do anything, because
[00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:21.180]   that's just a dirty point.
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:26.180]   No, but my point is, if you touch grass and you do real things in the world, you don't
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:31.220]   even have to be world-class, but if you give something your all, which is your own personal
[00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:35.780]   version of greatness, you realize how freaking awesome it is.
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:38.980]   You don't need to draw on Marxist theory to shut it down.
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:43.580]   You say, "Wow, training for that marathon was so much harder than I thought, and it
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:48.820]   felt so good," and that's very different than performative greatness, but the real thing,
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.980]   that's worth fighting for.
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:56.400]   That to me, I think, is the ultimate prescription, I guess the only addition to your prescription,
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.860]   is yeah, when there's the pseudo version of any of these things, we should call it out
[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:03.660]   and we should name it and we should say, "This is elaborate kabuki," and we should laugh
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:08.640]   at it and we should make fun of it, but instead of trying to throw the baby out with the bath
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:12.700]   water or come up with this intellectual snarky reason for why all hard work or all greatness
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:16.820]   or all productivity is bad, we should say, "And the real thing is freaking awesome."
[00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:17.820]   Yeah.
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:25.100]   I always say, you don't need a complicated theory when plain stupidity will suffice.
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:28.420]   In my writing, the famous case study is email and distraction.
[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:33.540]   I probably know more about the rise of email and knowledge work and its impact than any
[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:34.540]   living human.
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:38.140]   I wrote a book about it, endless articles about it, and from my point of view, if you
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:40.940]   really study it, it's an unforced error.
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:44.620]   You introduce this tool for one purpose, replace fax machines and voicemails, and you have
[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:48.380]   almost immediately due to the way that we deal with personal productivity and knowledge
[00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:53.660]   work, you have this unexpected consequence of communication volume metastasizing and
[00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:55.380]   suddenly we're distracted all the time.
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:38:02.380]   You don't need a nefarious villain to understand why that happened, and yet there was always
[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:07.620]   this, if you cover this topic, always this drumbeat of, "If I feel bad because I'm being
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:11.740]   distracted all the time, it has to be because someone else is exploiting me.
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:17.500]   It has to be I'm on email all the time because this somehow is allowing the managerial class
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:20.900]   to exploit more value from my labor, to alienate me more from my labor."
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.880]   It's some sort of psychic mind games of trying to have control.
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:24.880]   You can document it.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.260]   It's like, "Nah, it's just this tool messed up the ecosystem.
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:30.180]   You threw it in and it messed it up."
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:32.980]   As long as we're going to sit around and be like, "No, there's a bad guy here and we're
[00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:36.940]   hunting for the bad guy with our torches," we're not going to be actually trying to clear
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:39.020]   the invasive species out of the ecosystem, try to get back.
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:40.180]   It's like, "We got to fix what's going on here.
[00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:42.300]   We got to get rid of the kudzu."
[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:47.900]   I think that's part of what's going on here is we need to yell louder about the nonsense.
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.780]   The Musk performance is just nonsense.
[00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:52.420]   Again, I think I mentioned this earlier.
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:58.060]   He's running seven companies, so really the thing he is showing us is that in 10 to 15
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:02.420]   hours a week, you can actually be a successful CEO because that's what he's doing.
[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:05.420]   He might be working 120 hours a week, but he's spreading that very, very thin.
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:08.900]   If he really wanted to make the argument that you need to work 120 hours to do one thing
[00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:12.380]   well, he would have dropped everything else and just done one thing well, so that's nonsense.
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:17.540]   I think pseudoproductivity in the workplace, less nefarious in its origins, but it's just
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:18.540]   as annoying.
[00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:19.540]   We need to yell about it.
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:23.180]   All of these meetings, everyone jumping on calls and no one really pinning down what
[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:26.220]   it is you're trying to do and just making the whole thing activity-based, we got to
[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:27.220]   yell about it.
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:31.500]   That's a problem, but we don't need a complicated theory to understand why it's a problem.
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:35.940]   I think complicated theories are almost always smokescreens.
[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:40.260]   I know this even in the world of mathematics where I do complicated math theories.
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:43.420]   It's usually the simple theories that win the day.
[00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:46.660]   You can come up with complicated theories and it looks smart and your math is complicated
[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:51.620]   and you can even get a couple of papers accepted that way, but the real great minds in mathematics,
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:53.700]   it's typically like, "Oh, I cut to the core of it.
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:54.700]   Here's what's really going on."
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.500]   I think that's what's happening here.
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:03.820]   Call out the nonsense, but there isn't necessarily a complicated theoretically-induced nefarious
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:07.260]   scheme that we all have to write complicated journal papers about.
[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:08.260]   All right.
[00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:09.260]   I have two follow-ups.
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:14.500]   The first is complexity versus simplicity or complicating things versus making them
[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:15.860]   simple.
[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:23.540]   You see this all the time in any kind of sport performance where there's this real temptation
[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:27.740]   to have a super complicated program for what you're going to do at the gym or for your
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:33.700]   running and you have to have all these protocols and routines and you have to track everything.
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.660]   The reason for that is because you can hide behind complexity.
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:39.540]   So if something's not going well, well, it must be my complicated routine or it must
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:42.700]   be protocol six out of seven, so I'm going to change it up.
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.500]   When you make something really complicated and complex, you get to talk about it all
[00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:46.500]   the time.
[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:49.900]   So you can go to cocktail parties and you can post on social media about all that you're
[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:53.740]   doing and all the studying and methodology behind your program.
[00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:57.100]   But simplicity, which is you show up and you do the workout, you can't hide behind that.
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.580]   You either do the workout or you don't.
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:04.820]   Every single great coach will tell you that getting better at any sport or developing
[00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:07.700]   any physical capacity, it's just simple.
[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:11.100]   Find the system you want to stress, stress it, recover, and rinse and repeat.
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:12.100]   You don't need fancy protocols.
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:13.100]   You don't need complexity.
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:14.260]   It is simple.
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:19.540]   So I just love how you come to the same conclusion in your own little corner of the universe
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:23.900]   and I think that's probably a fairly universal truth that sometimes things are complex.
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:28.340]   This is Oskam's Razor, the simplest thing is generally the actual thing.
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:30.740]   My second point that I want to make that I think is important is there are going to be
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:33.980]   some people listening and I'm curious what you think, Cal and Clay, before I offer my
[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:39.060]   take that are saying a lot of what you guys are saying makes sense, but Elon Musk is pretty
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:40.060]   great.
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:46.700]   I mean, he's built all these companies, Starlink is an insane technology, Tesla completely
[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:53.380]   overhauled how we think about vehicular transportation in America, SpaceX is like on some accounts
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:57.860]   doing better than NASA or at least has performed better than NASA, and yes, he got all of these
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:01.540]   government grants and all this government money to do these things, but still, he was
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:03.220]   the head of these companies.
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:07.140]   So who are you guys that have written a couple books that have this podcast to say that Elon
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:09.140]   Musk isn't great?
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:11.220]   So let's hear what you guys have to say about that.
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:13.940]   Again, I have my own answer, but let's hit this head on.
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:17.700]   I think it's a great point and it's one I thought I was thinking about as we were texting
[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:21.380]   about this, but I think the thing that people are celebrating him for are not the things
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:26.180]   that actually have made him great to the extent that he's great, right?
[00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:29.660]   Great success, he's obviously very smart as a businessman, but I don't think people are
[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:32.300]   celebrating him because of business decisions he's made.
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.980]   I think they're celebrating because he shows up on stage wearing a ridiculous outfit and
[00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:41.020]   a gold chain and sunglasses and busts out a chainsaw.
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:50.060]   And I think that gets at a larger problem of like we are maybe judging the winners and
[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:52.980]   losers of this game by the wrong metrics, right?
[00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:58.940]   The fact that you can have pseudo productivity over productivity suggests that there's a
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:02.980]   way to shadow perform your job versus actually doing your job.
[00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:06.540]   And we're out there celebrating people for the ways in which they perform rather than
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:07.540]   the actual work.
[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:11.100]   I don't know if that makes sense, but as we're talking about this, I'm thinking about someone
[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:12.380]   who's like a teacher, right?
[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:16.900]   I can't imagine a teacher has really a form of pseudo productivity because either you're
[00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.700]   like educating the kids or you aren't.
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:24.380]   But someone like in our world, in knowledge work or in jobs where you have a following
[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:29.880]   or you're building a fan base, there is an element of like snake oil and selling yourself
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.660]   that gets in the way of actually making anything, if that makes sense, right?
[00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:35.380]   The selling of the product mattering more than the actual product.
[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:39.340]   But in something like teaching or surgery where the product is how you're evaluated
[00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:44.220]   not based on how you sell it, there isn't as much of an ability to have a pseudo work.
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:45.900]   Does that make sense?
[00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:47.460]   Is that too convoluted?
[00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:48.460]   I buy that.
[00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:49.460]   I buy that.
[00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:55.700]   I mean, and I think it's worth acknowledging what Brad said that, yeah, Elon, I mean, another
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:44:00.860]   way to think about it is he has been very successful with various startups, right?
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:07.300]   So the critique is not that he is bad at technology or bad at startups.
[00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:11.280]   And what an idea that came to mind is I think, okay, here's the other caveat or factor, secondary
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:19.180]   factor I wanted to mention is that there is actually certain areas, context, where a sort
[00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:23.900]   of like 120-hour-a-week workload, workflow matters.
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:29.380]   It's typically in startup culture for like a small portion of the lifestyle of a company,
[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:30.380]   lifeline of a company, right?
[00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.260]   The timeline of a company, right?
[00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:38.460]   So this is very overrepresented in the experience of Silicon Valley serial entrepreneurs.
[00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:40.360]   So I read the Musk biography.
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:42.860]   I've read both of them, actually.
[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:48.420]   And so when SpaceX is getting off the ground, actually like having a singular leader who
[00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:53.520]   just is small enough that he can continually push everyone back to this is what matters
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:57.600]   and keeping them focusing on this and pushing away other things, that is actually a way
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:59.660]   how you get a high-risk startup up and off the ground.
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:02.600]   And he did that at Tesla, and he did that at SpaceX.
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.360]   So part of the problem is, though, is trying to extrapolate that.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:09.400]   Steve Jobs did that early on like with the Mac group at Apple.
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:13.200]   Extrapolating that, though, that this is just how people should work in general, that is
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:14.200]   where the failure is.
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.760]   Musk kind of moves on when he gets bored.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:19.100]   But if you look at all these companies, yes, I wrote about this in my New Yorker piece.
[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:23.200]   When things are small, you might just have a single visionary leader who can hold the
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:24.560]   whole thing together.
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:27.760]   And in fact, that could be necessary for you to actually break out.
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:30.960]   But once your company is large and in the long run, you can't run it that way anymore.
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:34.360]   It's too big, and also it's just not sustainable or useful anymore.
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.960]   So I think that's part of it.
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:39.520]   Another part of it is I want to read this here from Nate Silver, who has been writing
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:43.280]   recently about the question, is Elon Musk smart or not?
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:47.080]   Because he's saying, like what you're pointing out, Brad, it's like, I think it's weird,
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:50.560]   this pushback from the left that he's somehow dumb, right?
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:54.440]   And just like it's somehow artificial.
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:58.080]   And here's what Silver said, which I think is an interesting take.
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:02.600]   He says that "Elon is highly intelligent in several ways does not mean that everything
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:04.340]   he does is brilliant.
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:07.200]   Everything he does are exceptionally dumb or dangerous, and we shouldn't make excuses
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:10.240]   for these to pretend that it's all or part of some master plan.
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:13.460]   But likewise, it's absurd to suggest that Elon isn't brilliant in many respects just
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:15.840]   because he isn't in others.
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:19.080]   And if he merely had very good SAT scores, I don't care.
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:21.240]   But he's demonstrated his intelligence through his accomplishment.
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:26.320]   This is a bit like criticizing Tom Brady because he had mediocre ratings in the NFL Combine."
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:27.320]   And he goes on and on.
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:31.640]   But he argues, you know, Elon is probably neurodivergent, and there are certain things
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:35.060]   he does very well, and there's other things like sort of interacting with normal humans
[00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:42.060]   or like reacting like a normal person on stage, and having feelings, having empathy, having
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:45.060]   any sort of moral compass that he's just really terrible at.
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.660]   So that probably gets at it, right?
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:52.660]   It's like, yeah, A, tech startups, you do go all out often for the first like year,
[00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:54.380]   and that's how these things succeed or fail.
[00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:58.340]   But we can't extrapolate that because if you tried that in many other fields long term,
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:01.920]   including athletic endeavors, including almost any other endeavors, you would burn out.
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:05.720]   And two, yeah, he's like really smart, sort of technical things and visionary things,
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:07.680]   and he's like a pretty terrible person at other things.
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:10.400]   And so both of those things could be true at the same time.
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.240]   And there's probably a lot of luck involved as well, something else we talk about a lot,
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:14.240]   right?
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.240]   Like, yeah.
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:18.600]   I have another take, and I'm shocked that you didn't say this, Cal, because this is
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:21.560]   to me like the ultimate Newportian take.
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:23.220]   Is it Newportian or Newportian?
[00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:24.220]   How would you say that?
[00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:27.080]   This is making me sound like Musk that I have a term named after my name.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.240]   A Newportian take.
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:31.720]   This is the ultimate Newportian take.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:35.460]   It's the simplest take, it's Oskam's razor.
[00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:42.120]   What I was going to say is I don't know if Elon Musk was great five years ago, and it
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:43.800]   depends on how you define great.
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:47.640]   There's a theory that he just put really smart people around him, and he's a sociopath, and
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:50.400]   that's what it takes to win in these kinds of companies.
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.400]   I don't really buy that.
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:55.000]   I think to have multiple successes, I think he's very good at running a startup, like
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.640]   you said.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:02.560]   I just think that he got on Twitter and it turned his brain into sawdust.
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:04.320]   That's the simplest explanation.
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:08.400]   He didn't build any of this stuff after he became addicted to Twitter.
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:10.600]   All this was pre-his Twitter addiction.
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:16.640]   I think he got on Twitter and he tweets 50 times a day, and anyone, if I got on Twitter
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:19.440]   and tweeted 50 times a day, it would ruin my brain.
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:26.600]   I think the real story here is to be wary of social media.
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:27.600]   You hear this too.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:31.240]   When I talk to professional sports teams, the biggest concern they have is players spending
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:32.960]   too much time on social media.
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:33.960]   Why?
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:36.480]   Because they think it takes away from that player's ability to pursue greatness in their
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.680]   sport.
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:42.200]   I think that no one took Elon's phone from him, and you spend that much time on Twitter,
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.760]   it turns your brain to mush.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:44.760]   Yeah.
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:45.760]   No, fair enough.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:48.600]   Maybe we're just talking too much about Elon Musk.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:50.920]   It's only relevant in that he sparked a conversation.
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:51.920]   Yeah.
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:52.920]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:53.920]   He's a hard figure to knock down.
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:58.640]   He was sociopathic, but also fantastic at startups, and then also his brain broke, which
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:48:59.640]   is Sam.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:01.400]   This is Sam Harris's argument.
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:02.400]   He said this on the air.
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:09.200]   He has told this to me individually as well, is because he knows Elon, but now they feud.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.200]   Twitter broke his brain.
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.200]   Yeah.
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:13.200]   You're right.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.200]   It's a cautionary tale.
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:15.520]   But Twitter would break my brain too.
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:20.560]   I think that I just have just enough self-awareness or just enough people in my lives to be like,
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:24.560]   "Man, you're spending too much time on social media," and then I get off.
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:28.880]   Because if I spent as much time on social media as Elon spent, I'd probably be a raging
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:34.020]   leftist instead of a trumper, but it would break my brain because that's the natural
[00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:35.560]   end point of social media.
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:39.880]   But isn't he also important not just for sparking this conversation, but because he is still
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:44.680]   the avatar for a lot of people of greatness.
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:48.040]   That goes back to our conversation of pseudo-greatness versus actual greatness.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:52.480]   I think a lot of people look at him and want to emulate him.
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:56.440]   I think some people would say he's as great as he's ever been at this moment right now.
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:50:02.280]   I think that's part of the problem, is we're oriented towards the wrong horizon in some
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:03.280]   ways.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.920]   I think that's also a larger conversation.
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:11.240]   We talk a lot about ... I think people think they want one thing, but they actually want
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.240]   another.
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:16.240]   If you talk about who emulates greatness in basketball, I think most people are going
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:17.240]   to say Michael Jordan.
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:20.520]   Now, if you took the qualities that Michael Jordan felt on the inside when he was at his
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:23.840]   greatest, this probably wouldn't make you feel good in terms of living that subjective
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:24.840]   experience in your life.
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:28.880]   You might be happier as Nikola Jokic, who seems to have a healthier relationship with
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:29.880]   being a champion.
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:33.920]   But I think we think we want one type of greatness, but what we actually want is a different type.
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:37.560]   I think that disconnect causes a lot of the turmoil.
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:41.480]   I'm going to try to tease that out a little bit more.
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:43.720]   I think that there's still two things at play here.
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:48.360]   The first is performative greatness versus real greatness, performative productivity
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:53.720]   versus real productivity, or pseudo, pick your adjective.
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:59.040]   I still think that's the most important battle for all of us to fight, for Cal to fight,
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:03.800]   for us to continue fighting, for us to fight together, because I think the first misstep
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:09.960]   that people make is they think they want masculinity, but then they go for performative masculinity.
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:12.280]   They think they want greatness, but then they go for performative greatness.
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:15.040]   They think they want an exercise program, and they want to be fit, but then they go
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:16.600]   for performative fitness.
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:20.040]   They think they want a certain family life, but then they go for the performative version.
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:24.600]   It's the, to quote Steve, who's not here, it's the Instagramification of everything.
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:26.900]   And I think that's the first problem.
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:29.880]   Then you overcome that problem, you've already done 90% of the work.
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:34.520]   So now you're able to, in your mind, tease out examples and role models of the real thing
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:36.680]   versus the performative version.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:39.840]   Now when you get to the real thing, things get interesting.
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:46.560]   And then you get to say, is it worth the trade-offs to be Michael Jordan in my pursuit?
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:52.760]   Or can I do this more like Giannis Antetokounmpo, or Nicola Jokic, or Steph Curry than Michael
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:53.760]   Jordan?
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:56.680]   Can I get to greatness while having fun and playfulness?
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:59.000]   Or am I the kind of person that needs to have a chip on my shoulder?
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   Clay, you want to say something?
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:05.240]   - Or just even can I be like Mikhail Bridges, or like Kentavious Caldwell Pope, right?
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.600]   I don't even necessarily need to be an all-star.
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:10.920]   Can I just be the sixth man and be happy with that?
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:11.920]   You know what I mean?
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:15.520]   This is already getting at the thing that I think we're talking about, which is winning.
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:16.760]   Maybe you don't need to be an NBA all-star.
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:20.680]   You can make a pretty good life coming off the bench as the seventh man in the NBA.
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:24.600]   And that's the equivalent of being a middle manager and being the deacon at your church,
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:26.800]   and that's a type of success too.
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:27.800]   - I think that's right.
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:32.280]   And I think all of this, though, comes after separating the bullshit from the real.
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:37.200]   And then once you get to the real, we could have a 40-series episodes or 40-podcast series
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:40.680]   'cause it's such a fascinating question, we're all obsessed with it, which is how do you
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:44.320]   navigate these natural tensions and trade-offs that come with trying to get the best out
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:45.320]   of yourself?
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:48.160]   - Well, so then how would we deal with the other critique that comes from greatness,
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:51.640]   which is it's not fair, right?
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:58.200]   Different people are in different positions that go for different definitions of greatness.
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:05.840]   Michael Jordan was 6'6", which was table stakes for considering basketball to be serious.
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:11.000]   I think this is the second critique from the left, the first being any valoration of greatness
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.640]   is somehow like a capitalist construction, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:20.320]   The second critique is, look, people start from different places, so it's best if we
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:21.800]   just don't talk about it.
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:27.280]   Because some people, I'm a single mom and it's taking every hour with my two shifts
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:33.080]   just to try to keep food on the table for my kids, and I can't go and work on whatever
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:37.880]   scheme to become great in X, Y, and Z, so maybe we should, in the interest of niceness
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:39.360]   and inclusivity, not talk about it.
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:41.200]   So how do we navigate that critique?
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:46.720]   Because that's probably the critique, I would say the elites, anti-greatness elites talk
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:47.720]   more about the theories.
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:52.360]   The critique I would hear most often sort of in my inbox would be of that second type.
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:55.480]   So I take it a little bit more seriously 'cause it's coming from real people.
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:56.600]   And so you gotta help me here.
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:59.800]   I should ask for help, like what's the right way to think about that?
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:02.560]   - I think that's the right critique.
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:08.080]   The right critique being like the much more interesting and I think more valid one.
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:12.840]   Someone who makes this point often is Ezra Klein, and I think he makes it really well.
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:14.040]   And he'll say just that.
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:20.120]   He's like, "My genetics are such that I love reading, that I have an obsessive personality,
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:24.720]   that I can read really fast, and I wasn't born in Syria.
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:27.320]   And if I was born in Syria, I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing.
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:30.000]   If I didn't have these genetics, I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.200]   So am I great or am I just lucky?"
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:37.960]   And my answer to that is yes, like the answer is both.
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:44.200]   So like I think that we have to acknowledge the role of circumstance in luck, in greatness,
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:46.600]   but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't celebrate it.
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:50.520]   I think that we can celebrate it while acknowledging the role of circumstance in luck.
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:56.160]   I think I made a post on Instagram a few weeks ago that essentially says anyone who says,
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:03.600]   "Look how hard I work, look how much I've done, don't tell me I got lucky," well, they
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:08.520]   clearly got lucky because they're too doofus-headed to realize how important luck is.
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:14.560]   But anyone who says, "You don't work hard and you're not that great, you just got lucky,"
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:18.700]   clearly has never worked hard or cared about greatness a day in their life because anyone
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:21.400]   who has skin in the game that's actually doing it knows it's both.
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.200]   It is being born in the right zip code.
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:27.160]   It is having certain genetics, but a lot of people are born in the same zip code as you
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:31.200]   and a lot of people have pretty good genetics and they just chose not to work hard.
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.020]   And that could be for a million different reasons.
[00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:37.600]   I'm not here to make a values judgment about it, but I don't think you should feel bad
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:41.200]   for making the most out of your situation and the most out of your gifts.
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:44.800]   And what's fascinating too, and the last thing I'll say here, is it's an argument that you
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:51.120]   hear out of very real people, and that's why I take it seriously and I appreciate it.
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:57.600]   However, when I've gone and I've given talks on my books in underserved areas, people who
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:03.300]   are born in like truly crappy situations, they're the ones that are the most inspired
[00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:06.000]   by this message of pursue greatness.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.080]   They don't want to hear about how the structure is against them or how they're in an unlucky
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:10.080]   situation.
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:11.520]   They know that because they live that.
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:15.240]   They want to know how can they get better so they can work themselves out of it.
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:23.200]   Yeah, and I think there's absolute greatness, evaluating it across everybody, and then there's
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:27.400]   relative greatness and how great can you be given the circumstances you have, and I think
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:36.400]   our job as a society is to try to give everyone the same opportunity to achieve absolute greatness
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.400]   on that scale.
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:42.720]   But while the reality is still that everything's not going to be equal, you can still be great
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:45.440]   relative to your own circumstances, I think.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:49.560]   So here's where it becomes more complicated because, I mean, I like the way this is set
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:50.560]   up.
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:54.400]   I mean, there's also like a religious, I think it's a Jewish notion of you have to make the
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:56.840]   most of what you have.
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:58.640]   It's not yours to complain, you know.
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:01.200]   If you have a particular gift, you have an obligation to do something that's going to
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:02.680]   help the world with it.
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:06.800]   Given like whatever latitude you have to do that, that'll look very different depending
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:12.320]   on what that would look like in war-torn Syria would be different than, you know, like Ezra
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:14.840]   growing up in Irvine, California or something like this.
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:19.280]   But you have an obligation to do something with whatever gifts you happen to have and
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:22.240]   opportunities you happen to have, do something with it.
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:24.680]   So that's like a notion that's out there.
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:29.080]   And then there's a notion that striving to get better at something important, regardless
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:33.780]   of scale or endpoint, is itself fulfilling, right?
[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:39.200]   And so like do that, and if your endpoints and your opportunities happen to put you on
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:45.160]   like a very notable scale, I'm doing something at a big scale, don't be like Elon Musk about
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:46.160]   it.
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.000]   Don't, you know, have some self-awareness.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.040]   But here's the complicated question I always get back to is like, okay, so how far should
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.040]   you go?
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:58.880]   I don't want to like psychologize this too much, but the pursuit of greatness is complicated,
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:57:59.880]   right?
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:02.400]   Like, I mean, I have a very complicated relationship with it.
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.520]   It's not simple.
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:08.120]   It's not, oh, all of the, it's not, it's all invented and it's all artificial and like
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:10.440]   you'll just feel better if you're just happy doing nothing.
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:14.840]   Like it really does feel good to do things, to get rewarded for it, and to have recognition.
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:16.840]   And it feels good and it can stay with you.
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:20.180]   It's also like really stressful and anxiety producing, and there's a lot of pathologies
[00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:21.320]   that come with it.
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:24.040]   And this is maybe going in a different direction.
[00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:28.920]   But if the idea is like, yeah, greatness is relative, but the point is like the pursuit
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:31.640]   of trying to do something useful with your gifts is important.
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:33.760]   It's a duty and it's going to make you feel better.
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:35.160]   But how far do you go?
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:40.400]   Like what is like most people, how do you figure out the line between Giannis and Jordan,
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:41.400]   you know?
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:43.600]   Or I mean, most of our audience probably doesn't know actually basketball.
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:47.740]   So to use like an actor, I was thinking of like an actor analogy, right?
[00:58:47.740 --> 00:58:52.360]   You know, Paul Rudd versus Daniel Day-Lewis, right?
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:56.880]   Like Paul Rudd, he's good and he got Ant-Man and got paid, you know, and then people like
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:59:00.920]   him, but he's not winning Oscars, right?
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:05.180]   How do – what's the advice there, right, about like how far to go?
[00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:08.040]   What a complicated question that becomes.
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:09.040]   Such a complicated question.
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:12.800]   To try to give a simple answer to a complicated question, for me it's like keep friends
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:17.280]   and family in your life that know who you are and will tell you when you've let greatness
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:21.620]   get in the way of who you actually are and if you're turned into an asshole.
[00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:24.440]   But I know a lot of people don't have that privilege, but I don't know, you got to
[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:25.520]   surround yourself with good people.
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.040]   I tell Jesse not to make eye contact.
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:30.000]   I said, "Don't make eye contact.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   Keep this down."
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.920]   That's what I always say when we're podcasting here.
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:39.680]   So I think that this is really, really hard and I think that the first thing is just to
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:43.380]   be aware that as you're pursuing greatness, whatever that looks like to you, that it comes
[00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:48.160]   with tradeoffs and then to constantly evaluate are the tradeoffs that you're making in
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:54.200]   alignment with your values and to have some minimum effective doses for important things
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:55.600]   in your life.
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:57.560]   So let's make this real.
[00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:59.940]   I might say, "Hey, I've got a book coming out in a year.
[00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:00.940]   I think it's great.
[01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:04.320]   My own personal version of greatness is selling as many books as possible."
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:08.840]   And part of being a great author isn't just writing the book, you have to sell the book.
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:13.840]   However, I'm going to do everything I can to sell that book and I'm still going to
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:17.240]   coach my kids' basketball and baseball team and I'm not going to miss that.
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.160]   I'm not going to miss those games.
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:21.800]   I'm only going to travel twice a month.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:28.280]   I am not going to miss family dinners, so on and so forth.
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:32.840]   I'm going to make sure that I exercise for at least 45 minutes a day.
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:37.040]   Once I hit those minimum effective dose for the other important areas of my life, then
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.160]   it's all in.
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.400]   So I'm all in, but not all the time.
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:45.600]   And I think every person has a different temperament in a different situation in their life where
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.760]   how they answer that question will look different and it will also look different at different
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.840]   points of your life.
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:55.800]   Someone who has a temperament that is maybe less inclined towards their family, well,
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.760]   their minimum effective doses are going to be less than mine.
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:02.320]   Someone whose temperament is more inclined toward family and community, their minimum
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.980]   effective doses are going to be higher than mine.
[01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:06.840]   It's not good or bad, it just is.
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:12.600]   And I think that people who achieve greatness on a planetary scale, the LeBron James and
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:21.080]   really any NBA player or coach, their unique mix of genetics and situation is such that
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:25.880]   they're just okay putting other parts of their life aside more than I might be.
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:32.200]   I mean, I think about this often with, and these are people that I admire, like JJ Reddick.
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:33.520]   Seems like a really good guy.
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:36.840]   I feel like I know him because I've long listened to his various podcasts.
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:37.840]   He seems normal.
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.840]   He's very thoughtful.
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:39.840]   He's very, very smart.
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:42.160]   He was a hell of an NBA basketball player.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.300]   Had a great career.
[01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:49.920]   Well, after his career, instead of retiring and hanging out in like building tables in
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:55.220]   his basement and whatever, posting on Instagram once a day, he took a job traveling all over
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:58.960]   the country, arguably traveling more than when he was a player so that he could be an
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:01.400]   analyst talking about basketball.
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.680]   And then he took a job as the head coach of the Lakers.
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:06.760]   That's not good or bad, that just is.
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:11.880]   But clearly, JJ Reddick finds more value in that than doing other things.
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:14.340]   And I just think you should never work against yourself.
[01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:19.280]   For JJ Reddick to say, "I'm not going to do this because I should be spending more time
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:23.520]   with my family and my friends," that's not core to who he is.
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.440]   But the flip side of that is also true.
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:29.040]   If you're saying, "I feel like I should be spending more time with my family and friends,
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:33.320]   but society is pushing me to sell more books, so I'm going to focus more on shilling my
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:36.180]   books," that's also not true to who you are.
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:38.680]   So I really think this comes down to knowing who you are and knowing your values and then
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:43.240]   getting as much out of yourself as you can within those constraints, all the while knowing
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:46.360]   that this changes at different points in time and different points of your life.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.360]   All right.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:48.360]   So I'll try to summarize this.
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:49.360]   All right.
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:50.360]   I'm going to...
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:51.360]   I've summarized our advice.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:54.160]   Then you got to tell me if you agree with this.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.340]   All right.
[01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:59.680]   So one thing we're saying is maybe it's easier to stop using the word greatness.
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:02.720]   Here's what you really should think about.
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:03.720]   Pick a craft.
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:04.720]   Let's use the word craft.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:11.680]   Pick a craft that you're well suited for, both in terms of your abilities and just opportunities
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.120]   in your life.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.800]   Strive to get better at that craft.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:17.920]   Practice quiet gratitude.
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:22.040]   So you should have pride and have gratitude for, "Hey, I'm getting better, and this is
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.280]   important, and I feel good about it," but be quiet about it.
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:27.140]   Don't run around the stage with a proverbial chainsaw.
[01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:30.320]   At the same time, have well-defined minimum effective doses for other things that matter
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:31.520]   to you in your life.
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:34.320]   These will differ between different people, but you got to be super clear about what they
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:36.040]   are at the moment, and you have to stick to them.
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.720]   If they're going to shift, then you got to shift them and be clear about it.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.720]   All right.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:42.720]   I'm going to coach this team for two years, and that's shifting, but never take that for
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.720]   granted.
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:44.720]   Know what that is.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:47.200]   That is the template for greatness.
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:54.180]   So then what should commentators like us or people writing other op-eds in New York Times,
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:57.240]   what then is our role in this?
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:00.360]   One way to think about it is getting rid of the stuff that gets in the way of that.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:03.080]   Pseudo productivity gets in the way of that.
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:06.280]   Pseudo greatness, flexing online gets in the way of that.
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:10.440]   So those who are public figures writing or thinking about this, that's what we should
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:14.280]   be doing, is maybe not trying to find whatever, the theoretical substructure that explains
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:18.640]   the universe, but help people identify and sidestep the craft that gets in the way of
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:21.920]   real greatness, which is picking a craft you're well-suited for, trying to get better at it,
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:26.600]   quiet gratitude, coupled with minimum effective doses.
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:30.060]   I think that's great, and then this sounds a little bit woo-woo, but the only thing I'd
[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:36.320]   add is really know yourself and then pursue your own personal version of greatness, and
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:40.560]   don't let society shape that for you in either direction.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:45.640]   If you are the person that just wants to be the stay-at-home parent, and you're going
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:49.120]   to be the best stay-at-home parent, and when you're being a stay-at-home parent, you feel
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:52.320]   like you're living your life's purpose, that is awesome.
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:53.320]   That is incredible.
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:55.100]   That is what you ought to do.
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:05:00.920]   If you are the person that can't stand an hour of being the primary parent, but every
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:05.080]   cell in your body tells you to go to medical school and to try to be the best surgeon that
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:09.540]   you can be, you should go be the best surgeon that you can be.
[01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:12.240]   Don't compare yourself to different people, because they have different temperaments and
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.240]   values than you.
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:18.120]   They're wired differently, and in both of those cases, don't be an insufferable asshole
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:19.440]   about it.
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:20.880]   Do it with quiet gratitude.
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:22.720]   Let the work speak for itself.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:27.900]   Yeah, and I think to go back to your question, Cal, about what is our role in this, I mean,
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:31.820]   I think this one's really hard to make actionable, but the way I think about it is, and you wrote
[01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:37.700]   about this a lot in your last book, Slow Productivity, but just make sure that the noise we're making
[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.860]   is actually meaningful.
[01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:40.860]   It's really difficult, right?
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:43.460]   Because you've got to make noise to sell what you're making.
[01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:48.380]   I think part of the problem is here is we live in such a noisy world, and when you live
[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:53.940]   in a cafeteria where everyone's screaming, that's how you get to a guy up on stage prancing
[01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:57.140]   a chainsaw, because he's making more noise than everyone else.
[01:05:57.140 --> 01:06:03.900]   But again, that's really hard to apply that across society, to tell people we should all
[01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:07.980]   be making less noise and make that noise better and more meaningful and higher quality, to
[01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:12.180]   use a word you've used, but I do think that is part of our responsibility, right?
[01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:16.580]   We aren't just going to get on here and talk about bullshit, because we want to give you
[01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:19.320]   guys listeners something to listen to.
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:23.220]   We're going to get on here and we feel like we have something to add to the conversation.
[01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:25.780]   >> You know who's an interesting model for this?
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:32.740]   I feel like whenever I listen to a podcast that's hosted by or has on a guest a Navy
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:39.060]   SEAL, and tell me if you've had the same experience, they don't like bluster.
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:44.380]   I think they don't like bluster, and probably because that's a community where you'll get
[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:47.420]   your ass kicked if you're strutting around and you're whatever.
[01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:53.620]   I don't know what it is, but I've listened to a few of these podcasts, and it's an interesting
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:55.740]   – because I'm trying to think of an example on the right.
[01:06:55.740 --> 01:07:00.020]   We're kind of saying to the left, "Okay, will you stop pathologizing greatness with
[01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:01.300]   theoretical frameworks?"
[01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:04.380]   What we need to do is fix the definition and get rid of the stuff that gets in the way
[01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:05.660]   of the useful definition.
[01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:09.340]   On the right, we're sort of saying, "Stop bicep flex greatness."
[01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:13.860]   It's sort of very performative, like, "Hey, I'm going to talk about my bench press on
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:15.060]   Instagram," or this or that.
[01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:16.820]   I'm trying to give an example on the right.
[01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:17.820]   Look towards this.
[01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:19.100]   I don't know.
[01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:20.100]   Maybe it's special forces.
[01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:25.180]   Some of those guys, at least the SEALs, they also don't tend to be, just for practical
[01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:29.300]   purposes, super swole when they're still on the teams because it's inefficient to carry
[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:35.340]   around that much muscle weight, and they tend to be – they really don't like to brag.
[01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:37.420]   Maybe that's – there's an example there.
[01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:42.100]   They get really good at what they do and have a culture of like, we get really upset if
[01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:46.500]   someone starts sounding off too much, gets a little bit too proud.
[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:49.740]   But they're great at what they do, and they strive, and it's useful, and there's utility
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:50.740]   to it.
[01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:54.300]   So maybe that's our example from the right.
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:57.100]   Yeah, and there's no pseudo productivity there in the SEALs.
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:00.620]   You can't pretend to be working, I don't think, when you're a Navy SEAL.
[01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:05.140]   Right, and it's entirely different because what I like about the Navy SEAL example is
[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:11.660]   it has like the ultimate foil, which is, over the last two years, there's been this movement
[01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:17.340]   where people sell like a one-week retreat where you train like a SEAL, and it's the
[01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:18.820]   fakest bullshit ever.
[01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:24.060]   It's like you sign up and you pay someone $10,000 to scream at you for a week, and that's
[01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:26.540]   not at all what actual – like, I've talked to Navy SEALs.
[01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:31.060]   That's not what they do in their training.
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:37.060]   What I would say is that unfortunately, I think a lot of Navy SEALs now see performative
[01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:43.500]   greatness everywhere, and they say like they're probably more in our camp, which is just like
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:49.500]   being an honest person and having some integrity in how you think about these topics and talk
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:50.500]   about them.
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:59.380]   But yes, if the right wants manly, honorable, conservative – but the Elon Musk with the
[01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:02.380]   chainsaw, there's nothing conservative or honorable about it.
[01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:05.900]   That's why this all gets to be like really hard when you actually talk about political.
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:12.940]   But yes, the traditional conservative, honorable, masculine example of this would 100% be a
[01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:16.380]   soldier who we ought to respect because they serve their country.
[01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:21.820]   They put their life on the line, and they pursue their own version of greatness with
[01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:22.820]   no BS.
[01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:28.100]   That used to be the right, I think, like 15 years ago.
[01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:29.940]   So we could just blame social media for everything.
[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:33.900]   The SEAL, by the way, I was thinking about, I was listening to a podcast by Andy Stumpf
[01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:42.820]   who is pretty cynical about the Navy and is just like to a fault, hates to be self-praising
[01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:44.060]   on anything.
[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:47.140]   Then it turns out more recently, I think not only was he a SEAL, but he was in SEAL Team
[01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:48.140]   Six.
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:52.860]   He was like an elite of an elite, and he's uncomfortable even people just like valorizing
[01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:53.860]   Navy SEALs in general.
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:56.300]   He says, "Oh, we're not so great."
[01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:57.300]   That caught my attention.
[01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:58.300]   I think it's kind of the same way.
[01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:05.380]   He's a gruff guy, and he posts those pictures of his watch, which that's its own thing.
[01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:11.540]   But if you listen to his podcast, really what he cares about is his men and the stories
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:13.280]   of what people have gone through.
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:18.820]   Most of his podcast is having on veterans and talking through, and the thing that haunts
[01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:22.420]   him is the men he lost in Iraq.
[01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:23.420]   So it's interesting.
[01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:25.940]   He's big, and he's black belt in jiu-jitsu or whatever.
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:27.940]   Man, that guy does not brag.
[01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:32.980]   I feel like he could put me into a stuff sack if he got mad at me.
[01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:36.340]   He would just go like that.
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:38.780]   But he doesn't go around acting like that's the case.
[01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:39.780]   I don't know.
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:42.260]   I think between our basketball references and our Navy SEAL references, we have now
[01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:43.260]   officially...
[01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:44.260]   I'm checking the notes here.
[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:46.340]   Yeah, we've lost every female listener to this episode.
[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:48.820]   I think the last one just left.
[01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:53.660]   When I said Contavious Caldwell Pope, I knew that was going to be a big drop off in the
[01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:54.660]   listenership.
[01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:59.660]   With the door shut, I think, in the background, with the screen door slamming shut as someone
[01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:01.060]   walked off into the field.
[01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:02.060]   Yeah.
[01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:03.580]   Yeah, but it's...
[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:06.740]   I don't know.
[01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:12.100]   This example is, I think, gender neutral, and maybe we should catch ourselves in the
[01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:19.480]   examples that we're using, but Serena Williams, there is a fierceness in her style is very
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:25.580]   bold, and she was known for yelling at officials and screaming during points, but she wasn't
[01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:26.580]   faking it.
[01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:29.580]   She's the greatest tennis player of all time.
[01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:34.660]   Kaitlyn Clark plays with a lot of pizzazz on the basketball court.
[01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:39.380]   She's the greatest collegiate basketball player of all time, probably across both sexes, but
[01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:41.940]   she wasn't faking it.
[01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:45.620]   It wasn't performative.
[01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:51.980]   Maybe a place to drive this home is I put something up on social media, although I'm
[01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:56.500]   trying not to ruin my brain, where I essentially say LeBron James doesn't have to be parading
[01:11:56.500 --> 01:12:01.460]   around with a chainsaw because he's too busy shooting his 2,000 jump shots, and that's
[01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:03.380]   real greatness.
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:09.300]   Someone commented, "Yeah, but Elon Musk is so WWE, worldwide wrestling entertainment,
[01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:10.980]   and it's awesome."
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:15.980]   And I immediately thought, and I commented back, and I said, "Yeah, for pure entertainment
[01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:21.720]   value, it is, but if you want to watch real wrestling, you go to the University of Iowa,
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:26.720]   and I bet you can't name one guy on that wrestling team, but it's arguably the greatest sports
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.780]   program in history.
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:29.780]   That's real wrestling."
[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:31.220]   And you know what this guy said?
[01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:35.260]   He said, "Touché, I've been owned on the internet today."
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:39.700]   But it's waking people up to that, and hopefully that guy had a realization, like, "Whoa, you're
[01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:40.700]   right."
[01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:43.860]   If you're watching Elon on stage, you can go down the YouTube wormhole and watch some
[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:50.740]   videos about the Iowa wrestling program, but that gets back to just calling out pseudo-greatness
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:53.460]   without saying greatness is bad, with saying, "Hey, you want greatness?
[01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:54.460]   Look at the real thing.
[01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:55.780]   Admire that over there."
[01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:57.020]   That's our job.
[01:12:57.020 --> 01:13:01.380]   - What I'm seeing here, this commenter said, "Touché, his name is Sradd Bulberg."
[01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:02.700]   I don't know, man.
[01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:07.460]   I think this is, his picture looks a lot like you with a mustache.
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:08.460]   I don't know.
[01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:10.380]   I've seen him show up a lot.
[01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:11.660]   He really likes your work.
[01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:13.100]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:14.100]   You're too funny, Cal.
[01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:19.900]   No, the actual commenter, I'm not gonna name anyone's name that's not appropriate, but
[01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:28.020]   it's definitely one of these manly dudes who has "Trainer" in his name, and who you go
[01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:32.300]   to his profile and has a Roman gladiator aesthetic.
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:35.580]   - I feel like if you send that guy to Iowa Wrestling Videos, given what's already in
[01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:38.700]   his algorithm, he's going down, you're gonna get him red-pilled.
[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:44.300]   So maybe he shouldn't be watching Iowa Wrestling, but you know.
[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:45.300]   - But that's my point.
[01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:48.860]   It's the WWE version versus the real thing, and that cuts across everything.
[01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:53.620]   And I think the left is too quick to throw the baby out with the bathwater and say, "It's
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:54.620]   all bad."
[01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:59.700]   And the right is too quick to actually mistake the WWE version for the real thing.
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:03.380]   And the people wrestling at Iowa have no time for either, 'cause they're too busy trying
[01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:04.380]   to be great at what they do.
[01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:05.380]   - Yeah, no, I like that.
[01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:06.380]   I like that.
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:07.380]   I like that.
[01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:08.380]   Yeah, there's a better way to think about it.
[01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:11.380]   So have we solved all the problems?
[01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:12.380]   - We did.
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:13.380]   - I don't know if we solved all of them.
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:14.380]   I don't know if we solved any of them.
[01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:15.380]   I hope we were great.
[01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:22.760]   - Well, I am gonna parade around with a chainsaw after this episode, just to lean into my greatness.
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:24.340]   - The new Porsche and chainsaw?
[01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:26.180]   - Hold up my Webby Award or whatever.
[01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:28.300]   - It shouldn't be a chainsaw, though.
[01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:34.780]   If it's Cal, it should be like a time block planning book, what's like the manifestation
[01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:36.740]   of time block planning, I'm trying to think.
[01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:37.740]   - My planner.
[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:42.120]   - Maybe it is a chainsaw, and you're just cutting everything that's not productive out
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:43.500]   of your day.
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:44.500]   - Cut it out of my way.
[01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:45.500]   - Scissors.
[01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:51.420]   - Other losers aren't doing this 'cause they're losers, but I deep work for 19 hours a day,
[01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:53.900]   'til my rectum bleeds.
[01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:55.740]   That's what a man does.
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:58.620]   - I forgot my partner's name.
[01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:01.620]   My kid only knows me because they see me on TV.
[01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:05.500]   I know my partner by the nickname Roadblock, 'cause that's what I see her as.
[01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:06.500]   - Oh, man.
[01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:09.060]   - The road to greatness.
[01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:14.900]   - Yeah, this is the problem, and this is the kind of greatness that we need to continue
[01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:19.340]   to call out, and as a listener, hopefully you found this helpful.
[01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:23.980]   Hopefully this helps you define the role of greatness in your own life, and I think that
[01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:28.700]   once you, hopefully we've helped you see the difference between the performative Kabuki
[01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:31.900]   version and the real version, and it's the kind of thing where once you see it, you can't
[01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:36.340]   unsee it, and now that your radar is fine tuned to this, I suspect you'll start seeing
[01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:41.620]   it everywhere, and I think it's a really good way to decipher between signal and noise,
[01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:46.060]   and I'd encourage all of you, as you look for examples in your own life and sources
[01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:51.780]   of inspiration, to identify the noise and try to minimize it, and then to follow good
[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:52.780]   signal.
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:53.780]   - Yeah, I agree.
[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:56.100]   All right, well, gentlemen, thank you.
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:59.900]   A pleasure talking, and I'm glad we could share this with our audiences as well.
[01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:03.060]   So, I guess we have to get back to crushing it.
[01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:04.060]   - All right.
[01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:05.060]   - Gotta go win.
[01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:06.060]   Gotta go win.
[01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:07.060]   - Let's go win.
[01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:08.060]   - Thank you, Cal.
[01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:09.060]   - All I do is win.
[01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:10.060]   - Thank you.
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:11.060]   Thank you, Cal.
[01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:12.060]   Thank you, Clay.
[01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:16.940]   Thank you, Jesse, in the background, for doing the production, and hopefully we'll make this
[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:18.860]   a more regular occurrence.
[01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:19.860]   - All right.
[01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:20.860]   Talk soon.
[01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:27.580]   That was my discussion with Brad and Clay, brought to you by the Land Rover Defender.
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:30.780]   Visit LandRoverUSA.com to learn more about the Defender.
[01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:35.700]   It's funny that they sponsored this particular episode, because Brad's neighbor in Asheville
[01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:39.900]   just bought a Defender, and he's always sending me photos of it, because he likes to look
[01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:40.900]   at that car.
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:46.400]   So, go to LandRoverUSA.com if you want to see what is this car that keeps being a part
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:48.660]   of Brad and I's life, whether we want it to or not.
[01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:50.220]   All right, I like that discussion.
[01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:51.700]   I think we covered a lot of ground.
[01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:52.700]   We got practical.
[01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:53.980]   We got philosophical.
[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:59.780]   This idea of having people I know and who have been on the show before join me for an
[01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:03.380]   in-depth episode to talk about something timely, this is new.
[01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:06.620]   It wasn't the original intention for this series, but maybe it's something I'll play
[01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:08.140]   around with as time goes on.
[01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:12.900]   If there's other things that come up in the news, or a new book, or a new sort of cultural
[01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:19.140]   trend that I think my existing group of writer friends might have an interesting thing to
[01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:21.020]   say, maybe we'll do a few more of these episodes.
[01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:26.300]   But in the meantime, I have what I think of as a spring season lined up for more semi-regular
[01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:27.300]   in-depth episodes.
[01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:29.980]   I have a few writers I want to have on.
[01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:34.260]   I have at least one repeat guest in mind who I want to try to convince to come back in
[01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:35.260]   the show.
[01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:37.860]   I'll give you a hint, he's in the woods for a month right now, so I want to hear about
[01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:38.860]   how that goes.
[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:40.460]   So, anyways, I'm trying to do more of this.
[01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:44.700]   I took a little bit of a hiatus during the late fall and winter, but I want to get back
[01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:45.700]   to it.
[01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:46.700]   So, stay tuned on our normal feed.
[01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:50.500]   I'll release these as I finish, but otherwise, Monday, you've got my normal episodes.
[01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:55.420]   I hope you enjoy this one, I hope you enjoy the ones to come, and until then, as always,
[01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:56.420]   stay deep.
[01:17:56.420 --> 01:18:00.100]   Hey, if you like this video, I think you'll really like this one as well.
