[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.640]   - Welcome back to a new week of episodes
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.520]   on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.960]   Last Friday in episode 577,
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.880]   we talked about the dangers inherent
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.580]   with digital communications technology.
[00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.120]   I think we all sense this is a topic that's important,
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.800]   and yet we really don't know and understand
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.160]   what all the dangers are of that technology at this stage.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.320]   This technology, of course,
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.040]   is wrapped up into all of our lives.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.760]   We're using it right now,
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.320]   and I'm on the phone again with Dr. Bruce Heidmarsch,
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.680]   a historian and the James M. Houston
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.000]   Professor of Spiritual Theology
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.200]   at Regent College in Vancouver.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.920]   Bruce, most of us simply cannot disconnect
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.720]   and become digital monks,
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.400]   so we need to master the art of technology fasting.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.920]   What are some practical helps for doing this well?
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.840]   - I think that's really good,
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.520]   and I wanna talk a little bit about fasting,
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.720]   'cause I think that's the right kind of way
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.960]   to begin to think and reframe this.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.160]   I think the first thing we need to do in our churches
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.000]   and in our discipleship context
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.960]   is to do what you've just done, is to name it,
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.080]   to name the task and to acknowledge it,
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.520]   because it can become invisible.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.800]   It's just, it's the environment you live in.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.560]   We need to acknowledge that we're going to need
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.640]   to experiment with disciplines,
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.620]   with practices that help us live in this world,
[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.160]   and see what helps.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.800]   And maybe we will need,
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.480]   I'd like to make a call for some people
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.600]   to be actually to be digital monks,
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.120]   and some people to be digital hermits,
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.680]   to preserve and report back
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.920]   what it's like to live another way.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.020]   "It won't be long," says the historian,
[00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.460]   "until we have no one left
[00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.280]   "who'll be able to remember what it was like
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.920]   "to live before computers or to live before the internet.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.780]   "We'll have no one left who is formed
[00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.700]   "in their mind and heart
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.240]   "and their habits by another reality."
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.640]   And some digital hermits,
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.160]   like it's good to have some astronauts
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.580]   who can report back what it's like
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.160]   to live in another reality.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.440]   I think there may be some people
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.360]   who actually are called to see how far they can unplug
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.640]   and live that way,
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.480]   not everyone, but some people.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.640]   And then I think what's not required
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.960]   for all people at all times
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.120]   should be still relevant to all Christians at some times.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.600]   And that's like fasting.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.040]   I think that's a great model.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.120]   Saying no to something good to say yes to something better.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.960]   Checking that we have not become addicted and enslaved.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.800]   And making space for God.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.640]   And I think here's where realistic practices
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.120]   that limit the dangers of the technology
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.840]   and seeing what's going to be helpful
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.240]   in our own discipleship.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.520]   Once we recognize the need for it,
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.080]   I think there's lots of room for experimenting.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.640]   I have a friend who, he's a college professor.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.840]   He doesn't check his email until 4 p.m.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.320]   That's his rule of life.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.500]   Doesn't check his email until 4 p.m.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.360]   And he actually, one day a week he sits
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.480]   and he just works in the kind of coffee shop area
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.480]   so he can meet face to face with students
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.800]   and they know he's available.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.720]   They don't have to just email him.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.160]   I have another friend, a senior scholar,
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.200]   who his rule of life is he checks his email twice a day,
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.040]   but no more.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.920]   I put away my smartphone, shut down my email on Sundays.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.960]   They have one day a week
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.600]   when I fast a little bit digitally.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.560]   Some people will need to put their smartphone
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.120]   in another room than their bedroom.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.400]   So it's not the first thing they look at in the morning.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.240]   They can begin with prayer and Bible reading
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.880]   and have a space for that
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.680]   rather than immediately jumping on digital media.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.800]   I think it's also important to have,
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.640]   you say no to something to say yes to something else.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.880]   So maybe while one gives up email,
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.660]   one chooses to write a letter to somebody
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.160]   with pen and ink and paper.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.840]   It's a wonderful way to try to say something
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.560]   that has a different kind of impact.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.880]   Garrison Keillor called this handmade writing.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.000]   But there's other focal practices
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.520]   that put us in touch with creation
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.760]   and with our bodies and with other people.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.760]   Walking outdoors with loved ones,
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.800]   gardening, reading a book, slow food,
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.600]   taking time to make a meal over a long period of time.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.600]   Focal practices that actually reground our lives
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.880]   and do a lot of good things.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.200]   I think we can use technology to limit technology,
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.600]   use reminders to shut off the phone and pray,
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.800]   filters, I think probably everyone should have filtering
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.440]   and accountability software of some kind on their computers
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.240]   and their phones and their devices.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.000]   I think it's also important that our digital world
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.820]   is not by default secular.
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.120]   So we need ways of acknowledging that in my world of email
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.920]   and texting and Facebook, it's not simply a secular world.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.220]   God is there, that scripture and prayer
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.040]   and Christian fellowship, all the things
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.360]   that constitute the Christian life
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.440]   are present in my digital world.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.440]   I don't just leave that as an alien world to God, he's there.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.080]   I think one of the most important focal practices
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.160]   that Christians could do as,
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.960]   so there's some element of saying no of fasting,
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.320]   at least from time to time, but is to recommit ourselves.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.600]   And so here's a practical suggestion,
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.900]   but to reinvigorate the practice of eating,
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.940]   of sitting down at a meal together
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.660]   with those that you love, of opening the table
[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.100]   to friends and neighbors.
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.380]   And that is, I just heard a lecture yesterday
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.380]   on a fellow talking about Christianity and Islam.
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.460]   And the conclusion to his lecture was,
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.900]   invite somebody, invite a Muslim into your home for a meal.
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.800]   And that was the most radical thing
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.240]   he felt like you could do as a longtime missionary
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.240]   to the Muslim world is hospitality,
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.840]   listening to somebody's story face to face.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.280]   They said, I guarantee you by the end of the conversation,
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.240]   they'll ask you about your religion
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.760]   and ask you about your faith.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.080]   He says, I've seen it time and time again.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.080]   When we were, I was concerned when our kids were
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.280]   sort of junior high, high school age,
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.080]   that we hadn't established a practice
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.160]   that I had experienced in my own family growing up
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.440]   of actually reading the Bible
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.760]   and praying together as a family.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.720]   And just life was so busy
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.720]   and everybody's pulled every direction.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.400]   And what we did is my wife and I committed ourselves
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.040]   to getting up early in the morning before our kids
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.320]   and making a really big hot breakfast.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.280]   It was gonna be bacon and eggs,
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.720]   or it was gonna be pancakes,
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.160]   or it was gonna be homemade scones,
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.280]   but making a really nice big breakfast for the kids.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.080]   And in the context of gathering around the meal
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.720]   in the morning, reading the scripture and praying together.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.520]   And I'm just so grateful that our children
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.600]   will have some memory, they're adults now,
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.080]   that they will have a memory that we did that.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.660]   And I wish we'd done it longer and done it more.
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.720]   So I think we need to give attention to the ways
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.440]   in which it's not just saying no to some things,
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.480]   but it's actually reinvigorating other things
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.400]   that are very, very life-giving
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.280]   and that we ground our discipleship.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.400]   - That is really helpful for parents and couples
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.400]   as we think of hospitality and of our homes
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.500]   and the embodied traditions and patterns
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.720]   we wanna build into our lives,
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.560]   especially in reaching the lost.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.560]   Thank you, Dr. Hyde-Marsh for that focus.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.600]   For now, I have time for one more question for you,
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.800]   and it relates to the issue of workaholism,
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.760]   of finding our identity in our careers
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.860]   and the inherent dangers of this.
[00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.120]   I know you have some thoughts about this,
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.000]   and I wanna get your perspective next time.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.400]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.520]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.720]   (silence)
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.880]   (silence)
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.040]   (silence)
