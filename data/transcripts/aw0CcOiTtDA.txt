[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240]   Well, did Abraham laugh God off in unbelief?
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.000]   It's a great question and it comes to us from Jessica who lives in the Netherlands.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.680]   "Dear Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.800]   In Genesis, we read of Abraham going along with Sarah's plan with Hagar to make Ishmael
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.800]   his heir."
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.320]   That's Genesis 16, verses 1 to 16.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.960]   "Later, when God tells him, he and Sarah will bear a child at 190 years old, respectively,
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.440]   he seems to laugh it off in unbelief."
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.680]   That's Genesis 17, 17.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.520]   "Therefore, how is it that in Romans chapter 4, Paul celebrates Abraham's unwavering faith?"
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.560]   Does it tell us anything about how God views our own wavering faith in the end, Pastor
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.560]   John?
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.000]   What would you say to Jessica?
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:56.700]   This is a good example of how careful we should be not to read into a text something from
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:06.340]   our own experience that makes an interpretation seem likely, but rather let the context decide
[00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.560]   whether it's likely or not.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:18.380]   So the question is, did Abraham's laughter in Genesis 17, 17 signify the kind of weakened
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.920]   faith or unbelieving doubt, wavering as she calls it, because that's the way it's translated
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.760]   in Romans, that Paul said Abraham did not have?
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.560]   Is Genesis 17, 17 in conflict with what Paul says?
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.060]   So the Old Testament context goes like this.
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.420]   This is Genesis 17, 15 following.
[00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:50.340]   "God said to Abraham, 'As for Sarai, your wife, you shall not call her name.'"
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.860]   Is somebody chopping down a tree?
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.860]   Yes, they're sawing somewhere.
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.380]   I hope it's not one of my trees.
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.060]   Well stop now.
[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.500]   Let's see if we can continue.
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.900]   Go ahead and pick it up where you left off.
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.980]   The Old Testament context goes like this.
[00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.220]   This is Genesis 17, 15 to 17.
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:18.220]   "God said to Abraham, 'As for Sarai, your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but
[00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.260]   Sarai shall be her name.
[00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.260]   I will bless her, and moreover, I will give you a son by her.'"
[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:34.180]   Now this is at 90 years old for her and barren all her life, and now postmenopausal, according
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.180]   to 1811.
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:44.580]   "I will bless her, and she shall become nations, kings of peoples shall come from her.
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.740]   Then Abraham fell on his face."
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.740]   This is the key verse.
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.740]   This is verse 17.
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.900]   "Abraham fell on his face and laughed and said to himself, 'Shall a child be born to
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.380]   a man who is a hundred years old?
[00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.540]   Shall Sarah, who is 90 years old, bear a child?'"
[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:09.940]   Now here's what Paul says about Abraham's faith at that time, and the reason this matters
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:18.220]   for us is that Paul makes clear in Romans 4.23 that these words were not spoken just
[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.180]   for Abraham, but for us also, so that the righteousness that was imputed to him might
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.720]   be imputed to us through faith alone as well.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.140]   So this is not a merely marginal illustration for Paul.
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.300]   This is central to our own faith.
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.780]   So here's Paul's description of Abraham's response to God at that time.
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.340]   Here's Romans 4.17.
[00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.940]   "God says to Abraham, 'I have made you the father of many nations in the presence
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:56.420]   of the God in whom you believed,'" referring back to 15.6 of Genesis, "who gives life
[00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.020]   to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist.
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.340]   In hope he believed against hope that he should become the father of many nations, as he had
[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.420]   been told, 'So shall your offspring be.'
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:18.380]   He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead since
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.700]   he was about a hundred years old, or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.700]   womb.
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.580]   No unbelief made him waver."
[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:34.480]   Now literally the translation there is, "He did not doubt in unbelief concerning the promise
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.420]   of God, but he grew strong."
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:44.020]   Literally he was strengthened—passive voice—"he was strengthened in faith, giving glory to
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.860]   God, fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.
[00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.660]   That is why faith was counted to him as righteousness."
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:58.660]   Now that's the end of Paul's assessment of Abraham's faith there in Genesis 17.
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:05.620]   So six times Paul affirms Abraham's faith in response to God's promise that he would
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:13.460]   have an heir from his own 100-year-old body and from Sarah's 90-year-old barren body.
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.260]   One, he says, the presence of God in whom he believed.
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.100]   Two, in hope he believed against hope.
[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.900]   Three, he did not weaken in faith.
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.380]   Four, he did not doubt in unbelief.
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.820]   Five, he was strengthened in faith.
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.260]   Six, he was fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.260]   That's amazing.
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.940]   That is really clear, right?
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:42.620]   You know what Paul thinks anyway about Abraham's faith from Genesis 17.
[00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:48.260]   Now here's an interesting possible confirmation before we turn to the Old Testament context
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.420]   for a minute.
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.780]   Here's an interesting confirmation from Jesus in John 8, 56.
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:03.100]   Jesus says to the Jewish leaders, "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day.
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:09.340]   He saw it and was glad."
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:18.660]   What does gladness refer to when Jesus says Abraham saw the day of Christ and was glad?
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:24.420]   Could it be the laughter of Genesis 17?
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:35.420]   God gave Abraham a glimpse of Christ in the sense that Genesis 17, 1 to 19 says repeatedly
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:44.860]   six times that Abraham would have offspring of his own who would be the heir of the promise.
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:50.900]   And we know that Paul in Galatians saw that offspring as Christ.
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:58.020]   So I just can't help but wonder when Jesus said, "He saw my day and was glad," he might
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:08.420]   have had in mind, "He saw my day in the promises of Genesis 17 and he laughed aloud with gladness."
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.460]   Well, I can't prove that.
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:18.820]   But what is clear is that Paul sees Abraham's faith as strong and exemplary for us, even
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.500]   though not perfect.
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.300]   So here's the question.
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:28.700]   Whether the clues in Genesis are sufficient to say, "Paul got this right."
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:34.540]   I mean, that's what Jessica is asking, because when she reads verse 17 of Genesis 17, it
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.380]   sounds to her like Abraham is just blowing it off, like he's laughing it out of court.
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:46.020]   That can't be, which sounds like a wavering of faith, a weakening, a doubting of faith.
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.540]   So let me just give a list of clues that I think Paul got it right.
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.960]   In other words, if I ask myself, "What did Paul see?"
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.820]   In the context, this is what I think he saw.
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:05.760]   In Genesis 15, 6, Abraham looked at the stars, listened to God, and believed the promise
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.780]   that his descendants would be like that.
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:08.780]   He says so.
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.860]   He believed God and God counted it to him as righteousness.
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:18.300]   Second, Abraham asks God what evidence God would give him that the covenant would be
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:25.060]   kept, and amazingly, in Genesis 15, 18, God acts out a kind of covenant ceremony in which
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:32.040]   animals are cut in half and God passes between them as if to say, "May I be cut in pieces
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:37.740]   if I don't keep my half of this covenant to make your seed nations."
[00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:46.700]   Third, God renews the promise in Genesis 17, 4 that he would, Abraham would father many
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:53.900]   nations and he changes Abraham's name from Abram to Abraham to show how certain this
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:54.900]   is.
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.100]   This is as good as done.
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.860]   You have a name and Abraham embraces that.
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:05.660]   And then fourth, in verse 17, it doesn't just say that Abraham laughed.
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.820]   This is really significant, I think.
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.940]   It says he fell on his face.
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.900]   He had already said that once in verse 3.
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:17.120]   He fell on his face and laughed.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:22.820]   And falling on your face before Yahweh is a sign of reverence and respect and awe and
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:23.820]   fear.
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:30.380]   It's not the posture you would assume if you were cynically laughing off the possibility
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.500]   of what God just said.
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:43.340]   And fifth, finally, as soon as the encounter with God is over in chapter 17, Abraham immediately
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.940]   obeys the terms of the covenant and has all the males circumcised.
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:55.340]   So it seems to me that we have good reason not only from the New Testament but also from
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:00.060]   the context of the Old Testament that Abraham's faith really was astonishing.
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:09.580]   And when Paul said in Romans 4.20 that Abraham was strengthened—passive voice, strengthened
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:16.060]   in his faith, giving glory to God—that passive voice is intended to draw our attention to
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:23.940]   the fact that this amazing work of faith in Abraham was not just his doing.
[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.900]   It was the work of God in him.
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.860]   And that probably is the central lesson for us.
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:39.500]   Paul is trying to make clear that sinners like us come into a right relationship with
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:47.140]   God by trusting him, believing, having faith, not by working for him.
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:55.900]   And even more pointedly, Paul is showing us that this faith itself is a work of God so
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:05.220]   that in the end, God gets all the glory, not just because of our faith calling attention
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:13.500]   to his total trustworthiness and all sufficiency, but also because the faith itself is a mighty
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:14.740]   work of God.
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.220]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.660]   Well, tell us if it was one of your trees.
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:19.660]   That was our tree.
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:20.660]   Oh my.
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.260]   Oh, that's like losing a loved one.
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.340]   How old is that tree?
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.740]   It was there since we moved in here 40 years ago.
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:28.740]   Oh my.
[00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:29.980]   And it must have been diseased.
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.580]   I saw a green X on it and I thought, "Oh no, no, they've taken it down.
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.460]   It had a lot of dead branches in it.
[00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:40.940]   That means all my shade in the afternoon is going to disappear, and I will leave a legacy
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:41.940]   with a small tree."
[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:47.100]   Oh man, well, I think your legacy will be more than a sap, Link, but that's still sap.
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:51.580]   Well, that's a bummer way to end today's episode, but that's how it's going to end.
[00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.060]   Thank you for listening to this unexpectedly interrupted episode.
