[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   - Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.380]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.560]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.320]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.760]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.960]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.480]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.880]   Today, we're going to talk about dreaming,
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.680]   learning during dreaming,
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.980]   as well as unlearning during dreaming.
[00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.800]   In particular, unlearning of challenging emotional events.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.320]   Now, numerous people throughout history
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.720]   have tried to make sense of dreams
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.480]   in some sort of organized way.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.840]   The most famous of which, of course, is Sigmund Freud,
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.520]   who talked about symbolic representations in dreams.
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.600]   A lot of that has been kind of debunked,
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.560]   although I think that there's some interest
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.000]   in what the symbols of dreaming are.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.400]   And this is something that we'll talk about
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.460]   in more depth today,
[00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.200]   although not Freudian theory in particular.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.960]   So I think in order to really think about dreams
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.280]   and what to do with them and how to maximize
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.360]   the dream experience for sake of learning and unlearning,
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.840]   the best way to address this
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.800]   is to look at the physiology of sleep,
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.680]   to really address what do we know concretely about sleep.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.040]   So first of all, as we get sleepy,
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.960]   we tend to shut our eyes,
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.060]   and that's 'cause there are some autonomic centers
[00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.040]   in the brain, some neurons that control
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.280]   closing of the eyelids when we get sleepy.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.960]   And then we transition into sleep.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.800]   And sleep, regardless of how long we sleep,
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.240]   is generally broken up into a series of 90-minute cycles,
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.000]   these ultradian cycles.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.340]   So early in the night,
[00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.980]   these 90-minute cycles tend to be comprised
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.960]   more of shallow sleep and slow-wave sleep.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.560]   And we tend to have less so-called REM sleep,
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.800]   R-E-M sleep, which stands for rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.240]   For every 90-minute cycle that we have
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.180]   during a night of sleep,
[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.120]   we tend to start having more and more REM sleep.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.660]   So more of that 90-minute cycle
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.380]   is comprised of REM sleep and less of slow-wave sleep.
[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.240]   Now, this is true regardless of whether or not
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.300]   you wake up in the middle of the night
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.980]   to use the restroom or your sleep is broken.
[00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.700]   The more sleep you're getting across the night,
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.820]   the more REM sleep you're going to have.
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.620]   And REM sleep and non-REM, as I'll refer to it,
[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.440]   have distinctly different roles in learning and unlearning,
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.720]   and they are responsible for learning and unlearning
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.180]   of distinctly different types of information.
[00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.500]   And this has enormous implications
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.000]   for learning of motor skills,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.420]   for unlearning of traumatic events,
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.580]   or for processing emotionally challenging,
[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.300]   as well as emotionally pleasing events.
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.860]   And as we'll see,
[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.020]   one can actually leverage their daytime activities
[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.540]   in order to access more slow-wave sleep,
[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.880]   or non-REM sleep, as we'll call it,
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.980]   or more REM sleep,
[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.580]   depending on your particular emotional and physical needs.
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.480]   So it's really a remarkable stage of life
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.160]   that we have a lot more control and power over
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.080]   than you might believe.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.400]   So let's start by talking about slow-wave sleep,
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.740]   or non-REM sleep.
[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.540]   So slow-wave sleep is characterized
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.620]   by a particular pattern of brain activity
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.540]   in which the brain is metabolically active,
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.500]   but that there's these big sweeping waves of activity
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.260]   that include a lot of the brain.
[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.620]   Now, the interesting thing about slow-wave sleep
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.580]   are the neuromodulators that tend to be associated with it
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.660]   that are most active and least active during slow-wave sleep.
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.340]   And here's why.
[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.820]   To remind you, neuromodulators are these chemicals
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.580]   that act rather slowly,
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.660]   but their main role is to bias particular brain circuits
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.440]   to be active and other brain circuits to not be active.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.380]   And they are associated, as a consequence,
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.960]   with certain brain functions.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.340]   So we know, for instance,
[00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.580]   and just to review, acetylcholine in waking states
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.420]   is a neuromodulator that tends to amplify the activity
[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.760]   of brain circuits associated with focus and attention.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.500]   Norepinephrine is a neuromodulator
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.260]   that tends to amplify the brain circuits
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.060]   associated with alertness and the desire to move.
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.220]   Serotonin is the neuromodulator that's released
[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.140]   and tends to amplify the circuits in the brain and body
[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.060]   that are associated with bliss and a desire to remain still.
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.580]   And dopamine is the neuromodulator that's released
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.080]   and is associated with amplification
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.740]   of the neural circuits in the brain and body
[00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.940]   associated with pursuing goals and pleasure and reward.
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.300]   So in slow-wave sleep,
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.500]   something really interesting happens.
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.500]   There's essentially no acetylcholine.
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.340]   And acetylcholine, as I just mentioned,
[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.260]   is associated with focus.
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.900]   So you can think of slow-wave sleep
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.620]   as these big sweeping waves of activity through the brain
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.100]   and a kind of distortion of space and time
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.180]   so that we're not really focusing on any one thing.
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.900]   Now, the other molecules that are very active at that time
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.600]   are norepinephrine, which is a little bit surprising
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.440]   'cause normally in waking states,
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.260]   norepinephrine is going to be associated
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.340]   with a lot of alertness and the desire to move.
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.760]   But there's not a ton of norepinephrine
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.880]   around in slow-wave sleep, but it is around.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.280]   So there's something associated
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.720]   with the movement circuitry going on in slow-wave sleep.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.280]   And remember, this is happening mostly
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.400]   at the beginning of the night.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.880]   Your sleep is dominated by slow-wave sleep.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.400]   So no acetylcholine, very little norepinephrine,
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.160]   although there is some, and a lot of serotonin.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.340]   And serotonin, again, is associated with this desire,
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.800]   this sensation of kind of bliss or wellbeing,
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.880]   but not a lot of movement.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.580]   And during sleep, you tend not to move.
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.520]   Now, in slow-wave sleep, you can move.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.060]   You're not paralyzed, so you can roll over.
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.980]   If people are going to sleepwalk,
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.760]   typically it's going to be during slow-wave sleep.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.680]   And what studies have shown
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.840]   through some kind of sadistic experiments
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.240]   where people are deprived specifically of slow-wave sleep,
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.600]   and that can be done by waking them up
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.640]   as soon as the electrode recordings show
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.180]   that they're in slow-wave sleep,
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.820]   or by chemically altering their sleep
[00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.520]   so that it biases them away from slow-wave sleep.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.080]   What studies have shown is that motor learning
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.540]   is generally occurring in slow-wave sleep.
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.140]   So let's say the day before you go to sleep,
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.060]   you were learning some new dance move,
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.740]   or you were learning some specific motor skill,
[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.860]   either a fine motor skill or a coarse motor skill.
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.420]   Learning of those skills is happening
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.420]   primarily during slow-wave sleep
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.900]   in the early part of the night.
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.380]   In addition, slow-wave sleep has been shown to be important
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.240]   for the learning of detailed information.
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.100]   So we can think of slow-wave sleep
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.560]   as important for motor learning, motor skill learning,
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.060]   and for the learning of specific details
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.060]   about specific events.
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.860]   And this turns out to be fundamentally important
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.660]   because now we know that slow-wave sleep
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.720]   is primarily in the early part of the night,
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.300]   and motor learning is occurring
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.060]   primarily early in the night,
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.140]   and detail learning is occurring early in the night.
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.860]   I want to talk about REM sleep or rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.620]   REM sleep and rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.060]   as I mentioned before, occurs throughout the night,
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.580]   but you're going to have more of it,
[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.120]   a larger percentage of these 90-minute sleep cycles
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.140]   is going to be comprised of REM sleep
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.720]   as you get toward morning.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.280]   REM sleep is fascinating.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.820]   It was discovered in the '50s
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.120]   when a sleep laboratory in Chicago,
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.380]   the researchers observed that people's eyes
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.960]   were moving under their eyelids.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.220]   Now, something very important that we're going to address
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.580]   when we talk about trauma later
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.480]   is that the eye movements are not just side to side,
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.160]   they're very erratic in all different directions.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.880]   One thing that I don't think anyone,
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.060]   I've never heard anyone really talk about publicly
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.260]   is why eye movements during sleep, right?
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.100]   Eyes are closed,
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.040]   and sometimes people's eyelids will be a little bit open
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.060]   and their eyes are darting around,
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.320]   especially in little kids.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.580]   I don't suggest you do this.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.680]   I'm not even sure it's ethical,
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.300]   but it has been done where you pull back the eyelids
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.260]   of a kid while they're sleeping
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.300]   and their eyes are kind of darting all over the place.
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.940]   Rapid eye movement sleep is fascinating
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.540]   and occurs because there are connections
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:02.580]   between the brainstem, an area called the pons,
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:07.220]   and areas of the thalamus and the top of the brainstem
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.760]   that are involved in generating movements
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.860]   in different directions, sometimes called saccades,
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.700]   although sometimes during rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:14.580]   it's not just rapid,
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.420]   it's kind of a jittery side to side thing,
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:17.860]   and then the eyeballs kind of roll.
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.420]   It's really pretty creepy to look at if you see.
[00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:23.940]   So what's happening there is the circuitry
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.740]   that is involved in conscious eye movements
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.880]   is kind of going haywire, but it's not haywire.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.500]   It's these waves of activity from the brainstem
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.020]   up to the so-called thalamus,
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.140]   which is an area that filters sensory information
[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.860]   up to the cortex.
[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.180]   And the cortex, of course,
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:41.620]   is involved in conscious perceptions.
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:46.620]   In REM sleep, serotonin is essentially absent, okay?
[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.340]   So this molecule, this neuromodulator
[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.360]   that tends to create the feeling of bliss and wellbeing
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.900]   and just calm placidity is absent.
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:00.480]   In addition to that, norepinephrine,
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.220]   this molecule that's involved in movement and alertness
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.880]   is absolutely absent.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.580]   It's probably one of the few times in our life
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.940]   that epinephrine is essentially
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.540]   at zero activity within our system.
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.580]   And that has a number of very important implications
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.200]   for the sorts of dreaming that occur during REM sleep
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.740]   and the sorts of learning that can occur
[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.060]   in REM sleep and unlearning.
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.980]   First of all, in REM sleep, we are paralyzed.
[00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.940]   We are experiencing what's called atonia,
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.320]   which just means that we're completely laid out
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.600]   and paralyzed.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.480]   We also tend to experience whatever it is
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.080]   that we're dreaming about as a kind of hallucination
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.560]   or a hallucinatory activity.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.600]   So in REM, our eyes are moving,
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.720]   but the rest of our body is paralyzed
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.400]   and we are hallucinating.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.140]   There's no epinephrine around.
[00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.160]   Epinephrine doesn't just create a desire
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.840]   to move and alertness.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.840]   It is also the chemical signature of fear and anxiety.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.900]   It's what's released from our adrenal glands
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.700]   when we experience something that's fearful or alerting.
[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.740]   So if a car suddenly screeches in front of us
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.980]   or we get a troubling text message,
[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.740]   adrenaline is deployed into our system.
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.260]   Adrenaline is epinephrine.
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.580]   Those are equivalent molecules.
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.340]   And epinephrine isn't just released from our adrenals.
[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.460]   It's also released within our brain.
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.700]   So there's this weird stage of our life
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.140]   that happens more toward morning that we call REM sleep,
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.460]   where we're hallucinating
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.980]   and having these outrageous experiences in our mind,
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:40.300]   but the chemical that's associated with fear and panic
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.700]   and anxiety is not available to us.
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.020]   And that turns out to be very important.
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.180]   And you can imagine why that's important.
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:53.780]   It's important because it allows us to experience things,
[00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.580]   both replay of things that did occur,
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.000]   as well as elaborate contortions
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.220]   of things that didn't occur.
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.300]   And it allows us to experience those
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.260]   in the absence of fear and anxiety.
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.280]   So we have this incredible period of sleep
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.780]   in which our experience of emotionally laden events
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.100]   is dissociated.
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:19.980]   It's chemically blocked from us having the actual emotion.
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:24.180]   So to just recap where we've gone so far,
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.420]   slow-wave sleep early in the night,
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.220]   it's been shown to be important for motor learning
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.140]   and for detailed learning.
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.980]   REM sleep has a certain dream component
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.020]   when which there's no epinephrine,
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.820]   therefore we can't experience anxiety.
[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:39.300]   We are paralyzed.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.780]   Those dreams tend to be really vivid
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.020]   and have a lot of detail to them.
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:47.340]   And yet in REM sleep, what's very clear
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.820]   is that the sorts of learning that happened in REM sleep
[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.220]   are not motor events.
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.620]   It's more about unlearning of emotional events.
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:55.540]   And now we know why,
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.980]   because the chemicals available
[00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.980]   for really feeling those emotions are not present.
[00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:06.380]   Now that has very important implications.
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.060]   So let's address those implications from two sides.
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.820]   First of all, we should ask what happens
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.900]   if we don't get enough REM sleep?
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.140]   And a scenario that happens a lot
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.180]   where people don't get enough REM sleep is the following.
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.500]   I'll just explain the one that I'm familiar with
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.140]   'cause it happens to me a lot,
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.420]   although I've figured out ways to adjust.
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.380]   I go to sleep around 10, 30, 11 o'clock.
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.060]   I fall asleep very easily.
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.980]   And then I wake up around three or 4 a.m.
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:38.460]   I now know to use a NSDR, a non-sleep deep rest protocol.
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.500]   And that allows me to fall back asleep.
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.180]   Even though it's called non-sleep deep rest,
[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.900]   it's really allows me to relax my body and brain.
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.220]   And I tend to fall back asleep and sleep till about 7 a.m.,
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.820]   during which time I get a lot of REM sleep.
[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.900]   And I know this because I've measured it.
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.620]   And I know this because my dreams tend to be very intense
[00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.060]   of the sort that we know is typical of REM sleep.
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.180]   In this scenario,
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.060]   I've gotten my slow wave sleep early in the night
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.100]   and I've got my REM sleep toward morning.
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.540]   However, there are times when I don't go back to sleep.
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.500]   Maybe I have a flight to catch, that's happened.
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.820]   Sometimes I've got a lot on my mind
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.260]   and I don't go back to sleep.
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.860]   I can tell you, and you've probably experienced that,
[00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.100]   the lack of REM sleep
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.980]   tends to make people emotionally irritable.
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.820]   It tends to make us feel
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.320]   as if the little things are the big things.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.420]   So it's very clear from laboratory studies
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:35.020]   where people have been deprived selectively of REM sleep,
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.460]   that our emotionality tends to get a little bit unhinged
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.540]   and we tend to catastrophize small things.
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:45.300]   We tend to feel like the world is really daunting.
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.780]   We're never going to move forward in the ways that we want.
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.060]   We can't unlearn the emotional components
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.020]   of whatever it is that's been happening,
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.300]   even if it's not traumatic.
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.020]   The other thing that happens in REM sleep
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:59.760]   is a replay of certain types of spatial information
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.700]   about where we were and why we were in those places.
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.100]   And this maps to some beautiful data
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.700]   and studies that were initiated
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.980]   by a guy named Matt Wilson at MIT years ago,
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:11.480]   showing that in rodents,
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.840]   and it turns out in other non-human primates and in humans,
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:18.480]   there's a replay of spatial information during REM sleep
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.940]   that almost precisely maps to the activity
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.060]   that we experienced during the day
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.740]   as we move from one place to another.
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.400]   So here's a common world scenario.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.180]   You go to a new place,
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:31.100]   you navigate through that city or that environment.
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.540]   This place doesn't have to be at the scale of a city.
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.780]   It can be a new building,
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:38.460]   could be finding particular rooms, new social interaction.
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:42.020]   You experience that, and if it's important enough,
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:44.860]   that becomes solidified a few days later
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:45.800]   and you won't forget it.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.960]   If it's unimportant, you'll probably forget it.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.160]   During REM sleep, there's a literal replay
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.140]   of the exact firing of the neurons that occurred
[00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:56.980]   while you were navigating that same city
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.220]   you're building earlier.
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.820]   So REM sleep seems to be involved
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:04.160]   in the generation of this detailed spatial information.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.460]   But what is it that's actually happening in REM sleep?
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.360]   So there's this uncoupling of emotion,
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.820]   but most of all, what's happening in REM sleep
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.160]   is that we're forming a relationship
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.220]   with particular rules or algorithms.
[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.940]   We're starting to figure out,
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.900]   based on all the experience that we had during the day,
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:26.060]   whether or not it's important that we avoid certain people
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.420]   or that we approach certain people,
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.520]   whether or not it's important that, you know,
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.820]   when we enter a building that we go into the elevator
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.640]   and turn left where the bathroom is, for instance,
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.280]   these general themes of things and locations
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.860]   and how they fit together.
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.660]   And that has a word, it's called meaning.
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.100]   During our day, we're experiencing all sorts of things.
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:51.100]   Meaning is how we each individually piece together
[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:54.040]   the relevance of one thing to the next, right?
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.220]   So if I suddenly told you that, you know,
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.220]   this pen was downloading all the information to my brain
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.380]   that was important to deliver this information,
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.460]   you'd probably think I was a pretty strange character
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.180]   because typically we don't think of pens
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.540]   as downloading information into brains.
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.440]   But if I told you that I was getting information
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.740]   from my computer that was allowing me to say things to you,
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.300]   you'd say, well, that's perfectly reasonable.
[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.060]   And that's because we have a clear
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.260]   and agreed upon association with computers
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.540]   and information and memory.
[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:25.660]   And we don't have that same association with pens.
[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.140]   You might say, well, duh,
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:31.900]   but something in our brain needs to solidify
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.400]   those relationships and make sure
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.900]   that certain relationships don't exist.
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.080]   And it appears that REM sleep is important for that
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.540]   because when you deprive yourself or people of REM,
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.900]   they start seeing odd associations.
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.940]   And we know that if people are deprived of REM sleep
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.740]   for very long periods of time, they start hallucinating.
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.560]   They literally start seeing relationships
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.420]   and movement of objects that isn't happening.
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.540]   And so REM sleep is really where we establish
[00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:02.020]   the emotional load, but where we also start discarding
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.220]   of all the meanings that are irrelevant.
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.260]   And if you think about emotionality,
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:10.260]   a lot of over-emotionality or catastrophizing
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.700]   is about seeing problems everywhere.
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.140]   It's very important in order to have healthy,
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.980]   emotional, and cognitive functioning
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.940]   that we have fairly narrow channels
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.100]   between individual things.
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.800]   If we see something on the news that's very troubling,
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.100]   well, then it makes sense to be very troubled.
[00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.660]   But if we're troubled by everything
[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.100]   and we start just saying, everything is bothering me
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.540]   and I'm feeling highly irritable
[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:33.680]   and everything is just distorting and troubling me,
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:38.680]   chances are we are not actively removing the meaning,
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.180]   the connectivity between life experiences
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.100]   as well as we could.
[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:46.300]   And that almost always maps back to a deficit in REM sleep.
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.620]   So REM sleep seems to be where we uncouple
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:54.620]   the potential for emotionality between various experiences.
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:59.700]   And that brings us to the absolutely fundamental relationship
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.240]   and similarity of REM sleep
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.820]   to some of the clinical practices
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.400]   that have been designed to eliminate emotionality
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.620]   and help people move through trauma
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.460]   and other troubling experiences.
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.540]   Many of you perhaps have heard of trauma treatments
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:19.540]   such as EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing,
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.700]   or ketamine treatment for trauma,
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:25.680]   something that recently became legal
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.420]   and is in fairly widespread clinical use.
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:33.740]   Interestingly enough, EMDR and ketamine
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:38.740]   at kind of a core level bear very similar features
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:41.060]   to REM sleep.
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.700]   So let's talk about EMDR first.
[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.740]   EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.020]   is something that was developed by a psychologist,
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.980]   Francine Shapiro.
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.720]   She actually was in Palo Alto.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.960]   And the story goes that she was walking,
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:03.560]   not so incidentally in the trees and forest behind Stanford,
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.560]   and she was recalling a troubling event in her own mind.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.480]   So this would be from her own life.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.680]   And she realized that as she was walking,
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.680]   the emotional load of that experience
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.200]   was not as intense or severe.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:20.600]   She extrapolated from that experience
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.440]   of walking and not feeling as stressed
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.040]   about the stressful event
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.840]   to a practice that she put into work
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.120]   with her clients, with her patients,
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.640]   and that now has become fairly widespread.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.240]   It's actually one of the few behavior treatments
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.920]   that are approved by the American Psychological Association
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.320]   for the Treatment of Trauma.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.560]   What she had her clients and patients do
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.620]   was move their eyes from side to side
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.960]   while recounting some traumatic or troubling event.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.120]   Why eye movements?
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.760]   Well, she never really said why eye movements,
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.400]   but soon I'll tell you why the decision
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.840]   to select these lateralized eye movements
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.960]   for the work in the clinic was the right one.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.120]   So these eye movements, they look silly,
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.800]   but they basically involve sitting in a chair
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:12.580]   and moving one's eyes from side to side for 30, 60 seconds,
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:15.880]   then describing this challenging procedure.
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:20.800]   Now, as a vision scientist who also works on stress,
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:26.040]   when I first heard this, I thought it was crazy, frankly.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.720]   People would ask me about EMDR,
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.480]   and I just thought, "That's crazy."
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.040]   I went and looked up some of the theories
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.320]   about why EMDR might work,
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.800]   and there were a bunch of theories.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.680]   Oh, it mimics the eye movements during REM sleep.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.640]   That was one.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.520]   Turns out that's not true, and I'll explain why.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.180]   The other one was, oh, it synchronizes the activity
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.920]   on the two sides of the brain.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:47.760]   Well, sort of.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.800]   I mean, when you look into both sides
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.040]   of the binocular visual field,
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.560]   you activate the visual cortex,
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.960]   but this whole idea of synchrony
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.320]   between the two sides of the brain
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.080]   is something that I think modern neuroscience
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.360]   is starting to, let's just say,
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.600]   gently or not so gently move away from,
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:08.320]   this whole right brain, left brain business.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.960]   It turns out, however,
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.960]   that eye movements of the sort that I just did,
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.860]   and that Francine Shapiro took from this walk experience
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.940]   and brought to her clients in the clinic,
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:20.780]   are the sorts of eye movements that you generate
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.620]   whenever you're moving through space,
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.960]   when you are self-generating that movement.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.280]   So not so much when you're driving a car,
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.080]   but certainly if you were riding a bicycle,
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.120]   or you were walking, or you were running,
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:31.960]   you don't realize it,
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.220]   but you have these reflexive subconscious eye movements
[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:36.040]   that go from side to side,
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.680]   and they are associated with the motor system.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.520]   So when you move forward, your eyes go like this.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.680]   There've been a number of studies
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.640]   showing that these lateralized eye movements
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.720]   helped people move through or dissociate
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.000]   the emotional experience of particular traumas
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.080]   with those experiences,
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.540]   such that they could recall those experiences
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:57.760]   after the treatment and not feel stressed about them,
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.520]   or they didn't report them as traumatic any longer.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.440]   Now, the success rate wasn't 100%,
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.040]   but they were statistically significant
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.320]   in a number of studies.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.840]   In the last five years,
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:11.360]   there have been no fewer than five journals and papers
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.540]   showing that lateralized eye movements
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:14.960]   of the sort that I just did,
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.000]   and if you're just listening to this,
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.120]   it's just sweeping, moving the eyes from side to side
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.460]   with eyes open,
[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:22.800]   that those eye movements, but not vertical eye movements,
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.400]   suppress the activity of the amygdala,
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.560]   which is this brain region
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.600]   that is involved in threat detection,
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.120]   stress, anxiety, and fear.
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.040]   There are some forms of fear
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.360]   that are not amygdala dependent,
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.100]   but the amygdala, it's not a fear center,
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:43.400]   but it is critical for the fear response.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.300]   And for the experience of anxiety.
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.220]   So that's interesting.
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.200]   We've got a clinical tool now
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.920]   that indeed shows a lot of success
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.660]   in a good number of people,
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.840]   where eye movements from side to side
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.200]   are suppressing the amygdala,
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.020]   and the general theme is to use those eye movements
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.960]   to suppress the fear response,
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:06.100]   and then to recount or repeat the experience,
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:10.080]   and over time, uncouple the heavy emotional load,
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.600]   the sadness, the depression, the anxiety, the fear,
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.160]   from whatever it was that happened that was traumatic.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.840]   This is important to understand
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:21.260]   because I'd love to be able to tell somebody
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:22.560]   who had a traumatic experience
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.480]   that they would forget that experience,
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.500]   but the truth is you never forget the traumatic experience.
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:29.880]   What you do is you remove the emotional load.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.840]   Eventually, it really does lose its potency.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.440]   The emotional potency is alleviated.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.960]   Now, EMDR, I should just mention,
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.640]   tends to be most successful for single event
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.840]   or very specific kinds of trauma that happen over and over,
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.520]   as opposed to, say, an entire childhood
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.920]   or an entire divorce.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.760]   They tend to be, it tends to be most effective
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:55.440]   for single event kinds of things, car crashes, et cetera,
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.800]   where people can really recall the events
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.440]   in quite a lot of detail.
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.760]   It's not for everybody, and it should be done,
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.280]   if it's going to be done for trauma,
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.000]   it should be done in a clinical setting
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.960]   with somebody who's certified to do this,
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.040]   but that bears a lot of resemblance to REM sleep, right?
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.400]   This experience in our sleep,
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.360]   where our eyes are moving, excuse me,
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:16.800]   although in a different way,
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.480]   but we don't have the chemical, epinephrine,
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.720]   in order to generate the fear response,
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.740]   and yet we're remembering the event
[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.640]   from the previous day or days.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.200]   And then now there's this chemical treatment
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.920]   with the drug ketamine,
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.500]   which also bears a lot of resemblance
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.520]   to the sorts of things that happen in REM sleep.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:39.120]   Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:44.100]   It is remarkably similar to the drug called PCP,
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:49.100]   which is certainly a hazardous drug for people to use.
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:54.640]   Ketamine and PCP both function to disrupt the activity
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.200]   of a particular receptor in the brain
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:02.200]   called the NMDA receptor, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.800]   This is a receptor that's in the surface of neurons
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.360]   or on the surface of neurons
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:11.220]   for which most of the time it's not active.
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:14.880]   But when something very extreme happens,
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.440]   and there's a lot of activity in the neural pathway
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.520]   that impinges on that receptor,
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:24.520]   it opens and it allows the entry of molecules, ions,
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:28.020]   that trigger a cellular process
[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:30.520]   that we call long-term potentiation.
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.720]   And long-term potentiation translates
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.920]   to a change in connectivity
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.880]   so that later you don't need that intense event
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.400]   for the neuron to become active again.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.640]   Ketamine blocks this NMDA receptor.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.700]   So how is ketamine being used?
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:49.760]   Ketamine is being used to prevent learning of emotions
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.520]   very soon after trauma.
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.720]   Ketamine is being stocked
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.240]   in a number of different emergency rooms
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.660]   where if people are brought in quickly,
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.840]   and these are hard to describe even,
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:02.520]   but a horrible experience of somebody seeing a loved one
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.200]   next to them killed in a car accident
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.280]   and they were driving that car.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.320]   This isn't for everybody, certainly,
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.920]   and you need to talk to your physician,
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.680]   but ketamine is being used
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.880]   so they might infuse somebody with ketamine
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:17.520]   so that their emotion can still occur,
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.600]   but that the plasticity,
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.240]   the change in the wiring of their brain
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.720]   won't allow that intense emotion
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.440]   to be attached to the experience.
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.760]   Now, immediately you can imagine
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.240]   the sort of ethical implications of this, right?
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.760]   Because certain emotions need to be coupled to experiences,
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.320]   but in the clinical setting,
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.440]   the basis of ketamine-assisted therapies
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.680]   is really to remove emotion.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.440]   Ketamine is about becoming dissociative
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.480]   or removed from the emotional component of the experience.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.280]   So now we have ketamine,
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.420]   which chemically blocks plasticity
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:52.420]   and prevents the connection
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.800]   between an emotion and an experience.
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.160]   That's a pharmacologic intervention.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.360]   We have EMDR, which is this eye movement thing
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.560]   that is designed to suppress the amygdala
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.840]   and is designed to remove emotionality
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.920]   while somebody recounts an experience.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.080]   And we have REM sleep,
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.000]   where the chemical epinephrine
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.200]   that allows for signaling of intense emotion
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.100]   and the experience of a tense emotion
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.040]   in the brain and body is not allowed.
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:21.780]   And so we're starting to see a organizational logic,
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.920]   which is that a certain component of our sleeping life
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.880]   is acting like therapy.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.000]   And that's really what REM sleep is about.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.180]   So we should really think about REM sleep
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.440]   and slow-wave sleep as both critical.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.840]   Slow-wave sleep for motor learning and detailed learning,
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.880]   REM sleep for attaching of emotions
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.520]   to particular experiences,
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:45.360]   and then for making sure that the emotions
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.840]   are not attached to the wrong experiences,
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.420]   and for unlearning emotional responses
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.680]   if they're too intense or severe.
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.400]   And this all speaks to the great importance
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.180]   of mastering one's sleep,
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.200]   something that we talked about
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.720]   in episode two of the podcast,
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:04.880]   and making sure that if life has disruptive events,
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.280]   either due to travel or stress
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:11.240]   or changes in school or food schedule,
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.700]   something that we talked about in episodes three and four,
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:18.620]   that one can still grab a hold and manage one's sleep life.
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:22.600]   Because fundamentally, the unlearning of emotions
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.960]   that are troubling to us
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.760]   is what allows us to move forward in life.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.600]   And indeed, the REM deprivation studies
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.080]   show that people become hyper-emotional.
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.880]   They start to catastrophize.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.680]   And it's no surprise, therefore,
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:38.080]   that sleep disturbances correlate
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:42.120]   with so many emotional and psychological disturbances.
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.040]   By now, it should just be obvious
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.520]   why that will be the case.
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.520]   I was in a discussion with a colleague of mine
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.560]   who's down in Australia, Dr. Sarah McKay.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:53.120]   I've known her for two decades now
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.520]   from the time she was at Oxford.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.800]   And Sarah studies, among other things,
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.200]   menopause in the brain.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.560]   And she was saying that a lot of the emotional
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:05.280]   effects of menopause
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.680]   actually are not directly related to the hormones.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.000]   There've been some really nice studies
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.560]   showing that the disruptions
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.200]   in temperature regulation in menopause
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.600]   map to changes in sleep regulation
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.080]   that then impact emotionality
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:22.280]   and an inability to correctly adjust
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.440]   the circuits related to emotionality.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:29.440]   So sleep deprivation isn't just deprivation of energy.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.040]   It's not just deprivation of immune function.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.800]   It is deprivation of self-induced therapy
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.440]   every time we go to sleep.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.880]   So these things like EMDR and ketamine therapies
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.000]   are in-clinic therapies,
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.320]   but REM sleep is the one that you're giving yourself
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.280]   every night when you go to sleep,
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.440]   which raises, I think, the other important question,
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.760]   which is how to get and how to know
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.700]   if you're getting the appropriate amount of REM sleep
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:55.720]   and slow-wave sleep.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:59.380]   Turns out that for sake of learning new information,
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.540]   limiting the variation in the amount of your sleep
[00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:06.860]   is at least as important and perhaps more important
[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:09.340]   than just getting more sleep overall.
[00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:11.440]   I find great relief personally
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.600]   in the fact that consistently getting,
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.960]   for me, about six hours or six and a half hours
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.600]   is going to be more beneficial
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.620]   than constantly striving for eight or nine
[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.420]   and finding that some nights I'm getting five
[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:25.200]   and sometimes I'm getting nine and varying around the mean.
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.000]   Now, ideally, you're getting the full complement
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   of slow-wave sleep early in night
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.280]   and sleep toward morning, which is REM sleep,
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:35.000]   which brings us to how to get more REM sleep.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.200]   Well, there are a couple of different ways,
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:42.200]   but here's how to not get more REM sleep, all right?
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:45.000]   First of all, drink a lot of fluid
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.320]   right before going to sleep.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.740]   One of the reasons why we wake up
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.640]   in the middle of the night to use the bathroom
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:52.320]   is because when our bladder is full,
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.920]   there is a neural connection,
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.280]   literally a set of neurons and a nerve circuit
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.800]   that goes to the brainstem that wakes us up.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:02.440]   So having a full bladder is one way to disrupt your sleep.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.760]   The other one is tryptophan
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.760]   or anything that contains 5-HTP,
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.560]   which is serotonin or a precursor to serotonin.
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:11.280]   Serotonin is made from tryptophan.
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.200]   For some people, those supplements might work,
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.840]   but beware serotonin supplements
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:20.720]   could disrupt the timing of REM sleep and slow-wave sleep.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:24.360]   Now, if you want to increase your slow-wave sleep,
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.480]   that's interesting.
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.840]   There are ways to do that.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:30.200]   One of the most powerful ways to increase slow-wave sleep,
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.920]   the percentage of slow-wave sleep,
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.360]   apparently without any disruption
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.700]   to the other components of sleep and learning,
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.400]   is to engage in resistance exercise.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.600]   It's pretty clear that resistance exercise
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.360]   triggers a number of metabolic and endocrine pathways
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.440]   that lend themselves to release of growth hormone,
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.680]   which happens early in the night.
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.080]   And resistance exercise, therefore,
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.640]   can induce a greater percentage of slow-wave sleep.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.400]   It doesn't have to be done very close to going to bedtime.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.720]   In fact, for some people,
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.080]   the exercise could be disruptive
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.680]   for reasons I've talked about in previous episodes.
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:07.920]   But resistance exercise, unlike aerobic exercise,
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.240]   does seem to increase the amount of slow-wave sleep,
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:13.480]   which, as we know, is involved in motor learning
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.280]   and the acquisition of fine detailed information,
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:17.480]   not general rules
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:20.880]   or the emotional components of experiences.
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.880]   Alcohol.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.080]   Alcohol and marijuana are well-known to induce states
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.300]   that are pseudo-sleep-like,
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:29.640]   especially when people fall asleep
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:32.760]   after having consumed alcohol or THC,
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:34.160]   the active component,
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.000]   one of the active components in marijuana.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Alcohol, THC, and most things like them,
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.040]   meaning things that increase serotonin or GABA,
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.080]   are going to disrupt the pattern of sleep.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.280]   They're going to disrupt the depth.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.560]   They're going to disrupt the overall sequencing
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.200]   of more slow-wave sleep early in the night
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.880]   and more REM sleep later in the night.
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.800]   That's just the reality.
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.860]   Now, of course, if that's what you need in order to sleep,
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.020]   and that's within your protocol, as I've said here before,
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.320]   I'm not suggesting people take anything.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.760]   I'm not a medical doctor.
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:06.580]   I'm not a cop.
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:09.460]   So I'm not trying to regulate anyone's behavior.
[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:12.600]   I'm just telling you what the literature says.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:17.600]   Today, we've been in a deep dive of sleep and dreaming,
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.640]   learning and unlearning.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.000]   And I just want to recap a few of the highlights
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.200]   and important points.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:27.300]   A lot more slow-wave sleep and less REM early in the night.
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.840]   More REM and less slow-wave sleep later in the night.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:34.720]   REM sleep is associated with intense experiences
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.800]   without this chemical, epinephrine,
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.480]   that allows us the anxiety or fear,
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.940]   and almost certainly has an important role
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:45.440]   in uncoupling of emotion from experiences,
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.920]   kind of self-induced therapy that we go into each night.
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:52.000]   That bears striking resemblance to things like EMDR
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.520]   and ketamine therapies and so forth.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.660]   Slow-wave sleep is critical, however.
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.520]   It's critical mostly for motor learning
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.600]   and the learning of specific details.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:06.120]   So REM is kind of emotions and general themes and meaning,
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.800]   and slow-wave sleep, motor learning and details.
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:14.300]   I personally find it fascinating that consistency of sleep,
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:16.860]   meaning getting six hours every night
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:19.140]   is better than getting 10 one night,
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:21.560]   eight the next, five the next, four the next.
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:25.120]   I find that fascinating and I think I also like it
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:26.860]   because it's something I can control better
[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:28.040]   than just trying to sleep more,
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.140]   which I think I'm not alone in agreeing
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:32.420]   that that's just hard for a lot of people to do.
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.860]   Thank you for joining me in this journey
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.920]   of the nervous system and biology
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.420]   and trying to understand the mechanisms
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:41.620]   that make us who we are and how we function
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.940]   in sleep and in wakefulness.
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:47.020]   It's really an incredible landscape to consider,
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.780]   and I hope that you're getting a lot out of the information.
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:52.500]   As always, thank you for your interest in science.
