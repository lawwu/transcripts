[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.220]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.060]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.980]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.600]   Today, we are going to be discussing bipolar disorder,
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.140]   often called bipolar depression.
[00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.420]   Bipolar depression is a condition
[00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.140]   in which people undergo massive shifts in their energy,
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.340]   their perception, and their mood.
[00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.920]   However, it is very important to note
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.600]   that the shifts in mood, energy, and perception
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.340]   are all maladaptive.
[00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.200]   They can often cause tremendous damage
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.020]   to the person suffering from bipolar disorder
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.280]   and tremendous damage to the people in their lives.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.620]   Today, we're going to parse the biology
[00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.180]   that leads to the shifts in mood, energy, and perception,
[00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.740]   and we are going to talk about
[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.560]   the various treatments that exist.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.820]   Some of those treatments have been around
[00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.760]   for a very long time, and indeed, one of those treatments,
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.380]   lithium, has an incredible backstory about its discovery,
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.960]   and in understanding how lithium works
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.820]   and some of the ways in which it does not work well,
[00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.300]   it reveals a tremendous amount
[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.500]   about how the brain works normally in all individuals.
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.860]   So that's a miraculous story
[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.900]   that I look forward to sharing with you.
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.980]   As we go forward in this discussion about bipolar disorder,
[00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.060]   I want everyone to keep in mind
[00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.380]   that it is a very severe condition.
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.760]   In fact, people suffering from bipolar disorder
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.680]   are at 20 to 30 times greater risk of suicide.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.860]   So today is a serious discussion,
[00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.720]   and it's certainly one in which people
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.780]   who are suffering from manic bipolar disorder
[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.180]   or who know people that are suffering
[00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.180]   from manic bipolar disorder can benefit from.
[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.580]   However, for those of you that might know people
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.020]   or who themselves suffer from major depression,
[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.020]   we will also be talking about important treatment
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.860]   developments for major depression.
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.360]   Major depression is a very common thing for many people.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.180]   In fact, most people will suffer from depression
[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.580]   of some sort at some point in their life,
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.140]   although not necessarily a major depressive episode,
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.980]   and yet major depression is very common.
[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.860]   So you'll soon learn up to 20% of people
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.940]   will suffer from major depression.
[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.180]   So today's discussion will encompass all of that,
[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.220]   and it will also encompass basic brain mechanisms
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.740]   of neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to change
[00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.300]   in response to experience both for good and for worse,
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.500]   and you'll learn a lot about the basic biology
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.280]   of how the brain regulates mood, energy, and perception.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.140]   I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.480]   is now partnered with Momentous Supplements.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.940]   We often talk about supplements on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.160]   and while supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.300]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.100]   for things like enhancing the quality and speed
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.660]   with which you get into sleep,
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.660]   or for enhancing focus, or for hormone support.
[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.480]   The reason we partnered with Momentous Supplements
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.320]   is several fold.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.300]   First of all, their supplements
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.040]   are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.300]   Second of all, they ship internationally,
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.780]   which is important because many of our podcast listeners
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.420]   reside outside the US.
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.260]   Third, many of the supplements that Momentous makes,
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.820]   and most all of the supplements
[00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.660]   that we partnered with them directly on
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.760]   are single ingredient formulations.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.260]   This is important for a number of reasons.
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.580]   First of all, if you're going to create
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.380]   a supplement protocol that's customized for your needs,
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.620]   you want to be able to figure out
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.620]   which supplement ingredients are most essential
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.740]   and only use those.
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.720]   And supplements that combine lots of ingredients
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.300]   simply won't allow you to do that.
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.440]   If you'd like to see the supplements
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.180]   that we partnered with Momentous on,
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.260]   you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman.
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.300]   And there you'll see many of the supplements
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.740]   that we've talked repeatedly about
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.980]   on the Huberman Lab podcast episodes.
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.420]   I should mention that the catalog of supplements
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.060]   that are available at livemomentous.com/huberman
[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.860]   is constantly being expanded.
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.200]   So you can check back there livemomentous.com/huberman
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.940]   to see what's currently available.
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.220]   And from time to time, you'll notice new supplements
[00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.780]   being added to the inventory.
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.100]   Before we dive into the discussion
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.260]   about manic bipolar disorder,
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.900]   I want to highlight some recent findings
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.780]   in an area totally separate from mental health
[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.180]   that I think are really important for everyone to know about.
[00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.180]   This is a paper published in the journal Cell,
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.260]   which is a Cell Press journal, an excellent journal.
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.100]   In fact, one of the three apex journals.
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.660]   So for those of you that are curious,
[00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.780]   papers published in the journal Nature, Science, and Cell
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.260]   are considered the sort of Super Bowl, Stanley Cup,
[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.400]   and NBA championships of publishing.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.500]   And this paper entitled
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.580]   An Interorgan Neural Circuit for Appetite Suppression
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.360]   illustrates a very important principle
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.940]   that I think everyone should know about.
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.420]   And that's the principle of so-called parallel pathways.
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.500]   Parallel pathways, as the name suggests, are pathways.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.880]   They could be neural pathways or hormonal pathways
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.400]   or otherwise that operate independently of one another
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.000]   to accomplish a common goal.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.740]   And what this paper really shows
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.620]   is that there's a set of peptides in the body.
[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.660]   And the peptide that I'm referring to today
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.380]   is called GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide one,
[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.700]   and some related peptides.
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.940]   I've talked about these on the podcast before
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.780]   for two reasons.
[00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.780]   First of all, I'm a big proponent and consumer of Yerba Mate.
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.620]   Yerba Mate is a tea that can promote the release
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.960]   of glucagon-like peptide one.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.620]   And there are also new prescription drugs
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.940]   that are now hitting the market
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.040]   and for which there are really impressive clinical trials
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.940]   for diabetes and obesity
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.180]   that are essentially glucagon-like peptide one stimulator.
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.440]   So they stimulate the release of that,
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.260]   or they are in fact a synthetic version
[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.900]   of glucagon-like peptide one.
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.100]   What is glucagon-like peptide one?
[00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.940]   It is a peptide, which is a small little protein
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.120]   that can dramatically suppress appetite.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.460]   So that's why these drugs are being explored
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.300]   and are showing quite impressive results
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.200]   for things like treatment of type two diabetes
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.480]   and other forms of diabetes, as well as obesity.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.020]   So they lead to weight loss.
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.960]   Now, in terms of the Yerba Mate stimulation
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.260]   of glucagon-like peptide one,
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.880]   that's going to be a much lower amount of glucagon-like
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.640]   peptide one that's released from drinking Yerba Mate
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.120]   as opposed to say, taking a drug that stimulates GLP-1
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.520]   or taking a drug that is GLP-1.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.280]   Nonetheless, I should also point out
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.600]   that Yerba Mate comes in a bunch of different forms.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.040]   There is some concern about certain smoky flavored forms
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.280]   of Yerba Mate being carcinogenic.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.800]   So that's why I avoid those forms of Yerba Mate.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.160]   But for me, Yerba Mate is one of the preferred sources
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.280]   of caffeine for me.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.480]   I like the way it tastes.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.420]   It does provide that sort of caffeine kick
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.660]   that I like to have early in the day
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.200]   for focus and for work and for exercise.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.920]   And yet I actively avoid the smoked varieties
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.040]   of Yerba Mate because of the potential carcinogenic effects
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.280]   of the smoked varieties.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.000]   Glucagon-like peptide one, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.740]   can suppress appetite.
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.920]   But what this paper shows is it does that
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.680]   by at least two mechanisms through parallel pathways.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.320]   What this paper shows is that glucagon-like peptide one
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.160]   acts on receptors in the body
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.600]   in a portion of the nervous system
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.200]   called the enteric nervous system, E-N-T-E-R-I-C,
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.960]   enteric nervous system.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.240]   This is a component of your nervous system
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.820]   that you don't really have control over.
[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.220]   It's autonomic or automatic.
[00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.240]   GLP-1 binds to what are called
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.820]   intestinal fugal enteric neurons.
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.000]   You don't need to know the name,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.700]   but those neurons do two things.
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.220]   First of all, they cause some gut distension.
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.380]   So they actually make you feel full.
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.480]   This is incredible, right?
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.860]   A peptide, not actual physical food,
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.240]   but a peptide that stimulates neurons
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.380]   that cause changes in the so-called mechanoreceptors
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.860]   of the gut of the enteric nervous system
[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.580]   and make people feel full.
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.540]   So it can lead to actually mild,
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.100]   or I suppose if levels of GLP-1 are very high,
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.380]   to major gut distension, okay?
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.980]   I think that the levels of GLP-1
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.420]   that would come from drinking Yerba Mate
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.460]   and hopefully from appropriate dosaging
[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.580]   of the synthetic forms of GLP-1
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.060]   or drugs that stimulate GLP-1 would cause mild,
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.220]   not major gut distension
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.680]   'cause major gut distension would be uncomfortable.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.060]   So GLP-1 is acting at the level of gut
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.380]   to increase gut distension
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.660]   and by way of a pathway that goes from the gut
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.180]   up to the hypothalamus, this little cluster of neurons
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.460]   about the size of a marble
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.060]   that sits above the roof of your mouth
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.580]   is also suppressing appetite through brain mechanisms.
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.980]   So this is really beautiful, right?
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.140]   You have a peptide, a small little protein
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.060]   that's released in the gut
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:10.520]   and that release within the gut causes gut distension,
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.700]   which makes you feel full
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.780]   and by way of neural stimulation of the hypothalamus
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.320]   also activates neural pathways within the brain
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.660]   that trigger satiety, the feeling of having had enough food.
[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.420]   So to me, GLP-1 is both impressive and important, why?
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.760]   Because this recent category of drugs
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.680]   that's now hitting the market seems to adjust obesity
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.060]   or can help people with weight loss
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.780]   in order to help their health
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.400]   and it's doing so by at least two mechanisms.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.460]   One is within the brain
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.460]   and the other is within the gut
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.620]   and communication through the so-called gut brain access
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.400]   because again, these enteric neurons
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.380]   are communicating to the brain, the hypothalamus
[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.820]   by way of this what's called
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:52.580]   the sympathogastrospinal reticular hypothalamic pathway.
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.700]   You absolutely do not need to know all of that.
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.520]   That's a mouthful.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.500]   That's enough to make your mouth feel distended
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.460]   but at the same time, things like yerba mate
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.320]   and I'm sure there are other compounds out there as well
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.380]   but certainly yerba mate can stimulate the release of GLP-1.
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.500]   So for those of you that are looking
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.380]   for some mild appetite suppression
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.420]   and want to accomplish that while also ingesting caffeine,
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.380]   yerba mate might be a good option for that
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.220]   and just know that it's operating through two mechanisms
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.040]   on the body, through mild gut distension
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.500]   to make you feel full and on the brain
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.260]   to increase satiety or make you feel less hungry
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.380]   and then for everybody, not just those
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.420]   that are interested in appetite suppression,
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.440]   I think it's important to understand
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.660]   that these parallel pathways are fundamental
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.140]   to how we are organized.
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.500]   Another good example of this would be
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.000]   when we are excited by something, positive or negative,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.520]   so it could be stressful or we're positively aroused,
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.840]   there is a parallel activation of epinephrine, adrenaline,
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.040]   both from your adrenals and from an area in the brain
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.480]   called the locus coeruleus.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.780]   So again and again, we see this in biology
[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.340]   and in neuroscience, that your brain and your body
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.240]   are acting in concert, they're acting together
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.860]   through mechanisms that either are independent,
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.140]   so separately in the brain and separately in the body
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.640]   but directed towards a common goal
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.140]   or through communication between brain and body
[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.300]   and almost always that communication
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.420]   is going to be bi-directional, body to brain
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.580]   and brain to body.
[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.420]   So I think these results are really interesting
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.420]   and really important for sake of weight loss,
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.340]   for sake of appetite suppression
[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.780]   and just generally for the way that they illustrate
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:19.220]   this very important theme of the way
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.260]   that we are constructed at a biological level
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.200]   which is parallel pathways.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.820]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.520]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.620]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.180]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.780]   and science related tools to the general public.
[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:36.860]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.600]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.020]   Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.420]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.980]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.580]   to help you better understand your body
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.600]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.340]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.620]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.740]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.140]   can only be assessed with a quality blood test.
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.940]   And nowadays with the advent of modern DNA tests,
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.860]   you can also get insight into, for instance,
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.440]   what your biological age is
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.460]   and compare that to your chronological age.
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:09.980]   And of course your biological age
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.960]   is the one that's important for your longevity
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.340]   and your understanding of your current health needs.
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.900]   One major problem with most blood tests
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.960]   and DNA tests out there however,
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.280]   is that you get information back
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.960]   about levels of metabolic factors,
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.300]   levels of hormones and lipids and so forth,
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.860]   but you don't know exactly what to do with that information.
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.580]   InsideTracker solves that problem
[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.300]   through their personalized platform,
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.760]   which can tell you, for instance, lifestyle factors
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.300]   like fitness or nutrition or supplementation
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.380]   that you can use to bring the numbers into the ranges
[00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.240]   that are ideal for your health needs.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.620]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.380]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.140]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.960]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.780]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:56.620]   The company was founded
[00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.420]   by two all-American swimmers from Stanford
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.800]   and everything about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.100]   were designed with performance in mind.
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.900]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.400]   of the visual system and I can tell you
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.080]   that your visual system has to contend
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.820]   with a number of very important challenges
[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.540]   in order for you to see clearly.
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.480]   The designers of Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.620]   understand this and for that reason,
[00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.000]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses allow you, for instance,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.180]   to move from a shady area to a bright area
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.900]   or from a bright area to a shady area
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.340]   and still see everything with crystal clarity.
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.980]   Originally, their glasses and sunglasses
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.500]   were designed for performance,
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.020]   that is for running and cycling.
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.180]   And as a consequence,
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.980]   the eyeglasses and sunglasses stay on your face
[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.140]   even if you get sweaty and they're extremely lightweight.
[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.040]   In fact, most of the time,
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.780]   I don't even realize that they're on my face.
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.700]   I wear Roca eyeglasses for reading and for driving at night
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.700]   and I wear their sunglasses when I'm out during the day
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.220]   and it's really bright and I need to use sunglasses
[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.860]   in order to be able to navigate in that bright sunlight.
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.240]   If you'd like to try Roca glasses,
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.140]   you can go to roca.com, that's R-O-K-A.com
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.580]   and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order.
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.780]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A.com
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.980]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.580]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Blinkist.
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.260]   Blinkist is an app that has thousands of nonfiction books
[00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.740]   condensed down to just 15 minutes each of key takeaways
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.380]   that you can read or listen to.
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.460]   I'm a big believer in reading physical books.
[00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.780]   I actually own a lot of hardcover books and paperback books
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:15.940]   and I like holding them in my hand
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.180]   and flipping through the pages.
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.180]   I also like listening to audio books,
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.300]   but the reality is I don't have a ton of time to read books
[00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.180]   and I don't have a lot of time
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.080]   to listen to entire audio books.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.060]   There are also a lot of books
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.540]   that I've really enjoyed in the past
[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.100]   that I have read in their entirety,
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.280]   but that I like to update myself on the information on
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.580]   every once in a while.
[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.300]   Blinkist has terrific books available.
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:37.460]   For instance, I'm a big fan of Tim Ferriss' "4-Hour Body,"
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.300]   gleaned so much knowledge from that book.
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.060]   Also from Nassim Taleb's book, "The Black Swan"
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.860]   and the great Matt Walker's book, "Why We Sleep,"
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.340]   which is a book that I've read several times
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.580]   and I actually listened to the synopsis of on Blinkist
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.160]   over and over because there's so many key takeaways.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.200]   With Blinkist, you get unlimited access to read
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.720]   or listen to a massive library of condensed nonfiction books,
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.740]   essentially all of the books
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.420]   that you ever wanted to listen to.
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.360]   And now you have time because they're condensed down
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.740]   to just 15 minutes each.
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.300]   Right now, Blinkist has a special offer
[00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.220]   just for Huberman Lab Podcast listeners.

[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.100]   Let's talk about bipolar disorder.
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.180]   And today I'm going to refer to bipolar disorder
[00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:30.340]   interchangeably with bipolar depression.
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.340]   Although, as you will soon learn,
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.340]   not everyone with bipolar disorder
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.540]   necessarily goes through highs and lows.
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.900]   There is a subset of people who suffer from bipolar disorder
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.820]   who experienced the manic phases,
[00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:45.940]   the highly elevated mood and energy,
[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.620]   and then drop down to so-called baseline.
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.760]   So they don't necessarily go down into a depressive state.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.420]   They often will return to a somewhat normal state.
[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.640]   In fact, we will talk about the percentage of time
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.340]   that people with bipolar disorder
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:02.820]   tend to be symptom-free, manic, or depressed
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.440]   in the context of the different categories
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.700]   of bipolar disorder.
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.140]   But as we wade into this topic, that is bipolar disorder,
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.040]   I just want to give you a little bit
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.860]   of the background statistics
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.040]   to anchor us in just how serious
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.860]   and prevalent bipolar disorder is.
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:20.260]   So bipolar disorder impacts about 1% of people.
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.580]   That might seem like a small percentage.
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.240]   If you think about a room of a hundred people,
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.100]   that means that at least one of them
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.700]   is very likely to have bipolar disorder.
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.900]   And as I mentioned earlier in the introduction,
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.260]   bipolar disorder is very serious.
[00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:39.720]   It has a 20 to 30% greater incidence of suicide
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.420]   than the general population,
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.740]   which is, first of all, extremely tragic
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.540]   and extremely concerning.
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.540]   So anyone that thinks they might have bipolar disorder
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.260]   or who knows someone with bipolar disorder
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.100]   should be especially vigilant about this.
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:55.840]   And we'll talk about some of the signs and risk factors,
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.740]   age of onset, et cetera, as we move forward.
[00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.100]   So 1% of people have bipolar disorder.
[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:05.180]   The typical age of onset is anywhere from 20 to 25 years old
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:07.580]   although it can be much earlier.
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:11.420]   And the earlier the onset of a bipolar episode,
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.140]   which we will define in a few minutes,
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.640]   the earlier the onset of that episode,
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.460]   the higher likelihood that the bipolar disorder
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.260]   is going to be a stable feature
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.960]   of that person's psychology going forward.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.740]   And yet I also want to point out
[00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.140]   that there are some very good treatments
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:28.040]   for bipolar disorder
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.660]   that those people could still benefit from.
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.940]   There are basically two kinds of bipolar disorder
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:36.980]   referred to as bipolar one and bipolar two.
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.740]   So let's just talk about bipolar one first.
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.840]   Bipolar one is characterized
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.080]   by a fairly extended period of mania.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.220]   What is mania?
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:50.220]   Mania is a period of very elevated mood, energy,
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:53.540]   distractibility, impulsivity, and some other symptomology
[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:55.600]   that we'll talk about going forward.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.640]   But this manic episode is extreme.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:04.640]   This is a condition in which the energy lift, the mood lift,
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:07.860]   and the sort of impulsivity and actions and words
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.660]   of the person suffering from manic bipolar disorder
[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.820]   are very noticeable and very extreme.
[00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:15.140]   Now, a key thing, however,
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.960]   is that it's not always noticeable
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.440]   to the person suffering from it that they are in this mode.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.740]   Sometimes they recognize that, sometimes they don't,
[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.940]   but it's always highly recognizable to other people
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:29.220]   that the person suffering from manic bipolar disorder
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.940]   is not like other people.
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.480]   So let's talk about bipolar one in a little bit more depth.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.700]   One of the key clinical criteria
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.100]   or diagnostic criteria for bipolar one
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.640]   is that a person suffer from these manic episodes
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.600]   or display these manic episodes for seven days or more.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.700]   That turns out to be very key.
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:51.760]   The stability of that manic episode for seven days or more
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.880]   turns out to be very important.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.880]   And for those seven days,
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:59.260]   the person is in an elevated mood, expansive thought
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.380]   all day, every day for those seven days.
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:03.520]   Now, there are a lot of reasons
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.220]   why somebody could be in a manic mode.
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.660]   It doesn't necessarily mean
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:09.700]   that somebody has bipolar disorder.
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.820]   In fact, someone could be in a manic mode
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.620]   for seven days or more
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.860]   and still not be diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:16.700]   Why?
[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.700]   Well, there are other things
[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.620]   that can create manic episodes,
[00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.820]   things like traumatic brain injury, things like seizure,
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.420]   things like various prescription drugs or illicit drugs,
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:28.580]   things like amphetamine and cocaine.
[00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.800]   That is not the same as bipolar disorder,
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.060]   even though from a symptomology perspective,
[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.060]   they might look even identical.
[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:37.340]   So let's think about these symptoms
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:41.020]   and the diagnostic criteria that a psychiatrist would use
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:44.020]   in order to ask whether or not someone is manic
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:46.500]   because they have manic bipolar disorder
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:50.040]   or whether or not that person is manic for some other reason
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.500]   such as traumatic brain injury, illicit drugs, et cetera.
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:57.800]   So typically a person will be brought into a clinic
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.660]   or a person would bring themselves to a clinic
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.480]   or meet with a psychiatrist.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.400]   It seems more likely
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.520]   that they would be directed toward a psychiatrist
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.140]   because oftentimes people who are in a manic episode
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.320]   just simply won't have the perspective
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.480]   or the foresight to bring themselves into the clinic.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.200]   And the psychiatrist is going to start to evaluate
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.780]   for a couple of different things.
[00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.240]   But first of all, what they're going to try and figure out
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.700]   is whether or not the person has at least three
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.700]   of the following symptoms.
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:28.300]   The first symptom is distractibility.
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.420]   Is the person distractible?
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:30.940]   Are they going from one thing to the next?
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.260]   People who are in a manic episode
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.220]   will be talking about a pen
[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:34.580]   and then they'll be talking about
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:35.580]   something they saw the other day
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:36.700]   and then something they want to purchase
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.700]   and then a place they're going to travel to, et cetera.
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.460]   But they are also very prone to any stimulus within the room
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.300]   meaning a bell could go off
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.500]   or there could be a sound out in the hallway
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.460]   and they'll orient to that.
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:47.780]   And then they'll orient to the clinician
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.500]   and then they'll orient to something in their pocket.
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.780]   So they're all over the place.
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.260]   You could think of this a little bit like ADHD
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:56.340]   or attention deficit disorder, but it's very extreme.
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.060]   So highly distractible, highly impulsive,
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.660]   impulsivity relates to actions.
[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.620]   So the person might be fidgeting with something
[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.220]   and then they might try and leave the room
[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:09.300]   or the person might, if they were out in the real world,
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.720]   somebody might notice that the person is going
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.360]   and purchasing multiples of something
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.740]   that would be unusual for someone to purchase.
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.580]   So for instance, I happen to know someone
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.060]   whose ex-spouse had bipolar disorder
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.800]   and their ex-spouse went out
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.980]   and bought 10 plus air fryers, right?
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.660]   I mean, I think unless you're a restaurant
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:28.840]   that's using a lot of air fryers,
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:32.240]   the idea that you would need more than one or two air fryers
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.900]   might just seem a little bit out of the norm.
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.980]   And so that impulsivity can be purchasing,
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.940]   it can be other things as well.
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:43.340]   It could be booking 12 international trips in one afternoon
[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.480]   or going and buying three cars, et cetera.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.640]   So impulsivity.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.620]   The other is grandiosity.
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:51.260]   People who have manic bipolar disorder
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:55.440]   who are in a manic episode will often display words of
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.140]   or actions of grandiosity.
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:59.700]   And keep in mind, these are not lies
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.540]   in the sense that the person isn't lying
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.120]   in order to try and pull one over on anybody.
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.980]   These are actual beliefs that the person comes to have
[00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:09.820]   about their grandiose position in the world
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:13.200]   or grandiose opportunities or potential in the world.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.100]   Typical forms of grandiosity in manic episodes
[00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.100]   would be that the person suddenly decides
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.060]   that they are going to win a Pulitzer Prize,
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.180]   they are the person selected to win a Pulitzer Prize,
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.200]   they're going to write a novel that afternoon
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.320]   and they're going to win a Pulitzer Prize that year,
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.480]   which is more or less a delusion of grandeur, right?
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.340]   The idea that someone could do that in one afternoon,
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:35.220]   I suppose it is possible in the realm of all possibilities,
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:37.720]   but it's extremely unlikely.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:41.100]   Other forms of grandiosity that often present themselves
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.460]   in people suffering from a manic episode
[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.420]   will be that they're going to run for president
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:50.420]   or that they are the person that they believe is selected
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:53.480]   by the citizens of a given country
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.980]   or by the universe to be the president of that country
[00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:58.780]   or to be president of the universe, right?
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:21:59.780]   It sounds ridiculous,
[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:02.340]   but those sorts of delusions of grandiosity
[00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:04.720]   are one condition that often presents itself
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.740]   or one set of symptoms that presents itself.
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.140]   Flight of ideas are also typical of manic episodes.
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.020]   So this is a little bit like distractibility,
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:16.060]   but this would be people talking extensively about one thing
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.960]   and then switching and talking extensively
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:18.800]   about something else.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.460]   It would be as if I was doing this podcast
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:21.780]   talking about manic bipolar disorder
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.600]   and then suddenly switching to OCD
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.200]   and then to deliberate cold exposure
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.040]   and then to the role of sugar
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.480]   and its impact on the brain, et cetera.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.560]   So essentially a random selection
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.800]   of the different topics that exist in science,
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.520]   all of which I happen to be very interested in
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.580]   and curious about,
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.920]   but just as we have episodes of the podcast
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.560]   that are about one or two topics
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.120]   and we focus on those in a fairly narrow trench
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:48.460]   of discussion, somebody who has a flight of ideas
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.960]   would be jumping between categories and topics
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.580]   in a kind of pseudo random way.
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.700]   So they might take off down a path of one thing
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:58.340]   and then switch to another without any transition
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.960]   or with transitions that don't have
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.000]   any logical structure to them.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.060]   The other aspect of manic bipolar disorder
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.160]   that often presents itself in the manic episodes
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:10.060]   are agitation, people feeling extremely physically agitated,
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.240]   so a lot of shaking and moving about.
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.560]   This can venture into the realm of paranoia,
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.880]   but a lot of agitation, a difficulty sitting down
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.780]   and being still, a difficulty
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:24.920]   and just looking, feeling and acting calm.
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.000]   And then another condition is no sleep.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.820]   And when I say no sleep, I mean no sleep
[00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:32.960]   or very minimal sleep.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.200]   As incredible as it sounds,
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.920]   people who are in a manic episode
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.920]   can often go seven days or more with zero sleep.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.000]   And a key feature of this zero sleep
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.240]   is that they're not troubled by it.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.520]   They're not thinking, oh, I'm suffering from insomnia
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:47.720]   and I really, really want to sleep.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.320]   Sometimes that's the case, but more often than not,
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.940]   they are simply not sleeping.
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.760]   They're staying up 24 hours, then another 24 hours,
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.940]   it just continues for an entire week.
[00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:59.020]   Again, inconceivable to those of us
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:01.520]   that don't suffer from manic episodes.
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.960]   Can only imagine how pulled apart most of us would feel
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.680]   under those conditions and yet they are just going
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.480]   and going and going with no sleep up all hours,
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:14.680]   shopping, talking, running,
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.960]   doing all sorts of different things in the categories
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.160]   of other symptoms that we talked about before.
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.280]   And it doesn't bother them that they're not sleeping.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.620]   And then the last sort of category of symptoms
[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:27.780]   that the psychiatrist is evaluating for
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:31.560]   and seeing if they present is rapid pressured speech.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.440]   The rapid pressured speech is something
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.200]   that when you hear it, you recognize it.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.120]   This is somebody that almost seems to be hitting you
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.640]   a speech like machine gun fire.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.640]   It's coming at you, coming at you, coming at you.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.840]   And there's really no room for conversation.
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:46.860]   They're not offering any opportunity for a back and forth.
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:47.840]   Or if there is a back and forth,
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.160]   they might ask you how you feel about something
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.520]   and then you started, well, then they're going to hit you
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:55.680]   with another barrage or a paragraph of information
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.080]   or of just speech that's pseudo random.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.080]   So we've got distractibility, impulsivity, grandiosity,
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:04.120]   flight of ideas, agitation, no sleep,
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.240]   and rapid pressured speech.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.120]   For someone to be diagnosed as in a manic episode,
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.960]   they do not have to be engaging in
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:15.300]   or displaying all of those symptoms.
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.640]   They do, however, need to present
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.560]   at least three of those symptoms.
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:23.060]   And then in order to meet the condition of bipolar one,
[00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.260]   they have to be presenting those three symptoms
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.800]   for at least seven days.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.880]   It could be longer, but at least seven days.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.160]   Now, this seems pretty straightforward, right?
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.620]   At one level, the way that I described this
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:38.440]   and the way that it exists in the clinical literature,
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.380]   you could think, well, this should be pretty easy
[00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:43.080]   to diagnose and yet there's a complication there
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.640]   or a challenge there because the psychiatrist, again,
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.220]   has to determine that these manic episodes
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:53.220]   are not due to something other than bipolar disorder.
[00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.400]   For instance, again, it could be TBI, traumatic brain injury,
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.920]   it could be seizures or meds or other sorts of drugs,
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.880]   corticosteroids, which are often prescribed
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.620]   for a number of immune conditions or for wound healing
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.760]   can also cause manic episodes.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.320]   So they have to determine that everything that's happening
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.960]   meets the criteria I described before,
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.020]   three out of seven of these symptom categories
[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:16.560]   for seven days or more and that it can't be better explained
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.200]   by something else going on in that person's life
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.320]   or immediate medical history.
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:22.520]   That's very important.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.220]   Now, the other challenge, and this is something
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.200]   that's going to come up again and again today,
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.220]   not just in the description of the biology
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:31.300]   of bipolar disorder, but also in the description
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.580]   of different treatments and treatment approaches,
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:36.980]   is that typically when somebody is sitting
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:39.760]   in front of a psychiatrist, in particular
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:44.020]   for the first time, those two people are interacting,
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:46.880]   the psychiatrist is just getting one snapshot
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.000]   of the person at that moment, right?
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.160]   So the person could be on day one of a manic episode,
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.680]   the person might be on day six of a manic episode,
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.680]   the person could be transitioning out of a manic episode,
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.560]   or the person could be suffering from a combination
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.780]   of manic episode where because of the impulsivity
[00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:06.040]   of bipolar disorder, they went out and used illicit drugs,
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.680]   they also used cocaine.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.860]   So the psychiatrist has a serious challenge.
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.900]   The psychiatrist has to determine based on a conversation,
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:17.120]   right, this isn't a blood test, this isn't a measurement
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.480]   that you can take on a scale or with a biomarker,
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.860]   they have to use language, a conversation with somebody
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:25.720]   who by all accounts is pretty impaired at conversation
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.040]   to determine whether or not they're suffering
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.540]   from a manic episode that is the consequence
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.360]   of bipolar disorder.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.480]   You can imagine this in the real world as somebody says,
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.280]   "Well, how long has it been since you slept?"
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.260]   And the person starts to answer,
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.840]   "Oh, well, the other day I went down to the basement,
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.040]   I was going to get something out of the refrigerator
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:44.880]   and I thought I might take a nap."
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:45.720]   And then all of a sudden they're talking
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.700]   about something completely different.
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.880]   So they might not even have an answer.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:53.000]   So the psychiatrist has to be a really good detective,
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.040]   a benevolent detective, but a detective nonetheless
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.120]   in determining whether or not these symptoms have existed
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.400]   for seven days or more and whether or not they meet
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.040]   the at least three, it could be more,
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.860]   but at least three of the criteria of symptom categories
[00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.300]   that I talked about before.
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.240]   Now, assuming that they do,
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.760]   assuming that the patient meets those criteria,
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:14.100]   they are likely to be diagnosed with bipolar I.
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:17.440]   Now, bipolar I disorder means they're having
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.840]   these extended manic episodes, seven days or more,
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.080]   but it does not necessarily mean that they are dropping
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.800]   into a depressive episode as well.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.760]   This is a common misconception about bipolar disorder
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.720]   because as it's often called,
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:34.240]   bipolar disorder is referred to as bipolar depression
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.840]   and yet many people with bipolar disorder
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:40.000]   don't necessarily experience the deep depressive episodes.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.460]   Many of them do, but many of them do not.
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:46.240]   So somebody can truly be diagnosed accurately
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.800]   with bipolar I even though they're only experiencing
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.200]   manic episodes and then dropping down to baseline,
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.320]   manic episode, then dropping down to baseline.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.860]   That's very important to understand.
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:00.640]   Now, the second category of bipolar disorder is bipolar II.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:04.360]   So BP2 or bipolar disorder II is somewhat different
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.520]   than bipolar disorder I.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.560]   First of all, it's characterized most often
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.980]   by the presence of both manic episodes,
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:13.280]   mania and depressive episodes,
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.840]   or what's referred to as hypomania.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:19.920]   Now, anytime in biology or in medicine, you hear hypo,
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.000]   it's the opposite of hyper, okay?
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.160]   So we've got normal, hyper and hypo.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.720]   Hypomania is a somewhat suppressed level of mania.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.580]   So this is not going to be as extreme as the mania
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:31.980]   that we typically think of.
[00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:36.100]   And yet the hypo can be due to the duration,
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:38.360]   not the intensity of mania.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:42.480]   That's right, hypomania can mean a lessened intensity
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.140]   of mania, but it can also be used to refer
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.120]   to a shorter duration of mania.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.420]   In fact, that's one of the key criteria for bipolar II.
[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:52.840]   Bipolar II is often diagnosed on the basis
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.880]   of the presence of manic episodes
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:58.700]   that are lasting four days or even less.
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.080]   So someone with BP2 might have four days
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.600]   of this increased energy, goal-directed activity,
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.080]   they're irritable, they're euphoric,
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.600]   they're not sleeping, et cetera,
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.100]   but it's only lasting for about four days.
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:12.520]   Or they could be having longer extended periods of mania,
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.240]   but they are hypomanic episodes.
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.560]   They're not quite as intense.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:19.480]   So the pressured speech isn't quite as pressured.
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.760]   The impulsivity isn't quite as severe, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.320]   The other aspect of bipolar II is one
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.480]   that I had mentioned briefly a moment ago,
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.980]   which is that it's often associated
[00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:31.460]   with the drops into the depressive episodes.
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:33.540]   So people are going from manic episodes
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:35.740]   for four days or less, then they're dropping
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:39.640]   into a depression, going back to normal, manic again.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.840]   I do want to point out, however,
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.620]   that people who have bipolar I can indeed go
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:47.740]   from manic episodes to severe what we call major depression.
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:50.020]   So they can oscillate like a sine wave,
[00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:52.220]   really high highs, really low lows.
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:56.320]   And very important to understand in terms
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.680]   of understanding both bipolar I and bipolar II
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.720]   is that it's not always a sine wave.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.640]   This is really important.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.320]   And it's something that, frankly,
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.800]   I did not know until I started researching this episode
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.420]   and talking to some psychiatrists.
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:09.240]   I should mention I've talked
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.000]   to several board-certified psychiatrists
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.800]   in preparation for this episode.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.280]   I'll give some references to them.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.640]   And in fact, some of them are going to be coming
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.520]   on the podcast as guests in the future
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.400]   for a more in-depth discussion about bipolar
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.640]   and other psychiatric disorders.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.240]   But all of the psychiatrists I spoke to
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.680]   confirmed what the other was saying,
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:29.320]   which was that the way that bipolar disorder can present
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:32.040]   can vary tremendously between individuals.
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.120]   One person might go from very high highs
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.160]   that last seven days or more to very low lows,
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.620]   bouts of depression, major depression
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:40.600]   that could last two weeks or more.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:44.200]   Other people are rapid cycling by way of three days manic,
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.920]   three days normal, three days manic,
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.020]   and then dropping into three days depression.
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:50.480]   So you want to erase that picture in your mind
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.480]   that manic bipolar disorder is this sine wave,
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:56.480]   this cycling up and down between mania and depression.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.920]   It can take a lot of different forms.
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:02.160]   And again, this is a serious challenge
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.400]   for the psychiatrist to diagnose people
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.360]   because of that fact
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.360]   that they're only getting a snapshot of the person
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.840]   unless they've known them for some time
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.680]   and are working with them for some time.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.560]   But this is also especially important for those of you
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:17.720]   that either have bipolar depression
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.960]   or suspect that you might,
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:22.640]   or that know someone with bipolar depression
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:26.160]   or suspect somebody might have bipolar depression,
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.880]   AKA bipolar disorder.
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:31.160]   Because if you're noticing that somebody is very manic
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:34.240]   and then normal, well, that's a very different picture
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.040]   than somebody who's going from very manic
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.560]   to very deep bouts of depression.
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.800]   The very manic to deep bouts of depression
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.480]   is easier to recognize
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.760]   because of the extremes of those highs and lows.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.940]   Now, this might seem somewhat obvious to all of you
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:47.840]   as I describe it.
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.720]   And yet it's very important as a,
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.560]   frankly, a citizen of the planet,
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.280]   who knows other human beings,
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.360]   to keep an eye out for these manic episodes.
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.000]   Because again, whether or not it's four days or less
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.420]   or whether or not it's seven days or more,
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:05.040]   these manic episodes really are the defining criteria
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:08.000]   of bipolar disorder, AKA bipolar depression.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.600]   There are a couple other key features
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.760]   about bipolar one and bipolar two
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.560]   that can allow us to get better insight
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.240]   into whether or not somebody has bipolar one or bipolar two.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.440]   And that's the percentage of time
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.240]   that people with bipolar one versus bipolar two
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.980]   spend in a manic state, a depressed state,
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.660]   or a symptom-free state.
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:28.080]   And this is also important to discuss
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:31.720]   because it turns out that people with genuine,
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.640]   diagnosed bipolar one or bipolar two
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.460]   are often symptom-free,
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:38.620]   which again can make it difficult
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:40.780]   for us as people that know them
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:43.420]   or for people that are treating people
[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:46.280]   with bipolar disorder to identify
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.700]   whether or not somebody is in a manic episode
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:49.680]   or a depressive episode
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:50.720]   or whether or not they are headed
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.960]   into a manic or depressive episode.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.680]   So the numbers on this have been studied.
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.680]   It's from a paper, actually two papers,
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.120]   first author Judd, J-U-D-D et al,
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.120]   published some years ago, 20 years ago,
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.360]   but the data hold up really nicely over time.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.280]   These were both published
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.880]   in Journal of American Medical Association Psychiatry.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.360]   So JAMA Psychiatry is a superb journal.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.920]   And basically people who have bipolar one on average
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:17.040]   spend about 50%, it's actually 53%
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:20.420]   was the number that was eventually converged upon,
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:22.840]   but about 50% of their time symptom-free.
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:23.760]   That's interesting, right?
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.160]   Somebody who has genuine bipolar one disorder
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.920]   can spend as much as half of their life symptom-free,
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:32.420]   sleeping normally, speaking normally, et cetera,
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:36.480]   about 32% of the time depressed.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.520]   And when we say depressed, we mean major depression.
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:41.440]   So severe challenges with waking up
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.020]   at two or three in the morning
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.520]   and having trouble falling back asleep,
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.520]   that's one of the defining characteristics of depression
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.760]   or sleeping far too much,
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.280]   having a hard time getting out of bed in the morning,
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.640]   suppressed appetite, suppressed libido, suppressed motivation,
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:54.440]   all the general symptoms of major depression,
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.220]   which we'll talk about a little bit more later
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:57.800]   and in an upcoming episode
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.660]   about major depression in particular.
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.940]   And then about 15% of their time
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:04.840]   in this kind of manic state or mixed manic state
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.900]   where they are showing long, again,
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.680]   seven days or more bouts of sleeplessness, irritability,
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.820]   pressured speech, grandiosity, et cetera.
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:16.760]   Contrast that with people who have bipolar two disorder
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:20.000]   who are spending about half of their time
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.800]   in a depressed state.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.860]   So that's interesting.
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:24.440]   People with bipolar two disorder,
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:27.280]   while not always displaying depressed states
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.960]   or oscillations between mania or hypomania
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.140]   and depressed states,
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:33.640]   they tend to be in a depressed state more often.
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:34.960]   And again, this is major depression.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.460]   This isn't just a little bit of a low.
[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:39.300]   This is a serious depression of their nervous system,
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.720]   their mood, and as we say, their affect,
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:42.840]   their outlook on life.
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:45.200]   And that's one of the key distinguishing features
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.120]   of major depression
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:50.380]   is that people's outlook on life becomes very diminished
[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:52.120]   in the sense that they don't see a future.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.520]   You ask them about, you know, how's work going?
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:55.360]   How are relationships?
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:58.280]   And it's not just that they feel that that's going poorly.
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.240]   They really feel as if there's no opportunity
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.700]   for those things to improve.
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:05.960]   Those people with bipolar two tend to be symptom free
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.520]   about 45% of the time.
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:09.360]   Again, these are averages.
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.360]   So about 45% of the time,
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.340]   that's a considerable amount of the time.
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:15.820]   And they tend to be in these hypomanic states
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:18.240]   only about four or 5% of the time.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:20.740]   Again, the criteria for BP2, bipolar two,
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:24.340]   is these four days or less of mania or hypomania,
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:27.420]   but only 4% of the time or 5% of the time
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:30.760]   is a small enough sliver of the pie
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.800]   that is these people's existence
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:36.200]   that you can imagine why it would be easy
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.820]   for them or other people to overlook the fact
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:41.620]   that they have bipolar disorder and not major depression.
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:42.460]   Think about it.
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:44.640]   This is a person who, or I should say,
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.900]   a collection of people who are spending
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.240]   about half of their time depressed,
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:52.480]   close to half, 45% of their time symptom-free,
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:56.100]   and then about 5% of their time in a hypomanic state.
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:37:00.680]   So either shortened bouts of high intensity mania
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:04.480]   or hypomania that is of reduced intensity.
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:07.020]   One of the reasons that I mentioned these percentages
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:09.280]   of time spent in a symptom-free depressed manic
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.320]   or hypomanic state is because one of my major goals
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:14.840]   for today's episode is that it will increase awareness
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.820]   of whether or not you or somebody you know,
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:19.960]   could be a coworker, could be a family member, et cetera,
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.660]   might be suffering from bipolar one or bipolar two.
[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.560]   I think it's fair to say that if somebody is suffering
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:29.160]   from bipolar one, that is likely to be revealed
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:32.340]   or to reveal itself before too long
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:35.100]   because of the fact that people have these extended periods
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:37.360]   of mania, and mania is such an extreme state,
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:39.460]   not just for the person who's experiencing it,
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.680]   but the way that it presents is just so extreme
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.540]   and out of the ordinary.
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:46.400]   But bipolar two, you can imagine could really duck
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.880]   under the radar of our awareness.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.100]   And you could imagine that we might just think somebody
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:53.080]   is low or depressed, especially if that person
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:56.440]   tends to self-medicate with alcohol or other substances.
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.520]   We might think, oh, well, they're drinking more than often,
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:37:59.760]   more than usual, excuse me,
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:02.560]   or they're spending more time alone and isolating.
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.200]   But then when they're in their hypomanic state,
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.680]   that might actually present as normal to us
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:09.400]   because they were in such a depressed state before.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.960]   So it's very important that we dial up our awareness,
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.260]   that we can tune our antennae to the possibility
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.360]   that people out there who might appear depressed
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.860]   or that we haven't heard from in a while
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:20.600]   might actually be suffering from bipolar two disorder.
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.980]   Before we move into a in-depth discussion
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.340]   about the different kinds of treatments
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:26.580]   for bipolar disorder, I'd like to touch on
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:30.040]   just a few additional aspects of what bipolar disorder
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.720]   can do in terms of its negative consequences,
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.320]   and also talk about some of the inherited risk,
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:38.500]   that is the genetic factors and the environmental factors
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.620]   that can contribute to bipolar disorder.
[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:45.520]   In terms of the burden, the very real emotional
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:47.880]   and occupational and educational burden
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:50.680]   that can occur for somebody with bipolar disorder,
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.700]   that's actually been studied.
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:53.960]   There's a measure of this, it's called global burden,
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.840]   which is defined as the years lost
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.340]   in engaging in normal life due to some disability.
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.280]   So that disability could be cancer,
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:05.080]   that disability in this case is bipolar disorder.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.900]   And basically the way this sort of study is done
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:09.200]   is that through questionnaires,
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.600]   I should say quite in-depth questionnaires,
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:15.380]   there's a probing for whether or not somebody has lost
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:17.600]   two consecutive weeks or more
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.480]   of interest in normal activities.
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.040]   Now, for people who have depression,
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.560]   that's a kind of straightforward thing to address, right?
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.900]   You ask somebody, when was the last time you ate?
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:27.760]   Or when was the last time that you went a few days
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.200]   without food or lost interest in relationships
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.880]   or work or sex or things of that sort?
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.960]   And they answer, and you can figure out the amount of time
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.900]   that you've essentially been withdrawn from normal levels
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.460]   of activity for them.
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:44.240]   With bipolar disorder, what it turns out
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:47.760]   is that the global burden of having bipolar I
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.160]   and even bipolar II is massive.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:53.340]   In fact, having bipolar disorder sits
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:56.060]   as one of the highest risk factors
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:40:00.920]   for being in the top 10 of all categories of disabilities
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.100]   leading to global burden.
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:05.360]   Put in plain English, what that means is having bipolar I
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:08.520]   or bipolar II disorder is extremely debilitating.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:12.220]   It really slows down one's life trajectory
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:14.160]   unless it's treated properly.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.360]   Now, the other aspect of bipolar disorder
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.640]   is its heritability.
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:20.720]   And this gets into a little bit of some tricky science
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:25.720]   related to heritability versus the genetic contribution
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:28.040]   of a given disease.
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:30.020]   So that might sound like the same thing.
[00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:32.320]   You think, okay, genes relate to heritability.
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.720]   Heritability relates to genes.
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.560]   But of course, everything about the way
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.660]   that our nervous system works and functions
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:41.360]   and expresses itself, healthy or otherwise,
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:45.080]   is an interaction between our genes and our environment.
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:47.080]   And so typically the way these studies are done
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:50.460]   is you address what is the risk of somebody
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.740]   having a given condition in the general population?
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:53.700]   We talked about that before.
[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:57.160]   Bipolar disorder is a 1% of the world's population.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:00.040]   Compare that to people who have only major depression.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:03.520]   So this would be repeated bouts of two weeks or more
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.160]   of serious depression, not just low mood
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.860]   or something due to a life loss, but major depression,
[00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:13.660]   which is 10 to 17% of people have major depression.
[00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:17.120]   Okay, they suffer from major depressive disorder
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.780]   compared to bipolar disorder, which again is 1%.
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:24.780]   Now, you can address how much of the 1% of bipolar disorder
[00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:28.460]   that exists is due to genes versus environment
[00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:30.220]   in a somewhat exact way.
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:31.760]   This is never an exact science.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.340]   And the way that this is typically done
[00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:37.760]   is to look at concordance, that is the likelihood
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:42.400]   that two identical twins will both have a given condition
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.200]   as opposed to two fraternal twins,
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.880]   which have more different genes
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:48.200]   than identical twins, of course.
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:51.220]   And then two siblings who have similar genes, of course,
[00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:54.440]   but less similar than identical or fraternal twins
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.480]   and so on and so forth.
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.900]   So what you basically do is you evaluate the probability
[00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:59.540]   that two people in the general population
[00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:02.760]   who are completely unrelated will have the same condition
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:05.520]   versus two people in the general population
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.320]   who are very related identical twins.
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:10.900]   And what you find is that in identical twins,
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:14.800]   if one identical twin has true major depression
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.640]   or major depressive disorder,
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:21.280]   there's a 20 to 45% chance that their identical twin
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.660]   will also have major depressive disorder.
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:27.360]   Now, that tells you right there that it can't all be genes.
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.660]   That is not a gene for major depression per se,
[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:33.340]   or if it is a gene or a collection of genes,
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:36.480]   that those genes are also subject to environmental influences
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:40.140]   either prenatal within the womb or after children are born.
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.500]   Now, the large range there of 20 to 45%
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:44.420]   could be due to any number of things.
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:46.120]   It could be experimental,
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.020]   meaning the techniques that were used in experiments.
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:51.540]   It could be due to regional differences, right?
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.780]   One part of the world versus another.
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:54.480]   There are a lot of different factors.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.760]   Right now, we probably shouldn't delve into all that.
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.180]   At some point, we'll probably do an episode
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:01.740]   all about the genetics of nervous system heritability
[00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:04.580]   and heritability of features and mental health, et cetera.
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:07.980]   But we can compare major depression and the heritability
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:10.780]   or the genetic concordance between identical twins
[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:13.120]   in major depression and bipolar disorder and ask,
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:16.860]   if one twin of an identical twin pair
[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.820]   has bipolar depression,
[00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:22.300]   what is the likelihood that the other twin will have it?
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:25.700]   And it turns out that number is much higher.
[00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:29.000]   It's 40 to 70% likelihood or probability
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.800]   that if one twin has bipolar disorder,
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:35.580]   that their identical twin will also have bipolar disorder.
[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:39.420]   So again, the total incidence of bipolar disorder
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:42.520]   in the general population is much lower
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:43.780]   than it is for major depression.
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:48.140]   It's 1% for bipolar versus 10 to 17% for major depression.
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:51.260]   But the genetic component is much higher,
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:55.860]   40 to 70% for bipolar disorder versus 20 to 45%
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:56.860]   for major depression.
[00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:00.260]   I know I'm throwing a lot of numbers out there,
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:03.040]   but basically what this means is that
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.540]   researchers have been able to take those numbers
[00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:08.820]   and filter them through a number of different risk factors
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:10.900]   that are related to early development,
[00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:13.700]   ask questions like if two twins were raised separately
[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:16.340]   or together in one part of the world versus another,
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:19.140]   or had a two-parent household versus one-parent household,
[00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:21.200]   evaluate a lot of different variables.
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.100]   What they were able to discover,
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:25.100]   and this has been shown again and again,
[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:30.100]   is that the genetic contribution to bipolar disorder
[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:32.020]   is very, very high.
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:37.020]   That is the heritability of bipolar disorder is 85%.
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:40.880]   Okay, so again, I want to be really clear what this means.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:46.020]   The total occurrence in the general population, fairly low.
[00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:49.020]   Still serious, 1%, but fairly low
[00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:51.100]   compared to other things like major depression.
[00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:55.100]   However, if someone has bipolar disorder,
[00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:58.500]   it's very likely that they inherited some gene
[00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:02.780]   or sets of genes or more accurately a susceptibility
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:05.740]   within their genes to environmental influences
[00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:08.240]   that can trigger bipolar disorder.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.420]   There are a lot of different ways to discuss
[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:12.320]   and to conceptualize heritability.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:13.460]   So I want to be very careful
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:15.400]   with the way that I'm wording this.
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.520]   What this means is that people with bipolar disorder
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:21.520]   very likely have a gene, or more typically,
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:23.080]   it's going to be a set of genes
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:25.700]   that creates a susceptibility for bipolar disorder
[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:27.520]   to present itself.
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:30.380]   Now, what environmental factors trigger
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:34.480]   or increase that susceptibility is not entirely clear.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.220]   This always seems to center back onto the same sets of things
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:40.020]   like early life stress, trauma, et cetera.
[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:42.660]   Certainly those are going to exacerbate the likelihood
[00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:44.660]   that someone who has a genetic propensity
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:47.920]   for bipolar disorder will express that bipolar disorder
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.300]   in its full array of symptomology.
[00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:55.300]   But 85%, while very, very high is not 100%.
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:59.060]   Again, 85%, while a very high number for heritability
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:00.180]   is not 100%.
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:03.580]   What that means is that there is no single gene
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:07.260]   or identified gene cluster for bipolar disorder.
[00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:09.260]   The reason I keep drilling into this over and over
[00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:11.260]   is that I think we can confidently say
[00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:12.800]   that if someone has bipolar disorder,
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:15.160]   that there was something in their genetic lineage
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:18.220]   that led to that, or that very likely led to that,
[00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:22.380]   and yet it's not like eye color
[00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:24.620]   or some other physical feature
[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:27.300]   which we can actually do the direct,
[00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:28.700]   so it's called Mendelian genetics,
[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:31.000]   and figure out whether or not
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.920]   somebody directly inherited that gene
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:34.440]   from one parent or the other parent.
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:36.980]   So the takeaway here is that
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:39.140]   if you have certainly an identical twin
[00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:41.460]   or a fraternal twin or a sibling or a parent,
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:44.660]   or even a cousin or an uncle that has bipolar disorder,
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:46.900]   in particular, bipolar one,
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:49.360]   well, then you need to be on the lookout
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.840]   for bipolar disorder, perhaps in yourself
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:53.840]   and for the family members of that person.
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:56.360]   My goal within this episode up until now
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:59.700]   has been to provide a clear and detailed picture
[00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:03.040]   of bipolar disorder and its various forms.
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:04.760]   Before we start to talk about treatments
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:05.780]   for bipolar disorder
[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:09.460]   and some of the neural circuit basis for bipolar disorder,
[00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:12.180]   I want to make sure that I distinguish bipolar disorder
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:15.260]   from borderline personality disorder.
[00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:16.740]   We will do an entire episode
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:18.140]   or maybe even several episodes
[00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:20.520]   about borderline personality disorder.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:25.020]   Borderline personality disorder can indeed present itself
[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:29.500]   in ways that resemble bipolar disorder and vice versa,
[00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:32.340]   but there are some key distinctions that need to be made
[00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:34.460]   because it turns out that bipolar disorder
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:38.240]   and borderline personality disorder are quite distinct
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:40.120]   in terms of their defining criteria.
[00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:42.820]   The key distinction between somebody
[00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:47.220]   with borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:50.340]   is that in borderline personality disorder,
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:54.380]   there can be episodes that can resemble mania or hypomania,
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:56.540]   so periods of flights of ideas
[00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:59.060]   or where people are spending money excessively
[00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:02.420]   or are sexually promiscuous in ways that seem manic
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:05.980]   or could even be a little bit manic or a lot manic,
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:08.300]   and yet more often than not,
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:12.300]   there is an environmental trigger for those manic episodes.
[00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:15.980]   That is distinctly different from bipolar disorder
[00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:18.340]   where the person will have manic episodes
[00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:20.340]   without any need for a trigger.
[00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:23.340]   There doesn't need to be a call from someone saying,
[00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:25.300]   hey, let's go on a vacation together,
[00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:27.500]   or there's something coming up this Friday
[00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:28.780]   that's really exciting,
[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:31.160]   or let's enter a relationship together
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:32.400]   of one form or another.
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:35.460]   The person with bipolar disorder will have episodes of mania
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:37.620]   or episodes of major depression
[00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:40.500]   without any need for an external stimulus
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.180]   or environmental trigger,
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:44.980]   but the person with borderline personality disorder
[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:46.260]   almost always, again,
[00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:48.480]   there's never an always in biology and psychiatry,
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:53.060]   but almost always is going to exhibit flights of mania
[00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:55.820]   or depressive episodes or other types of mood shifts
[00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:59.380]   that are dramatic and maladaptive in response to things
[00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:02.300]   that are coming in through the external environment
[00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:03.860]   or relationships of some kind.
[00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:05.740]   In fact, one of the defining characteristics
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:07.860]   of borderline personality disorder
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:10.080]   is this thing that's referred to as splitting.
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.420]   A good example of splitting
[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:14.100]   in the person with borderline personality disorder
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:17.820]   is that they will feel that they absolutely adore you
[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:19.660]   and want to spend all their time with you
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:21.060]   and just think the world of you.
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:22.220]   You can do no wrong.
[00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:25.380]   And in fact, they genuinely can feel that way
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:27.780]   and can genuinely think that way about you.
[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:30.020]   And then for whatever reason,
[00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:32.880]   it could be a perception of something that you did
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.260]   or something that you said
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:37.100]   or suspicion that you're thinking something about them,
[00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:41.220]   they can suddenly shift or split their emotions
[00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:45.040]   and what's called move you from a good object
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:48.220]   or a can do no wrong object to a bad object.
[00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:50.780]   They'll suddenly decide that you are cheating on them
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:53.220]   or that you are being mean to them
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:54.540]   or that you're insulting them
[00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:56.740]   or that something that you're doing
[00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:59.540]   is in violation to their self-worth,
[00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:00.620]   their wellbeing, et cetera.
[00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:02.540]   And that can send them down a pathway
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:04.940]   of being very angry, very depressed, et cetera.
[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:06.800]   As I described the contour of a person
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.780]   with borderline personality disorder
[00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:11.020]   as somebody who splits very suddenly
[00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:12.680]   in response to some environmental trigger,
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:16.180]   real or perceived, there's the risk, of course,
[00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:17.340]   that it makes the person
[00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:18.860]   with borderline personality disorder
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:20.340]   sound like a bad person, you know,
[00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:22.100]   that they're very volatile.
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:23.780]   And while they can be volatile,
[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:25.400]   I want to be very careful to point out
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:27.640]   that the person with borderline personality disorder
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:30.300]   is also suffering in this context.
[00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:33.220]   So while those sorts of relationships
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:35.800]   with people with borderline personality disorder,
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.620]   whether or not they're romantic relationships
[00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:39.680]   or familial or coworkers, et cetera,
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.020]   can be very challenged, can be very high friction
[00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:46.460]   because of the good object, bad object shifts, et cetera,
[00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:48.380]   it's bi-directional, meaning the person
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.720]   with borderline personality disorder, as you can imagine,
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:52.300]   is also going through a lot of suffering.
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:54.880]   At one moment, they feel as if someone is wonderful
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:55.920]   and can do no wrong to them
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:57.980]   and they want to be so strongly affiliated with them.
[00:50:57.980 --> 00:50:59.260]   And then in the next moment,
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:01.420]   they feel as if that person is attacking them
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:04.060]   through their actions or even through their non-actions.
[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:06.100]   So again, we will return to
[00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:08.540]   borderline personality disorder in a separate episode.
[00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:11.200]   It's a serious disorder, both for the person that has it
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:12.620]   and for people around them.
[00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:14.460]   Fortunately, there are some emerging treatments
[00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:16.200]   that are showing promise,
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:18.540]   and it's a fairly common disorder,
[00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:20.580]   but it's important that we distinguish
[00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:23.840]   borderline personality disorder from bipolar disorder,
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:25.980]   mostly on the basis of this need for a trigger.
[00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:28.200]   Again, in bipolar disorder,
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:31.140]   there is no need for a trigger to create a manic episode
[00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:32.460]   or a major depressive episode.
[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:35.680]   They just happen or they can just happen.
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:38.340]   Whereas in borderline personality disorder,
[00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:41.500]   almost always there's an external trigger or a perception
[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:43.720]   that something happened in the environment
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.940]   or that somebody is behaving a certain way
[00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:47.580]   that dramatically shifts the person
[00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:49.600]   with borderline personality disorder
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.500]   from one mode to the next.
[00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:53.820]   As we move into our discussion about the treatments for
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:56.540]   and neural circuits underlying bipolar disorder,
[00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:59.980]   I want to just nail down one more key point.
[00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:01.480]   This is a very brief point,
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:03.940]   but it's perhaps the most important point,
[00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:07.140]   which is the highs and lows,
[00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:09.160]   or we should say the highs,
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:11.500]   these manic episodes and sometimes lows,
[00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:14.140]   'cause again, not everybody with bipolar disorder one or two
[00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:15.900]   suffers from depressive episodes.
[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:17.600]   Sometimes yes, sometimes no.
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:19.840]   In particular in bipolar two, yes,
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:22.760]   but people with bipolar one can have extreme manic episodes
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:25.040]   and then just return to normal, as you recall.
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:28.460]   Well, those extreme lows and or extreme highs
[00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:32.220]   of people with bipolar disorder impact their lives
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:34.000]   in very negative ways.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.320]   This is essential.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:37.020]   And it's something that we're going to return to
[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:39.020]   a little bit later when we talk about the relationship
[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:41.620]   between bipolar disorder and creativity,
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:42.800]   because it turns out that there's
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:45.460]   a quite strong association there.
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:47.200]   One that would almost lead you to believe
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.640]   that being bipolar can be beneficial in certain contexts.
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:54.220]   And yet on whole, having bipolar disorder
[00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:56.880]   is extremely detrimental and challenging
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:58.320]   to the person suffering from it.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:52:59.960]   And it's something that we want to keep in mind
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:03.440]   as we think about treatments and the underlying biology.
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:05.240]   Now I'd like to talk about some of the treatments
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:06.920]   for bipolar disorder.
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:08.880]   And in the discussion of those treatments,
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:11.820]   there's an absolutely incredible history
[00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:14.280]   of the discovery of one particular treatment
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:18.120]   that still shows great success in many patients,
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:19.780]   although some people can't take it
[00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:21.560]   for reasons that we'll talk about.
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:24.680]   And in the description of the discovery of this treatment
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:27.800]   for bipolar disorder, it also reveals to us
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:32.800]   that sometimes treatments come to the profession of medicine
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:37.300]   and through science in ways that precede the discovery
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:39.520]   of the underlying biology.
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:40.360]   That's right.
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:43.720]   Every once in a while, someone will discover a treatment
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:46.300]   for a disease without any understanding
[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:49.940]   about the underlying biological basis of that disease.
[00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:52.800]   And in fact, that is the case for bipolar disorder.
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:56.600]   And the treatment that we are referring to is lithium.
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:59.020]   Lithium, as some of you know,
[00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:01.480]   is on the periodic table of elements.
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:04.420]   It is indeed a naturally occurring substance.
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:08.240]   It actually arrived on earth by way of stardust.
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:11.020]   Yes, we are talking about stardust on this podcast.
[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:13.520]   But if you'd like to learn more about the origins of lithium
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:17.080]   and how lithium arrived here on earth for its discovery
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:18.960]   and applications in psychiatry,
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:21.640]   there's a beautiful talk that exists on YouTube.
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:24.720]   And we'll provide a link to this in the show note captions
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:27.460]   that describes the history of lithium
[00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:31.260]   in terms of its interplanetary travels and arrival on earth.
[00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:34.120]   This is a talk delivered by a physicist
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:38.280]   who's expert in quantum mechanics and is expert in lithium.
[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:40.720]   And it's a just wonderful talk that I can refer you to.
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:42.380]   Less on the biology in that talk,
[00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:44.380]   but certainly a lot about lithium as an element.
[00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:46.840]   So for those of you nerds like me
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:50.820]   that love to know how things came to be here on the planet
[00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:52.360]   in one form or another,
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:55.280]   I'll encourage you to take a brief listen to that talk.
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:56.600]   We are going to discuss lithium
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:58.620]   in the context of its applications
[00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:00.520]   for treatment of bipolar disorder.
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:01.820]   And the discovery of lithium
[00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:04.160]   as a treatment for bipolar disorder
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:05.940]   is truly a miraculous story
[00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:07.540]   that I think everyone should know.
[00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:11.400]   The key player in this story is a physician
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:12.560]   by the last name Cade.
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:14.880]   He was an Australian physician.
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:18.200]   And Cade has a very interesting story in his own right.
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:20.080]   Cade was an Australian psychiatrist
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:24.800]   or Australian psychiatrist who also was a soldier.
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:27.280]   And during World War II,
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:29.120]   after the fall of Singapore to Japan,
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:31.340]   he became a prisoner of war
[00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:35.560]   and he was a prisoner of war from 1942 until 1945.
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:37.800]   So he had some time for observation.
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:39.440]   And during his imprisonment,
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:41.740]   he observed some of his fellow inmates
[00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:44.600]   as going through pretty wild vacillations
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:46.240]   in mood and energy,
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:49.520]   essentially going from manic episodes to depressed episodes
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:51.820]   or from manic to normal episodes.
[00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:54.880]   And for one reason or another,
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:57.080]   we don't know why because I couldn't find any report
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:59.040]   as to why he hypothesized this,
[00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:01.600]   but he hypothesized that there was some buildup
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:05.400]   of some chemical in these people's brains
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:08.000]   that then they would urinate out
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.520]   and that urinating out of whatever chemical was in there
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:15.600]   would allow them to be more relaxed and not manic.
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:16.820]   In other words,
[00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:19.240]   Cade hypothesized that there's a buildup of a chemical
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:21.240]   in certain people's brains that makes them manic
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:23.620]   and they urinate that chemical out.
[00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:27.120]   So eventually he got out of this prison,
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:29.040]   as we mentioned, in 1945,
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:30.960]   and he started doing experiments
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:33.860]   in addition to seeing patients in his clinic.
[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:36.060]   And what he did is he started to take urine
[00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:38.280]   from people who exhibited mania
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:41.000]   and urine from people who were not manic.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.480]   And he took that urine and he would inject it
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:46.440]   into guinea pigs as an experimental model.
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:49.000]   And his general observation
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.480]   was that there was something in the urine
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:55.160]   that was indeed making the guinea pigs more manic
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:59.680]   if they were injected with urine from a manic patient.
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:02.260]   The exact measures that he was taking in these guinea pigs
[00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:03.280]   wasn't exactly clear.
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:06.180]   This is at a time or an era in science
[00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:08.260]   when you could just sort of report things
[00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:09.720]   a little bit more subjectively,
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:12.240]   although there were still numbers and statistics,
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:14.560]   it was a little bit more of like case studies
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:15.600]   and descriptions,
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:16.960]   but it turns out that even though
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:18.280]   that all seems a little bit loose,
[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:21.920]   it led to some incredible and still important discoveries
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:23.680]   for psychiatric health.
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:27.080]   So what he figured out was that the urine from manic patients
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:29.840]   seemed to be more toxic for these guinea pigs.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:33.420]   And he also knew that there are two toxic substances
[00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:36.800]   in urine, urea and uric acid.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:40.160]   So he was able to separate the urea and uric acid
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:44.580]   from people with mania and patients that did not have mania.
[00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:47.800]   And he figured out that the urea was the same
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:50.840]   in both these mentally ill manic patients
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:52.640]   and the non-manic patients.
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:56.200]   So it did not seem that urea was the compound
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:58.680]   that was creating these manic episodes
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:02.840]   or related to manic episodes or held the toxicity.
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:05.800]   So instead he focused on the uric acid.
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:09.520]   Now, in order to put the uric acid into solution
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:11.800]   so that he could inject it into these guinea pigs,
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:13.920]   he had to try a number of different compounds
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:14.820]   in order to dilute it.
[00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:16.460]   It just so happens that,
[00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:18.200]   and you chemists will be familiar with this,
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:19.540]   but there's certain things
[00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:21.180]   that just don't go into solution easily.
[00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:23.140]   You put the powder in a vial,
[00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:25.440]   you add some water or a saline or another solution,
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.800]   you mix it up and the powder stays suspended in there.
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:32.600]   It just doesn't actually ever become a clear liquid
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:33.940]   that you can inject.
[00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:36.920]   So in order to try injecting different strengths
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:40.540]   of uric acid, he ended up using lithium
[00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:43.760]   to assist in the dilution and lithium worked.
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:46.120]   So what he basically was doing, again for you chemists,
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:49.440]   is he was taking uric acid, he was adding lithium
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:52.780]   and making a solution of lithium urate, okay?
[00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:55.440]   This is a lot of details, but this is important
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:57.520]   because what he eventually found
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:01.520]   is that when he diluted the uric acid with lithium
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:04.140]   and created lithium urate, lithium urate
[00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:07.140]   could actually calm down these guinea pigs
[00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:10.280]   that were injected with the toxic urea.
[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:13.160]   He also found that lithium urate
[00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:16.860]   had a generally calming effect on these guinea pigs.
[00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:19.540]   So now we're really off in crazy territory, right?
[00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:21.720]   We're talking about urine from patients
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:24.900]   that's separating out urea and uric acid.
[00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:27.020]   We're adding lithium to the uric acid.
[00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:28.620]   We're injecting this into guinea pigs.
[00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:30.740]   This is getting pretty wild and pretty weird,
[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:32.020]   but this is medicine.
[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:35.000]   And from time to time, this is medicine and science.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.880]   Cade was a good scientist
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:39.900]   in addition to being a good physician.
[00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:41.540]   And by good scientists,
[00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:43.420]   I mean that he did control experiments.
[00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:47.440]   Here he was injecting lithium urate
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:49.620]   into animals and seeing an effect,
[00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:52.700]   but he knew that that solution of lithium urate
[00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:55.500]   contained not just the uric acid,
[00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:57.060]   but it also contained lithium.
[00:59:57.060 --> 01:00:00.020]   And so he quite appropriately asked,
[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:02.180]   maybe the lithium alone
[01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:05.540]   is having this calming effect on these guinea pigs.
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:07.260]   And indeed that was the case.
[01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:09.220]   When he did the proper control experiment
[01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:14.220]   and injected only lithium solution into these guinea pigs,
[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:15.500]   they calmed down.
[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:20.060]   From there, he in sort of 1940s style medicine,
[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:21.780]   this would not happen now,
[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:24.020]   he very quickly moved from that animal model
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.580]   into human patients
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:28.620]   and started injecting human patients with lithium
[01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:31.660]   or providing lithium orally to those patients.
[01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:33.300]   And lo and behold,
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:38.300]   found an absolutely profound and positive effect of lithium
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:41.360]   in reducing symptoms of mania.
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:44.020]   And as all good physician scientists do,
[01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:45.700]   he wrote up his results.
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:48.900]   And he wrote it up in a paper entitled
[01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:52.380]   "Lithium Salts and the Treatment of Psychotic Excitement."
[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:53.620]   Okay, back then they didn't call it mania,
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:55.880]   they called it psychotic excitement.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:58.720]   This is a paper that was published September 3rd, 1949
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.640]   in the Medical Journal of Australia.
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.180]   We will provide a link to this study
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:05.520]   as now a classic study in the field of psychiatry.
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.240]   It's a really wonderful paper to read.
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:09.240]   And actually I encourage people,
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:12.680]   even if you're not a scientist or a clinician,
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.640]   to just take a quick look at the second page in this paper
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:17.800]   that we've made available to you,
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:21.400]   where he describes each of the various case studies
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:23.840]   or the individuals that he looked at.
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.160]   I'm not going to read these in detail now
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.120]   'cause it would take a lot of unnecessary time.
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:31.660]   But things like case seven, MC, aged 40 years old,
[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:33.640]   suffering from manic recurrent mania.
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.820]   In this episode, he'd been excited,
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:36.920]   restless and violent for over two months
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:37.960]   and was interfering so often
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:40.520]   that he had to be confined to a single room during the day.
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.800]   So this is very debilitating,
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.960]   what we now know to be bipolar depression.
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:48.320]   He commenced taking lithium citrate 20 grains,
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.360]   that's a measure of the amount of lithium,
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:51.200]   three times a day.
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.760]   In four days, he was distinctly quieter.
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:58.440]   And by February 13th, 1949, appeared practically normal.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.940]   He continued well and on February 20th, 1949,
[01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:03.080]   the dose of citrate was reduced to 10 grains,
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:03.920]   et cetera, et cetera.
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.360]   He left the hospital.
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.900]   There are numerous descriptions of this sort
[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:10.340]   within this paper, including some descriptions of patients
[01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:12.860]   that did not see such success
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:15.240]   and including some descriptions of patients
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:18.200]   that suffered from some negative side effects.
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:20.000]   So that's important to point out as well.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.280]   But it's an absolutely wonderful paper
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:24.720]   and it's an absolutely wonderful voyage
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.300]   into the history of psychiatry,
[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:27.560]   right down to the discussion
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:30.320]   where in just three short paragraphs,
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:32.760]   Cade really lays out the case
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.980]   for why lithium is such an important discovery
[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:37.960]   in the treatment of what at that time
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:39.480]   they were calling psychotic excitement
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:43.300]   and what we now know to be manic bipolar depression.
[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:44.800]   Lithium, I should mention,
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:46.420]   has a number of important features,
[01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:48.680]   but also a number of important side effects
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:49.720]   that need to be considered.
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:53.160]   First of all, it does have a certain toxicity
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.180]   and so levels of lithium in the blood
[01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:57.700]   need to be monitored extremely carefully.
[01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:58.680]   So it's not the sort of thing
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:00.820]   that people can just take at a given dose
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:02.480]   and every patient responds the same.
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:03.760]   There's a lot of oversight
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:05.560]   and a lot of blood tests that have to be done,
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:08.840]   especially in the first three months of lithium treatment.
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:11.600]   I should mention that lithium treatment is still used
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:14.160]   to some great degree of success in many,
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.840]   not all people suffering from bipolar depression
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:20.360]   or bipolar disorder rather,
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:23.840]   but there are a number of important things that happen
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:28.240]   between 1949 and present day that prevented lithium
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:31.460]   from reaching patients that really needed it.
[01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:33.140]   And that all can be summarized
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:35.140]   in two or three short sentences.
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:37.360]   Basically, by virtue of the fact
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:39.840]   that lithium is a naturally occurring element,
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:41.320]   it could not be patented.
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.100]   And as a consequence of that,
[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:46.120]   there wasn't a lot of potential profit for drug companies
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:48.400]   to produce lithium, in fact, still to this day,
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.680]   it's very low cost.
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:54.080]   And still to this day, no one really owns the patent
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.280]   for lithium in its purest form.
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.760]   So that made it unattractive.
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:00.080]   It turns out that the FDA in the United States
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.560]   didn't allow lithium to be used as a treatment
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:06.720]   for manic bipolar disorder until 1970.
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.840]   So we're talking about a full 21 years
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:11.120]   from the publication of this paper
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:13.100]   by Cade in the Medical Journal of Australia
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:16.680]   showing quite beautifully the great potential
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:19.740]   and use of lithium for quelling the symptoms
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:23.680]   of bipolar disorder until the first patients
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:24.840]   in the United States were starting
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:26.580]   to access lithium regularly.
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:28.280]   And nowadays, of course, lithium is available,
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:30.480]   but still not able to be patented
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.800]   'cause it's element number three on the periodic table.
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:34.180]   It's naturally occurring.
[01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:36.120]   It's not literally falling down from the stars
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.740]   as stardust and going into pill form,
[01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:41.940]   but rather it can be synthesized in laboratories,
[01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:43.400]   but it is available.
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:47.040]   It does show not only great potential in many patients,
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.200]   but great application in many patients
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:51.120]   despite its side effects.
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:55.200]   So lithium really stands as this kind of golden example
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:58.680]   of a treatment that works, at least in many individuals,
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:01.960]   prior to an understanding of the biological basis
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:04.920]   of the disease for which that treatment is needed.
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:07.040]   Now, with that said, scientists and clinicians
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:09.760]   have been quite rigorous in trying to understand
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:13.080]   why and how lithium works in order to understand
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:15.260]   the why and how of bipolar disorder.
[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:17.580]   This is the way that proper medicine and science is done.
[01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:20.120]   Even if there's an excellent treatment for something,
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:22.980]   it's important to understand why that treatment works
[01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:25.320]   because first of all, not everyone responds
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:26.160]   to that treatment.
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:29.420]   Second of all, scientists and physicians understand
[01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:31.960]   that just because we have one treatment that works,
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:34.280]   if it has any side effects at all,
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.720]   there is the possibility for better treatments.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:39.840]   So it's not just about trying to bypass a drug
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.700]   that doesn't make much money for drug companies.
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:43.360]   I know a lot of people think in those terms,
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:46.040]   they think, oh, well, there's this continued search
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.940]   for better treatments for bipolar disorder,
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:48.960]   even though lithium works
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.600]   because lithium doesn't allow drug companies
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:51.640]   to make much money.
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:52.840]   That's not really the case.
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:55.240]   The fact of the matter is, is that the toxicity,
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:58.600]   some of the other issues that are created with lithium,
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:01.560]   the fact that people need the ongoing blood testing,
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:04.560]   et cetera, really stimulates the need,
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:07.240]   really an urgent need for new and better treatments
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:08.120]   for bipolar disorder.
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:10.320]   And only by understanding how lithium works
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:13.680]   at the cellular level, at the neural circuit level, et cetera,
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:16.020]   do we really stand to find those new discoveries.
[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:18.280]   If you were to do a literature search
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:21.960]   on the actions and mechanisms of lithium
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:24.240]   in terms of how it can calm people down
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:26.280]   and reduce their manic episodes,
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:29.000]   you would find an enormous array of papers,
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.640]   literally thousands of scientific studies
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:35.020]   in animals and in humans, which for instance,
[01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:37.200]   will tell you that lithium treatment
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.680]   will increase so-called BDNF,
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:42.280]   brain-derived neutrophic factor.
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:43.960]   BDNF is often talked about
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:45.700]   in the context of neuroplasticity,
[01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:48.040]   the brain and nervous system's ability to change
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.400]   in response to experience.
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:53.340]   And indeed, it does seem that ingesting lithium
[01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:54.920]   increases BDNF.
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:59.280]   BDNF is what we call permissive for neuroplasticity.
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:02.080]   It doesn't create specific changes in the brain,
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:04.400]   meaning it's not going to make your memory better
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.360]   or your coordination better
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.800]   or your emotional state better per se.
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:13.560]   What BDNF does is it permits the neurons, the nerve cells
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.040]   and their connections in the brain
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:17.920]   to be more likely to change
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:21.600]   if the proper environmental conditions are met.
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:26.560]   That is BDNF creates a kind of buoyancy to neuroplasticity.
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:28.960]   It opens the gates to neuroplasticity.
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:31.200]   So lithium does increase BDNF.
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:32.480]   We'll talk about why that's important
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.880]   in the context of the neural circuits involved
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:37.400]   with bipolar disorder in a few minutes.
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:41.240]   It also seems to be a potent anti-inflammatory.
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:42.880]   Now, inflammation is one of those words
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:45.200]   that's thrown around extensively nowadays,
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.440]   especially on social media
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:48.760]   and especially as it relates to any health condition.
[01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:50.940]   It's like inflammation, inflammation, inflammation
[01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:52.620]   always seems to be discussed
[01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:54.440]   in the context of inflammation being bad.
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:56.080]   But I do want to point out
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:59.160]   that inflammation is a natural adaptive response
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:03.220]   to physical injury to a cell or organ or tissue of any kind.
[01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:05.040]   Inflammation is the basis
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:08.240]   by which adaptations occur to exercise.
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.760]   So for instance, you were to weight train
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:12.680]   and use a heavier than normal weight
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.040]   and do a set to failure
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:16.240]   or create some little micro terrors in the muscle
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:17.740]   that are healthy in the sense
[01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:19.720]   that they would create adaptations
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:22.400]   and make that muscle stronger, maybe even grow that muscle.
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:24.700]   There's an inflammatory response associated with that
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:27.400]   that is critical to the positive adaptation.
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:29.480]   So inflammation isn't always bad,
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:33.920]   although excessive or as we say, runaway inflammation is bad.
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:36.680]   Lithium seems to be able to suppress inflammation
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:40.140]   and importantly, it can suppress inflammation
[01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:43.160]   in neural tissues and within the brain in particular.
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.920]   That is important and we will return to that
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:48.340]   and why it's important in a little bit.
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:49.860]   The other thing about lithium
[01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:52.900]   is that lithium is neuroprotective.
[01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:56.120]   That is, it can prevent neurons from dying
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.280]   under certain conditions.
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:58.400]   Why would neurons die?
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:00.400]   Well, there are a lot of reasons why neurons can die.
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:01.920]   There can be a physical insult to the neurons.
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:05.160]   You can get hit really hard in the head, a bullet,
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:07.680]   God forbid can enter the skull and kill neurons.
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:10.520]   There are a lot of reasons why neurons can die.
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:13.920]   Neuroprotection is a situation
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:16.560]   in which a neuron is given some sort of chemical
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:20.860]   or physical resiliency that allows it to suffer an insult
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:21.920]   and yet bounce back.
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:23.200]   So it's very similar to the way
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.000]   that we think about psychological resiliency.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.200]   Neuroprotection is an ability for neurons
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:31.700]   to be better able to handle stress of different kinds.
[01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:34.240]   In particular, excitotoxicity.
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:36.600]   There's a phenomenon in bipolar disorder
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.660]   and a lot of other psychiatric conditions
[01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:41.720]   in which hyperactivity of certain brain areas
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:44.440]   actually starts to kill off neurons.
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:46.280]   Hyperactivity doesn't always do this,
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:48.140]   but it turns out that if certain brain circuits
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:49.800]   are too active for too long,
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:52.560]   some of the chemicals associated with neuronal activity,
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:55.360]   things like calcium and neurotransmitters like glutamate
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:57.840]   can actually kill the very neurons that are active.
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.600]   So it seems that lithium can prevent
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:00.900]   some of that neurotoxicity.
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:03.800]   Now, this turns out to be particularly important
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.720]   for this discussion about bipolar disorder
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:08.440]   and the neural circuit basis of bipolar disorder.
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:10.600]   Because if we are to just take a step back and ask,
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.000]   what's different in the brains
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.040]   of people with bipolar disorder?
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.900]   There are some very interesting answers that start to emerge.
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:19.400]   There are basically two main neural circuits
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:22.600]   that are present in normal individuals.
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:24.720]   I say normal, I say that respectfully
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.000]   to the people with bipolar disorder
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   by referring to people who do not suffer
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.480]   from manic episodes or from manic depression.
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:33.780]   There are circuits that are present
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:35.280]   in people with bipolar disorder
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:40.520]   and in people that do not suffer from bipolar disorder.
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:43.560]   Both of those circuits do the same thing
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.360]   in both sets of individuals.
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:47.840]   And yet in people with bipolar disorder,
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.960]   there seems to be an atrophy
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:53.240]   or a removal of certain neural connections over time
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:55.200]   that leads to a situation
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:59.600]   in which people with bipolar disorder become very poor
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.240]   at registering their own internal state.
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:04.140]   In particular, their emotional states
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:05.840]   and their somatic states.
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:06.780]   What we're referring to here
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:08.480]   is something called interoception.
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:09.460]   I've talked about this a little bit
[01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:11.260]   on the Huberman Lab podcast before,
[01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:13.780]   but there are two modes of perception.
[01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:16.680]   Perception, of course, is a attention
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:18.800]   to something that's happening in our environment
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:21.940]   or to us on or within our body.
[01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:25.100]   Exteroception is literally an attention
[01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:26.040]   to things that are happening
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:27.880]   beyond the confines of our skin.
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:29.960]   So seeing that person's face over there
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:32.660]   or seeing that color of leaf over there
[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:34.660]   or hearing a sound over to my left.
[01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:36.400]   That is exteroception,
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:39.640]   perception of things beyond the confines of one's skin.
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:41.400]   Then there's interoception,
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:44.240]   which is perception of things that are happening internally.
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.160]   Like how full does my gut feel?
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:48.540]   How fast is my heart beating?
[01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:50.500]   Some people can measure that quite accurately
[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:51.520]   just by thinking about it.
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:53.300]   Other people can't.
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:54.480]   How happy am I?
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:55.680]   How sad am I?
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:56.920]   How energetic am I?
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:58.040]   How lethargic am I?
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:11:59.020]   Et cetera, et cetera.
[01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:00.720]   So we are always existing in a balance
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.440]   between exteroception and interoception.
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:04.840]   But as it turns out,
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:07.720]   people with bipolar disorder over time
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:10.400]   and especially into the second and third decade
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.960]   of having bipolar disorder
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:15.240]   seem to have progressively diminished levels
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:16.480]   of interoception.
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:18.280]   And that very likely is important
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:20.520]   in their inability to register, for instance,
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:23.760]   that, wow, they are talking at an excessive rate
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:27.280]   or they haven't slept in five or even 10 days
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:30.200]   or they haven't eaten in a long period of time.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:35.200]   This atrophy of neural circuits for interoception
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:37.040]   is starting to emerge
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:40.020]   as one of the defining neural circuit characteristics
[01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:42.120]   or underpinnings of bipolar.
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.880]   Now, I bridged to this conversation about neural circuits
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:48.720]   from the statement that lithium can protect
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:51.640]   against some of the neurotoxic effects
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:53.420]   of neural circuits being very active.
[01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:55.320]   Now, this can get a little bit complicated,
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:57.060]   but I promise I'm going to make it clear
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:59.800]   for any of you that are watching and/or listening.
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:03.900]   The reality is that people with bipolar depression
[01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:06.280]   very likely have a hyperactivity,
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.000]   that is an increased level of activity
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.560]   in certain circuits within the brain
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:12.080]   early in the expression of their disease.
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:14.300]   And that typically, as I mentioned earlier,
[01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:15.920]   sets in around the early 20s,
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:18.040]   although sometimes that can be even earlier
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:19.820]   in the teens and so forth.
[01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:24.820]   But that hyperactivity, we think, leads to a toxicity,
[01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:29.160]   an excitotoxicity of certain elements of the neural circuits
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:31.640]   that are responsible for interoception.
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:34.440]   In other words, the overuse of certain circuits
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:37.480]   can lead to a diminishing, an atrophy,
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:40.000]   or even a death of certain elements within those circuits.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.560]   And it appears that lithium,
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:45.420]   through its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects,
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:49.160]   and through its ability to increase BDNF,
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:52.140]   very likely protects us against some of that atrophy
[01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:54.260]   of those circuits for interoception.
[01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:56.400]   So this isn't a case in which, you know,
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:59.020]   people with bipolar have a neural circuit
[01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:00.060]   or lack a neural circuit,
[01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:02.200]   and people without bipolar are the opposite.
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:03.040]   This is a case in which
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:05.100]   everyone more or less starts out the same,
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:07.240]   but it seems that there's a hyperactivity
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:09.860]   of certain neural circuits in people with bipolar disorder
[01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:13.440]   that over time actually causes those circuits to diminish.
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:14.560]   Now, this is very important
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:17.320]   because some of the more recent longitudinal studies
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:19.400]   doing brain imaging on people with bipolar disorder
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.960]   and those without, and doing that over time
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:23.840]   in patients starting as early as their teens,
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:25.800]   but into their 20s and 30s,
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:27.620]   reveals just that,
[01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:29.900]   that there can be hyperactivity of circuits early on,
[01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:33.800]   but then hypo, reduced activity of those very same circuits
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:36.360]   at a time five or 10 years later.
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:38.240]   Again, this speaks to the complicated nature
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:41.800]   of bipolar disorder and the complicated nature of psychiatry
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:44.960]   and linking specific psychiatric disorders
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:46.840]   to neural circuits in general.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:49.500]   Because if you have a situation in which,
[01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:50.600]   you know, in one disease,
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:53.840]   let's just hypothesize here for a second that,
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:55.860]   for instance, in certain forms of schizophrenia,
[01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:57.040]   there's elevated dopamine,
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:58.900]   and were we to just reduce the amount of dopamine
[01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:00.100]   that they would receive relief
[01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:02.160]   from those schizophrenic symptoms?
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.400]   Well, that's all pretty straightforward on the face of it.
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:06.400]   But in this situation with bipolar disorder,
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:09.240]   what we're talking about is hyperactivity, too much activity,
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:12.000]   leading to hypoactivity through death
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:12.960]   of those very circuits.
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:16.800]   And so now you can especially appreciate why
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:19.080]   when the patient shows up to the psychiatrist
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.800]   or when the psychiatrist shows up to the patient
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:23.200]   in the total course of their disease
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.420]   is going to be very important.
[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:26.880]   And then layer on top of that the complexity of the fact
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:30.160]   that the very defining characteristic of bipolar disorder
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:31.860]   is that there are oscillations in mood.
[01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:33.760]   So now we need to think about treatments
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.600]   not just for the manic episodes,
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:38.060]   but also treatments for the depressive episodes.
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:40.360]   And that's, in fact, what psychiatrists do.
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.720]   Turns out that they apply different treatments
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:44.400]   or combinations of treatments
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:46.540]   for patients that are in manic episodes
[01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:47.960]   versus depressive episodes,
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:51.460]   and they have to infer all that from discussions.
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:53.140]   Again, just exchange of words,
[01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:56.740]   depending on when that person walked into their office,
[01:15:56.740 --> 01:15:59.440]   where they are in terms of manic episodes,
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:02.080]   no symptomology or depressive symptomology,
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:04.500]   and whether or not they've had that symptomology
[01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:06.000]   for an extended period of time.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.640]   And then just to make the situation even more complicated,
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:10.300]   the very circuits that atrophy
[01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:12.040]   that start to wane and disappear
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:13.500]   in people with bipolar disorder
[01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.580]   are the circuits for interoception,
[01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:17.800]   for understanding of what's going on in one's own body.
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:20.280]   So you can imagine if you sit down and ask somebody,
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:23.400]   well, how long has it been since you slept?
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:26.120]   That person may genuinely not know.
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.680]   Or if you ask the very depressed person,
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:29.720]   how depressed are you?
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:32.560]   That person may not be able to articulate that.
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:34.900]   So fortunately, there are solutions to this.
[01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:38.600]   And the solution is that more often than not,
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:40.300]   the accurate understanding of whether or not
[01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:43.280]   someone has bipolar depression or not,
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:47.200]   and what stage of the illness they might be in or not,
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:50.320]   is going to depend on the reports of people around them
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:52.260]   and not the patient themselves.
[01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:55.420]   Hence, the importance of having a rather detailed
[01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:57.560]   and admittedly a rather intense discussion
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:59.880]   about the symptomology of bipolar disorder,
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:03.440]   so that you can have an understanding
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:06.160]   of the people around you and have an eye and an ear
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:07.360]   to whether or not those people
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:08.720]   might be suffering from bipolar,
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:10.680]   and if so, at what stage of the disease
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:11.960]   they might happen to be at.
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.240]   Now, I'd like to talk a little bit more
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:15.280]   about what is known about the neural circuits
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:17.380]   that lead to the manic states,
[01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:18.640]   as well as the depressive states,
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:22.320]   but mainly the manic states of bipolar disorder.
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:25.320]   We already discussed the fact that interoception,
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:27.520]   registering of one's own internal emotions
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:28.520]   and bodily states,
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:31.160]   is diminished in people with bipolar disorder.
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:33.280]   But we haven't really talked about the neural circuits
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:35.820]   that are responsible for that lack of recognition.
[01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:38.960]   For that reason, I'd like to point out a paper.
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:41.720]   This is a fairly recent paper, just came out this year,
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:43.520]   but it's an excellent one,
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:46.360]   looking at the changes over time in neural circuitry
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:50.380]   in people with high genetic risk for bipolar disorder,
[01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:51.840]   and in particular, in young people.
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:54.320]   And studies of this sort are rare,
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.660]   but are exceedingly important because of the fact
[01:17:56.660 --> 01:17:58.680]   that they track individuals over time.
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:01.180]   The title of this paper is "Longitudinal Changes
[01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:03.460]   in Structural Connectivity in Young People
[01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:05.880]   at High Genetic Risk for Bipolar Disorder."
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:07.580]   We will provide a link to this study
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:09.200]   in the show note captions.
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:12.080]   There are a lot of data in this paper,
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:14.840]   in particular, neuroimaging data,
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:17.520]   and it's quite extensive in terms of analyzing
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:19.580]   the so-called connectomics.
[01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:21.080]   You've probably heard of genomics,
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:24.000]   which is the analysis of genes and their display
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.940]   in different individuals or different animals, et cetera.
[01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:29.680]   You have proteomics, which is the display of,
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:31.180]   or the existence of different proteins.
[01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:33.260]   So omics is a big thing now in science.
[01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:35.000]   You kind of throw omics behind anything,
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.340]   and it becomes its own Wikipedia page,
[01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:39.220]   which means it becomes its own thing.
[01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:42.400]   So to speak, I say that only partially in jest.
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:46.940]   Nonetheless, connectomics is the analysis of connections
[01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:50.100]   between different neurons and neural circuit elements.
[01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:52.000]   And what this paper really showed
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.360]   by analyzing the connectomics of neural circuits
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:57.180]   in the brains of many different people
[01:18:57.180 --> 01:19:01.840]   with different categories of, and onset of,
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:05.420]   and severity of bipolar disorder,
[01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:10.180]   as well as controls in different age groups, et cetera,
[01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:14.940]   is that people who are a particularly high risk
[01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:16.380]   for having bipolar disorder
[01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:19.220]   or that have full-blown bipolar disorder
[01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:22.280]   have deficits and actually reductions
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:23.720]   in the amount of connectivity
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:25.920]   between what are called the parietal brain regions
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:27.240]   and the limbic system.
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:28.800]   Now, the limbic system I've talked about before
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:30.620]   in this podcast, if you're not familiar with it,
[01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:32.900]   I'll explain what it is in a moment.
[01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:34.780]   It's simply a collection of brain structures,
[01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:35.800]   not one brain structure,
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:37.760]   but a collection of brain structures
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:39.600]   that generally are responsible
[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:43.220]   for shifting the overall state that we're in
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:46.360]   from states of more relaxed and calm
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:48.820]   to states of more alert and focused.
[01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:51.980]   The limbic system is intimately related
[01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:53.940]   to the so-called autonomic nervous system,
[01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:56.080]   which regulates our sleep-wake cycles
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:59.000]   and a number of other things like our digestion, et cetera,
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000]   our level of hunger and on and on.
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.060]   So the limbic system is really kind of like a volume control
[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:07.500]   or as nerd scientists like to say,
[01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:11.140]   a kind of game control on the overall level
[01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:13.980]   or amplitude of alertness or calmness.
[01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:15.600]   In fact, if we're very, very calm,
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:18.620]   we are asleep or even more calm, we can be in a coma.
[01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:20.960]   If we are very alert, we can be wide awake
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:22.760]   and ready to work and run, et cetera.
[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:25.020]   Or if we are very, very, very alert
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:27.540]   by way of limbic autonomic interactions,
[01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:29.340]   well, then we can be in anxiety,
[01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:31.100]   we can be in full-blown panic attack,
[01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:33.380]   or we can be in mania.
[01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:35.020]   We can have so much energy
[01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:36.440]   that we feel like we don't need to sleep.
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:38.780]   And in fact, disruptions in the circuitry
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:41.100]   really seems to be what's going on
[01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:43.820]   in people who have bipolar disorder.
[01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:46.960]   Now, if disruptions in the circuitry
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:48.300]   are present in the limbic system,
[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:49.460]   that doesn't necessarily mean
[01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:51.720]   that the limbic system is at fault,
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:53.140]   because the way that neural circuits work
[01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:55.500]   is that different brain areas are talking to one another
[01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:57.060]   through electrical chemical signaling,
[01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:58.540]   and they are regulating one another.
[01:20:58.540 --> 01:21:01.060]   And what this paper really tells us
[01:21:01.060 --> 01:21:03.300]   is that there are elements within the parietal lobe,
[01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:04.900]   which is a kind of a section of the brain
[01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:07.380]   that sits off to the side, it's not really off to the side,
[01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:10.740]   but in neuroanatomical nomenclature,
[01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:15.160]   the parietal lobe is connected in two ways,
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:17.060]   bidirectionally, so parietal lobe
[01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:18.180]   is connecting to limbic system
[01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:20.380]   and limbic system is connecting to parietal lobe.
[01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:21.980]   And in people with bipolar disorder,
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:23.380]   it seems that the parietal lobe
[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:26.580]   is able to exert less top-down control,
[01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:28.540]   that is, less suppression
[01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:30.740]   of certain elements of the limbic system,
[01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:33.300]   which, at least right now,
[01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:35.420]   is leading researchers to hypothesize
[01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:39.580]   that the limbic system is sort of revving at higher levels,
[01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:41.160]   it's kind of like RPM in your car,
[01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:43.140]   it's kind of redlining,
[01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:45.820]   at times and for durations that are inappropriate
[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:47.220]   or at least abnormal.
[01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:51.700]   So we have two major sets of neural circuit deficits
[01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:53.620]   or changes in people with bipolar.
[01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:55.700]   Their lack of internal awareness is reduced,
[01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:58.300]   and that turns out to be by way of neural structures
[01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:00.940]   like the insula, which is a brain region
[01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:03.580]   that is connected in a very direct way
[01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:05.700]   to our somatosensory cortex,
[01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:09.820]   so the part of our cortex that registers how we feel,
[01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:13.100]   literally, sense of touch and internal state.
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:15.380]   So those circuits, excuse me,
[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:17.740]   for those of you listening, I just bumped the microphone,
[01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:20.780]   excuse me, those circuits are disrupted
[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:22.060]   in people with bipolar,
[01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:24.260]   and the top-down control,
[01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:26.060]   the kind of accelerator and brake
[01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:30.040]   on our overall levels of energy are also disrupted.
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:34.100]   Now, that's all fine and good because, well, it's true,
[01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:35.740]   at least according to what the data
[01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:37.340]   at this point in time tell us,
[01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:38.760]   there may be new discoveries to come,
[01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:40.620]   but that all seems to be the case,
[01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:42.340]   but it doesn't tell us how to modulate
[01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:43.980]   or change that circuitry.
[01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:47.260]   It also doesn't tell us how something like lithium
[01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:50.180]   can actually benefit a large number of patients
[01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:53.060]   or how a good number of the other treatments
[01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:56.000]   for bipolar disorder, which we'll talk about going forward,
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.060]   can benefit patients with bipolar.
[01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:00.460]   So it appears that lithium is exerting its positive effects
[01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:04.100]   on bipolar depression treatment, at least in part,
[01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:06.300]   by preventing the loss of certain neural circuits,
[01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:08.140]   namely the neural circuits for interoception
[01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:10.900]   and the top-down control over the limbic system.
[01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:14.160]   Now, it turns out that by examining lithium's effects
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:16.400]   at an even more reductionist level,
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:18.420]   we can gain really important insight
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:20.540]   into what's going on in bipolar depression
[01:23:20.540 --> 01:23:23.380]   and some of the other treatments for bipolar depression,
[01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:25.380]   including behavioral treatments,
[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:27.420]   things like transcranial magnetic stimulation,
[01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:29.580]   and even some of the more natural
[01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:31.780]   or so-called nutraceutical treatments,
[01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:35.360]   including things like high-dose omega-3 supplementation,
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:37.440]   which we're going to talk about extensively.
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:38.700]   Now, in order to understand
[01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:40.060]   what we're going to talk about next,
[01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:42.040]   it's important that everybody understand
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:44.020]   a key concept of neuroplasticity.
[01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:45.540]   And this is a key concept,
[01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:46.460]   regardless of whether or not
[01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:48.440]   one is talking about bipolar depression.
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:50.060]   In fact, it's something I think everybody,
[01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:52.540]   every citizen of Earth should know about,
[01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:55.060]   and that's called homeostatic plasticity.
[01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:57.740]   Homeostatic plasticity is a particular form
[01:23:57.740 --> 01:24:01.140]   of neuroplasticity in which if a neural circuit
[01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:04.500]   is overactive for a period of time,
[01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:07.500]   there are changes that occur at the cellular level
[01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:12.040]   that lead to a balance or a homeostatic regulation
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:15.140]   of that circuit so that it's no longer overactive.
[01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:18.060]   Conversely, if a neural circuit is underactive
[01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:19.240]   for a period of time,
[01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:22.160]   certain changes happen within the cells of that circuit
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:23.620]   to ramp up their activity
[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:26.140]   or make them more likely to be active.
[01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:27.880]   And whether or not a neural circuit
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:30.940]   and the neurons within it become more active
[01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:34.120]   or less active in the context of homeostatic plasticity
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:36.200]   largely depends on one mechanism,
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:37.580]   and it's a beautiful mechanism
[01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:38.980]   that I'll make very clear to you right now,
[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:41.300]   even if you don't have a background in biology.
[01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:43.000]   Neurons communicate with one another
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.760]   by releasing so-called neurotransmitters,
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:45.760]   which are just chemicals.
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:48.280]   Those neurotransmitters are vomited out.
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:49.120]   They're not actually vomited,
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:51.480]   but they're spit out into the so-called synaptic cleft,
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:52.500]   often called the synapse.
[01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:54.960]   The synapse is just a little gap between neurons.
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:58.360]   And when they are released into the synapse,
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:24:59.280]   they don't just stay there.
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:01.840]   They actually park or bind to receptors
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:03.840]   on what's called the postsynaptic neuron.
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:07.120]   And depending on how many receptors they bind to
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:09.200]   and how many receptors are available, et cetera,
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:10.820]   they can have a greater or lesser effect
[01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:12.320]   on the postsynaptic neuron.
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:14.240]   This scenario of neurotransmitters
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:16.040]   being released into synapses,
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:18.720]   then binding to receptors on postsynaptic neurons
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:21.100]   and influencing the electrical excitability
[01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:22.540]   of those postsynaptic neurons,
[01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:25.680]   sits central to not just the treatment of bipolar disorder,
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:28.760]   but to all treatments of all psychiatric conditions,
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:31.520]   and indeed to things like neuropathic pain as well.
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:35.000]   For example, the so-called SSRIs,
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.920]   Prozac, Zoloft, and others, et cetera,
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:41.280]   stands for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:42.120]   What does that mean?
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:44.000]   Well, serotonin is a neurotransmitter.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.040]   It's actually a neuromodulator
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.560]   that's released into the synapse.
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:48.720]   And then the SSRI,
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:51.380]   the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor,
[01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:53.640]   allows more of that serotonin
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:55.780]   to sit within the synapse for longer, right?
[01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:57.360]   It's a reuptake inhibitor.
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:00.040]   It prevents reuptake by the presynaptic neuron.
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:02.780]   And that serotonin therefore can park in
[01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:05.480]   or dock in the receptors, as it's called,
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:08.080]   of the postsynaptic neuron in greater numbers
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:11.960]   and have a greater impact on that postsynaptic neuron.
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:14.360]   So the drugs that are used to treat depression
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:18.000]   or other things of that sort, things like SSRIs,
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.400]   work by changing the availability
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:22.120]   of neurotransmitter in the synapse.
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:24.360]   Other things like MAO inhibitors,
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:27.480]   monoamine oxase inhibitors, work a different way.
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:28.660]   They inhibit the enzyme.
[01:26:28.660 --> 01:26:30.480]   Anytime you hear ASE in biology,
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:33.880]   it's very likely an enzyme which breaks things down.
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:38.000]   So MAO inhibitors prevent the breakdown,
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.900]   not the reuptake, but the breakdown of neurotransmitter,
[01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:44.320]   and therefore allow more neurotransmitter to be available
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:47.500]   in the synapse and influence the postsynaptic cell.
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:52.280]   Homeostatic plasticity is a form of neuroplasticity
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:55.760]   in which overall circuits can become much more excitable
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:27:00.020]   or much less excitable by the addition of more receptors
[01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:01.500]   in the postsynaptic neuron,
[01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:03.500]   or by the removal of more receptors
[01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:04.680]   from the postsynaptic neuron.
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:06.660]   And the way this happens is just beautiful.
[01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:09.260]   It was first discovered in the visual system,
[01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:11.420]   and the person primarily responsible
[01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:13.300]   for the discovery of homeostatic plasticity,
[01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:14.460]   although there are several,
[01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:16.200]   is a woman by the name of Gina Turgiano.
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:18.700]   She's a professor at Brandeis University.
[01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:21.980]   And what the Turgiano laboratory showed was that,
[01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:25.980]   for instance, if we are in the dark for a long period
[01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:27.720]   of time, literally, and we're not seeing much
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:28.840]   for a long period of time,
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:31.020]   there's an increase in the number of receptors
[01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:32.400]   in the postsynaptic neurons,
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:35.520]   so that a smaller amount of light and excitability
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:38.780]   within the visual system can lead to greater amounts
[01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:40.480]   of activity in the visual system.
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:42.840]   Conversely, if there's an overactivity
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:45.000]   or an increase in activity in the visual system
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.640]   for some period of time,
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:49.900]   then a number of receptors in the postsynaptic neuron
[01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:52.940]   are removed from that postsynaptic neuron surface,
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:55.760]   making any neurotransmitter that's available
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:58.120]   only able to bind the receptors that are left
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:00.540]   and have less of an influence on those cells.
[01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:02.360]   In other words, keeping a circuit
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:04.720]   in so-called homeostatic balance
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:07.780]   in a particular range of excitability.
[01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:10.160]   Now, while that's a mouthful and an earful
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:13.040]   and a conceptful, I don't know if a conceptful is a word,
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:15.160]   but in any case, that's a lot to think about,
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:17.360]   but all you need to know is that if a neural circuit
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:19.040]   is very active for a period of time,
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:22.240]   in normal individuals, there will be a reduction
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:25.520]   in the amount of activity by way of removing receptors
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:26.540]   that bind neurotransmitter,
[01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:29.280]   whereas if a neural circuit is very quiet,
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:30.800]   it's not activated for a period of time,
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:33.040]   maybe your leg is in a cast, for instance,
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:35.900]   and you're not activating your quadricep and calves
[01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:38.540]   very much, well, when that cast comes off,
[01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:40.120]   sure, the muscle might be atrophied,
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:41.980]   but the nerves that connect to that muscle
[01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:44.480]   are actually in a position to influence that muscle
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:48.800]   even more once you start using that muscle or those muscles,
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:51.220]   because whatever neurotransmitter is released
[01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:54.800]   now has the opportunity to bind to more receptors,
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:57.920]   in that case, in muscle or in the case of brain circuits
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:59.240]   in postsynaptic neurons.
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:01.960]   So homeostatic plasticity is this beautiful
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:04.380]   balancing mechanism that makes sure that neural circuits
[01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:08.240]   are never too active nor too quiet for too long.
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:13.240]   And in a beautiful display of how treatments
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:15.860]   can lead to a better understanding of biology,
[01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:19.240]   which can lead to the discovery of even better treatments,
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:22.400]   lithium and another compound,
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:24.680]   which we'll talk about ketamine,
[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:28.820]   seem to exert their actions largely through effects
[01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:31.440]   on homeostatic neuroplasticity.
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:33.180]   There's a wonderful paper that describes
[01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:34.840]   all the nitty gritty of this.
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:37.200]   Certainly most people listening, I'm guessing,
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:40.540]   are not going to be interested in all this detail,
[01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:41.720]   but for those of you that you are
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:43.600]   and you want to delve deep into this,
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:46.080]   this paper was published in Neuron Cell Press Journal,
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.680]   excellent journal.
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:50.040]   It's titled Targeting Homeostatic Plasticity
[01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:51.700]   for the Treatment of Mood Disorders.
[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:53.460]   And there's one particular figure in this paper
[01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:54.900]   that I'll just describe to you
[01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:58.500]   in which measurements were made from neurons
[01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:00.540]   and the number of receptors in those neurons.
[01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:02.340]   It's done somewhat indirectly through a method
[01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:05.020]   that's detailed and neuroscientists are familiar with.
[01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:08.720]   Basically what it measures is how excited a given neuron is,
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:10.580]   electrically excited a given neuron is
[01:30:10.580 --> 01:30:13.400]   to a given amount of neurotransmitter, okay?
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:15.420]   So that the amount of neurotransmitter
[01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:18.600]   that's vomited onto a neuron is essentially kept constant.
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:21.000]   And then the response of the postsynaptic neuron
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:21.840]   is measured.
[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:24.400]   So it can be of one level or higher or lower
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:27.380]   depending on homeostatic plasticity.
[01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:30.120]   And what this paper shows
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:31.960]   and what's been shown over and over again
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:36.660]   is that when neurons are exposed to lithium
[01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:37.700]   for a period of time,
[01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:41.680]   there is a reduction in the excitability
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:42.820]   of the postsynaptic neuron.
[01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:46.900]   That is, neurons within the brain become less excitable
[01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:50.060]   over time if lithium is present,
[01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:53.840]   whereas ketamine, which is now a common FDA approved,
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:54.680]   at least in the US,
[01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:57.480]   it's approved for the treatment of major depression,
[01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:59.240]   ketamine does the opposite.
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:01.680]   Ketamine seems to increase the number of receptors
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:02.820]   in the postsynaptic neuron
[01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:06.120]   and lead to greater levels of excitability
[01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:08.360]   and electrical activity within neural circuits
[01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:11.360]   to a given fixed amount of neurotransmitter.
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:12.640]   So this is super interesting
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:14.140]   'cause what it means is that lithium
[01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:16.560]   is causing circuits to be less active.
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:19.140]   Ketamine is causing circuits to be more active.
[01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:22.160]   And we know from excellent clinical data now
[01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:25.400]   that ketamine seems to be a very effective treatment
[01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:27.280]   for major depression
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:30.300]   and for the major depressive episodes
[01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:33.100]   of people that suffer from bipolar depression
[01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:35.040]   that includes these major depressive episodes
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:37.500]   of two weeks or longer of suppressed mood,
[01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:39.860]   appetite, sleep issues, et cetera.
[01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:42.080]   Now, the key thing about ketamine
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:44.000]   that's often not discussed
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.440]   is that while its effects are very potent,
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:48.840]   they are transient.
[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:52.820]   So one major drawback to ketamine therapy for depression
[01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:54.560]   is that it has to be done repeatedly.
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:57.440]   And how repeatedly or how often rather
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:59.200]   depends of course on a discussion
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:00.920]   between the psychiatrist and the patient.
[01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:04.520]   This is not something to cowboy on your own.
[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:07.040]   I know that, and many of you are probably familiar
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:11.200]   with the fact that ketamine also is abused recreationally.
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:13.000]   It is a so-called NMDA,
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.040]   N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist.
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:17.620]   So it blocks the very receptor
[01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:19.680]   that's responsible for neuroplasticity
[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:21.680]   for changes in neural circuits.
[01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:24.160]   It also changes excitability in neurons as I just described.
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:26.300]   So ketamine is a very potent chemical
[01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:28.800]   that has been shown over and over again
[01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:30.560]   and is now FDA approved for the treatment
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:31.400]   of major depression,
[01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:33.640]   but its effects seem to be transient.
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:35.560]   Lithium, as I described earlier,
[01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:39.560]   seems to reduce the manic episodes
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:41.760]   or the intensity of manic episodes and symptomology
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:43.280]   in people with bipolar disorder.
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:45.160]   It's doing that through neural protection.
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:47.340]   So protecting neural circuits from dying away
[01:32:47.340 --> 01:32:48.980]   that initially are overactive
[01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:50.920]   and that overactivity causing excitotoxicity.
[01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:54.460]   It blocks that excitotoxicity, we believe.
[01:32:54.460 --> 01:32:58.200]   And it seems to do that in part
[01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:01.460]   by diminishing the amount of activity in those circuits.
[01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:04.040]   So this is a beautiful mechanistic story.
[01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:06.360]   And it's the sort of story that you'd love to have
[01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:08.840]   for a great number of psychiatric illnesses.
[01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:10.960]   And fortunately, we have for bipolar disorder.
[01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:12.400]   Overactivity of a given circuit
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:16.440]   eventually leads to neurotoxicity, excuse me.
[01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:18.280]   Lithium is preventing that neurotoxicity
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:20.280]   by reducing the number of receptors
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:22.360]   in certain elements within those circuits,
[01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:24.360]   so-called homeostatic scaling.
[01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:26.840]   It's down-regulating the number of receptors,
[01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:28.240]   leading to less excitability
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:31.000]   and preventing, we think, excitotoxicity.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.200]   And in that sense,
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:35.520]   you can see exactly why it's important
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:37.280]   to get lithium treatment in there early
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:38.960]   for people with bipolar disorder.
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:41.580]   Ketamine as a treatment for major depression
[01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:43.640]   seems to be effective, but transient.
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:45.740]   And you can also see why it would be important
[01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:48.580]   not just to reduce the manic episodes
[01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:49.820]   for people with bipolar disorder,
[01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:52.180]   but to also treat the depressive episodes.
[01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:53.840]   So this is a key feature of the treatment
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:56.880]   for bipolar depression and for bipolar disorder.
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:59.080]   There needs to be treatment both of the mania
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:01.680]   and of the depressive episodes if they're present.
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:04.540]   And fortunately, there are excellent drugs to do that.
[01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:07.420]   And I should mention that ketamine and lithium
[01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:10.380]   are just two of the drugs within the kit
[01:34:10.380 --> 01:34:12.400]   that psychiatrists have access to.
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:14.820]   There are many things, olanzapine
[01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:18.260]   and a number of different things, including clozapine.
[01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:20.300]   Clozapine is an antipsychotic,
[01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:24.700]   which is commonly prescribed as a sedative in some cases
[01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:26.820]   that allows people in manic episodes to sleep.
[01:34:26.820 --> 01:34:28.420]   It's classically described
[01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:31.220]   as so-called dopamine receptor four antagonist,
[01:34:31.220 --> 01:34:32.900]   although it does other things as well.
[01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:35.780]   Clozapine has a number of side effect features
[01:34:35.780 --> 01:34:39.020]   related to white blood cell and things of that sort
[01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:40.620]   that require careful monitoring.
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:44.180]   So there are an enormous number now,
[01:34:44.180 --> 01:34:46.700]   literally dozens and dozens of different drugs,
[01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:49.860]   each designed to target either the manic phase,
[01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:53.700]   the depressive phase, or some, what we call acute,
[01:34:53.700 --> 01:34:56.260]   sort of early phases versus ongoing treatments.
[01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:59.420]   This is a vast galaxy of drug treatments
[01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:02.020]   that really should be navigated, I should say,
[01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:03.780]   absolutely should be navigated
[01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:06.300]   by a board certified psychiatrist.
[01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:08.700]   And of course, in close discussion
[01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:11.800]   with both the person suffering from bipolar disorder,
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:14.340]   but also ideally the family members
[01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:16.800]   of the person suffering from bipolar disorder.
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:19.940]   But I think at least up until now,
[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:23.940]   we've focused on the two major pathways for treatment,
[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:25.740]   lithium and ketamine.
[01:35:25.740 --> 01:35:28.380]   And we talked about why lithium and ketamine work,
[01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:29.700]   that they're working on opposite ends
[01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:30.900]   of this homeostatic scaling.
[01:35:30.900 --> 01:35:33.540]   We talked a bit about the circuits that are involved
[01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:37.080]   in generating what we think are the manic symptomology
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:38.340]   and the lack of interoception,
[01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:40.440]   why people can just persist in staying awake,
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:43.040]   awake, awake, not eating, et cetera.
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:45.940]   Now you have in mind how all that is put together.
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:47.420]   And I think you have in mind
[01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:49.920]   some of the well-demonstrated treatments
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:52.620]   for the different component parts of bipolar disorder,
[01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:54.700]   which now I'm hoping you're also well-versed in
[01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:57.140]   based on our early, early discussion
[01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:00.020]   of what constitutes bipolar I and bipolar II.
[01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:02.220]   Now I would like to also talk about
[01:36:02.220 --> 01:36:04.900]   some of the not so typical therapeutics
[01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:06.460]   for bipolar disorder,
[01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:10.260]   and also point to the things that have been tried and failed
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:12.760]   for successful treatment of bipolar disorder,
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:16.620]   because some of those things are often talked about
[01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:19.220]   and suggested, especially in online communities.
[01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:21.220]   And while it's not clear that any of them
[01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:24.300]   are particularly hazardous on their own,
[01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:26.960]   although some of them do carry some hazards,
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:28.140]   I do think it's important
[01:36:28.140 --> 01:36:30.900]   because of the critical time-sensitive nature
[01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:32.940]   of bipolar disorder and the urgency
[01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:34.780]   of getting treatments early
[01:36:34.780 --> 01:36:36.940]   to try and prevent some of the longer lasting
[01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:38.200]   neural circuit changes,
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:40.660]   that if people can avoid some of the less effective
[01:36:40.660 --> 01:36:43.860]   or demonstrated to be ineffective treatments,
[01:36:43.860 --> 01:36:46.420]   that they stand to combat bipolar disorder
[01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:47.580]   much more successfully.
[01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:50.040]   First of all, a key point about drug therapies
[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:53.240]   versus non-drug therapies or talk therapies.
[01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:55.480]   Without question,
[01:36:56.380 --> 01:36:59.160]   drug therapies are going to be most effective
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:02.020]   when done also with talk therapies.
[01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:03.380]   And we'll talk about which talk therapies
[01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:06.180]   have been demonstrated to be most effective.
[01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:08.540]   There is some argument about what I'm about to say next,
[01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:11.980]   but in general, most psychiatrists will tell you,
[01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:14.900]   or certainly the ones I've spoken to have told me,
[01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:17.460]   that talk therapy on its own
[01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:22.380]   is rarely, if ever, effective for bipolar depression
[01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:25.660]   and bipolar disorder, whether or not it's BP-1 or BP-2.
[01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:27.340]   That's just the reality of it.
[01:37:27.340 --> 01:37:29.080]   Contrast that with our discussion
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:30.780]   about obsessive compulsive disorder,
[01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:32.700]   which we talked about a few episodes ago.
[01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:33.940]   If you haven't seen that episode,
[01:37:33.940 --> 01:37:36.600]   we have an in-depth episode all about OCD
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:39.460]   and obsessive compulsive personality disorder.
[01:37:39.460 --> 01:37:42.620]   There, it seems that drug therapies and talk therapies
[01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:45.700]   can be done independently or in combination.
[01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:49.140]   As expected, combined drug and talk therapies
[01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:51.300]   are more effective there than either one alone,
[01:37:51.300 --> 01:37:54.480]   but there are pretty impressive effects of talk therapy alone
[01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:56.320]   provided that they are initiated at the right time
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:58.540]   and it's the right form of talk therapy.
[01:37:58.540 --> 01:38:01.340]   That's OCD, but in terms of bipolar disorder,
[01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:04.860]   it really seems that the drug therapies are necessary,
[01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:07.920]   at least in most all cases.
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:12.580]   That said, talk therapies are terrific augment or support
[01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:14.740]   for those drug therapies and sometimes can allow people
[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:16.680]   to take lower doses of those drug therapies,
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:17.860]   which turns out to be important
[01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:19.260]   because of the side effect profiles
[01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:22.040]   of a lot of drug therapies and sometimes the cost as well.
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:22.980]   I guess we can think of cost
[01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:24.780]   just as another side effect, really.
[01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:28.780]   There are both established and more novel forms
[01:38:28.780 --> 01:38:31.520]   of talk therapy being used, again,
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:34.220]   in concert with drug treatments for bipolar disorder.
[01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:38.740]   Cognitive behavioral therapy is the one that seems to be best
[01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:41.660]   at least by way of the statistics and papers that exist.
[01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:43.340]   It's also the one that's been explored the most.
[01:38:43.340 --> 01:38:45.460]   So one of the reasons why it's often considered
[01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:46.680]   the most popular or effective
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:48.120]   is 'cause it's also been around longer
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:49.100]   and it's been explored the most.
[01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:53.460]   Cognitive behavioral therapy in general is a progressive
[01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:56.400]   exposure of the patient in a very controlled way
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:59.140]   in a clinical setting to some of the triggers
[01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:02.780]   or the conditions that would exacerbate bipolar disorder.
[01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:05.420]   Now, earlier I said borderline personality disorder
[01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:07.900]   has all these triggers and triggered elements
[01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:08.940]   from the external environment,
[01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:10.900]   whereas bipolar disorder does not.
[01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:15.140]   And that's still true, but it is the case
[01:39:15.140 --> 01:39:18.680]   that somebody with bipolar can have worse symptoms
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:20.520]   if life conditions get worse or more stressful.
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:24.100]   So cognitive behavioral therapy in the discussion about,
[01:39:24.100 --> 01:39:25.820]   and sometimes the direct exposure
[01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:29.360]   to anxiety-provoking elements of life
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:33.700]   can be very helpful for adjusting the responses
[01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:35.400]   to those otherwise triggering events
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:37.460]   and sometimes making the drug treatments more effective
[01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:38.600]   even at lower doses.
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:40.480]   There are also forms of therapy
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:42.800]   including family-focused therapy,
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:46.520]   which is especially important in terms of bipolar disorder
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:49.740]   because family members,
[01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:52.280]   provided that they are not themselves in a manic episode
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:55.820]   due to the close heritability of bipolar disorder,
[01:39:55.820 --> 01:39:59.640]   but family members can often be excellent windows
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:02.760]   into whether or not somebody is doing well or poorly
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:04.860]   or is veering toward or is emerging
[01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:06.940]   from a manic or depressive episode
[01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:08.180]   because they understand that person.
[01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:09.740]   They have a lot of data.
[01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:11.180]   It could be purely subjective data,
[01:40:11.180 --> 01:40:13.240]   but they have a lot of exposure to how long or well
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:15.380]   somebody has been sleeping or eating, et cetera.
[01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:17.380]   So family-focused therapy involves other members
[01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:19.340]   of the person suffering from bipolar disorders,
[01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:24.080]   family, as well as conversations about family members
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:26.980]   in a way that helps patients with bipolar disorder
[01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:28.860]   navigate not just through manic episodes
[01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:29.800]   and depressive episodes,
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:32.900]   but start to learn to predict what are the conditions,
[01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:35.060]   psychological, physical, and otherwise,
[01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:38.100]   that can trigger bipolar episodes.
[01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:41.040]   And then there's a category of therapy
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:44.080]   called interpersonal and social rhythm therapy.
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:48.120]   This is deserving of its own entire episode, really.
[01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:49.980]   Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy
[01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:53.020]   is sort of an expansion on family-focused therapy,
[01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:55.340]   although it's distinct in certain ways as well,
[01:40:55.340 --> 01:40:59.220]   and really focuses on how people are relating to others
[01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:01.420]   in their life and in the workplace
[01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:03.000]   and in the school environment
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.980]   and also within the family, et cetera.
[01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:08.740]   And I should say that a overall theme that's emerging
[01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:12.260]   in psychiatry and psychology is to start wherever possible
[01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:15.500]   to incorporate more of the social aspects
[01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:17.060]   and the interpersonal aspects.
[01:41:17.060 --> 01:41:19.900]   In other words, not just talking to and examining a patient
[01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:22.560]   as one biological system, one nervous system,
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:24.560]   one set of chemicals, and one life,
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:27.040]   but rather a set of chemicals, neural circuits,
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:28.940]   and a life that's embedded in the chemicals
[01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:31.740]   and neural circuits and lives of other people.
[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:33.580]   Just by way of example, you can imagine that
[01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:35.940]   if somebody is in a very healthy relationship
[01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:37.820]   or a very abusive relationship,
[01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:39.900]   that that's going to strongly impact
[01:41:39.900 --> 01:41:41.720]   the outcomes of manic episodes.
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:44.380]   You can imagine that if the financial situation
[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:47.580]   is one in which people can recover from manic episodes,
[01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:50.360]   I did mention this earlier, but I should have, forgive me,
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:52.460]   that oftentimes people who are in a manic episode
[01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:54.780]   will go out and spend immense amounts of money
[01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:56.900]   that they simply cannot afford to lose.
[01:41:56.900 --> 01:42:00.860]   And then the depressive episodes that in many cases follow
[01:42:00.860 --> 01:42:05.100]   are made far worse by the financial anxiety
[01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:07.260]   and the financial stress that results
[01:42:07.260 --> 01:42:09.500]   from those manic episodes of spending, et cetera.
[01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:13.280]   And then of course, this carries over to sexual promiscuity
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:15.840]   where people might be dealing with unwanted pregnancy
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:20.760]   or STIs or very fractured interpersonal dynamics
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:22.360]   with existing or new relationships.
[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:25.960]   I mean, you can imagine how these manic episodes
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:28.600]   as well as the depressive episodes can really wick out
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:31.100]   into an enormous amount of destruction,
[01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:35.360]   which brings us back to the initial criteria of BP1 and BP2
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:39.160]   is that these manic episodes are not a good thing.
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:41.520]   These depressive episodes are not a good thing.
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:44.640]   They create this sense of euphoria
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:46.380]   in the person experiencing mania,
[01:42:46.380 --> 01:42:48.860]   or they create the sense that anything is possible,
[01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:52.400]   but at the end of the day, and actually every day,
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:54.720]   these episodes are quite maladaptive.
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:56.440]   They really destroy people's lives,
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:58.020]   and it's not just the life of the person
[01:42:58.020 --> 01:42:59.460]   that's suffering from bipolar disorder.
[01:42:59.460 --> 01:43:01.720]   And so hence, cognitive behavioral therapy,
[01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:02.940]   family-focused therapy,
[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:04.840]   and interpersonal and social rhythm therapies
[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:07.000]   are the primary three talk therapies
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.520]   that are most often combined with drug therapies
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:12.860]   in order to try and really reduce the harm.
[01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:15.780]   It's really all about harm reduction
[01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:18.280]   from manic episodes and depressive episodes.
[01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:20.220]   One very exciting and emerging treatment
[01:43:20.220 --> 01:43:22.440]   that does show great promise,
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:26.220]   and in some cases, great outcomes for bipolar disorder
[01:43:26.220 --> 01:43:29.180]   is, believe it or not, electric shock therapy.
[01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:31.280]   Electric shock therapy may sound barbaric,
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:33.280]   and in fact, it tends to look barbaric,
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:34.900]   although this is done in the controlled setting
[01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:35.760]   of a hospital.
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:38.680]   If any of you have seen "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:41.640]   the final scene or near final scene in that movie
[01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:45.360]   was Jack Nicholson with the sort of bite protector
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:47.560]   in his mouth and getting electric shock therapy,
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:50.620]   and it's, as the name suggests,
[01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:53.280]   it's kind of inducing a global seizure,
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:57.080]   either low-level or grand mal-type seizure
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:59.760]   in the patient's brain and nervous system.
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:02.600]   You might ask, well, why would one want to do that?
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:06.040]   Well, it turns out that this is a well-established
[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:08.400]   and in many cases, very effective treatment
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:09.640]   for major depression.
[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:12.440]   Electric shock therapy is generally used
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:14.320]   for treatment-resistant depression,
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:17.640]   so these are people that have no positive response
[01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:19.820]   or ongoing positive response to drug therapies
[01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:20.860]   or other therapies.
[01:44:20.860 --> 01:44:23.920]   Electric shock therapy is thought to work primarily
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:27.720]   by stimulating the massive kind of indiscriminate release
[01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:31.280]   of things like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine,
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:33.840]   a huge variety of neuromodulators,
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:35.560]   as well as things like BDNF,
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:36.800]   brain-derived neurotrophic factor,
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:39.280]   which then allows neuroplasticity to take place.
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:42.320]   Again, BDNF being permissive for neuroplasticity.
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:45.160]   The problem with ECT is that it's really only useful
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:47.160]   for treatment-resistant depression.
[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:49.460]   It doesn't actually target the manic aspects
[01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:52.360]   of bipolar depression and bipolar disorder,
[01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:56.000]   but nonetheless is used when drug treatments don't work.
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.740]   Some of the negatives of electric shock therapy
[01:44:59.740 --> 01:45:03.680]   or electroconvulsive therapy, ECT is the proper acronym
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:06.680]   and way it's described, is that it's quite invasive, right?
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:09.120]   This is something that you need to go to the hospital for
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:11.560]   and oftentimes there's some inpatient care required
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:14.100]   after the electric shock convulsive therapy.
[01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:15.420]   It's a fairly high cost,
[01:45:15.420 --> 01:45:17.820]   especially for those that don't have insurance.
[01:45:17.820 --> 01:45:20.160]   And of course it requires anesthesia.
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:21.640]   For most people, that's not going to be a problem,
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:24.720]   but for many people that could be a problem.
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:28.380]   And there's often some associated memory loss.
[01:45:28.380 --> 01:45:33.360]   And so the memory loss, the invasive nature of ECT
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:37.640]   and the cost oftentimes rule out ECT for most patients.
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:39.200]   And that's why it's sort of a late stage
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:41.080]   or kind of last resort type thing
[01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:42.740]   for treatment-resistant depression.
[01:45:42.740 --> 01:45:45.600]   Nowadays, ketamine type therapy is done repeatedly
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:47.560]   or other treatments, for instance,
[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:50.120]   transcranial magnetic stimulation,
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:52.120]   which is basically noninvasive.
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:55.160]   It's a coil that's placed on the outside of the skull,
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:59.760]   excuse me, and we can more accurately refer to it
[01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:02.300]   as repetitive or RTMS,
[01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:04.900]   repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.
[01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:07.660]   Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a tool
[01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:09.700]   that allows researchers and clinicians
[01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:12.500]   to reduce the amount of activity in specific neural circuits
[01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:15.140]   so they can actually target the magnetic field
[01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:16.180]   to particular neural circuits
[01:46:16.180 --> 01:46:18.340]   to reduce activity in those neural circuits.
[01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:20.020]   Again, it's minimally invasive.
[01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:21.680]   It has been shown to be effective
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:25.480]   in both increasing neuroplasticity in positive ways,
[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:27.560]   as well as reducing depressive episodes,
[01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:31.960]   and in a few instances in reducing the amplitude
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:33.620]   or the intensity of manic episodes
[01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:35.760]   in people with bipolar disorder.
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:39.060]   The problem is it's still a very early technique.
[01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:41.080]   There aren't a lot of clinics and labs doing it.
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:42.920]   I'm starting to see more advertisements,
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:45.200]   literally commercial clinics
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:48.120]   that are advertising RTMS or TMS.
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:50.600]   I encourage you to approach those clinics with caution.
[01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:53.380]   I'm of the mind that if those clinics
[01:46:53.380 --> 01:46:57.000]   are not either closely or maybe even distantly associated
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:58.200]   with a research institution
[01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:00.580]   that's really up on the latest of RTMS,
[01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:03.400]   you'd be wise to at least do your research, right,
[01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:05.900]   and explore, talk to other patients
[01:47:05.900 --> 01:47:07.360]   who've done these treatments.
[01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:09.520]   But certainly in university hospitals
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:11.640]   and in clinical settings and research settings,
[01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:15.180]   RTMS is being used as a way to, for instance,
[01:47:15.180 --> 01:47:17.760]   reduce the activity of certain limbic circuitries
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:20.460]   so that people are just overall less excitable and manic,
[01:47:20.460 --> 01:47:22.460]   or to activate,
[01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:24.280]   because it can also be used for activation now,
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:25.120]   certain neural circuits,
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:27.180]   activate, for instance, the parietal inputs,
[01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:29.180]   the top-down control over the limbic system.
[01:47:29.180 --> 01:47:30.960]   This is all happening right now.
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:34.940]   So we have ECT, repetitive TMS, or RTMS,
[01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:36.980]   and then as I mentioned earlier, ketamine therapies,
[01:47:36.980 --> 01:47:38.260]   most of those are targeted
[01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:41.400]   toward the depressive aspects of manic depression.
[01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:42.920]   So for people with bipolar disorder
[01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:44.300]   that doesn't include depression,
[01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:45.940]   those are going to be less effective.
[01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:48.500]   But overall, it's going to be the talk therapies
[01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:51.900]   of the sort that we discussed earlier or a moment ago,
[01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:54.560]   plus drug treatments,
[01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:56.280]   almost always lithium will be explored,
[01:47:56.280 --> 01:47:58.940]   plus some treatments for the depressive episodes,
[01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:01.900]   in particular, if those depressive episodes are present.
[01:48:01.900 --> 01:48:04.940]   Nowadays, there's a lot of excitement about psilocybin,
[01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:06.380]   which is a psychedelic.
[01:48:06.380 --> 01:48:09.160]   In the US, psilocybin is still illegal.
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:10.740]   It is not legal,
[01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:14.120]   meaning you can get in a lot of trouble for possessing it,
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:15.860]   certainly for selling it, et cetera.
[01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:18.560]   But psilocybin is being explored as a clinical therapy
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:20.020]   in certain laboratory settings,
[01:48:20.020 --> 01:48:22.660]   in particular, at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
[01:48:22.660 --> 01:48:24.220]   It's being explored in human patients
[01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:25.740]   for the treatment of major depression,
[01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:28.460]   for OCD, I believe, as well,
[01:48:28.460 --> 01:48:31.200]   but certainly for major depression and for eating disorders.
[01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:34.300]   And it seems from the initial wave of publications
[01:48:34.300 --> 01:48:37.860]   from that work done by the incredible Matthew Johnson
[01:48:37.860 --> 01:48:38.980]   or Dr. Matthew Johnson,
[01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:40.620]   who was a guest on this podcast before.
[01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:43.340]   He's also been on the Tim Ferriss podcast.
[01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:45.540]   He's been on the Lex Friedman podcast.
[01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:48.060]   Dr. Matthew Johnson came on this podcast,
[01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:49.720]   has talked about some of the work with psilocybin
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:51.620]   for the treatment of depression.
[01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:54.100]   Very impressive results there.
[01:48:54.100 --> 01:48:55.300]   And as you can imagine,
[01:48:55.300 --> 01:48:57.660]   very impressive results for the major depressive episodes
[01:48:57.660 --> 01:48:58.500]   for bipolar.
[01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:02.580]   However, at least to my knowledge, again, to my knowledge,
[01:49:02.580 --> 01:49:04.940]   there have not been any controlled clinical trials
[01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:07.300]   exploring psilocybin for the mania
[01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:08.980]   associated with bipolar disorder.
[01:49:08.980 --> 01:49:11.320]   If someone out there is aware of those clinical trials,
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:12.160]   please let me know.
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:13.940]   I'll do an update in a future podcast.
[01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:16.900]   But right now, no knowledge from me
[01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:18.620]   about psilocybin clinical trials
[01:49:18.620 --> 01:49:22.340]   for the manic component of bipolar disorder.
[01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:24.780]   A number of people are probably also going to wonder about
[01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:28.360]   whether or not cannabis or medical marijuana
[01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:31.020]   is useful for bipolar disorder.
[01:49:31.020 --> 01:49:34.220]   To address this, I looked to some previous lectures
[01:49:34.220 --> 01:49:37.620]   and some clinicians at Stanford Psychiatry.
[01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:38.980]   This question was asked of them.
[01:49:38.980 --> 01:49:40.960]   And as it turns out,
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:43.400]   cannabis does not seem to be effective
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:46.980]   for the treatment of the manic phases of bipolar disorder
[01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:50.340]   or for the treatment of the major depressive component.
[01:49:50.340 --> 01:49:52.740]   The only treatment perhaps,
[01:49:52.740 --> 01:49:55.160]   or I should say the only situation perhaps
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:56.100]   in which it might be useful,
[01:49:56.100 --> 01:49:57.720]   and this is what was relayed to me,
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:00.600]   is that it may help with sleep in certain people
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:03.460]   that are having trouble with insomnia.
[01:50:03.460 --> 01:50:05.500]   Though nowadays it's far more common
[01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:08.000]   for people in manic episodes to be prescribed things
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:11.760]   like trazodone or other benzos, benzo diazepines,
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:14.300]   in order to try and get sleep within the manic episodes.
[01:50:14.300 --> 01:50:16.980]   And benzo diazepines and trazodone, et cetera,
[01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:19.240]   work largely through the so-called GABA system.
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:21.240]   This is a neurotransmitter
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:25.140]   that causes reductions in excitability of neurons,
[01:50:25.140 --> 01:50:27.780]   hence why it's being used to try and calm people down
[01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:29.880]   and allow them to sleep during their manic episodes.
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:32.020]   So not a lot, or essentially no data,
[01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:33.280]   supporting the use of cannabis
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:35.780]   for the treatment of bipolar disorder per se,
[01:50:35.780 --> 01:50:38.480]   nor data supporting the use of psilocybin
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:40.460]   for the treatment of bipolar disorder per se.
[01:50:40.460 --> 01:50:43.040]   But I realized as I say that,
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:44.420]   that there are going to be a number of people
[01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:48.360]   that may have had positive or negative experiences
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:49.560]   with cannabis or psilocybin
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:51.000]   as they relate to bipolar disorder.
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.840]   So please, if you're willing or comfortable,
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:54.960]   put that if you're comfortable
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:57.520]   into the comment section on YouTube.
[01:50:57.520 --> 01:50:59.640]   And of course, if you are aware of any studies
[01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:03.060]   on cannabis or psilocybin showing positive outcomes
[01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:04.920]   for the treatment of bipolar disorder,
[01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:07.420]   please provide links or PubMed ideas to those.
[01:51:07.420 --> 01:51:09.080]   I'd love to peruse those studies.
[01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:12.300]   There are two naturopathic,
[01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:15.720]   or I should say nutrition supplement-based approaches
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:18.740]   to bipolar disorder they get talked about a lot.
[01:51:18.740 --> 01:51:22.000]   And one of them shows some interesting promise
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:26.180]   or effectiveness even in a limited context.
[01:51:26.180 --> 01:51:28.280]   Before marching into this description
[01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:29.860]   of these two compounds,
[01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:32.200]   in fact, before even mentioning these two compounds,
[01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:35.460]   I do want to emphasize what's been said
[01:51:35.460 --> 01:51:37.480]   and written about over and over again,
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:41.120]   and what was relayed to me from expert psychiatrists.
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:45.720]   It is not wise to rely purely on talk therapy
[01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:48.360]   or on natural approaches
[01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:49.700]   to the treatment of bipolar disorder,
[01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:52.680]   given the intensity of the disorder
[01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:56.260]   and the high propensity for suicide risk
[01:51:56.260 --> 01:51:57.820]   in people with bipolar disorder.
[01:51:57.820 --> 01:52:00.600]   It is a chemical and neural circuit disruption,
[01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:02.240]   and it needs to be dealt with head on
[01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:05.000]   through the appropriate chemistry
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.960]   and prescription drug approaches from a board-certified
[01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:09.080]   psychiatrist.
[01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:11.320]   I don't say this to protect me.
[01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:14.760]   I say this truly to protect those who either suffer from
[01:52:14.760 --> 01:52:16.800]   or think they may suffer from bipolar disorder.
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:18.720]   If you know someone who you think might suffer
[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:19.980]   from bipolar disorder.
[01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:22.600]   Now, all that is not to say
[01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:24.960]   that there aren't useful lifestyle interventions
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:26.840]   that can support people with bipolar disorder.
[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:28.460]   So I just briefly want to mention those.
[01:52:28.460 --> 01:52:30.960]   And again, I'm lifting the statements I'm about to make
[01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:33.760]   from some excellent online lectures
[01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:36.480]   from psychiatrists at Stanford and elsewhere,
[01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:41.480]   which essentially say that of course, of course, of course,
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:45.120]   getting better sleep, getting adequate exercise,
[01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:46.640]   getting proper nutrition,
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:50.600]   having quality, healthy social interactions,
[01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:52.400]   even getting regular sunlight in the day
[01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:53.700]   and avoiding bright light at night.
[01:52:53.700 --> 01:52:57.000]   All of those things are going to braid together
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:00.640]   to support the nervous system and the psyche of somebody
[01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:02.360]   with bipolar disorder,
[01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:04.880]   but they braid together to support the psyche
[01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:06.480]   and the neurochemistry and the neural circuits
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:08.380]   of anybody and everybody.
[01:53:08.380 --> 01:53:11.240]   So they have generally a modulatory effect.
[01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:15.040]   That is they're indirectly shifting the likelihood
[01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:17.200]   that somebody might have an episode
[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:19.240]   or the intensity of an episode,
[01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:21.160]   in particular, the depressive episodes, right?
[01:53:21.160 --> 01:53:22.380]   You can imagine how someone who's heading
[01:53:22.380 --> 01:53:23.800]   into a depressive episode,
[01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:25.560]   maybe they're on a lower amount of medication
[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:27.160]   or they haven't yet medicated
[01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:29.200]   for the depressive episode of bipolar.
[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:31.400]   And now they're making sure,
[01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:32.500]   or their family is making sure
[01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:35.080]   that they're getting exercise, sunshine, eating correctly,
[01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:36.780]   social engagement, et cetera.
[01:53:36.780 --> 01:53:38.080]   Of course, it makes perfect sense
[01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:41.380]   why they would have perhaps a shallower drop into depression
[01:53:41.380 --> 01:53:43.920]   or maybe even offset a depressive episode.
[01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:48.740]   That said, most all, if not all people with bipolar disorder
[01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:52.620]   are likely to need some sort of drug therapy intervention
[01:53:52.620 --> 01:53:53.880]   in order to help them.
[01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:56.800]   So lifestyle factors are always important
[01:53:56.800 --> 01:53:58.280]   in all individuals,
[01:53:58.280 --> 01:54:01.400]   those suffering from psychiatric conditions or not.
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:05.460]   But in some conditions of the mind and body,
[01:54:05.460 --> 01:54:08.140]   those lifestyle interventions can have a greater effect
[01:54:08.140 --> 01:54:09.560]   in offsetting symptoms.
[01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:12.480]   Whereas in bipolar disorder, I think it's naive
[01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:16.320]   and in fact wrong to say that lifestyle interventions alone
[01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:18.800]   are going to prevent especially the extreme forms
[01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:20.600]   of mania and depression.
[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:23.120]   Again, bipolar disorder being so serious
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:25.420]   and carrying such high suicide risk,
[01:54:25.420 --> 01:54:27.500]   we just have to point this out again and again.
[01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:29.760]   Now, with that said, there are two substances
[01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:31.840]   generally found as supplements,
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:33.780]   although there are other sources of them as well,
[01:54:33.780 --> 01:54:37.400]   including within nutritional sources that have been shown,
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:39.760]   at least in some studies, to be pretty effective
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:43.340]   in adjusting the symptoms of bipolar disorder.
[01:54:43.340 --> 01:54:48.340]   And those two things are inositol and omega-3 fatty acids.
[01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:51.680]   Now, inositol is a compound
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:53.380]   that is taken for a variety of reasons.
[01:54:53.380 --> 01:54:55.440]   It's something we've talked about on the podcast before.
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:56.740]   I personally take inositol
[01:54:56.740 --> 01:54:58.140]   not because I have bipolar disorder.
[01:54:58.140 --> 01:55:02.120]   In fact, I am quite lucky that I don't have bipolar disorder,
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:05.240]   but I take inositol at 900 milligrams of myo-inositol
[01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:07.780]   every third night or so in order to improve my sleep.
[01:55:07.780 --> 01:55:09.640]   It's something that I've added to my sleep stack.
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:12.840]   It's something that I found greatly enhances the depth
[01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:14.480]   and quality of my sleep.
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:16.100]   And if I wake up in the middle of the night
[01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:17.360]   to use the bathroom, et cetera,
[01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:20.620]   it's greatly enhanced my ability to fall back asleep
[01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:22.000]   when I want to go back to sleep.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.880]   It also seems to have a fairly potent anti-anxiety effect
[01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:26.800]   during the day.
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:29.180]   And as I discussed in our episode
[01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:30.800]   about obsessive compulsive disorder,
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:34.040]   inositol has been used at high dosages.
[01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:35.860]   Again, I should say myo-inositol has been used
[01:55:35.860 --> 01:55:40.320]   at high dosages, levels of even 10, 18 grams.
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:42.440]   Those are massive dosages, by the way,
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:46.680]   to deal with certain symptoms of OCD to limited success.
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:48.360]   And I should mention that high dosages
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:51.680]   of 10 or 18 grams of inositol
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:54.480]   can cause a lot of gastric discomfort, et cetera.
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:57.240]   If you want to learn more about inositol
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:55:58.280]   and its various uses,
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:00.920]   I encourage you to go to examine.com
[01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:03.520]   where there's the so-called human effect matrix
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:07.120]   and that human effects matrix will describe the many places
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:10.000]   in which myo-inositol and other forms of inositol
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.400]   have been shown to be effective in, for instance,
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:15.780]   reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep, and on and on.
[01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:19.340]   Myo-inositol is important because myo-inositol,
[01:56:19.340 --> 01:56:21.440]   and we can just say inositol,
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:24.160]   is related to so-called second messenger pathways.
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:25.000]   I don't want to get too deep
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:26.240]   into a second messenger pathways,
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:29.680]   but when certain substances bind like neurotransmitters
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:31.640]   to a receptor on a cell surface,
[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:34.180]   oftentimes those receptors themselves will open
[01:56:34.180 --> 01:56:37.280]   and allow the passage of ions and other things into a cell.
[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:39.200]   Oftentimes they will engage
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:41.000]   what are called second messenger systems.
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.880]   That is, they will trigger mechanisms within the cell
[01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:45.480]   to then go do other things.
[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:47.040]   This is probably something we should get into
[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:48.720]   in real detail in a future episode
[01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:50.380]   for those of you that really want to nerd out
[01:56:50.380 --> 01:56:53.440]   on cell-cell signaling, which is a favorite topic of mine.
[01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:56.040]   In any case, inositol is related
[01:56:56.040 --> 01:56:58.380]   to a number of so-called second messenger systems,
[01:56:58.380 --> 01:57:01.400]   this handoff or this kind of stimulating
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:05.500]   of changes within a cell that can inspire changes
[01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:07.600]   in what's called a membrane fluidity,
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:10.360]   can actually make the membranes of cells,
[01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:12.840]   the outside fence around a cell,
[01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:14.600]   which is made up of fatty stuff,
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:17.520]   it can change the fluidity,
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:21.680]   meaning how readily things can float around in the membrane.
[01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:23.160]   We think of cells as very rigid,
[01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:24.760]   like there's a cell, there's a neuron,
[01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:25.980]   or there's a immune cell,
[01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:29.840]   but actually those cells have a fatty outside,
[01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:31.960]   in particular neurons have a fatty outside,
[01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:35.380]   it's a thin fatty outside and it's called the cell membrane.
[01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:37.820]   And things are floating around in that cell membrane,
[01:57:37.820 --> 01:57:40.240]   but it's kind of like jello that hasn't quite fixed.
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:43.360]   And so things like receptors moving into the synapse
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:46.360]   or moving out of the synapse for homeostatic plasticity,
[01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:50.720]   things like the ability for certain genes
[01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:52.560]   to be turned on in a cell or not turned on
[01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:54.960]   can depend a lot on things that are happening
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:57.460]   in that cell membrane and how readily things move around
[01:57:57.460 --> 01:57:58.340]   in the cell membrane.
[01:57:58.340 --> 01:57:59.920]   One way to think about this whole picture
[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:02.720]   of membrane fluidity is that just imagine
[01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:05.040]   that every one of your cells has this layer,
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:07.400]   it's kind of a gelatinous-like layer,
[01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:10.640]   and there are lots of little rafts floating around in there,
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:15.280]   but those rafts are able to move more quickly
[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:16.280]   from one place to another,
[01:58:16.280 --> 01:58:18.520]   or get more stuck in one place or another,
[01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:21.040]   depending on how set that jello is.
[01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:26.040]   Inositol and lithium, and as we'll talk about next,
[01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:29.960]   omega-3 fatty acids seem to change
[01:58:29.960 --> 01:58:32.080]   the fluidity of those membranes.
[01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:33.960]   In other words, they allow things to move
[01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:37.320]   in and out of those membranes more readily or not.
[01:58:37.320 --> 01:58:42.320]   And this is no surprise given that those membranes
[01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:44.800]   are made out of fatty stuff.
[01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:47.160]   In particular, the membranes of neurons
[01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:49.200]   are called a lipid bilayer.
[01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:54.200]   It's two layers of fat, okay, bi means two, lipid fat,
[01:58:54.200 --> 01:58:57.000]   and omega-3 fatty acids of the sort
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.240]   that are found in certain fish,
[01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:01.500]   and that fatty fish in particular,
[01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:05.200]   and that are found in fish oil and cod liver oil, et cetera.
[01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:09.080]   Omega-3 fatty acids, when we ingest them,
[01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:11.200]   are used for a lot of different things,
[01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:14.580]   but they can be readily incorporated into pathways
[01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:17.600]   or directly incorporated into cell membranes,
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:19.680]   changing the way those cell membranes work,
[01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:21.880]   and if those cell membranes are the cell membranes
[01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:24.360]   of neurons, changing the way that neurons work.
[01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:28.520]   So the ability for fish oil, and in particular,
[01:59:28.520 --> 01:59:31.200]   the omega-3 fatty acids, which come in varieties
[01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:34.120]   like EPA and DHA, we'll talk about that in a moment,
[01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:36.800]   have been explored at relatively high dosages
[01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:41.520]   for their ability to offset some of the effects of mania
[01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:44.860]   and to offset the effects of depressive episodes
[01:59:44.860 --> 01:59:46.080]   in bipolar disorder.
[01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:48.560]   And actually, the data there are pretty impressive,
[01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:52.780]   although they are varied,
[01:59:52.780 --> 01:59:55.320]   meaning you will find several studies,
[01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:57.800]   and I'll mention a few, that found no effect
[01:59:57.800 --> 02:00:00.080]   of omega-3 supplementation through fish oil.
[02:00:00.080 --> 02:00:01.540]   Usually it's capsuled fish oil,
[02:00:01.540 --> 02:00:04.760]   although fish oil can also be taken in liquid form.
[02:00:04.760 --> 02:00:06.080]   Oftentimes, taking in liquid form
[02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:07.800]   is the more cost-efficient way to do it.
[02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:10.920]   Taking in capsule form is the more palatable way to do it,
[02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:13.600]   because fish oil, for a lot of people, doesn't taste good.
[02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:17.540]   But nonetheless, there are several studies that have shown
[02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:21.560]   that supplementing with fish oil or omega-3 fatty acids
[02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:25.040]   at levels of, for instance, four grams per day
[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:25.920]   for a period of time.
[02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:27.660]   This is a study that we will link in the show notes.
[02:00:27.660 --> 02:00:29.920]   This is Murphy et al. 2012.
[02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:34.920]   This is a fatty acid supplementation of 70% EPA to DHA,
[02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:37.560]   actually worsened symptoms of mania
[02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:39.920]   over a period of about 16 weeks,
[02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:42.040]   which on the face of it makes it seem like, okay,
[02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:43.800]   omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
[02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:47.120]   very likely to not be good for bipolar disorder.
[02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:50.440]   And yet, that was the manic phase.
[02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:52.120]   When one looks at some of the other studies
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:54.700]   of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
[02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:58.080]   there is, for instance, a study published in 1999.
[02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:01.200]   This is a much higher dosage supplementation
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:02.320]   with omega-3 fatty acid.
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:06.800]   This is a 9.6 grams of fish oil per day for four months.
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:10.320]   And that actually greatly reduced symptoms
[02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:14.800]   of bipolar depression compared to the control group,
[02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:16.280]   which received olive oil.
[02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:18.080]   Olive oil is a different form of fat,
[02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:20.540]   monounsaturated fat, but doesn't contain
[02:01:20.540 --> 02:01:22.880]   as much of the omega-3 fatty acids and so forth.
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:27.440]   So 9.6 grams of fish oil per day over four months
[02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:31.580]   is a lot of fish oil to be ingesting on a given day.
[02:01:31.580 --> 02:01:33.920]   This was a double-blind study.
[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:36.760]   This was only carried out, I should mention, in 30 subjects,
[02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:38.400]   but it was males and females.
[02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:39.880]   And the age range was pretty broad,
[02:01:39.880 --> 02:01:42.520]   anywhere from 18 all the way up to 64 years of age,
[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:45.460]   which is important given the sort of longitudinal
[02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:49.040]   or changes over time that one sees in bipolar disorder.
[02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:50.840]   Here's the major takeaway.
[02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:52.840]   Supplementing with high-dose omega-3s
[02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:56.040]   does seem to be beneficial for a good number of people
[02:01:56.040 --> 02:01:57.600]   with bipolar disorder.
[02:01:57.600 --> 02:01:59.260]   However, again, I want to highlight,
[02:01:59.260 --> 02:02:01.560]   however, it should not be viewed
[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:04.560]   as the only treatment approach for bipolar disorder.
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:06.360]   This goes back to what I was saying before
[02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:09.080]   about the essential need, in most every case,
[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:12.360]   for high potency prescription drug treatments
[02:02:12.360 --> 02:02:14.120]   prescribed by a board-certified psychiatrist
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:15.000]   for bipolar disorder.
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:19.840]   However, omega-3 supplementation does seem to improve
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:22.480]   or reduce the depressive symptoms
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:24.400]   in the major depressive episodes of bipolar.
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:25.880]   And there are a couple of studies,
[02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:27.880]   and we'll link to these in the show notes as well,
[02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:29.640]   that show that it may even improve
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:31.980]   some of the manic episodes as well,
[02:02:31.980 --> 02:02:34.880]   meaning it reduces some of the manic symptoms.
[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:38.080]   Now, I say all this from a place of great caution
[02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:41.160]   because I know, especially for listeners of this podcast,
[02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:42.920]   there's a lot of interest in the behavioral tools,
[02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:44.560]   the supplement-based tools, the nutrition tools
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:46.280]   that can support bipolar disorder.
[02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:48.600]   But I don't think I can overemphasize enough
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:50.560]   that especially for bipolar disorder
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:53.080]   and the great risk of suicide and suffering
[02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:55.120]   and inappropriate spending,
[02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:57.480]   or I should say maladaptive spending and impulsivity
[02:02:57.480 --> 02:02:59.300]   that's associated with bipolar disorder,
[02:02:59.300 --> 02:03:01.360]   that it's hard to imagine a scenario
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:03.440]   in which just talk therapy and fish oil
[02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:06.840]   and lifestyle interventions are going to completely suppress
[02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:08.280]   or treat bipolar disorder.
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:10.840]   People with bipolar disorder really need to consider
[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:13.840]   the full picture of treatments, the drug treatments,
[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:18.160]   the talk therapy treatments and lifestyle treatments
[02:03:18.160 --> 02:03:22.800]   and nutraceutical, or we can say supplement-based treatments
[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:24.800]   such as omega-3 supplementation,
[02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:28.040]   as a full and necessary picture
[02:03:28.040 --> 02:03:29.880]   for dealing with their illness.
[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:32.400]   I'd be remiss, however, if I didn't emphasize
[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:35.600]   that the omega-3 fatty acid supplementation
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:36.880]   is very interesting,
[02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:40.240]   not just in terms of the subjective effects,
[02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:41.760]   people saying they feel less depressed
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:42.760]   or able to sleep better,
[02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:45.160]   or maybe even some reduction in manic symptoms.
[02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:47.080]   There's actually been some really good brain imaging
[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:50.600]   to try and understand how omega-3 fatty acid treatments
[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:53.100]   are actually changing the brains and neural circuits
[02:03:53.100 --> 02:03:54.040]   of people with bipolar.
[02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:55.320]   And I will put a reference to this.
[02:03:55.320 --> 02:03:56.840]   This is a paper that was published
[02:03:56.840 --> 02:03:58.760]   in the American Journal of Psychiatry.
[02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:00.940]   It's entitled "Omega-3 Fatty Acid Treatment
[02:04:00.940 --> 02:04:04.660]   and T2 Whole Brain Relaxation Times in Bipolar Disorder."
[02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:06.980]   I don't have the opportunity
[02:04:06.980 --> 02:04:08.700]   to go into a lot of detail right now
[02:04:08.700 --> 02:04:11.140]   about what T2 whole brain relaxation times are,
[02:04:11.140 --> 02:04:13.860]   but basically when people go into a MRI
[02:04:13.860 --> 02:04:16.340]   or F, functional MRI scanner,
[02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:21.340]   magnetic resonance imaging scanner,
[02:04:21.340 --> 02:04:23.380]   what they're getting essentially
[02:04:23.380 --> 02:04:25.800]   is pulses of magnetic fields.
[02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:27.880]   And the way that brain structures
[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:29.380]   and neural activity can be evaluated
[02:04:29.380 --> 02:04:32.420]   has a lot to do with the sort of spinning,
[02:04:32.420 --> 02:04:34.520]   or not sort of, it has to do with the spinning
[02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:38.340]   and the relaxation times of different elements,
[02:04:38.340 --> 02:04:41.740]   literally the protons and electrons within the neuron.
[02:04:41.740 --> 02:04:43.740]   So it gets really detailed there.
[02:04:43.740 --> 02:04:46.180]   And the relaxation time is essentially looking
[02:04:46.180 --> 02:04:49.940]   at how quickly some of that spinning returns to rest.
[02:04:49.940 --> 02:04:54.940]   And in particular, the fact that the relaxation times
[02:04:54.940 --> 02:04:58.420]   are different for aqueous, that is liquid,
[02:04:58.420 --> 02:05:03.060]   versus lipid, fatty, versus other components of brain tissue.
[02:05:03.060 --> 02:05:05.120]   And basically what this study shows
[02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:08.780]   is that the membranes of neurons within the brains
[02:05:08.780 --> 02:05:11.720]   of these people with bipolar disorder showed more fluidity,
[02:05:11.720 --> 02:05:14.940]   more ability of things to move in and around the membranes,
[02:05:14.940 --> 02:05:17.900]   which we know is an important component of neuroplasticity,
[02:05:17.900 --> 02:05:20.960]   in bipolar subjects that were treated
[02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:24.380]   with omega-3 fatty acids as compared to bipolar subjects
[02:05:24.380 --> 02:05:27.320]   that did not receive omega-3 fatty acids.
[02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:29.480]   And fortunately, this study also included
[02:05:29.480 --> 02:05:31.220]   a healthy comparison group
[02:05:31.220 --> 02:05:33.900]   where they could essentially find that people
[02:05:33.900 --> 02:05:36.140]   with bipolar disorder who supplemented with omega-3s
[02:05:36.140 --> 02:05:38.560]   had changes at the cellular level
[02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:42.460]   and the neural circuit level that brought their brains
[02:05:42.460 --> 02:05:44.300]   and neural circuits closer to that
[02:05:44.300 --> 02:05:46.300]   of the healthy comparison subjects.
[02:05:46.300 --> 02:05:48.660]   So while I don't want to point
[02:05:48.660 --> 02:05:50.660]   to omega-3 fatty acid supplementation
[02:05:50.660 --> 02:05:53.060]   as the be all end all of treatment for bipolar disorder,
[02:05:53.060 --> 02:05:54.260]   certainly it is not,
[02:05:54.260 --> 02:05:57.660]   it does have a strong mechanistic basis
[02:05:57.660 --> 02:06:02.660]   for its possible support of neural circuitry,
[02:06:02.660 --> 02:06:04.420]   of neuroplasticity,
[02:06:04.420 --> 02:06:06.540]   and in particular the ability to make changes
[02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:09.680]   in cell membranes that are very reminiscent
[02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:11.300]   of some of the neural circuit changes
[02:06:11.300 --> 02:06:12.920]   and changes in membrane fluidity
[02:06:12.920 --> 02:06:14.700]   that are seen with lithium treatment
[02:06:14.700 --> 02:06:17.300]   and other known prescription drug treatments
[02:06:17.300 --> 02:06:20.220]   that have been established now for decades
[02:06:20.220 --> 02:06:22.940]   to be very effective for bipolar disorder.
[02:06:22.940 --> 02:06:26.420]   So what that says is that omega-3 supplementation,
[02:06:26.420 --> 02:06:30.000]   while not the only intervention that one should consider,
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:33.100]   is something to consider and talk about with your doctor,
[02:06:33.100 --> 02:06:35.660]   and it's operating in powerful ways.
[02:06:35.660 --> 02:06:38.220]   It's not just that it's changing, for instance,
[02:06:38.220 --> 02:06:40.340]   your gut microbiome, which is powerful,
[02:06:40.340 --> 02:06:41.500]   but is indirect to the brain.
[02:06:41.500 --> 02:06:43.180]   It does seem to be having direct effects
[02:06:43.180 --> 02:06:44.900]   on neurons and neural circuits.
[02:06:44.900 --> 02:06:46.520]   Before we begin to conclude our discussion
[02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:48.180]   about bipolar disorder,
[02:06:48.180 --> 02:06:50.980]   I want to talk a little bit about this word disorder.
[02:06:50.980 --> 02:06:52.900]   And this is a theme that doesn't just relate
[02:06:52.900 --> 02:06:54.260]   to bipolar disorder,
[02:06:54.260 --> 02:06:56.980]   but other psychiatric disorders as well.
[02:06:56.980 --> 02:06:58.700]   And when we think of a disorder,
[02:06:58.700 --> 02:07:02.100]   we think of something that is really detrimental to us,
[02:07:02.100 --> 02:07:05.060]   something that really impairs our ability to function
[02:07:05.060 --> 02:07:06.760]   in work and school and relationships,
[02:07:06.760 --> 02:07:10.060]   and really starts to pull down our health status
[02:07:10.060 --> 02:07:11.220]   in a variety of ways.
[02:07:11.220 --> 02:07:14.940]   And certainly bipolar disorder meets those criteria.
[02:07:14.940 --> 02:07:17.780]   However, there is this idea
[02:07:17.780 --> 02:07:19.740]   that things like bipolar disorder,
[02:07:19.740 --> 02:07:22.620]   even things like schizophrenia in some cases,
[02:07:22.620 --> 02:07:25.540]   are responsible for some of the creative aspects
[02:07:25.540 --> 02:07:27.840]   or the creative works that have been observed
[02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:31.100]   and carried out by human beings for many centuries.
[02:07:31.100 --> 02:07:32.180]   And believe it or not,
[02:07:32.180 --> 02:07:34.140]   there are good data to support the fact
[02:07:34.140 --> 02:07:36.380]   that certain aspects of mania
[02:07:36.380 --> 02:07:38.860]   are associated with creativity.
[02:07:38.860 --> 02:07:42.220]   Now, we are long overdue for an episode about creativity.
[02:07:42.220 --> 02:07:43.380]   It's neural circuit basis,
[02:07:43.380 --> 02:07:45.780]   it's chemical basis here on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:07:45.780 --> 02:07:48.260]   And certainly we will have that conversation.
[02:07:48.260 --> 02:07:49.440]   But in the meantime,
[02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:52.100]   I'd like to just briefly touch upon this idea
[02:07:52.100 --> 02:07:54.900]   that certain occupations are associated
[02:07:54.900 --> 02:07:57.840]   with a higher incidence of bipolar depression.
[02:07:57.840 --> 02:08:02.180]   And in fact, it's been explored at a research level.
[02:08:02.180 --> 02:08:04.580]   Really, there are data pointing to the fact
[02:08:04.580 --> 02:08:07.780]   that certain individuals of certain occupations
[02:08:07.780 --> 02:08:09.540]   tend to be more creative,
[02:08:09.540 --> 02:08:11.660]   and that creativity is associated with,
[02:08:11.660 --> 02:08:13.740]   again, associate, this isn't causal,
[02:08:13.740 --> 02:08:16.900]   it's associate or correlated with higher levels
[02:08:16.900 --> 02:08:19.060]   or incidents of bipolar depression
[02:08:19.060 --> 02:08:21.100]   and maybe even other forms of depression.
[02:08:21.100 --> 02:08:24.220]   So this is a study looking at mood disorders
[02:08:24.220 --> 02:08:25.820]   in eminent individuals.
[02:08:25.820 --> 02:08:28.940]   So these are people that are not just good at what they do,
[02:08:28.940 --> 02:08:30.940]   but are exceptional at what they do
[02:08:30.940 --> 02:08:35.640]   and explored the percentage of people in given professions
[02:08:35.640 --> 02:08:39.000]   with either depression or mania.
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.420]   And this was actually a data set gleaned
[02:08:41.420 --> 02:08:45.100]   from more than 1,000 20th century Westerners
[02:08:45.100 --> 02:08:46.620]   based on their biographies
[02:08:46.620 --> 02:08:49.020]   that were reviewed by other people.
[02:08:49.020 --> 02:08:50.580]   So it's a bit of an indirect measurement.
[02:08:50.580 --> 02:08:52.580]   This isn't psychiatrist data.
[02:08:52.580 --> 02:08:55.740]   This is data, or I should say these are data,
[02:08:55.740 --> 02:08:59.340]   that were compiled from self-reports
[02:08:59.340 --> 02:09:02.140]   or from reads of self-reports.
[02:09:02.140 --> 02:09:03.860]   And they explored a number of different professions.
[02:09:03.860 --> 02:09:06.500]   So for instance, they looked at people in the military
[02:09:06.500 --> 02:09:08.440]   or people who were professional athletes
[02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:11.060]   or natural scientists or social scientists,
[02:09:11.060 --> 02:09:13.380]   people who occupied positions in public office
[02:09:13.380 --> 02:09:17.220]   or were musical performers, artists, nonfiction writers,
[02:09:17.220 --> 02:09:18.580]   poetry, et cetera.
[02:09:18.580 --> 02:09:20.260]   There are a lot of professions here.
[02:09:20.260 --> 02:09:22.700]   I will post this, or I'll post a link to it
[02:09:22.700 --> 02:09:25.000]   in the show note captions for you to peruse,
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.820]   but I'll just give you a sense of the extremes on this graph
[02:09:27.820 --> 02:09:29.420]   because they're very interesting.
[02:09:29.420 --> 02:09:32.520]   It turns out that if you were to look at the profession,
[02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:34.140]   or I should say among the professions
[02:09:34.140 --> 02:09:35.540]   they looked at in this study,
[02:09:35.540 --> 02:09:38.220]   'cause they didn't look at all professions,
[02:09:38.220 --> 02:09:39.940]   those in the military
[02:09:39.940 --> 02:09:42.020]   and those who are professional athletes
[02:09:42.020 --> 02:09:46.660]   or had jobs in the social or natural sciences had the,
[02:09:46.660 --> 02:09:49.680]   of those, there was a lower percentage of those
[02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:51.960]   that had depression or mania.
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:53.900]   In some cases, like those who were professional athletes
[02:09:53.900 --> 02:09:56.400]   didn't seem to have, there was no incidents of mania,
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:09:58.160]   at least in this data set.
[02:09:58.160 --> 02:10:00.580]   Whereas at the opposite extreme of the graph,
[02:10:00.580 --> 02:10:04.200]   those that were poets, so these are eminent individuals,
[02:10:04.200 --> 02:10:06.060]   people that were exceptional poets,
[02:10:06.060 --> 02:10:09.360]   exceptional fiction writers, exceptional artists
[02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:11.320]   or nonfiction writers.
[02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:14.100]   Well, they are especially for the poets.
[02:10:14.100 --> 02:10:17.940]   You find that as many as 90%
[02:10:17.940 --> 02:10:20.480]   of these very successful poets
[02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:23.680]   had either depression or mania.
[02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:26.260]   As high as 90%.
[02:10:26.260 --> 02:10:27.220]   That's incredible.
[02:10:27.220 --> 02:10:28.580]   Contrast that with military,
[02:10:28.580 --> 02:10:31.240]   where it's as few as 10% or professional athletes,
[02:10:31.240 --> 02:10:32.460]   where it's as few as 20%.
[02:10:32.460 --> 02:10:34.580]   And for the professional athletes, as I mentioned before,
[02:10:34.580 --> 02:10:36.220]   none of them had mania.
[02:10:36.220 --> 02:10:39.060]   So does this mean that being a poet
[02:10:39.060 --> 02:10:40.600]   will make you manic or depressed?
[02:10:40.600 --> 02:10:43.320]   Well, first of all, let's look at the poetry category.
[02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:47.920]   It turns out that 75% of these eminent poets,
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:51.780]   these highly accomplished poets had major depression.
[02:10:51.780 --> 02:10:57.640]   Whereas only about 20% of those poets had manic episodes.
[02:10:57.640 --> 02:11:02.680]   So again, it's not that being a poet
[02:11:02.680 --> 02:11:03.600]   is going to give you mania.
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:04.600]   Certainly we're not saying that.
[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:06.440]   It's not that being a poet is going to give you depression,
[02:11:06.440 --> 02:11:09.620]   but it turns out that people with depression
[02:11:09.620 --> 02:11:12.220]   and people with depression and mania
[02:11:12.220 --> 02:11:14.160]   seem to gravitate towards poetry,
[02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:16.440]   or at least are very successful at poetry.
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:19.980]   Again, associative, correlative,
[02:11:19.980 --> 02:11:22.480]   no causal relationship here.
[02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:24.340]   But it is really striking to see
[02:11:24.340 --> 02:11:28.500]   how the creative occupations, poetry, fiction,
[02:11:28.500 --> 02:11:30.340]   art, nonfiction writing,
[02:11:30.340 --> 02:11:32.140]   even though nonfiction writing is about nonfiction,
[02:11:32.140 --> 02:11:34.940]   it's still creative, music, composition, theater,
[02:11:34.940 --> 02:11:37.620]   much higher incidents of things like mania.
[02:11:37.620 --> 02:11:41.020]   And in fact, for the people in theater, the actors,
[02:11:41.020 --> 02:11:44.880]   even though the overall occurrence of depression and mania
[02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:47.240]   is lower than that in poets,
[02:11:47.240 --> 02:11:51.000]   the fraction of those individuals that have mania
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:52.560]   is exceedingly high.
[02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:55.320]   It's about 30% of those that they looked at
[02:11:55.320 --> 02:12:00.840]   who are actors, have manic episodes,
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:02.280]   or have full-blown mania.
[02:12:02.280 --> 02:12:04.580]   So I'm referring to these data because,
[02:12:04.580 --> 02:12:06.760]   first of all, I find them incredibly interesting, right?
[02:12:06.760 --> 02:12:08.700]   Up until now, we've been talking about bipolar disorder
[02:12:08.700 --> 02:12:11.700]   and other mood disorders for their maladaptive effects.
[02:12:11.700 --> 02:12:13.360]   And again, they're extremely maladaptive,
[02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:16.460]   much, much higher incidents of suicide, et cetera.
[02:12:16.460 --> 02:12:19.020]   But we'd be wrong to say that certain aspects
[02:12:19.020 --> 02:12:22.020]   of manic episodes don't lend themselves well to creativity,
[02:12:22.020 --> 02:12:23.900]   or that certain aspects of major depression
[02:12:23.900 --> 02:12:26.980]   don't lend themselves well to creativity
[02:12:26.980 --> 02:12:29.320]   or to the performing arts or to poetry.
[02:12:29.320 --> 02:12:32.920]   That said, in no way, shape, or form
[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:36.280]   do I believe that being depressed is a good thing
[02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:37.880]   or that being manic is a good thing.
[02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:40.940]   Again, we return to the basic foundational criteria
[02:12:40.940 --> 02:12:42.500]   for bipolar disorder and major depression,
[02:12:42.500 --> 02:12:46.960]   which is that the pressured speech, the not sleeping,
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:51.760]   the incredible increases in energy and the flights of ideas
[02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:54.200]   are generally not going to lead,
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:56.060]   or I think it's fair to say
[02:12:56.060 --> 02:12:58.140]   are not going to lead to good places.
[02:12:58.140 --> 02:13:00.840]   In fact, often lead to bad places.
[02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:04.140]   But we would also be wrong if we didn't consider the fact
[02:13:04.140 --> 02:13:07.720]   that there's a somewhat inextricable relationship
[02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:10.100]   between mania and creativity.
[02:13:10.100 --> 02:13:15.100]   And it could be that hypomania or brief periods of mania,
[02:13:15.100 --> 02:13:17.480]   maybe even an hour a day or 30 minutes a day
[02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:19.520]   of composing or writing poetry,
[02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:21.960]   maybe even some of the lows that we feel, right?
[02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:23.520]   Some of the sadness, some of the grief,
[02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:25.200]   some of the nostalgia that we feel,
[02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:27.280]   provided that it's not pathologic,
[02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:30.240]   that it's not persistent for the four or seven days
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:32.380]   that are diagnostic of bipolar II
[02:13:32.380 --> 02:13:34.480]   and bipolar I disorder respectively.
[02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:38.080]   Well, then we can start to view emotional states
[02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:40.360]   as something that can actually lend themselves
[02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:43.480]   to positive outcomes and maybe even to creativity
[02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:45.220]   and to improved occupations.
[02:13:45.220 --> 02:13:47.520]   So it's important that we have a nuanced view
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:50.580]   of what sadness versus depression
[02:13:50.580 --> 02:13:52.360]   versus major depression are.
[02:13:52.360 --> 02:13:57.000]   It's important that we distinguish between being erratic,
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:00.760]   being very energized and full-blown bipolar disorder.
[02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:02.760]   And I raise this for another reason as well.
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:05.600]   Nowadays, it's very common to hear people saying,
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:07.600]   "Oh, you know, that person is OCD."
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:11.940]   Well, on the episode about OCD that I did a few weeks back,
[02:14:11.940 --> 02:14:15.120]   that you can find if you like at hubermanlab.com,
[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:18.700]   in that episode, I pointed out that OCD,
[02:14:18.700 --> 02:14:21.780]   obsessive compulsive disorder, is very maladaptive, right?
[02:14:21.780 --> 02:14:23.880]   I think it's number seven, as I recall,
[02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:26.100]   on the list of debilitating diseases,
[02:14:26.100 --> 02:14:29.160]   all diseases in terms of lost time at work,
[02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:30.840]   suffering relationships, et cetera.
[02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:32.600]   So it's a really serious condition.
[02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:35.040]   And yet we often hear, "Oh, that person is obsessive."
[02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:36.360]   And as I pointed out,
[02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:38.780]   there is obsessive compulsive personality disorder.
[02:14:38.780 --> 02:14:41.520]   And then there is obsessive compulsive tendencies
[02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:43.280]   which actually benefit people.
[02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:46.720]   But that is distinct from obsessive compulsive disorder
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:49.440]   as a clinically diagnosed thing.
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:53.000]   Similarly, we hear that, "Oh, somebody's being bipolar,"
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.120]   or, "They're all over the place, they're bipolar."
[02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:58.920]   Well, that's a very subjective and label
[02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:01.840]   that people give one another in passing.
[02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:03.240]   More and more often I'm hearing this.
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:08.020]   And yet bipolar disorder, whether or not it's BP1 or BP2,
[02:15:08.020 --> 02:15:12.440]   are extremely maladaptive and extremely associated
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:14.380]   with high suicide risk.
[02:15:14.380 --> 02:15:17.480]   So while I'm not here to police people,
[02:15:17.480 --> 02:15:18.720]   I'm not certainly not the word police
[02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:20.280]   or the nomenclature police,
[02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:23.160]   I do think that whether or not you refer to people as OCD
[02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:25.240]   or as bipolar, et cetera, that's up to you, all right?
[02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:26.480]   It's not my place to say.
[02:15:26.480 --> 02:15:29.040]   But I do think it's important that all of us understand
[02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:31.600]   that these psychiatric conditions carry with them
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:33.840]   tremendous maladaptive weight.
[02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:35.960]   So today we've really done a deep dive
[02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:39.400]   into bipolar disorder and to both the manic
[02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:42.700]   and the depressive components that are present
[02:15:42.700 --> 02:15:44.960]   or can be present in bipolar disorder
[02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:46.960]   and the different forms of bipolar disorder
[02:15:46.960 --> 02:15:49.800]   and some of the major treatments for bipolar disorder,
[02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:52.200]   in particular lithium and its underlying mechanisms
[02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:54.520]   and some of the neural circuit and chemical basis
[02:15:54.520 --> 02:15:57.600]   and neuroplasticity basis of the treatments
[02:15:57.600 --> 02:16:01.640]   for bipolar disorder, in particular homeostatic scaling
[02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:03.800]   or homeostatic plasticity.
[02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:06.560]   All of that, of course, is relevant to bipolar disorder
[02:16:06.560 --> 02:16:08.720]   and I hope will be useful in your understanding
[02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:10.360]   and maybe even in your pursuit of treatments
[02:16:10.360 --> 02:16:12.680]   for bipolar depression, bipolar disorder
[02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:14.240]   for you or other people.
[02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:16.980]   I also hope that it will be useful in your understanding
[02:16:16.980 --> 02:16:19.880]   of how brain circuits work in normal conditions
[02:16:19.880 --> 02:16:22.240]   or in conditions where there is no disease state
[02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:23.840]   or maladaptive conditions.
[02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:27.460]   Homeostatic plasticity is present in all of us.
[02:16:27.460 --> 02:16:31.140]   Membrane fluidity due to how easily things move around
[02:16:31.140 --> 02:16:33.920]   in the surface, the fatty layers on the outside of neurons
[02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:35.900]   and the movement of receptors in and out of neurons,
[02:16:35.900 --> 02:16:37.560]   that is present in all of us.
[02:16:37.560 --> 02:16:39.680]   The influence of omega-3 fatty acids
[02:16:39.680 --> 02:16:41.960]   is central to that discussion,
[02:16:41.960 --> 02:16:44.600]   as is the discussion about various drug treatments
[02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:45.660]   because even if you're not somebody
[02:16:45.660 --> 02:16:47.340]   who's taking a drug treatment
[02:16:47.340 --> 02:16:49.840]   or who is pursuing a drug treatment for bipolar disorder
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:51.720]   or another psychiatric condition,
[02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:53.720]   your serotonin levels, your dopamine levels,
[02:16:53.720 --> 02:16:54.680]   your acetylcholine levels,
[02:16:54.680 --> 02:16:56.080]   all of these play into what we call
[02:16:56.080 --> 02:16:57.800]   your mental and physical health.
[02:16:57.800 --> 02:16:59.200]   In fact, if any of you are interested
[02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:01.560]   in the various categories of neuromodulators
[02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:04.020]   and tools to adjust those neuromodulators
[02:17:04.020 --> 02:17:06.860]   under more standard non-disease conditions,
[02:17:06.860 --> 02:17:10.900]   we did an episode on neurochemicals and how to control them.
[02:17:10.900 --> 02:17:12.820]   You can find that at hubermanlab.com
[02:17:12.820 --> 02:17:15.660]   along with all other episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:17:15.660 --> 02:17:17.320]   She mentioned everything is timestamped
[02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:18.920]   so you can navigate to the specific topics
[02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:20.720]   and tools of interest to you.
[02:17:20.720 --> 02:17:23.400]   And meanwhile, I just want to thank all of you
[02:17:23.400 --> 02:17:27.140]   for joining me on this voyage through the biology
[02:17:27.140 --> 02:17:29.180]   and the treatments for bipolar disorder.
[02:17:29.180 --> 02:17:31.440]   I do hope you found it beneficial
[02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:33.320]   both for yourself and for others.
[02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:35.400]   I just want to remind people that bipolar disorder
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:37.520]   is an extremely serious condition.
[02:17:37.520 --> 02:17:39.660]   If you suspect that you have bipolar disorder
[02:17:39.660 --> 02:17:41.840]   or you know somebody who does,
[02:17:41.840 --> 02:17:43.560]   please make sure that you or they
[02:17:43.560 --> 02:17:45.540]   talk to a qualified health professional.
[02:17:45.540 --> 02:17:47.820]   If you're learning from and are enjoying this podcast,

[02:18:18.840 --> 02:18:19.860]   During today's episode,
[02:18:19.860 --> 02:18:21.520]   and certainly on many previous episodes
[02:18:21.520 --> 02:18:22.920]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:24.240]   we talk about supplements.
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:26.920]   Once again, while supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:28.800]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:31.800]   for things like enhancing sleep and focus and hormone support
[02:18:31.800 --> 02:18:33.240]   and other aspects of mental
[02:18:33.240 --> 02:18:35.140]   and physical health and performance.
[02:18:35.140 --> 02:18:36.880]   As I mentioned at the beginning of today's episode,
[02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:38.740]   the Huberman Lab podcast is happy to announce
[02:18:38.740 --> 02:18:40.720]   that we partnered with Momentous Supplements.
[02:18:40.720 --> 02:18:42.100]   If you'd like to see our supplements
[02:18:42.100 --> 02:18:44.360]   and the ones that we designed in concert with Momentous,
[02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:47.760]   you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:50.440]   Please also check out Huberman Lab on social media.
[02:18:50.440 --> 02:18:53.240]   We are Huberman Lab on both Twitter and Instagram.
[02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:56.200]   In both places, I cover science and science-related tools,
[02:18:56.200 --> 02:18:57.740]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:18:57.740 --> 02:18:59.240]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:01.600]   but much of which is distinct from the information covered
[02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:03.120]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:04.460]   We also have a newsletter.
[02:19:04.460 --> 02:19:06.560]   It's called the Neural Network Newsletter.
[02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:07.840]   It's completely zero cost,
[02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:10.120]   and it contains summaries of podcasts
[02:19:10.120 --> 02:19:12.240]   and some actionable protocols from each podcast.
[02:19:12.240 --> 02:19:14.520]   You can sign up for it by going to HubermanLab.com,
[02:19:14.520 --> 02:19:17.440]   go to the menu, and click on Neural Network Newsletter.
[02:19:17.440 --> 02:19:18.640]   You can also see some examples
[02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:20.240]   of previous newsletters there.
[02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:21.960]   I should mention that by signing up,
[02:19:21.960 --> 02:19:23.200]   you do provide your email,
[02:19:23.200 --> 02:19:25.160]   but we do not share your email with anybody.
[02:19:25.160 --> 02:19:27.320]   And again, it is completely zero cost.
[02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:28.980]   So once again, thank you for joining me today
[02:19:28.980 --> 02:19:30.680]   for our discussion about the biology
[02:19:30.680 --> 02:19:32.200]   and treatment of bipolar disorder.
[02:19:32.200 --> 02:19:34.520]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:19:34.520 --> 02:19:36.320]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:38.900]   [upbeat music]
[02:19:38.900 --> 02:19:41.480]   (upbeat music)
