[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   The following is a conversation with Norman Namark,
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.960]   a historian at Stanford specializing in genocide,
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.400]   war, and empire.
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.600]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

[00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.040]   in the description.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.960]   And now, here's my conversation with Norman Namark.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.500]   Did Stalin believe that communism is good,
[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.400]   not just for him, but for the people of the Soviet Union
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.960]   and the people of the world?
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.840]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.720]   I mean, Stalin believed that socialism was the be all
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.760]   and end all of human existence.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.440]   I mean, he was a true Leninist,
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.160]   and in Lenin's tradition, this was what he believed.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.320]   I mean, that set of beliefs didn't exclude
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.880]   other kinds of things he believed or thought or did.
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.920]   But no, the way he defined socialism,
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.880]   the way he thought about socialism,
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.720]   no, he absolutely thought it was in the interest
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.480]   of the Soviet Union and of the world.
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.320]   And in fact, that the world was one day going to go socialist
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.840]   in other words, I think he believed in that.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.240]   And eventually, in the International Revolution.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.840]   - So given the genocide in the 1930s that you described,
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.400]   was Stalin evil, delusional, or incompetent?
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.480]   - Evil, delusional, or incompetent.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.500]   Well, you know, evil is one of those words,
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.900]   you know, which has a lot of kind of religious
[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.680]   and moral connotations.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.280]   And in that sense, yes, I think he was an evil man.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.880]   I mean, he, you know, eliminated people
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.720]   absolutely unnecessarily.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.080]   He tortured people, had people tortured.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.000]   He was completely indifferent to the suffering of others.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.760]   He couldn't have cared a whit,
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.840]   you know, that millions were suffering.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.540]   And so yes, I consider him an evil man.
[00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.140]   I mean, you know, historians don't like to--
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.780]   - Use the word evil. - Use the word evil.
[00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.340]   It's, you know, it's a word for moral philosophers,
[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.340]   but I think it certainly fits who he is.
[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.040]   I think he was delusional.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.980]   And there is a wonderful historian at Princeton,
[00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.620]   a political scientist actually named Robert Tucker,
[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.620]   who said he suffered from a paranoid delusional system.
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.320]   And I always remember that of Tucker's writing
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.240]   because what Tucker meant is that he was not just paranoid,
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.600]   meaning, you know, I'm paranoid,
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.920]   I'm worried you're out to get me, right?
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.920]   But that he constructed whole plots of people,
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.340]   whole systems of people who were out to get him.
[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.220]   So in other words, his delusions were that there were
[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.540]   all of these groups of people out there
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.500]   who were out to diminish his power and remove him
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.360]   from his position and undermine the Soviet Union in his view.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.360]   So yes, I think he did suffer from delusions.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.940]   And this had a huge effect because whole groups then
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.920]   were destroyed by his activities,
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.920]   which he would construct based on these delusions.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.380]   He was not incompetent.
[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.340]   He was an extremely competent man.
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.700]   I mean, I think most of the research that's gone on,
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.840]   especially since the Stalin Archive was opened
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.820]   at the beginning of the century,
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.720]   and I think almost every historian who goes in that archive
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.260]   comes away from it with the feeling of a man
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.860]   who is enormously hardworking, intelligent,
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.900]   you know, with an acute sense of politics,
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.900]   a really excellent sense of political rhetoric,
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.180]   a fantastic editor, you know, in a kind of agitational sense.
[00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.460]   I mean, he's a real agitator, right?
[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.280]   And of a, you know, a really hard worker.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.900]   I mean, somebody who works from morning till night,
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.700]   a micromanager in some ways.
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.820]   So his competence, I think, was really extreme.
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.440]   Now, there were times when that fell down,
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.540]   you know, times in the '30s, times in the '20s,
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.220]   times during the war, where he made mistakes.
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.940]   It's not as if he didn't make any mistakes.
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.220]   But I think, you know, you look at his stuff,
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.120]   you know, you look at his archives, you look what he did.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.700]   I mean, this is an enormously competent man
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.320]   who in many, many different areas of enterprise,
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.540]   because he, you know, he had this notion
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.620]   that he should know everything and did know everything.
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.620]   I remember one archive, "Gilad's" called,
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.340]   you know, a kind of folder that I looked at
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.260]   where he actually went through the wines
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.460]   that were produced in his native Georgia
[00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.340]   and wrote down how much they should make
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.060]   of each of these wines, you know,
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.200]   how many, you know, barrels they should produce
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.360]   of these wines, which grapes were better
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.780]   than the other grapes, sort of correcting,
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.700]   in other words, what people were putting down there.
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.860]   So he was, you know, his competence ranged very wide,
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.500]   or at least he thought his competence ranged very wide.
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.760]   I mean, both things, I think, are the case.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.860]   - If we look at this paranoid, delusional system,
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.900]   Stalin was in power for 30 years.
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.000]   He is, many argue, one of the most powerful men in history.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.620]   Did, in his case, absolute power corrupt him
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.940]   or did it reveal the true nature of the man?
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.500]   And maybe just in your sense,
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.540]   as we kind of build around this genocide
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.300]   of the early 1930s, this paranoid, delusional system,
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.780]   did it get built up over time?
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.620]   Was it always there?
[00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.620]   It's kind of a question of did the genocide,
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.240]   was that always inevitable, essentially, in this man,
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.900]   or did power create that?
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.060]   - I mean, it's a great question,
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.460]   and I don't think you can,
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.100]   I don't think you can say that it was always
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.500]   kind of inherent in the man.
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.740]   I mean, the man without his position and without his power,
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.060]   you know, wouldn't have been able to accomplish
[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.060]   what he eventually did in the way of murdering people,
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.580]   you know, and murdering groups of people,
[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.860]   which is what genocide is.
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.780]   So, you know, I don't, it wasn't sort of in him.
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.180]   I mean, there were, and again, you know,
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.020]   the new research has shown that, you know,
[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.540]   he had, his childhood was, you know,
[00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.380]   not a particularly nasty one.
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.780]   People used to say, you know, the father beat him up,
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.540]   and it turns out, actually, it wasn't the father,
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.340]   it was the mother once in a while.
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.900]   But basically, you know, he was not an unusual,
[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.980]   young Georgian kid, or student, even.
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.060]   And, you know, it was the growth of the Soviet system,
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.720]   and him within the Soviet system,
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.780]   I mean, his own development within the Soviet system,
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.780]   I think that led, you know, to the kind of mass killing
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.340]   that occurred in the 1930s.
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.680]   You know, he essentially achieved complete power
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.680]   by the early 1930s, and then as he rolled with it,
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.160]   as you would say, you know, or people would say,
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.740]   you know, it increasingly became murderous,
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.660]   and there was no, you know, there were no checks
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.820]   and balances, obviously, on that murderous system.
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.180]   And not only that, you know, people supported it
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.980]   in the NKVD and elsewhere,
[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.900]   and he learned how to manipulate people.
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:51.500]   I mean, he was a superb, you know, political manipulator
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.700]   of those people around him.
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:59.700]   And, you know, we've got new transcripts, for example,
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.940]   of, you know, police bureau meetings in the early 1930s.
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.660]   And you read those things, and you read, you know,
[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:12.660]   he uses humor, and he uses sarcasm, especially.
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:17.140]   He uses verbal ways to undermine people, you know,
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.780]   to control their behavior and what they do.
[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:25.460]   And he's a really, you know, he's a real,
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.380]   I guess, manipulator is the right word,
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:32.380]   and he does it with, you know, a kind of skill
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.060]   that on the one hand is admirable,
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:39.860]   and on the other hand, of course, is terrible,
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.740]   because it ends up, you know,
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:46.460]   creating the system of terror that he creates.
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.620]   - I mean, I guess just to linger on it,
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.180]   I just wonder how much of it is a slippery slope
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.500]   in the early '20s, 1920s,
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.460]   did he think he was going to be murdering
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:04.460]   even a single person, but thousands and millions.
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.340]   I just wonder,
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:14.060]   maybe the murder of a single human being,
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.620]   just to get them, you know,
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.460]   because you're paranoid about them
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:19.920]   potentially threatening your power,
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.260]   does that murder then open a door?
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.980]   And once you open the door,
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.940]   you become a different human being.
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.060]   A deeper question here is the Solzhenitsyn,
[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.740]   you know, the line between good and evil
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.180]   runs in every man, are all of us,
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.780]   once we commit one murder in this situation,
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.060]   does that open a door for all of us?
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.620]   And I guess even the further deeper question
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.980]   is how easy it is for human nature
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:49.020]   to go on this slippery slope that ends in genocide.
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.380]   - There are a lot of questions in those questions,
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.900]   and you know, the slippery slope question,
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.160]   I would answer, I suppose, by saying,
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.100]   you know, Stalin wasn't the most likely successor of Lenin.
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.020]   There were plenty of others.
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.620]   There were a lot of political contingencies
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.660]   that emerged in the 1920s
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:16.620]   that made it possible for Stalin to seize power.
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.540]   I don't think of him as a,
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.820]   you know, if you would just know him in 1925,
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.900]   I don't think anybody would say, much less himself,
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.780]   that this was a future mass murderer.
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.980]   I mean, Trotsky mistrusted him
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:35.980]   and thought he was, you know, a mindless bureaucrat.
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.500]   You know, others were less mistrustful of him,
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.740]   but, you know, he managed to gain power
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.580]   in the way he did through this bureaucratic
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.920]   and political maneuvering that was very successful.
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.940]   You know, the slippery slope, as it were,
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.580]   doesn't really begin until the 1930s, in my view.
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.820]   In other words, once he gains complete power
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.300]   and control of the Politburo,
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:05.860]   once the programs that he institutes
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:10.060]   of the Five-Year Plan and collectivization go through,
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:14.020]   once he reverses himself and is able to reverse himself
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.140]   or reverse the Soviet path, you know,
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.540]   to give various nationalities their, you know,
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.980]   their ability to develop their own cultures
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:26.660]   and sort of internal politics,
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.000]   once he reverses all that, you know,
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.140]   you have the Ukrainian famine in '32, '33,
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.460]   you have the murder of Kirov,
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:38.060]   who is one of the leading figures, you know,
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.140]   in the political system, you have the suicide of his wife,
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:45.540]   you have all these things come together in '32, '33,
[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:50.540]   that then, you know, make it more likely,
[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.440]   in other words, that bad things are gonna happen.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.820]   And people start seeing that, too, around him.
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.940]   They start seeing that it's not a slippery slope,
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.940]   it's a dangerous, it's a dangerous situation,
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.100]   which is emerging, and some people really understand that.
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:13.460]   So I don't, I really do see a differentiation, then,
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:14.700]   between the '20s.
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.420]   I mean, it's true that Stalin, during the Civil War,
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.140]   there's a lot of, you know, good research on that,
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.060]   you know, shows that he already had
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.420]   some of these characteristics of being,
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:29.620]   as it were, murderous and being, you know,
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.980]   being dictatorial and pushing people around
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:34.820]   and that sort of thing.
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.620]   That was all there.
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:40.800]   But I don't really see that as kind of the necessary stage
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.500]   for the next thing that came, which was the '30s,
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.780]   which was really terror of the worst sort,
[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:49.340]   you know, where everybody's afraid for their lives
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.580]   and most people are afraid for their lives
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.420]   and their families' lives, and where torture
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.100]   and that sort of thing becomes a common part,
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.300]   you know, of what people had to face.
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.100]   So it's a different world.
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.820]   And, you know, people will argue.
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:09.820]   They'll argue this kind of Lenin-Stalin continuity debate,
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.220]   you know, that's been going on
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.100]   since I was an undergraduate, right?
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.460]   That argument, you know, was Stalin
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:19.100]   the natural sort of next step from Lenin,
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.220]   or was he something completely different?
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:24.380]   Many people will argue, you know,
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.760]   because of Marxism-Leninism, because of the ideology,
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.860]   that, you know, it was the natural,
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.700]   it was a kind of natural next step.
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.300]   I don't think so, you know?
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.300]   And I would tend to lean the other way.
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.220]   Not absolutely.
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:40.100]   I mean, I won't make an absolute argument
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.540]   that what Stalin became had nothing to do with Lenin
[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.540]   and nothing to do with Marxism-Leninism.
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.380]   It had a lot to do with it.
[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:51.580]   But, you know, he takes it one major step further.
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.780]   And again, that's why I don't like the slippery slope,
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.540]   you know, metaphor, because that means
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.220]   it's kind of slow and easy.
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.300]   It's a leap.
[00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.300]   And we call, you know, I mean, historians talk
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:05.380]   about the Stalin revolution, you know, in '28 and '29,
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:08.860]   you know, that he, in some senses,
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.540]   creates a whole new system, you know,
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.300]   through the Five-Year Plan, collectivization,
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.720]   and seizing political power the way he does.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.460]   - Can you talk about the 1930s?
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.660]   Can you describe what happened in Holodomor,
[00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.220]   the Soviet terror famine in Ukraine in '32 and '33?
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.060]   - Yes.
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.220]   - That killed millions of Ukrainians?
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:28.040]   - Right.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.720]   It's a long story, you know,
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:34.120]   but let me try to be as succinct as I can be.
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.060]   I mean, the Holodomor, the terror famine
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:42.060]   of '32, '33, comes out of, in part,
[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:47.900]   an all-union famine that is the result of collectivization.
[00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:52.180]   You know, collectivization was a catastrophe.
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:56.020]   You know, the more or less, the so-called kulaks,
[00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.000]   the more or less richer farmers,
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.200]   I mean, they weren't really rich, right?
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.180]   Anybody with a tin roof and a cow was considered a kulak,
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:05.080]   you know, and other people who had nothing
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.420]   were also considered kulaks.
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.180]   If they opposed collectivization.
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:12.380]   So these kulaks, we're talking millions of them, right?
[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.060]   And Ukraine, it's worth recalling,
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:17.220]   and I'm sure you know this, was a, you know,
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.820]   heavily agricultural area, and Ukrainian peasants,
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.180]   you know, were in the countryside
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:27.700]   and resisted collectivization more
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:32.060]   than even the Russian peasants resisted collectivization,
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:35.480]   suffered during this collectivization program.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.620]   And they, you know, burned sometimes their own houses,
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.540]   they killed their own animals.
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:45.120]   They were shot, you know, sometimes on the spot.
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:50.020]   Tens of thousands and others were sent into exile.
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.500]   So there was a conflagration in the countryside.
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.260]   And the result of that conflagration in Ukraine
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.140]   was terrible famine.
[00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.020]   And again, there was famine all over the Soviet Union,
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:04.840]   but it was especially bad in Ukraine,
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.940]   in part because Ukrainian peasants resisted.
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.700]   Now in '32, '33, a couple of things happen.
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:14.520]   I mean, I've argued this in my writing,
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:18.200]   and, you know, I've also worked on this.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.980]   I continue to work on it, by the way,
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:23.340]   with a museum in Kiev,
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:25.900]   that's going to be about the Holodomor.
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.500]   They're building the museum now,
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:32.060]   and it's going to be a very impressive set of exhibits,
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.300]   and talk with historians all the time about it.
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.440]   So what happens in '32, '33, a couple of things.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:42.440]   First of all, the Stalin develops an even stronger,
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.280]   I say even stronger,
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:49.280]   'cause they already had an antipathy for the Ukrainians,
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:53.160]   an even stronger antipathy for the Ukrainians in general.
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.960]   First of all, they resist collectivization.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.160]   Second of all, he's not getting all the grain he wants
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.040]   out of them, and which he needs.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:07.040]   And so he sends in, then, people to expropriate the grain,
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.500]   and take the grain away from the peasants.
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.840]   These teams of people, you know, some policemen,
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.580]   some urban thugs, some party people,
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.320]   some poor peasants, you know, take part too,
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:23.920]   go into the villages, and forcibly seize grain,
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:28.500]   and animals from the Ukrainian peasantry.
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.920]   They're seizing it all over.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.960]   I mean, let's remember, again,
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.760]   this is all over the Soviet Union, in '32 especially.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:40.800]   Then, you know, in December of 1932,
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.800]   January of '33, February of '33,
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.760]   Stalin is convinced the Ukrainian peasantry
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.740]   needs to be shown who's boss,
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:55.620]   that they're not turning over their grain,
[00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.900]   that they're resisting the expropriators,
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.140]   that they're hiding the grain,
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.520]   which they do sometimes, right?
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:05.640]   That they're basically not loyal to the Soviet Union,
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.560]   that they're acting like traitors,
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.840]   that they're ready, and he says this,
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.640]   you know, I think it's Kaganovich, he says it too,
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.240]   you know, they're ready to kind of pull out
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.920]   of the Soviet Union and join Poland.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.520]   I mean, he thinks Poland is, you know,
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.960]   out to get Ukraine, and so he's gonna then,
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.040]   essentially, break the back of these peasantry.
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.720]   And the way he breaks their back
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.580]   is by going through another expropriation program,
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:33.420]   which is not done in the rest of the Soviet Union.
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.300]   So he's taking away everything they have,
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.500]   everything they have.
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.180]   There are new laws introduced
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:42.780]   where they will actually punish people,
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:47.660]   including kids, with death if they steal any grain,
[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.700]   you know, if they take anything from the,
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.220]   you know, from the fields.
[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:53.740]   So, you know, you can shoot anybody,
[00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.740]   you know, who is looking for food.
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:58.820]   And then he introduces measures in Ukraine
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:02.200]   which are not introduced into the rest of the Soviet Union.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.260]   For example, Ukrainian peasantry
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.960]   are not allowed to leave their villages anymore.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.180]   They can't go to the city to try to find some things.
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:13.060]   I mean, we've got pictures of, you know,
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.940]   Ukrainian peasants dying on the sidewalks
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:19.620]   in Kharkiv and in Kiev and in places like that
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.300]   who've managed to get out of the village
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.100]   and get to the cities, but now they can't leave.
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:28.180]   They can't leave Ukraine to go to Belarusia,
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:32.860]   Belarus today, or to Russia, you know, to get any food.
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:36.820]   There's no, he won't allow any relief to Ukraine.
[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.660]   Number of people offer relief, including the Poles,
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.180]   but also the Vatican offers relief.
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.500]   He won't allow any relief to Ukraine.
[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.340]   He won't admit that there's a famine in Ukraine.
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:52.260]   And instead what happens is that Ukraine turns
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.540]   into the Ukrainian countryside turns
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:59.220]   into what my now past colleague
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.580]   who died several years ago, Robert Conquest,
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:04.500]   called a vast belson.
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.100]   And by that, you know, the images
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:10.500]   of bodies just lying everywhere, you know, people dead
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:15.500]   and dying, you know, of hunger, which is, by the way,
[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:19.960]   I mean, as you know, I've spent a lot of time
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:20.800]   studying genocide.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.300]   I don't think there's anything worse than dying of hunger
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.540]   from what I have read.
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:27.620]   I mean, you see terrible ways that people die, right?
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.660]   But dying of hunger is just such a horrible, horrible thing.
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:36.180]   And so, for example, we know there were many cases
[00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.740]   of cannibalism in the countryside
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.260]   'cause there wasn't anything to eat.
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.300]   People were eating their own kids, right?
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.620]   And Stalin knew about this.
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:46.340]   And again, you know, we started with this question
[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:47.180]   a little bit earlier.
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:51.640]   He doesn't, there's not a sign of remorse,
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.360]   not a sign of pity, right?
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:58.980]   Not a sign of any kind of human emotion
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.680]   that normal people would have.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:06.680]   - What about the opposite of joy for teaching them a lesson?
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:09.560]   - I don't think there's joy.
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.880]   I'm not sure Stalin really understood
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.640]   what joy was. - Emotion of intermingling.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:19.440]   - You know, I think he felt it was necessary
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.920]   to get those SOBs, right?
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.660]   That they deserved it.
[00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:24.940]   He says that several times.
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:26.700]   This is their own fault, right?
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:27.900]   This is their own fault.
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:32.380]   And as their own fault, you know,
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:36.020]   they get what they deserve, basically.
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.400]   - How much was the calculation?
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.900]   How much was it reason versus emotion?
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.800]   In terms of, you said he was competent.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.600]   Was there a long-term strategy,
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.580]   or was this strategy based on emotion and anger?
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:54.760]   - No, well, I think actually the right answer
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.440]   is a little of both.
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.260]   I mean, usually the right answer in history
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.100]   is something like that.
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.400]   - A little of both? - No, you can't, you can't.
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.960]   It wasn't just, I mean, first of all,
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:08.640]   you know, the Soviets had it in for Ukraine
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.940]   and Ukrainian nationalism,
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.080]   which they really didn't like.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.680]   And by the way, Russians still don't like it, right?
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.080]   So they had it in for Ukrainian nationalism.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.900]   They feared Ukrainian nationalism.
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:24.760]   As I said, you know, Stalin writes, you know,
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:29.440]   we'll lose Ukraine, you know, if these guys win.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:33.300]   You know, so there's a kind of long-term determination,
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.260]   as I said, you know, to kind of break the back
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:42.260]   of Ukrainian national identity and Ukrainian nationalism
[00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:46.840]   as any kind of separatist force whatsoever.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:50.040]   And so there's that rational calculation.
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.640]   At the same time, I think Stalin is annoyed
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:58.560]   and peeved and angry on one level
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.880]   with the Ukrainians for resisting collectivization
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.340]   and for being difficult and for, you know,
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:10.340]   not conforming, you know, to the way he thinks
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:13.240]   peasants should act in this situation.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.480]   So you have both things.
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.600]   He's also very angry at the Ukrainian party
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.160]   and eventually purges it for not being able
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.900]   to control Ukraine and not be able to control the situation.
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.160]   You know, Ukraine is in theory,
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.040]   the breadbasket, right, of Europe.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:30.280]   Well, how come the breadbasket isn't turning over to me
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.200]   all this grain so I can sell it abroad
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.160]   and, you know, build new factories?
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.540]   And support the workers in the cities.
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.880]   So there's a kind of annoyance, you know,
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.760]   when things fail, and this is absolutely typical of Stalin,
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.960]   when things fail, he blames it on other people
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.760]   and usually groups of people, right?
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.020]   Not individuals, but groups, again.
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:53.720]   So a little bit of both, I think, is the right answer.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.760]   - This blame, it feels like there's a playbook
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.580]   that dictators follow.
[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:03.020]   I just wonder if it comes naturally or just kind of evolves.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.960]   There's blaming others and then telling these narratives
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.080]   and then creating the other and then somehow
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.700]   that leads to hatred and genocide.
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:14.720]   It feels like there's too many commonalities
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:18.960]   for it not to be a naturally emergent strategy
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.680]   that works for dictatorships.
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.080]   - I mean, that's a good, it's a very good point.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:27.680]   And I think it's one, you know, that has its merits.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.400]   In other words, I think you're right,
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.020]   that there's certain kinds of strategies by dictators
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.560]   that are common to them.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.880]   A lot of them do killing, not all of them,
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.040]   of that sort that Stalin did.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.840]   I've written about Mao and Pol Pot and Hitler.
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:46.840]   And there is a sort of, as you say,
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:51.800]   a kind of playbook for political dictatorship.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:56.800]   Also for a kind of communist totalitarian way of functioning.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:01.500]   And that way of functioning was described already
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.480]   by Hannah Arendt early on when she wrote
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.400]   The Origins of Totalitarianism.
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:10.280]   And she more or less writes the playbook
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.720]   and Stalin does follow it.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:17.180]   The real question, it seems to me, is to what extent,
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:19.740]   you know, and how deep does this go
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.180]   and how often does it go in that direction?
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:25.000]   I mean, you can argue, for example,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.480]   I mean, Fidel Castro was not a nice man, right?
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.840]   He was a dictator, he was a terrible dictator.
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.280]   But he did not engage in mass murder.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.760]   Ho Chi Minh was a dictator, a communist dictator
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:39.800]   who grew up in the communist movement,
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.360]   went to Moscow, spent time in Moscow in the '30s
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:47.960]   and went to find, found the Vietnamese Communist Party.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.240]   He was a horrible dictator.
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.460]   I'm sure he was responsible
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.560]   for a lot of death and destruction.
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.120]   But he wasn't a mass murderer.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.920]   And so you get those.
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:02.000]   I mean, I would even argue, others will disagree,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.120]   that Lenin wasn't a mass murderer.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.960]   You know, that he didn't kill the same way
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.200]   that Stalin killed.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.400]   Or people after him.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.280]   They're communist dictators too, after all.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.560]   Khrushchev was a communist dictator,
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.960]   but he stopped this killing.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:19.080]   And, you know, he's still responsible for a gulag
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.320]   and people sent off into a gulag
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.800]   and imprisonment and torture and that sort of thing.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.400]   But it's not at all the same thing.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:29.800]   So there are some, you know, like Stalin, like Mao,
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.680]   like Pol Pot, you know, who commit these horrible,
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:36.960]   horrible atrocities, extensively engaging,
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.800]   in my view, in genocide.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.240]   And there's some who don't.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:44.680]   And, you know, what's the difference?
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.680]   Well, you know, the difference is partly in personality,
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.400]   partly in historical circumstance, you know,
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.240]   partly in, you know, who is it
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.200]   that controls the reins of power.
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.040]   - How much do you connect the ideas of communism
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:02.040]   or Marxism or socialism to Holodomor, to Stalin's rule?
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:05.600]   So how naturally, as you kind of alluded to,
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.440]   does it lead to genocide?
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:13.200]   - It's also, I mean, in some ways,
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.400]   I've just addressed that question
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.080]   by saying it doesn't always lead to genocide.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.960]   You know, in the case, again, you know,
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:23.040]   Cuba is not pretty, but it didn't have,
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.000]   there was no genocide in Cuba.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.800]   And the same thing in North Vietnam.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.720]   You know, even North Korea, as awful as it is,
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.480]   as terrible dictatorship, right,
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:37.480]   and people's rights are totally destroyed, right?
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:40.160]   They have no freedom whatsoever, you know,
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.560]   is not, as far as we know, genocidal.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.120]   Who knows whether it could be,
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.480]   or whether if they took over South Korea, you know,
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.200]   mass murder wouldn't take place and that kind of thing.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:53.240]   But my point is, is that the ideology
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:57.120]   doesn't necessarily dictate genocide.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.360]   In other words, it's an ideology, I think,
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:04.280]   that makes genocide sometimes too easily possible,
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:09.200]   given, you know, the way it thinks through history
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.600]   as being, you know, you're on the right side of history,
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.760]   and some people are on the wrong side of history,
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.640]   and you have to destroy those people
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.040]   who are on the wrong side of history.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.760]   I mean, there is something in, you know,
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.480]   Marxism-Leninism, which, you know,
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.480]   has that kind of language and that kind of thinking.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:30.480]   But I don't think it's necessarily that way.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:34.080]   There's a wonderful historian at Berkeley
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.640]   named Martin Melia, who has written, you know,
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.600]   wrote a number of books on this subject,
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:44.600]   and he was very, very, he was convinced that the,
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:49.680]   you know, that the ideology itself, you know,
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:53.080]   played a crucial role in the murderousness
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.640]   of the Soviet regime.
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.080]   I'm not completely convinced, you know.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.600]   When I say not completely convinced,
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.640]   I think there are, you could argue it different ways,
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:05.640]   equally valid, you know, with equally valid arguments.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:10.640]   - I mean, there's something about the ideology of communism
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:15.200]   that allows you to decrease the value of human life,
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.440]   almost like this philosophy,
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.040]   if it's okay to crack a few eggs to make an omelet.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:19.880]   - Right.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:23.040]   - So maybe that, if you can reason like that,
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:26.240]   then it's easier to take the leap of,
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.460]   for the good of the country, for the good of the people,
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.640]   for the good of the world, it's okay to kill a few people.
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:36.640]   And then that's where, I wonder about the slippery slope.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.640]   - Yeah, no, no, again, you know,
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.240]   I don't think it's a slippery slope.
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:44.080]   I think it's, I think it's dangerous.
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.720]   In other words, I think it's dangerous.
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:48.640]   But I don't consider, you know,
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.680]   I don't like Marxism, Leninism any better than the next guy.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.520]   And I've lived in plenty of those systems
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.680]   to know how they can beat people down
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.500]   and how they can, you know,
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:03.280]   destroy human aspirations
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.500]   and human interaction between people.
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:11.500]   But they're not necessarily murderous systems.
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:15.620]   They are systems that contain people's autonomy,
[00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:20.000]   that force people into work and labor and lifestyles
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.840]   that they don't want to live.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.680]   I spent a lot of time, you know,
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.640]   with East Germans and Poles, you know,
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.880]   who lived in, and even in the Soviet Union,
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:34.200]   you know, in the post-Stalin period,
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.160]   where people lived lives they didn't want to live,
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.660]   you know, and didn't have the freedom to choose.
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:44.040]   And that was terrifying in and of itself.
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:46.560]   But these were not murderous systems.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:51.520]   And they, you know, ascribe to Marxism, Leninism.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.200]   - So I suppose it's important to draw the line
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:58.480]   between mass murder and genocide and mass murder
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:02.720]   versus just mass violation of human rights.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.020]   - Right, right.
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:08.800]   - And the leap to mass murder, you're saying,
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:13.240]   may be easier in some ideologies than others,
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.960]   but it's not clear that somehow one ideology
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.520]   definitely leads to mass murder and not.
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.360]   - Exactly.
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:21.080]   - I wonder how many factors, what factors,
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:24.000]   how much of it is a single charismatic leader?
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   How much of it is the conflagration
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.640]   of multiple historical events?
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:35.060]   How much of it is just dumb, the opposite of luck?
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:40.680]   Do you have a sense where if you look at a moment
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:45.680]   in history, predict, looking at the factors,
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:49.520]   whether something bad's going to happen here.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:54.080]   When you look at Iraq, when Saddam Hussein first took power,
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:57.120]   well, you could, or you can, you know,
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.680]   go even farther back in history,
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.240]   would you be able to predict?
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.200]   So you said, you already kind of answered that
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.120]   with Stalin saying there's no way you could have
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:07.000]   predicted that in the early 20s.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Is that always the case?
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.280]   You basically can't predict.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.080]   - It's pretty much always the case.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:14.960]   In other words, I mean, history is a wonderful,
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.520]   you know, discipline and way of looking at life
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.920]   and the world in retrospect, meaning it happened.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:25.000]   It happened and we know it happened.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.640]   And it's too easy to say sometimes it happened
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.720]   because it had to happen that way.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.840]   It almost never has to happen that way.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:38.660]   And, you know, things, so I very much,
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:43.820]   I'm of the school that emphasizes, you know,
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:48.820]   contingency and choice and difference and different paths
[00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:52.060]   and not, you know, not necessarily a path
[00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:54.880]   that has to be followed.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:59.900]   And those, you know, and, you know,
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.900]   sometimes you can warn about things.
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:06.100]   I mean, you can think, well, something's going to happen.
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.420]   And usually the way it works,
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:09.620]   let me just give you one example.
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.580]   I mean, I'm thinking about an example right now,
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:13.300]   which was the war in Yugoslavia, you know,
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.020]   which came in the 1990s
[00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:18.400]   and eventually ventuated in genocide in Bosnia.
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:23.220]   And, you know, I remember very clearly, you know,
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:25.860]   the 1970s and 1980s in Yugoslavia,
[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:28.300]   and people would say, you know, there's trouble here.
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:31.280]   And, you know, something could go wrong,
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.920]   but no one in their wildest imagination
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.900]   thought that there would be outright war between them all.
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.300]   Then the outright war happened, genocide happened,
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.960]   and afterwards people would say, I saw it coming.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.620]   You know, so you get a lot of that,
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:49.180]   especially with pundits and journalists and that.
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:51.060]   I saw it coming, I knew it was happening.
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:53.620]   You know, well, I mean, what happens in the human mind
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:55.660]   and it happens in your mind too is, you know,
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:58.180]   you go through a lot of alternatives.
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:00.460]   I mean, think about January 6th, you know, in this country
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:02.180]   and all the different alternatives
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:05.020]   which people had in their mind
[00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:10.020]   or before January 6th, you know, after the lost election.
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:13.180]   You know, things could have gone in lots of different ways
[00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:14.580]   and there were all kinds of people
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.300]   choosing different ways it could have gone,
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:20.020]   but nobody really knew how it was gonna turn out.
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:22.000]   Wasn't it smart people really understood
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.420]   that there'd be this Khakimimi uprising on January 6th,
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:28.980]   you know, that almost, you know, caused this enormous grief.
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:32.020]   So all of these kinds of things in history, you know,
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:33.620]   are deeply contingent.
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:37.300]   They depend on, you know, factors that we cannot predict
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:41.380]   and, you know, and it's the joy of history that it's open.
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.500]   You know, you think about how people are now,
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.020]   I mean, let me give you one more example
[00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.220]   and then I'll shut up,
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:49.700]   but, you know, there's the environmental example.
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:51.020]   You know, we're all threatened, right?
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:54.440]   We know it's coming, we know there's trouble, right?
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:58.260]   We know there's gonna be a catastrophe some point,
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.260]   but when?
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:00.980]   What's the catastrophe?
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:02.380]   - Yeah, what's the nature of the catastrophe?
[00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:03.700]   Everyone says catastrophe. - And what's the nature of it?
[00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:05.160]   Right, right, right. - Is it gonna be wars
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.380]   because of resource constraint?
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:07.380]   Is it going to be hunger?
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:10.780]   Is it gonna be like mass migration of different kinds
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:13.260]   that leads to some kind of conflict and immigration?
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:16.320]   And maybe it won't be that big of a deal
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.020]   and a total other catastrophic event
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:21.220]   will completely challenge the entirety
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.220]   of the human civilization.
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:25.120]   - That's my point, that's my point, that's my point.
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:28.100]   You know, we really don't know.
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:29.700]   I mean, there's a lot we do know.
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.060]   I mean, the warming business and all this kind of stuff,
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:34.260]   you know, it's scientifically there,
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.540]   but how it's going to play out,
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.660]   and everybody's saying different things,
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:42.980]   and then you get somewhere in 50 years or 60 years,
[00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:44.820]   which I won't see, and people say,
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:46.980]   "Aha, I told you it was gonna be X
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.420]   "or it was gonna be Y or it was gonna be Z."
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:52.080]   So I just don't think in history you can,
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:56.360]   well, you can't predict.
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.020]   You simply cannot predict what's going to happen.
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:02.260]   It's kind of when you just look at Hitler in the '30s,
[00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:07.140]   for me, oftentimes when I kind of read different accounts,
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.100]   it is so often, certainly in the press,
[00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.880]   but in general, me just reading about Hitler,
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:15.020]   I get the sense like, this is a clown.
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:18.420]   There's no way this person will gain power.
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:19.980]   - Which one, Hitler or Stalin?
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.300]   - Hitler, Hitler, Hitler.
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:24.260]   No, no, no, with Stalin, you don't get a sense he's a clown.
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:25.940]   He's a really good executive.
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:28.540]   You don't think it would lead to mass murder,
[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:32.440]   but you think he's going to build a giant bureaucracy,
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.340]   at least.
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:37.260]   With Hitler, it's like a failed artist
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.500]   who keeps screaming about stuff.
[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:42.380]   There's no way he's gonna, I mean,
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:44.820]   you certainly don't think about the atrocities,
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:47.580]   but there's no way he's going to gain power,
[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:48.860]   especially against communism.
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:50.620]   There's so many other competing forces
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:54.220]   that could have easily beat him.
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:58.940]   But then you realize event after event
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.420]   where this clown keeps dancing,
[00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:02.420]   and all of a sudden he gains more and more power,
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.980]   and just certain moments in time,
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:09.980]   he makes strategic decisions in terms of cooperating
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:13.220]   or gaining power over the military,
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.500]   all those kinds of things,
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.340]   that eventually give him the power.
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:21.580]   I mean, this clown is one of the most impactful
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:25.260]   in a negative sense human beings in history.
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:26.180]   Right?
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:28.020]   And even the Jews who are there
[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:30.580]   and are being screamed at and discriminated against,
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:33.860]   and there's a series of measures taken against them
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:36.460]   incrementally during the course of the 1930s,
[00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:39.060]   and very few who leave.
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:39.900]   Yeah.
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:40.740]   I mean, some pick up and go and say,
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.340]   I'm getting the hell out of here.
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:45.380]   And some Zionists try to leave too
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:46.860]   and go to the United States and stuff,
[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:51.660]   but go to Israel and Palestine at the time,
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:55.580]   but, or to Britain or France.
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:58.540]   But in general, even the Jews
[00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:01.540]   who should have been very sensitive to what was going on,
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:06.140]   didn't really understand the extent of the danger.
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:08.940]   And it's really hard for people to do that.
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:12.100]   It's almost impossible, in fact, I think.
[00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:15.080]   So most of the time in that exact situation,
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.360]   nothing would have happened,
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.240]   or there'd be some drama and so on,
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.240]   and be there some bureaucrat.
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.840]   But every once in a while in human history,
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.880]   there's a kind of turn,
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:28.720]   and maybe something catalyzes something else
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:31.080]   and just it accelerates, it accelerates,
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:34.040]   escalates, escalates, and then war breaks out
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.800]   or totally, you know, revolutions break out.
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:38.640]   Right.
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:43.560]   Can we go to the big question of genocide?
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.880]   What is genocide?
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.440]   What are the defining characteristics of genocide?
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:50.560]   Dealing with genocide is a difficult thing
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.300]   when it comes to the definition.
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:58.520]   There is a definition, the December 1948 UN Convention
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:02.240]   on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:07.240]   is considered the sort of major document of definition
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.680]   and the definitional sense of genocide.
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.040]   And it emphasizes, you know,
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:16.440]   the intentional destruction, you know,
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:21.440]   of an ethnic, national, racial, or religious group.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:26.680]   Those are the four groups again, comma as such.
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:27.920]   And what that means basically
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:31.920]   is destroying the group as a group.
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:36.760]   In other words, there's a kind of beauty in human diversity
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.600]   and different groups of people, you know,
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:43.520]   Estonians, you know, a tribe of Native Americans,
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:48.520]   South African tribes, you know, the Rohingya in Myanmar.
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:52.220]   There's a kind of beauty humanity recognizes
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:54.600]   in the distinctiveness of those groups.
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:58.100]   You know, this was a notion that emerges really
[00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:00.960]   with Romanticism after the French Revolution
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:04.520]   in the beginning of the 19th century with Herder mostly.
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:08.920]   And this beauty of these groups then, you know,
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:12.560]   is what is under attack in genocide.
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:15.920]   And it's with intent.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:19.880]   You know, the idea is that it's intentional destruction.
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:24.880]   So this is a kind of, you know, analogy to first degree,
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.160]   second degree, and third degree murder, right?
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:28.320]   First degree murder, you know,
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:31.240]   you're out to kill this person and you plan it
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:34.240]   and you go out and you do it, right?
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:36.120]   That's intent, right?
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:37.840]   Manslaughter is not intent.
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:41.000]   You end up doing the same thing, but it's different.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   So, you know, the major person behind the definition
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.080]   is a man named Raphael Lemkin.
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:50.400]   I don't know if you heard his name or not,
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:55.200]   but he was a Polish Jewish jurist who came, you know,
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:58.360]   from Poland, came to the United States during the war
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:03.360]   and had been a kind of crusader for recognizing genocide.
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:08.620]   It's a word that he created by the way.
[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:11.300]   And he coined the term in 1943
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:14.900]   and then published it in 1944 for the first time.
[00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:18.060]   Geno meaning people and side meaning killing, right?
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:20.900]   And so Lemkin then had this term
[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:23.380]   and he pushed hard to have it recognized
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:24.940]   and it was in the UN convention.
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.340]   So that's the rough definition.
[00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:30.500]   The problem with it is the definition,
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:32.980]   the problems with the definition are several.
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:38.460]   You know, one of them is, is it just these four groups,
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:42.340]   you know, racial, religious, ethnic, or national?
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:44.620]   See, this comes right out of the war.
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:49.500]   And what's in people's minds in 1948 are Jews, Poles,
[00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:53.060]   Russians, Yugoslavs sometimes who were killed by the Nazis.
[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:54.580]   That's what's in their mind.
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:56.980]   But there are other groups too, if you think about it,
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:01.420]   you know, who are killed, social groups or political groups.
[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:05.260]   And that was not allowed in the convention,
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:07.940]   meaning for a lot of different reasons,
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:10.780]   the Soviets were primary among them.
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.860]   They didn't want other kinds of groups.
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:16.660]   Let's say Kulaks, for example, to be considered.
[00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:21.500]   That's a social group or peasants, which is a social group.
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:23.140]   So, or a political group.
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:26.620]   I mean, let's take a group, you know,
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:30.340]   communists killed groups of people,
[00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:32.500]   but non-communists also killed groups of people.
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:36.260]   In Indonesia in 1965, '66, they killed, you know,
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:37.100]   I don't know exactly,
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:40.100]   but roughly 600,000 Indonesian communists.
[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:42.500]   Well, is that genocide or not?
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.260]   You know, and my point of view, it is genocide,
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:48.380]   although it's Indonesians killing Indonesians.
[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:51.060]   And we have the same problem with the Cambodian genocide.
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:53.860]   I mean, we talk about a Cambodian genocide,
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:56.940]   but most of the people killed in the Cambodian genocide
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.620]   were other Cambodians.
[00:42:58.620 --> 00:42:59.660]   They give it the name,
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:02.060]   they're ready to recognize this genocide
[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:04.340]   because they also killed some other peoples,
[00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:08.780]   meaning the Vietnamese, Akham people who are, you know,
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:13.780]   Muslim, smaller Muslim people in the area, and a few others.
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:17.460]   So the question then becomes,
[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:20.260]   well, does it have to be a different nationality
[00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:23.100]   or ethnic group or religious group for it to be genocide?
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.740]   And my answer is no.
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:26.420]   You know, you need to expand the definition.
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:28.060]   It's a little bit like with our constitution.
[00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:29.860]   We got a constitution,
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:32.020]   but we don't live in the end of the 18th century, right?
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:33.620]   We live in the 21st century.
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:36.620]   And so you have to update the constitution
[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:38.140]   over the centuries.
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:42.660]   And similarly, the genocide convention needs updating too.
[00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:45.100]   So that's how I work with the definition.
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:47.180]   - So this is this invention.
[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:51.060]   Was it an invention, this beautiful idea,
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:53.500]   romantic idea that there's groups of people
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:57.660]   and the group is united by some unique characteristics?
[00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:01.580]   That was an invention in human history, this idea?
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:02.420]   Not the CS individuals?
[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:05.180]   - Yes, in some senses it was.
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:06.740]   I mean, it's not, you know,
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.380]   there are things that are always constructed
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:10.660]   in one fashion or another,
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:13.220]   and the construction, you know,
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:15.860]   more or less represents the reality.
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:18.540]   And what the reality is always much more complicated
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:21.940]   than the construction or the invention of a term
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:26.420]   or a concept or a way of thinking about a nation, right?
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:29.740]   And this way of thinking of nations, you know,
[00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:34.740]   as again, you know, groups of religious, linguistic,
[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:40.140]   not political necessarily,
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:43.340]   but cultural entities is something
[00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:45.500]   that was essentially invented, yes.
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:47.460]   - Yes, I mean, you know, if you look at--
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:50.380]   - There are no Germans in the 17th century.
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:52.740]   There are no Italians in the 17th century, right?
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:54.860]   They're only there after, you know,
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:59.340]   the invention of the nation, which comes again,
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.900]   mostly as out of the French Revolution
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.700]   and in the Romantic movement,
[00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:08.420]   a man named Johann Gottfried von Herder, right?
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:10.380]   Who was the, really the first one
[00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:13.100]   who sort of went around, collected people's languages
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:15.660]   and collected their sayings and their dances
[00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:17.740]   and their folkways and stuff and said,
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:20.620]   "Isn't this cool, you know, that they're Estonians
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:23.140]   and that they're Latvians and that they're these other,
[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:25.900]   these interesting different peoples
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:28.420]   who don't even know necessarily
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:30.620]   that they're different peoples, right?"
[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:33.100]   That comes a little bit later, right?
[00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:35.020]   Once the concept is invented,
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:38.660]   then people start to say, "Hey, we're nations too."
[00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:40.820]   You know, and the Germans decide they're a nation
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:43.900]   and they unify and the Italians discover they're a nation
[00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:46.260]   and they unify instead of being, you know,
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:51.100]   Florentines and Romans and, you know, Sicilians.
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:55.340]   - But then beyond nations, there's political affiliations,
[00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:56.180]   all those kinds of things.
[00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:58.260]   It's fascinating that, you know,
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:01.580]   you start, you look at the early Homo sapiens
[00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:04.220]   and then there's obviously tribes, right?
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:06.660]   And then that's very concrete,
[00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:08.500]   that's a geographic location,
[00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:10.700]   and it's a small group of people.
[00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.940]   And then you have warring tribes probably connected
[00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:16.140]   to just limited resources.
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.580]   But it's fascinating to think that that is then taken
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:20.780]   to the space of ideas,
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:23.380]   to where you can create a group at first
[00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:26.980]   to appreciate its beauty.
[00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:29.980]   You create a group based on language,
[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:34.300]   based on maybe even, so political philosophical ideas,
[00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:36.340]   religious ideas, all those kinds of things.
[00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:38.540]   And then that naturally then leads
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:41.460]   to getting angry at groups.
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:42.300]   - Right.
[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.900]   - And making them the other and then hatred.
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:44.740]   - Right.
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:47.660]   - And that comes more towards the end of the 19th century,
[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:50.100]   you know, with the influence of Darwin.
[00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:51.940]   I mean, you can't blame Darwin for it,
[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:54.300]   but Neo-Darwin, Darwinians, you know,
[00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:55.860]   who start to talk about, you know,
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:58.100]   the competition between nations,
[00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:01.260]   the natural competition, the weak ones fall away,
[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:03.220]   the strong ones get ahead.
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.500]   You know, you get this sort of combination also
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.420]   with, you know, modern antisemitism
[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:09.980]   and with racial thinking, you know,
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:12.420]   the racial thinking at the end of the 19th century
[00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:14.060]   is very powerful.
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:16.820]   So now, you know, at the end of the 19th century
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:19.780]   versus the beginning of the 19th, you know,
[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:22.580]   the middle of the 19th century, you know,
[00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:24.020]   you can be a German and be a Jew
[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:26.220]   and there's no contradiction.
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:27.060]   - Yeah.
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:28.900]   - As long as you speak the language and you, you know,
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:32.420]   you dress and think and act and share the culture.
[00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:34.140]   By the end of the 19th century, people are saying,
[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:37.100]   no, no, you know, they're not Germans.
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:37.940]   They're Jews, they're different.
[00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:39.260]   They have different blood, they have different,
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:41.220]   they don't say genes yet, but you know,
[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:43.740]   that sort of a sense of people.
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:45.420]   And that's when, you know,
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:49.220]   there's this sense of superiority too and inferiority.
[00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:50.060]   - Yeah.
[00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:51.700]   - You know, that they're inferior to us.
[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:52.540]   - Yeah.
[00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:55.380]   - You know, and that we're the strong ones
[00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:57.460]   and we have to, you know, and Hitler, by the way,
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:00.260]   just adopts this hook, line, and sinker.
[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:03.020]   I mean, there are a whole series of thinkers
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:05.100]   at the end of the 19th and beginning of 20th century
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:06.900]   who he cites in Mein Kampf, you know,
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:09.300]   which is written in the early 1920s,
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:14.300]   that, you know, basically pervades this racial thinking.
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:16.740]   So nationalism changes.
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:19.820]   So nationalism in and of itself is not bad.
[00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:22.620]   I mean, it's not bad, you know, to share culture
[00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:26.140]   and language and, you know, folkways
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:29.900]   and a sense of common belonging.
[00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:32.740]   There's nothing bad about it inherently.
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:35.500]   But then what happens is it becomes, you know,
[00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:39.580]   frequently is used and becomes, especially on fascism,
[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:42.340]   becomes dangerous.
[00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:44.540]   - And then it's especially dangerous
[00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:48.940]   when the two conflicting groups share geographic location.
[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:49.780]   - That's right.
[00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:54.220]   - So like with Jews, you know, I come, you know,
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:58.740]   I'm a Russian Jew and it's always interesting.
[00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:03.740]   I take pride in, you know, I love the tradition
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:07.500]   of the Soviet Union, of Russia.
[00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:08.540]   I love America.
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:10.140]   So I love these countries.
[00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:13.340]   They have a beautiful tradition in literature and science
[00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:15.380]   and art and all those kinds of things.
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:19.300]   But it's funny that people, not often,
[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:24.060]   but sometimes correct me that I'm not Russian.
[00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:24.900]   I'm a Jew.
[00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:30.060]   And it's a nice reminder.
[00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:31.060]   - Yes.
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:33.640]   - That that is always there.
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:37.320]   That desire to create these groups.
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:39.840]   And then when they're living in the same place
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:42.160]   for that division between groups,
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:45.080]   that hate between groups can explode.
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:49.600]   And I just, I wonder why is that there?
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:53.480]   Why does the human heart tend so easily
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:55.600]   towards this kind of hate?
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:50:02.640]   - You know, that's a big question in and of itself.
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:04.880]   You know, the human heart is full of everything, right?
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:06.720]   It's full of hate, it's full of love,
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.760]   it's full of indifference, it's full of apathy,
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:10.760]   it's full of energy.
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:14.980]   So, I mean, hate is something, you know, that,
[00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:22.720]   I mean, I think, and, you know, along with hate,
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:26.320]   you know, the ability to really hurt and injure people
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:28.320]   is something that's within all of us.
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:30.400]   You know, it's within all of us.
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:33.480]   And it's just something that's part of who we are
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:37.920]   and part of our society.
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:40.040]   So, you know, we're shaped by our society
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:43.420]   and our society can do with us often what it wishes.
[00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:46.440]   You know, that's why it's so much nicer
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:49.840]   to live in a more or less beneficent society
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:52.560]   like that of a democracy in the West
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:55.120]   than to live in the Soviet Union, right?
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:59.080]   I mean, because, you know, you have more or less
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:01.840]   the freedom to do what you wish
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:04.440]   and not to be forced into situations
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:08.660]   in which you would have to then do nasty to other people.
[00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:12.760]   Some societies, as we talked about, you know,
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:17.000]   are more, have proclivities towards, you know,
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.960]   asking of its people to do things they don't want to do
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:24.440]   and forcing them to do so.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:27.880]   So, you know, freedom is a wonderful thing
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:30.920]   to be able to choose not to do evil is a great thing.
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:33.940]   You know, whereas in some societies, you know,
[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:38.940]   you feel in some ways for, not so much for the NKVD bosses,
[00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:42.000]   but for the guys on the ground, you know, in the 1930s
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.880]   or not so much for the Nazi bosses,
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:49.120]   but for the guys, you know, in the police battalion
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:53.800]   that were told go shoot those Jews, you know?
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:57.280]   And you do it, not necessarily
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:59.680]   because they force you to do it,
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:04.100]   but because your social, you know, your social situation,
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:07.640]   you know, encourages you to,
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:10.000]   and you don't have the courage not to.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.560]   - Yeah, I was just, as I often do,
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:15.960]   rereading Viktor Frankl's "Man's Search for Meaning,"
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:19.160]   and he said something, I just,
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:21.260]   I often pull out sort of lines.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:25.160]   "The mere knowledge that a man was either a camp guard
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:28.320]   or a prisoner tells us almost nothing.
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:31.160]   Human kindness can be found in all groups,
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:36.160]   even those which as a whole, it would be easy to condemn."
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:41.200]   So that's speaking to, you feel for those people
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:45.840]   at the lowest level implementing the orders
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:49.800]   of those above.
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:50.640]   - Right.
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:53.400]   - And also you worry yourself,
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:56.320]   what will happen if you were given those same orders?
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:59.040]   You know, I mean, what would you do?
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:01.720]   You know, what kind of reaction would you have
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:03.360]   in this similar situation?
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:05.900]   And, you know, you don't know.
[00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:10.360]   - I could see myself in World War II
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:15.360]   while fighting for almost any country that I was born in.
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:18.800]   There's a love of community.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:21.000]   There's a love of country that's just,
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.160]   at least to me, it comes naturally.
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:27.240]   Just love of community, and countries want such community.
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:29.480]   And I could see fighting for that country,
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:32.320]   especially when you're sold a story
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:33.640]   that you're fighting evil,
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:35.320]   and I'm sure every single country
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:38.520]   was sold that story effectively.
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:41.280]   And then when you're in the military
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:42.360]   and you have a gun in your hand
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:47.360]   or you're in the police force and you're ordered,
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:52.600]   go to this place and commit violence,
[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:55.400]   it's hard to know what you would do.
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:56.520]   It's a mix of fear.
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:00.700]   It's a mix of, maybe you convince yourself,
[00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:03.480]   you know, what can one person really do?
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:05.840]   And over time, it's again, that slippery slope.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:09.000]   'Cause you could see all the people who protest,
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.600]   who revolt, they're ineffective.
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:17.440]   So like, if you actually want to practically help somehow,
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:18.560]   you're going to convince yourself
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:21.060]   that you can't, one person can't possibly help.
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:24.120]   And then you have a family, so you want to make,
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:25.480]   you know, you want to protect your family.
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:28.000]   You tell all of these stories, and over time,
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.560]   you naturally convince yourself to dehumanize the other.
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:35.200]   Yeah, I think about this a lot,
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:41.520]   mostly because I worry that I wouldn't be a good German.
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:44.600]   - Yeah, no, no, that's right, that's right.
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:48.440]   And one of the, you know, one of my tasks as a teacher,
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:52.080]   right, of our students, and I have, you know,
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:54.420]   classes on genocide, I have one now,
[00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:57.820]   and another one, by the way, on Stalin.
[00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:01.120]   But the one on genocide, you know,
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:05.320]   one of my tasks is to try to get the students
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:07.200]   to understand this is not about weird people
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:10.940]   who live far away in time and in place,
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:12.600]   but it's about them, you know?
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:15.280]   And that, you know, that's a hard lesson,
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.080]   but it's an important one, you know,
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:20.520]   that this is in all of us, you know, it's in all of us.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.760]   And there's nothing, you know,
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:25.600]   and you just try to gurge yourself up, you know,
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:29.420]   to try to figure out ways that maybe you won't be complicit,
[00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:33.600]   and that you learn how to stand by your principles,
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:36.160]   but it's very hard, it's extremely difficult.
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:38.680]   And you can't, the other interesting thing about it
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:40.320]   is it's not predictable.
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:43.360]   Now, they've done a lot of studies of Poles, for example,
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:45.840]   who during the war saved Jews, you know?
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:47.800]   Well, who are the Poles who saved Jews
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:50.060]   versus those who turned them in?
[00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:51.780]   It's completely unpredictable.
[00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:53.820]   You know, sometimes it's the worst anti-Semites
[00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:55.400]   who protect them because they don't believe
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:57.520]   they should be killed, right?
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:01.160]   And sometimes, you know, it's not predictable.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:04.280]   It's not as if the humanists among us, you know,
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:09.280]   are the ones who, you know, consistently show up, you know,
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:14.040]   and experience danger, in other words,
[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:15.720]   and are ready to take on danger
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:18.920]   to defend, you know, your fellow human beings.
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:19.840]   Not necessarily.
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:21.560]   I mean, sometimes simple people do it,
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:24.800]   and sometimes they do it for really simple reasons.
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:28.540]   And sometimes people you would expect to do it don't,
[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:31.080]   you know, and you've got that mix,
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:32.580]   and it's just not predictable.
[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:37.280]   - One thing I've learned in this age of social media
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:39.840]   is it feels like the people with integrity
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:41.940]   and the ones who would do the right thing
[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:43.240]   are the quiet ones.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:46.880]   In terms of humanists, in terms of activists,
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:49.040]   there's so many points to be gained
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:52.700]   of declaring that you would do the right thing.
[00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:57.500]   It's the simple, quiet folks.
[00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:01.320]   Because I've seen quite, on a small,
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:03.520]   obviously much smaller scale,
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:05.920]   just shows of integrity and character
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:07.360]   when there were sacrifices to be made
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:09.400]   and it was done quietly.
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:11.640]   Now, this sort of the small heroes,
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:15.640]   those are, you're right, it's surprising,
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:17.240]   but they're often quiet.
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:18.920]   That's why I'm distrustful of people
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:21.720]   who kind of proclaim that they would do the right thing.
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:25.520]   - And there are different kinds of integrity, too.
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:30.460]   I mean, I edited a memoir of a Polish,
[00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:34.960]   you know, underground fighter,
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:37.200]   member of the underground who was in Majdanek,
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:38.920]   in the concentration camp of Majdanek,
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:41.200]   you know, and it was just an interesting mix
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:43.560]   of different kinds of integrity.
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.200]   You know, on the one hand,
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:50.360]   you know, it really bothered him deeply
[00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:52.860]   when Jews were killed or sent to camp
[00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:53.700]   or that sort of thing.
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:56.840]   On the other hand, he was something of an anti-Semite.
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:59.700]   You know, he would, you know,
[00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:02.840]   sometimes if Jews were his friends, he would help them.
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:06.360]   And if they weren't, sometimes he was really mean to them.
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:08.200]   You know, and you could, in their various levels,
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:11.480]   you know, a concentration camp is, you know,
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:15.540]   a terrible social experiment in some ways, right?
[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:19.960]   But you learn a lot from how people behave.
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:21.320]   And what you see is that, you know,
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:24.040]   people behave sometimes extraordinarily well
[00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:26.700]   in some situations and extraordinarily poorly in others.
[00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:28.760]   And it's mixed and you can't predict it.
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:32.420]   And it's hard to find consistency.
[00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:33.480]   I mean, that's the other thing.
[00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:37.160]   It's, you know, I think we claim too much consistency
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:38.440]   for the people we study
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:40.400]   and the people we think about in the past.
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:42.640]   You know, they're not consistent anymore than we are,
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:43.620]   consistent, right?
[00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:46.920]   - Well, let me ask you about human nature here
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:48.040]   on both sides.
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:53.040]   So first, what have you learned about human nature
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:54.720]   from studying genocide?
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:56.840]   Why do humans commit genocide?
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:01.560]   What lessons, first of all, why is a difficult question,
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:04.840]   but what insights do you have into humans
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:07.800]   that genocide is something that happens in the world?
[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:10.360]   - That's a really big and difficult question, right?
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:13.880]   And it has to be parsed, I think,
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:16.400]   into different kinds of questions.
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.760]   You know, why does genocide happen?
[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:24.380]   You know, which the answer there is frequently political,
[00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:28.960]   meaning, you know, why Hitler ended up killing the Jews.
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:32.020]   Well, it had a lot to do with the political history
[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:35.360]   of Germany and wartime history of Germany, right?
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:37.640]   In the '30s.
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:40.480]   And, you know, it's traceable to then.
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:42.960]   No, like you mentioned it yourself.
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:46.040]   You can't imagine Hitler in the mid '20s
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:50.440]   turning into anything of the kind of dictator he ended up
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:53.160]   being and the kind of murderer,
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:55.520]   mass murderer he ended up being.
[00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:58.880]   So, and the same thing goes, by the way,
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:01.280]   for Stalin and Soviet Union and Pol Pot.
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:04.800]   I mean, these are all essentially political movements
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:08.160]   where the polity, state is seized, you know,
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:12.960]   by a ideological or, you know, party,
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:15.800]   single party movement, and then is moved in directions
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:18.520]   where mass killing takes place.
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:22.620]   The other question, let's separate that question out.
[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:26.780]   The other question is why do ordinary people participate?
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:31.060]   Because the fact of the matter is,
[01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:33.780]   just ordering genocide is not enough.
[01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:36.620]   Just saying, you know, go get them is not enough.
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:39.100]   There have to be people who will cooperate
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:41.420]   and who will do their jobs, you know,
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:43.060]   both at the kind of mezzo level,
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:45.340]   the middle level of a bureaucracy,
[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:47.060]   but also at the everyday level.
[01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:48.700]   You know, people who have to pull the triggers
[01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:50.380]   and that kind of thing, and, you know,
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:52.220]   force people into the gas chamber.
[01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:56.740]   And grab people, you know, in Kiev in September, 1941,
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:59.100]   at Babi Yar and push them, you know,
[01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:02.020]   towards the ravine where the machine gunners
[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:03.900]   are gonna shoot them down.
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:06.740]   You know, and those are all sorts of different questions.
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:11.580]   The question of, you know, especially the lower level,
[01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:13.820]   people who actually do the killing,
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:15.980]   is a question which I think we've been talking about,
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:19.620]   which is that within all of us, you know,
[01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:21.980]   is the capability of being murderers.
[01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:23.140]   And mass murderers, I mean,
[01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:25.460]   to participate in mass murder.
[01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:27.860]   I won't call them laws of social psychology,
[01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:31.220]   but the character of social psychology.
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:33.380]   You know, we will do it in most cases.
[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:35.700]   I mean, one of the shocking things that I learned
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:38.980]   just a few years ago, studying the Holocaust,
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:41.860]   is that you could pull out.
[01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:44.340]   In other words, if they order a police battalion
[01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:47.660]   to go shoot Jews, you didn't have to do it.
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:49.660]   You could pull out.
[01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:51.500]   They weren't gonna, they never killed anybody.
[01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.260]   They never executed anybody.
[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:54.860]   They never even punished people for saying,
[01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:56.420]   no, I'm not gonna do that.
[01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:59.540]   So people are doing it voluntarily.
[01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:01.980]   They may not want to do it.
[01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:04.620]   You know, they give them booze to try to, you know,
[01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:09.100]   numb the pain of murder, 'cause they know there is pain.
[01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:12.500]   I mean, people experience pain when they murder people.
[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:14.700]   But they don't pull out.
[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:17.620]   And so it's the character of who we are in society,
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:21.060]   in groups, and we're very, very influenced.
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:22.700]   I mean, we're highly influenced
[01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:25.620]   by the groups in which we operate,
[01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:30.020]   and who we talk to, and who our friends are
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:32.860]   within that group, and who is the head of the group.
[01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:34.740]   And I mean, you see this even,
[01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:36.460]   I mean, you see it in any group,
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:39.680]   whether it's in the academy, right, at Stanford,
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:42.340]   or whether it's in a labor union,
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:45.020]   or whether it's in a church group in Tennessee,
[01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:49.220]   or wherever, you know, people pay attention to each other,
[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:53.380]   and they are unwilling frequently to say,
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:56.260]   "No, this is wrong."
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:58.260]   Even though all of you think it's right, it's wrong.
[01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:00.900]   I mean, they just don't do that usually,
[01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:05.900]   especially in societies that are authoritarian,
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:08.100]   or totalitarian, right?
[01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:10.940]   Because it's harder, 'cause there's a backup to it, right?
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:13.380]   There's the NKVD there, or there's the Gestapo there,
[01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:14.780]   and there are other people there.
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:18.900]   So you just, you know, they may not be forcing you to do it,
[01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:23.900]   but your social being, plus this danger in the distance,
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:28.460]   you know, you do it.
[01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:31.260]   - But then if you go up the hierarchy,
[01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:33.460]   at the very top, there's a dictator,
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:36.340]   presumably, you know, you go to like middle management,
[01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:37.520]   to the bureaucracy.
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:41.140]   The higher you get up there,
[01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:43.740]   the more power you have to change
[01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:45.540]   the direction of the Titanic.
[01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:46.960]   - Right, right, right.
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.580]   - But nobody seems to do it, right?
[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:52.580]   - Or what happens, and it does happen,
[01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:54.620]   it happens in the German army,
[01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:57.660]   I mean, it happens in the case of the Armenian genocide,
[01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.160]   where we know there are governors who said,
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.380]   "No, I'm not gonna kill Armenians,
[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:02.460]   "what kind of business is this?"
[01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:03.660]   They're just removed.
[01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:07.900]   They're removed, and you find a replacement very easily.
[01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:10.580]   So, you know, you do see people who stand up,
[01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:13.700]   and again, it's not really predictable who it will be.
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:15.980]   I would maintain, I mean, I haven't done the study
[01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:19.220]   of the Armenian governors who said no,
[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:21.140]   I mean, the Turkish governors who said no
[01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:24.500]   to the Armenian genocide, but you know,
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:30.040]   there are people who do step aside every once in a while,
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.420]   in the middle level, and again,
[01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:32.520]   they're German generals who say,
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.340]   "Wait a minute, what is this business in Poland
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:37.920]   "when they start to kill Jews, or in Belarusia?"
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:40.420]   And you know, they're just pushed aside.
[01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:42.980]   You know, if they don't do their job, they're pushed aside.
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:44.060]   Or they end up doing it,
[01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:45.900]   and they usually do end up doing it.
[01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:49.700]   - What about on the victim side?
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:51.700]   So I mentioned man's search for meaning.
[01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:55.340]   What can we learn about human nature,
[01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:59.620]   the human mind, from the victims of genocide?
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:02.340]   So Viktor Frankl talked about the ability
[01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:05.980]   to discover meaning and beauty, even in suffering.
[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:10.140]   Is there something to be said about, you know,
[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:11.700]   in your studying of genocide
[01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.660]   that you've learned about human nature?
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:19.420]   - Well, again, I don't, I have to say,
[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:21.140]   I come out of the study of genocide
[01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:24.340]   with a very pessimistic view of human nature,
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:25.740]   a very pessimistic view.
[01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:26.900]   - Even on the victim side?
[01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:28.940]   - Even on the victim side.
[01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:33.620]   I mean, the victims will eat their children, right?
[01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:36.080]   Ukrainian case, they have no choice.
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.740]   You know, the victims will rob each other.
[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:43.740]   The victims will form hierarchies within victimhood.
[01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:46.740]   So you see, let me give you an example.
[01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:49.940]   Again, I told you I was working on Majdanek.
[01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:55.860]   And there's, in Majdanek, at a certain point in '42,
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:06:02.340]   a group of Slovak Jews were arrested and sent to Majdanek.
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:08.420]   Those Slovak Jews were a group,
[01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:10.260]   somehow, I mean, they stuck together.
[01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:11.460]   They were very competent.
[01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:14.900]   Many of them were businessmen.
[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:16.460]   They knew each other.
[01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:19.900]   And for a variety of different reasons within the camp,
[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:22.340]   and again, this shows you the diversity of the camps,
[01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:24.580]   and also, you know, these images of black and white
[01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:26.780]   in the camps are not very useful.
[01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:29.060]   They ruled the camp.
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:31.160]   I mean, they basically had all the important jobs
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:35.780]   in the camp, including jobs like beating other Jews.
[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:40.620]   And persecuting other Jews, and persecuting other peoples,
[01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:43.540]   which they did.
[01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:46.340]   And this Polish guy who I mentioned to you,
[01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:48.740]   who wrote this memoir, hated them
[01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:53.740]   because of what they were doing to the Poles, right?
[01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:57.520]   And he's incensed,
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:01.180]   because aren't these supposed to be the intervention,
[01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:02.680]   he says, and look what they're doing.
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:06.200]   They're treating us, you know, like dirt.
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:08.780]   And they do, they treat them like dirt.
[01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:11.440]   So, you know, in this kind of work on Majdanek,
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:16.000]   there's certainly parts of it that, you know,
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.040]   were inspiring.
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:20.840]   You know, people helping each other.
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:23.080]   People trying to feed each other.
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.920]   People giving warmth to each other.
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:30.400]   You know, there's some very heroic Polish women
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:33.760]   who end up having a radio show called Radio Majdanek,
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:36.440]   which they put on every night in the women's camp.
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:39.400]   Which is, you know, to raise people's spirits.
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.400]   And they, you know, sing songs,
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:43.040]   and do all this kind of stuff, you know,
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:47.940]   to try to keep themselves from, you know,
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:51.080]   the horrors that they're experiencing around them.
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:54.680]   And so you do see that, and you do see, you know,
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:59.680]   human beings acting in support of each other.
[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:05.440]   But, you know, I mean, Primo Levi is one of my
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:08.800]   favorite writers about the Holocaust,
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:10.360]   and about the camps.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:14.320]   And, you know, I don't think Primo Levi saw anything.
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:17.400]   You know, I mean, he had pals, you know,
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:20.080]   who he helped, and who helped him.
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:25.080]   I mean, but he describes this kind of, you know,
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:27.520]   terrible inhuman environment,
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.440]   which no one can escape, really.
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.440]   No one can escape.
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:31.920]   He ends up committing suicide, too,
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:35.960]   I think because of his sense of,
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:37.480]   we don't know exactly why,
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:40.820]   but probably because of his sense of what happened
[01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:41.660]   in the camp.
[01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:42.880]   I mean, later he goes back to Italy,
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:44.600]   becomes a writer, that sort of thing.
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:49.360]   So I don't, especially in the concentration camps,
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:52.960]   it's really hard to find places like Wickel-Frankl,
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.440]   where you can say, you know,
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:59.440]   I am moved in a positive way,
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:02.640]   you know, by what happened.
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.280]   There were cases, there's no question.
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:06.360]   People hung together, they tried to help each other,
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:11.360]   but, you know, they were totally, totally caught
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:15.760]   in this web of genocide.
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:17.520]   - See, so there are stories,
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.960]   but the thing is, I have this sense,
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:22.900]   maybe it's a hope, that within most,
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:24.440]   if not every human heart,
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:29.440]   there's a kind of like flame of compassion
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:34.840]   and kindness and love that waits,
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:37.280]   that longs to connect with others,
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:41.040]   that ultimately, en masse, overpowers everything else.
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.400]   If you just look at the story of human history,
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:49.360]   the resistance to violence and mass murder and genocide
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:52.900]   feels like a force that's there.
[01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:57.200]   And it feels like a force that's more powerful
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:02.200]   than whatever the dark momentum that leads to genocide is.
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:07.720]   It feels like that's more powerful.
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:08.720]   It's just quiet.
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.720]   It's hard to tell the story of that little flame
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:14.060]   that burns within all of our hearts,
[01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:16.560]   that longing to connect to other human beings.
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:18.920]   And there's something also about human nature,
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:21.600]   and us as storytellers, that we're not very good
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:24.040]   at telling the stories of that little flame.
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:27.040]   We're much better at telling the stories of atrocities.
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:31.320]   - No, I think maybe I fundamentally disagree with you.
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:32.600]   I think maybe I fundamentally,
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:35.260]   I don't disagree that there is that flame.
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:38.920]   I just think it's just too easily doused.
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:43.360]   And I think it too easily goes out in a lot of people.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:48.360]   And I mean, like I say, I come away from this work
[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:50.840]   a pessimist.
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:54.640]   You know, there is this work by a Harvard psychologist,
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:55.480]   now I'm forgetting his name.
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:56.560]   - Steven Pinker.
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:00.280]   - Yes, yes, Steven Pinker that shows over time,
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:03.420]   and initially I was quite skeptical of the work,
[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:05.820]   but in the end I thought he was quite convincing
[01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:12.200]   that over time the incidence of homicide goes down,
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:14.880]   the incidence of rape goes down,
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:18.880]   the incidence of genocide, except for the big blip,
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:22.280]   you know, in the middle of the 20th century goes down.
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:24.840]   Not markedly, but it goes down generally,
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:28.380]   that norms, international norms are changing
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:30.120]   how we think about this and stuff like that.
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:33.080]   I thought he was pretty convincing about that.
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:37.240]   But think about, you know, we're modern people.
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:42.000]   I mean, we've advanced so fast in so many different areas.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.200]   I mean, we should have eliminated this a long time ago,
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.420]   a long time ago.
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:50.880]   You know, how is it that, you know,
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:54.400]   we're still facing this business of genocide in Myanmar,
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:59.400]   in Xinjiang, in, you know, Tigray, in Ethiopia,
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:02.560]   you know, the potentials of genocide there,
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.280]   and all over the world, you know,
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:08.320]   we still have this thing that we cannot handle,
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:10.240]   that we can't deal with.
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:14.400]   And, you know, again, you know, electric cars and planes
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:16.840]   that fly from here to, you know, Beijing.
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:21.280]   Think about the differences between 250 years ago
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:23.960]   or 300 years ago and today.
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:26.800]   But the differences in genocide are not all that great.
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.720]   I mean, the incidence has gone down.
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:30.440]   I think Pinker has demonstrated,
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:32.860]   I mean, there are problems with his methodology,
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:35.460]   but on the whole, I'm with him on that book.
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:38.960]   I thought in the end it was quite well done.
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:43.640]   So, you know, I do not,
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:46.720]   I have to say I'm not an optimist
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:48.960]   about what this human flame can do.
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:52.880]   And, you know, I once, someone once said to me,
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:56.300]   when I posed a similar kind of question to a seminar,
[01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:57.960]   a friend of mine at Berkeley once said,
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:00.640]   remember original sin, Norman?
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:02.660]   Well, I don't, you know, that's very Catholic,
[01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:07.320]   and I don't really think in terms of original sin.
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.080]   But in some ways, you know,
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:11.600]   her point is we carry this with us.
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:15.000]   You know, we carry with us a really
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:20.220]   potentially nasty mean streak
[01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:22.360]   that can do harm to other people.
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:24.640]   - But we carry the capacity to love too.
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:25.560]   - Yes, we do.
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:26.400]   Yes, we do.
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.520]   That's part of the deal.
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:32.120]   - You have a bias in that you have studied
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.880]   some of the darker aspects of human nature
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.560]   and human history.
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:41.000]   So it is difficult from the trenches,
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.000]   from the muck to see a possible sort of way out through love.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.500]   But it's not obvious that that's not the case.
[01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:54.800]   You mentioned electric cars and rockets and airplanes.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:58.840]   To me, the more powerful thing is Wikipedia, the internet.
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:02.400]   Only 50% of the world currently has access to the internet,
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:05.900]   but that's growing in information and knowledge and wisdom,
[01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:08.200]   especially among women in the world.
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:12.680]   As that grows, I think it becomes a lot more difficult
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:13.840]   if love wins.
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:16.120]   It becomes a lot more difficult for somebody like Hitler
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.400]   to take power, for genocide to occur,
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:22.360]   because people think, and the masses, I think,
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:26.160]   the people have power when they're able to think,
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:28.160]   when they can see the full kind of...
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:34.040]   First of all, when they can study your work,
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:36.340]   they can know about the fact that genocide happens,
[01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:40.500]   how it occurs, how the promises of great charismatic leaders
[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:44.820]   lead to great destructive mass genocide.
[01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:48.940]   And just even studying the fact that the Holocaust happened
[01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:50.860]   for a large number of people
[01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:55.100]   is a powerful preventer of future genocide.
[01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:57.620]   Like one of the lessons of history
[01:14:57.620 --> 01:14:59.980]   is just knowing that this can happen,
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:01.580]   learning how it happens,
[01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:06.580]   that normal human beings, leaders that give big promises
[01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:09.560]   can also become evil and destructive.
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:12.020]   The fact, knowing that that can happen
[01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:13.900]   is a powerful preventer of that.
[01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:16.860]   And then you kind of wake up from this haze
[01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:19.800]   of believing everything you hear,
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:24.800]   and you learn to just, in your small, local way,
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:28.960]   to put more love out there in the world.
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:31.460]   I believe it's not too good.
[01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:35.300]   So to push back, it's not so obvious to me
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:40.040]   that in the end, I think in the end, love wins.
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:40.880]   That's my intuition.
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:42.660]   If I had to bet money on it,
[01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:46.620]   I have a sense that this genocide thing
[01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:51.240]   is more and more going to be an artifact of the past.
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.100]   - Well, I certainly hope you're right.
[01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:54.500]   I mean, I certainly hope you're right.
[01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:59.500]   And it could be you are, we don't know.
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:04.020]   But the evidence is different.
[01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:05.260]   The evidence is different.
[01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:10.260]   And the capacity of human beings to do evil
[01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:14.920]   to other human beings is repeatedly demonstrated.
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:20.140]   Whether it's in massacres in Mexico,
[01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:25.140]   or ISIS and the Yazidi Kurds,
[01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:27.660]   or you can just go on and on.
[01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:29.420]   Syria, I mean, look what,
[01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:31.740]   I mean, Syria used to be a country, you know?
[01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:36.180]   And now it's been a mass grave,
[01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:38.940]   and people then have left in the millions,
[01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:41.100]   you know, for other places.
[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:43.140]   And I'm not saying,
[01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:46.580]   you know, I'm not saying,
[01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:48.980]   I mean, the Turks have done nice things for the Syrians,
[01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:51.100]   and the Germans welcomed in a million or so,
[01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:53.340]   and actually reasonably absorbed them.
[01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:57.660]   I mean, I'm not saying bad things only happen in the world.
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:59.100]   There are good and bad things that happen.
[01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:00.300]   You're absolutely right.
[01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:04.860]   But I don't think we're on the path
[01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:08.380]   to eliminating these bad things,
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:10.140]   really bad things from happening.
[01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:11.180]   I just don't think we are.
[01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:12.980]   And I don't think there's any,
[01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:15.500]   I don't think the facts demonstrate it.
[01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:17.300]   I mean, I hope, I hope you're right.
[01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:20.980]   But I think otherwise, it's just an article of faith.
[01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:23.580]   - Well.
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:25.500]   - You know, which is perfectly fine.
[01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:27.260]   It's better to have that article of faith
[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:29.980]   than to have a article of faith which says,
[01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:32.180]   you know, things should get bad or things like that.
[01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:33.940]   - Well, it's not just fine.
[01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:36.900]   It's the only way if you want to build a better future.
[01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:38.780]   So optimism is a prerequisite
[01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:40.580]   for engineering a better future.
[01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:43.440]   So like, okay, so a historian
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:46.140]   has to see clearly into the past.
[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:51.140]   An engineer has to imagine a future
[01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:54.260]   that's different from the past,
[01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:56.020]   that's better than the past.
[01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:58.340]   Because without that, they're not going to be able
[01:17:58.340 --> 01:17:59.520]   to build a better future.
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:01.260]   So there's a kind of saying,
[01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:02.660]   like you have to consider the facts.
[01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:05.600]   Well, at every single moment in history,
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:10.160]   if you allow yourself to be too grounded
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:11.340]   by the facts of the past,
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:12.820]   you're not going to create the future.
[01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:15.160]   So that's kind of the tension that we're living with.
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:16.860]   To have a chance, we have to imagine
[01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:19.540]   that that better future is possible.
[01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:24.000]   But one of the ways to do that is to study history.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.040]   - Which engineers don't do enough of.
[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:26.880]   - They do not.
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:29.280]   - Which is a real problem.
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.020]   It's a real problem.
[01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:33.180]   - Well, basically a lot of disciplines in science
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:35.220]   and so on don't do enough of.
[01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:41.340]   Can you tell the story of China from 1958 to 1962,
[01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:44.960]   what was called the Great Leap Forward,
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:47.400]   orchestrated by Chairman Mao Zedong
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:49.760]   that led to the deaths of tens of millions of people,
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:53.560]   making it arguably the largest famine in human history.
[01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:59.380]   - Yes, I mean, it was a terrible set of events
[01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:02.200]   that led to the death.
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:04.040]   People will dispute the numbers.
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:12.040]   15 million, 17 million, 14 million, 20 million people died
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:16.000]   in the Great Leap. - Many people say
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.360]   30, 40, 50 million.
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:18.940]   - Some people will go that high too.
[01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:21.000]   That's right, that's right.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.220]   Essentially, Mao and the Communist Party leadership,
[01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:28.480]   but it was mostly Mao's doing,
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:33.200]   decided he wanted to move the country into communism.
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:35.840]   And part of the idea of that
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:37.920]   was rivalry with the Soviet Union.
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:43.240]   Mao was a good Stalinist, or at least felt like Stalin
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:46.340]   was the right kind of communist leader to have,
[01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:48.080]   and he didn't like Khrushchev at all,
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:51.200]   and he didn't like what he thought were Khrushchev's reforms
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:54.160]   and also Khrushchev's pretensions
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:57.140]   to moving the Soviet Union into communism.
[01:19:57.140 --> 01:19:59.680]   So Khrushchev started talking about giving more power
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:01.720]   to the party, less power to the state,
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:04.480]   and if you give more power to the party versus the state,
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:07.240]   then you're moving into communism quicker.
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:11.400]   So what Mao decided to do was to engage in this vast program
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:16.960]   of building what were called people's communes.
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:21.960]   And these communes were enormous conglomerations
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:25.520]   of essentially collective farms.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:28.360]   And what would happen on those communes
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:31.560]   is there would be places for people to eat,
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:34.920]   and there would be places for the kids to be raised
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:38.040]   in essentially kind of separate homes,
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:39.960]   and they would be schooled.
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:42.680]   Everybody would turn over their medal,
[01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:44.160]   which was one of the, actually turned out
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:46.760]   to be a terribly negative phenomenon.
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:51.720]   Their metal pots and pans to be melted to then make steel.
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:53.640]   Every of these big communes
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:55.880]   would all have little steel plants,
[01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:57.320]   and they would build steel,
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:01.360]   and the whole countryside would be transformed.
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:03.400]   Well, like many of these sort of,
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:07.680]   I mean, a true megalomaniac project,
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:10.240]   like some of Stalin's projects too.
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:13.000]   And this particular project then,
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.400]   the people had no choice.
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:18.760]   They were forced to do this.
[01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:23.760]   It was incredibly dysfunctional for Chinese agriculture
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:30.840]   and ended up creating, as you mentioned, a terrible famine
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:36.440]   that everybody understood was a famine as a result of this.
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:40.400]   I mean, there were also some problems of nature
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.720]   at the same time and some flooding and bad weather
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:43.800]   and that sort of thing.
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:45.760]   But it was really a man-made famine.
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:52.240]   And Mao said at one point, "Who cares if millions die?
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:53.840]   "It just doesn't matter.
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:55.360]   "We've got millions more left."
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:57.800]   I mean, he would periodically say things like this
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:02.800]   that showed that like Stalin, he had total indifference
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:06.320]   to the fact that people were dying in large numbers.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:11.320]   It led again to cannibalism and to terrible wastage
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:15.080]   all over the country and millions of people died.
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:17.160]   And there was just no stopping it.
[01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:21.680]   There were people in the party who began to kind of edge
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:24.160]   towards telling Mao this wasn't a great idea
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:28.480]   and that he should back off, but he wouldn't back off.
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:32.080]   And the result was catastrophe in the countryside
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.240]   and all these people dying.
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:35.840]   And then they, compounding the problem
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:39.840]   was the political elite, which then,
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:43.320]   if peasants would object or if certain people would say,
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:45.040]   "No, they'd beat the hell out of them."
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:47.880]   They would beat people who didn't do
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.160]   what they wanted them to do.
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:54.160]   So it was really, really a horrific set of events
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:59.240]   on the Chinese countryside.
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:02.520]   I mean, and people wrote about it.
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.480]   I mean, we learned about it.
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:05.960]   There were people who were keeping track
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:09.080]   of what was going on and eventually wrote books about it.
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:13.040]   So we have, I mean, we have pretty good documentation,
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:14.160]   not so much on the numbers.
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:17.720]   Numbers are always a difficult problem.
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:19.120]   I'm facing this problem, by the way,
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:23.120]   this is a little bit separate with the Holodomor
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:26.680]   where Ukrainians are now claiming 11.5 million people died
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:28.000]   in Holodomor.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.760]   And most people assume it's somewhere
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:33.200]   in the neighborhood of 4 million, 4.5 million maybe.
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:36.440]   So you have wildly different numbers that come out
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:38.000]   and we have different kinds of numbers,
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.640]   as you mentioned too, with the Great Leap Forward.
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:45.320]   So it was a huge catastrophe for China
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:47.920]   and now only backed off when he had to.
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:50.720]   And then revived a little bit
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:53.920]   with the Red Guards movement later on
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:58.080]   when he was upset that the bureaucracy
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:00.320]   was resisting him a little bit
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:01.720]   when it came to the Great Leap,
[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:03.320]   but he had to back off.
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:06.000]   It was such a terrible catastrophe.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.680]   - So one of the things about numbers
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:10.440]   is that you usually talk about deaths,
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:13.380]   but with the famine, with starvation,
[01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:16.920]   the thing I often think about
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:18.680]   that's impossible to put into numbers
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:20.160]   is the number of people
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:23.440]   and the degree to which they were suffering.
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:28.840]   The number of days spent in suffering.
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.120]   - Oh yeah.
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:31.780]   - And so, I mean, death is,
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:39.760]   death is just one of the consequences of suffering.
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:43.320]   To me, it feels like one, two, three years,
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:48.320]   months and then years of not having anything to eat
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:53.600]   is worse and it's sort of those
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:55.320]   aren't put into numbers often.
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:56.160]   - That's right.
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:58.240]   And the effect on people long-term,
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:24:59.560]   in terms of their mental health,
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:02.560]   in terms of their physical health,
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:05.240]   their ability to work, all those kinds of things.
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:07.720]   I mean, Ukrainians are working on,
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:09.280]   there are people working on this subject now,
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:13.000]   you know, the long-term effect of the hunger famine on them.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.220]   And I'm sure there's a similar kind of long-term effect
[01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:18.080]   on Chinese peasantry of what happened.
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:20.040]   You know, I mean, you're destroying--
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:21.040]   - Multi-generational.
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:23.040]   - Yes, multi-generational, that's right.
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:23.880]   That's right. - Wow.
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:26.560]   - And, you know, it's a really, you're absolutely right.
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:29.160]   This is a terrible, terrible way to die.
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:31.520]   And it lasts a long time.
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:34.320]   And sometimes you don't die, you survive,
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:37.240]   but, you know, in the kind of shape
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:39.800]   where you can't do anything.
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:42.080]   I mean, you can't function.
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:44.920]   Now, your brain's been injured, you know.
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:46.960]   I don't know, it's a really,
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:49.240]   these famines are really horrible.
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:50.080]   - You're right.
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:50.960]   So when you talk about genocide,
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:52.440]   it's often talking about murder.
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:53.720]   - Yeah. - Where do you place
[01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:55.160]   North Korea in this discussion?
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:56.960]   We kind of mentioned it.
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:00.400]   So in the, what is it, the arduous march
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:08.120]   of the 1990s, where it was mass starvation,
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:11.320]   many people describe mass starvation going on.
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:14.360]   Now in North Korea, when you think about genocide,
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:18.760]   when you think about atrocities going on in the world today,
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:20.760]   where do you place North Korea?
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:22.280]   - So take a step back.
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:24.800]   When the, there were all these courts
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:28.080]   that were set up for Bosnia and for Rwanda
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:34.040]   and for other genocides in the 1990s.
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:37.360]   And then the decision was made
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:39.880]   by the international community, UN basically,
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:43.120]   to set up the International Criminal Court,
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:47.520]   which would then try genocide in the more modern period
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:49.520]   and the more contemporary period.
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:54.520]   And the ICC lists three crimes, basically.
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:59.840]   The genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:07.200]   And subsumed to crimes against humanity
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:08.680]   are a lot of the kinds of things
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:10.800]   you're talking about with North Korea.
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:13.760]   I mean, it's torture, it's artificial,
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:16.160]   sometimes artificial famine or famine,
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:21.040]   that is not necessary, right?
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:23.040]   Not necessary to have it.
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:28.040]   And there are other kinds of mass rape and stuff like that.
[01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:31.160]   There are other kinds of things that fit
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:33.480]   into the crimes against humanity.
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:36.400]   And that's sort of where I think about North Korea
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:39.200]   as committing crimes against humanity, not genocide.
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:43.200]   And again, remember, genocide is meant to be,
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:46.880]   I mean, some people, there's a disagreement
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:48.840]   among scholars and jurists about this.
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:51.920]   Some people think of genocide as the crime of crimes,
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:55.160]   the worst of the three that I just mentioned.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:57.000]   But some think of them as co-equal.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.480]   And the ICC, the International Criminal Court,
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:03.320]   is dealing with them more or less as co-equal,
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:06.520]   even though we tend to think of genocide as the worst.
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:08.960]   So, I mean, what I'm trying to say is that,
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:11.680]   you know, I don't wanna split hairs.
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:15.480]   I think it's sort of morally and ethically unseemly,
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:18.000]   you know, the split hairs about what is genocide
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.720]   and what is a crime against humanity.
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:22.960]   You know, this is for lawyers, not for historians.
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:24.120]   - Oh, terminology-wise.
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:28.360]   - Yeah, yeah, you know, you don't wanna get into that.
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:32.200]   Because it, I mean, it happened with Darfur a little bit,
[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:35.680]   where the Bush administration had declared
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:37.840]   that Darfur was a genocide.
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:40.800]   And the UN said, no, no, it's, you know,
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:43.400]   it wasn't genocide, it was a crime against humanity.
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:45.280]   And that, you know, that confused things
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:47.320]   versus clarified them.
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:49.320]   I mean, we damn well knew what was happening.
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:51.520]   People were being killed and being attacked.
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:55.240]   And so, you know, on the one hand,
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:58.360]   I think the whole concept and the way of thinking
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:04.040]   about history using genocide as an important part
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:08.040]   of human history is crucial.
[01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:12.400]   On the other hand, I don't like to, you know,
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:13.880]   get involved in the hair splitting,
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:15.320]   what's genocide and what's not.
[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:18.600]   So that, you know, North Korea, I tend to think of,
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:22.640]   like I said, as committing crimes against humanity
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:25.560]   and, you know, forcibly incarcerating people,
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:28.120]   torturing them, that kind of thing.
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:30.160]   You know, routinely incarcerating,
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:33.640]   depriving them of certain kinds of human rights
[01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:35.720]   can be considered a crime against humanity.
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:38.000]   But I don't think of it in the same way
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.080]   I think about genocide,
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:40.800]   which is an attack on a group of people.
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:42.800]   Let me just leave it at that.
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:45.840]   - What in this, if we think about, if it's okay,
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:48.160]   can we loosely use the term genocide here?
[01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:50.880]   Just let's not play games with terminology.
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:54.720]   Just bad crimes against humanity.
[01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:58.640]   Of particular interest are the ones
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:01.640]   that are going on today still,
[01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:04.440]   because it raises the question to us,
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:07.920]   what do people outside of this,
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:09.320]   what role do they have to play?
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:12.360]   So what role does the United States,
[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:16.640]   or what role do I as a human being
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:19.800]   who has food today, who has shelter,
[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:21.400]   who has a comfortable life,
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:26.120]   what role do I have when I think about North Korea,
[01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:27.320]   when I think about Syria,
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:31.440]   when I think about maybe the Uyghur population in China?
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:36.080]   - Well, I mean, the role is the same role I have,
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:38.360]   which is to teach and to learn
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:43.360]   and to get the message out that this is happening,
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:45.760]   because the more people who understand it,
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:48.600]   the more likely it is that the United States government
[01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:50.680]   will try to do something about it,
[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:56.640]   within the context of who we are and where we live, right?
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:31:00.800]   And so I write books, you do shows,
[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:04.560]   maybe you write books too, I don't know.
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:07.840]   - No, I do not write books, but I tweet.
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:09.720]   - You tweet, okay, that's good too.
[01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:11.440]   - Ineloquently, but that's not,
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:14.360]   I guess that's not the, yes, so certainly this is true,
[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:17.040]   and in terms of a voice, in terms of words,
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:19.440]   in terms of books, you are, I would say,
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:24.280]   a rare example of somebody that has powerful reach
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:27.220]   with words, but I was also referring to actions.
[01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:31.800]   The United States government, what are the options here?
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:36.800]   So war has costs, and war seems to be,
[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:40.280]   as you have described, sort of potentially
[01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:43.260]   increase the atrocity, not decrease it.
[01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:48.500]   If there's anything that challenges my hope for the future,
[01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:52.980]   is the fact that sometimes we're not powerless to help,
[01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:56.000]   but very close to powerless to help,
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:00.300]   because trying to help can often lead to,
[01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:03.420]   in the near term, more negative effects
[01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:04.700]   than positive effects.
[01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:06.980]   - That's exactly right, I mean, you know,
[01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:10.220]   the unintended consequences of what we do
[01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:13.580]   can frequently be as bad, if not worse,
[01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:17.100]   than trying to relieve the difficulties
[01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:17.940]   that people are having.
[01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:21.540]   So I think you're caught a little bit,
[01:32:21.540 --> 01:32:25.260]   but it's also true, I think, that we can be more forceful.
[01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:29.420]   I think we can be more forceful without necessarily war.
[01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:31.900]   You know, there is this idea
[01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:35.220]   of the so-called responsibility to protect,
[01:32:35.220 --> 01:32:39.000]   and this was an idea that came up after Kosovo,
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:42.840]   which was what, 1999,
[01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:47.520]   and when, you know, the Serbs looked like
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:50.560]   they were gonna engage in a genocidal program in Kosovo,
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:53.200]   and you know, it was basically a program of ethnic cleansing
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:56.240]   but it could have gone bad and gotten worse,
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:59.540]   not just driving people out, but beginning to kill them,
[01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:04.540]   and the United States and Britain and others intervened,
[01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:06.640]   you know, and Russians were there too,
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:08.840]   as you probably recall,
[01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:13.840]   and I think correctly, people have analyzed this as a case
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:19.920]   in which genocide was prevented or stopped.
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:22.020]   In other words, the Serbs were stopped in their tracks.
[01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:23.440]   I mean, some bad things did happen.
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:25.640]   We bombed Belgrade and the Chinese embassy
[01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:30.640]   and things like that, but you know, it was stopped,
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:32.320]   and following upon that,
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:35.620]   then there was a kind of international consensus
[01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:36.880]   that we needed to do something.
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:39.520]   I mean, because of Rwanda, Bosnia,
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:42.600]   and the positive example of Kosovo, right?
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:46.200]   That genocide did not happen in Kosovo,
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:49.360]   and I think that argument, you know,
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:50.720]   has been substantiated.
[01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:55.440]   Anyway, and this notion of the,
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:58.440]   or this, you know, doctrine or whatever
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:00.840]   of the responsibility to protect them
[01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:05.840]   was adopted by the UN in 2005, unanimously,
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:11.480]   and what it says is there's a hierarchy of measures
[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:14.960]   that should be, well, let me take a step back.
[01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:19.960]   It starts with the principle that sovereignty of a country
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:24.820]   is not, you don't earn it just by being there
[01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:27.300]   and being your own country.
[01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:29.920]   You have to earn it by protecting your people.
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:32.840]   So every, this was all agreed
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:35.160]   with all the nations of the UN agreed, you know,
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:38.320]   Chinese and Russians too, that, you know,
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:43.320]   sovereignty is there because you protect your people
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:46.380]   against various depredations, right?
[01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:49.560]   Including genocide, crimes against humanity,
[01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:51.200]   you know, forced imprisonment, torture,
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:52.840]   and that sort of thing.
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:57.840]   If you violate that justification for your sovereignty,
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:01.480]   that you're protecting your people,
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:03.240]   that you're not protecting them,
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:06.000]   the international community has the obligation
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.000]   to do something about it, all right?
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.840]   Now, then they have a kind of hierarchy
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:14.200]   of things you can do, you know, starting with,
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:17.020]   I mean, I'm not quoting exactly,
[01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:19.360]   but, you know, starting with kind of push and pull,
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:22.360]   you know, trying to convince people, don't do that.
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:24.480]   You know, to Myanmar, don't do that
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:26.000]   to the Rohingya people, right?
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.480]   Then it goes down the list, you know,
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:32.300]   and you get to sanctions, or threatening sanctions,
[01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:36.720]   and then sanctions, you know, like we have against Russia,
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:38.520]   but you go down the list, right?
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:41.300]   You go down the list, and eventually,
[01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:44.400]   you get to military intervention at the bottom,
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:46.880]   which they say is the last thing, you know,
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:50.120]   and you really don't wanna do that.
[01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:52.040]   And not only do you not wanna do it,
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:54.760]   but it, just as you said, just as you pointed out,
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:58.200]   it can have unintended consequences, right?
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:02.000]   And we'll do everything we can short, you know,
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.320]   of military intervention, but, you know, if necessary,
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:09.080]   that can be undertaken as well.
[01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:11.580]   And so the responsibility to protect, I think, is,
[01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:16.280]   you know, it was not implementable.
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:20.600]   One of the things it says in this last category, right,
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:23.500]   the military intervention, is that the intervention
[01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:28.500]   cannot create more damage than it relieves, right?
[01:36:29.020 --> 01:36:34.020]   And so for Syria, we came to the conclusion,
[01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:36.780]   you know, that, I mean, the international community,
[01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:39.680]   in some ways, said this in so many words,
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:41.500]   even though the Russians were there, obviously,
[01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:43.260]   we ended up being there, and that sort of thing,
[01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:45.460]   but the international community basically said,
[01:36:45.460 --> 01:36:48.260]   you know, there's no way you can intervene in Syria.
[01:36:48.260 --> 01:36:52.140]   You know, there's just no way without causing more damage,
[01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:54.260]   you know, than you would relieve.
[01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:56.840]   So, you know, in some senses,
[01:36:56.840 --> 01:36:58.740]   that's what the international community is saying about,
[01:36:58.740 --> 01:37:02.060]   you know, Xinjiang and the Uyghurs, too.
[01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:04.740]   You know, I mean, you can't even imagine
[01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:07.900]   what hell would break loose if there was some kind
[01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:12.740]   of military trouble, you know, to threaten the Chinese with.
[01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:17.460]   But you can go down that list with, you know,
[01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:19.740]   the military leadership of Myanmar,
[01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:21.160]   and you can go down that list
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:23.460]   with the Chinese Communist Party,
[01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:25.460]   and you can go down the list, you know,
[01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:29.780]   with others who are threatening, you know,
[01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:33.900]   with Ethiopia and what it's doing in Tigray,
[01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:37.940]   and, you know, you can go down that list and start pushing.
[01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:39.260]   I think what happened,
[01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:44.380]   there was more of a willingness in the '90s,
[01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:47.680]   and in the, you know, right at the turn of the century,
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:50.820]   you know, to do these kinds of things,
[01:37:50.820 --> 01:37:52.880]   and then, you know, when Trump got elected,
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:54.660]   and, you know, he basically said, you know,
[01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:56.300]   America first, and out of the world,
[01:37:56.300 --> 01:37:58.620]   we're not gonna do any of this kind of stuff.
[01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:01.100]   And now Biden has the problem of trying
[01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:04.940]   to rebuild consensus on how you deal
[01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:06.780]   with these kinds of things.
[01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:08.700]   I think it's not impossible.
[01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:11.700]   I mean, here, I tend to be maybe more of an optimist than you.
[01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:12.540]   (Larry laughs)
[01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:14.580]   You know, I think it's not impossible
[01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:16.740]   that the international community can, you know,
[01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:20.660]   muster some internal fortitude,
[01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:25.660]   and push harder, short of war, you know,
[01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:30.700]   to get the Chinese, and to get the, again, Myanmar,
[01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:34.140]   and to get others to kind of back off
[01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:36.060]   of violations of people's rights
[01:38:36.060 --> 01:38:38.360]   the way they are routinely doing it.
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:40.060]   - So that's in the space of geopolitics.
[01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:42.500]   That's the space of politicians, and UN, and so on.
[01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:43.340]   - Yes, yes.
[01:38:43.340 --> 01:38:44.500]   - The interesting thing about China,
[01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:47.080]   and this is a difficult topic,
[01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:52.080]   but there's so many financial interests
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:58.600]   that not many voices with power and with money speak up,
[01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:02.460]   speak out against China,
[01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:06.760]   because it's a very interesting effect,
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:11.260]   because it costs a lot for an individual to speak up,
[01:39:11.260 --> 01:39:13.840]   because you're going to suffer.
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:17.040]   I mean, China just cuts off the market.
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:20.040]   Like, if you have a product, if you have a company,
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:22.120]   and you say something negative, China just says,
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:25.120]   "Okay, well, then they knock you out of the market."
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:27.440]   And so any person that speaks up,
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:29.800]   they get shut down immediately, financially.
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:33.200]   It's a huge cost, sometimes millions or billions of dollars.
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:36.720]   And so what happens is everybody of consequences,
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:39.540]   sort of financially, everybody with a giant platform
[01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:41.240]   is extremely hesitant to speak out.
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:45.280]   It's a very, it's a different kind of hesitation
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:46.840]   that's financial in nature.
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:48.760]   I don't know if that was always the case.
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:53.760]   It seems like in history, people were quiet because of fear,
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:55.840]   because of threat of violence.
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:40:00.720]   Here, there's almost like a self-interested preservation
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:04.320]   of financial, of wealth.
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:06.240]   And I don't know what to do that.
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:09.440]   I mean, I don't know if you can say something there,
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:12.520]   like, (chuckles)
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:14.440]   the genocide going on
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:17.400]   because people are financially self-interested.
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:22.060]   - Yeah, no, I think, I mean, I think the analysis is correct.
[01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:26.160]   And it's not only, but it's not only corporations,
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:28.240]   but it's, you know, it's the American government
[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:30.380]   that represents the American people
[01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:34.040]   that also feels compelled
[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:39.400]   not to challenge the Chinese on human rights issues.
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:42.000]   - But the interesting thing is it's not just,
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:44.440]   I know a lot of people from China,
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:47.160]   and first of all, amazing human beings,
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:49.100]   and a lot of brilliant people in China.
[01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:50.920]   They also don't want to speak out,
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:52.440]   and not because they're sort of,
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:54.600]   quote unquote, like, silenced,
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:57.760]   but more because they're going to also lose financially.
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:00.640]   They have a lot of businesses in China.
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:02.560]   They, you know, they're running,
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:06.780]   in fact, the Chinese government and the country
[01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:08.520]   has a very interesting structure
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:11.400]   because it has a lot of elements that enable capitalism
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:13.880]   within a certain framework.
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:16.640]   So you have a lot of very successful companies,
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:18.240]   and they operate successfully.
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:19.960]   And then the leaders of those companies,
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:24.680]   many of whom have either been on this podcast,
[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:25.960]   or want to be on this podcast,
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:28.240]   they really don't want to say anything negative
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:29.460]   about the government.
[01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:32.840]   And the nature of the fear I sense
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:37.400]   is not the kind of fear you would have in Nazi Germany.
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:40.280]   It's a very kind of, it's a mellow,
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:43.000]   like, why would I speak out
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.680]   when it has a negative effect on my company,
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:48.740]   on my family, in terms of finance, strictly financially?
[01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:53.960]   And that's difficult.
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:56.120]   That's a different problem to solve.
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:57.720]   That feels solvable.
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:00.160]   Because it feels like it's a money problem.
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:02.460]   If you can control the flow of money,
[01:42:02.460 --> 01:42:05.680]   where the government has less power
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:06.880]   to control the flow of money,
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:08.840]   it feels like that's solvable.
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:10.360]   And that's where capitalism is good.
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:11.580]   That's where the free market is good.
[01:42:11.580 --> 01:42:13.240]   So it's like, that's where a lot of people
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:14.440]   in the cryptocurrency space,
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:16.040]   I don't know if you follow them,
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:19.720]   they kind of say, okay, take the monetary system,
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:22.560]   the power to control money away from governments.
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:23.480]   Make it a distributed,
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:26.360]   like, allow technology to help you with that.
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:28.760]   That's a hopeful message there.
[01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:31.040]   In fact, a lot of people argue that kind of Bitcoin,
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:35.040]   these cryptocurrencies can help deal
[01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:38.500]   with some of these authoritarian regimes
[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:41.880]   that lead to violations of basic human rights.
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:44.320]   If you can control, if you can give the power
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:46.120]   to control the money to the people,
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:47.960]   you can take that away from governments.
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:49.740]   That's another source of hope,
[01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:52.760]   where technology might be able to do something good.
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:54.840]   That's something different about the 21st century
[01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:57.120]   than the 20th, is there's technology
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:59.680]   in the hands of billions of people.
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:03.240]   - I mean, I have to say, I think you're a naive
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:04.640]   when it comes to technology.
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:07.920]   I mean, I don't, I'm not someone who understands technology.
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:11.640]   So it's wrong of me to argue with you
[01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:13.840]   because I don't really spend much time with it.
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:15.960]   I don't really like it very much.
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:20.960]   And I'm not, I'm neither a fan nor a connoisseur.
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:23.920]   So I just don't really know.
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:27.800]   But what human history has shown basically,
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:29.040]   and that's a big statement.
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:31.080]   I don't want to pretend I can tell you
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:32.920]   what human history has shown.
[01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:37.240]   But technology, atom bomb,
[01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:39.520]   I mean, that's the perfect example of technology.
[01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:42.120]   You know, what happens when you discover new things.
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:45.080]   It's a perfect example, what's going on with Facebook now.
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:47.600]   It's an absolutely perfect example.
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:51.480]   You know, and I once went to a lecture
[01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:53.680]   by Eric Schmidt about the future, you know,
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:55.760]   and about all the things that were going to happen
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:57.540]   and all these wonderful things like, you know,
[01:43:57.540 --> 01:43:59.880]   you wouldn't have to translate yourself anything.
[01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:02.820]   You wouldn't have to read a book, you know.
[01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:04.160]   You wouldn't have to drive a car.
[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:05.680]   You don't have to do this, you don't have to do that.
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:07.360]   What kind of life is that?
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:12.360]   So, you know, my view of technology is it's subsumed,
[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:17.480]   you know, to the political, social, and moral needs
[01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:20.360]   of our day and should be subsumed to that day.
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:22.400]   It's not going to solve anything by itself.
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:25.520]   It's going to be you and me that solve things.
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:26.360]   If they're solved,
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:28.440]   or our political system that solves things.
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:31.460]   Technology is neutral on one level.
[01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:34.240]   It is simply a human, I mean,
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:37.040]   they're talking now about how artificial intelligence,
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:39.800]   you know, is going to do this and is going to do that.
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:43.680]   I'm not so sure there's anything necessarily positive
[01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:44.800]   or negative about it,
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:47.560]   except it does obviously make work easier
[01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:48.680]   and things like that.
[01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:52.160]   I mean, I, you know, I like email and I like, you know,
[01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:56.220]   word processing and that sort of, all that stuff is great.
[01:44:56.220 --> 01:45:01.220]   But actually solving human relations in and of itself,
[01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:06.100]   relations in and of itself, or international relations,
[01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:11.100]   or conflict among human beings.
[01:45:11.100 --> 01:45:13.600]   I mean, I see technology as, you know,
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:15.940]   causing as many problems as it solves,
[01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:18.940]   and maybe even more, you know, the kind--
[01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:19.780]   - Maybe.
[01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:21.020]   - Maybe even more. - Maybe.
[01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:21.860]   - Yeah.
[01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:25.260]   - The question is, so like you said, technology is neutral.
[01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:26.940]   I agree with this.
[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:30.460]   Technology is a toolkit, is a tool set
[01:45:30.460 --> 01:45:34.980]   that enables humans to have wider reach and more power.
[01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:39.980]   The printing press, the rare reason I can read your books
[01:45:39.980 --> 01:45:42.740]   is I would argue, so first of all, the printing press,
[01:45:42.740 --> 01:45:45.540]   and then the internet.
[01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:50.540]   Wikipedia, I think, has immeasurable effect on humanity.
[01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:53.900]   Technology is a double-edged sword.
[01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:57.260]   It allows bad people to do bad things
[01:45:57.260 --> 01:45:58.780]   and good people to do good things.
[01:45:58.780 --> 01:45:59.620]   - Exactly.
[01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:01.020]   - It boils down to--
[01:46:01.020 --> 01:46:01.860]   - Right, the people.
[01:46:01.860 --> 01:46:04.460]   - The people and whether you believe
[01:46:04.460 --> 01:46:07.500]   the capacity for good outweighs the capacity of bad.
[01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:10.540]   And so you said that I'm naive, it is true.
[01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:12.380]   I'm naively optimistic.
[01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:16.060]   I would say you're naively cynical about technology.
[01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:20.500]   Here we have one overdressed, naive optimist,
[01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:23.820]   and one brilliant, but nevertheless,
[01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:27.100]   technologically naive cynic, and we don't know.
[01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:30.340]   We don't know whether the capacity for good
[01:46:30.340 --> 01:46:34.860]   or the capacity for evil wins out in the end.
[01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:37.060]   And like we've been talking about,
[01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:39.940]   the trajectory of human history seems to pivot
[01:46:39.940 --> 01:46:43.060]   on a lot of random seeming moments.
[01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:48.060]   So we don't know, but as a builder of technology,
[01:46:48.060 --> 01:46:50.980]   I remain optimistic.
[01:46:50.980 --> 01:46:55.980]   And I should say, when you are optimistic,
[01:46:56.220 --> 01:47:01.040]   it is often easy to sound naive.
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:06.300]   And I'm not sure what to make of that small effect.
[01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:07.780]   Not to linger on specific words,
[01:47:07.780 --> 01:47:11.660]   but I've noticed that people who kind of
[01:47:11.660 --> 01:47:17.580]   are cynical about the world somehow sound more intelligent.
[01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:22.560]   - No, no, the issue is how can you be realistic
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:23.820]   about the world?
[01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:27.260]   It's not optimistic or pessimistic, it's not cynical.
[01:47:27.260 --> 01:47:29.540]   The question is how can you be a realist, right?
[01:47:29.540 --> 01:47:31.140]   - Yes, that's a good question.
[01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:36.140]   - Realism depends on a combination of knowledge
[01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:42.680]   and wisdom and good instincts and that sort of thing.
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:47.320]   And that's what we strive for, is a kind of realism.
[01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:49.420]   We both strive for that kind of realism.
[01:47:49.420 --> 01:47:53.420]   But I mean, here's an example I would give you.
[01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:56.580]   What about, again, we've got this environmental issue,
[01:47:56.580 --> 01:47:59.280]   and technology has created it.
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:01.820]   It's created it.
[01:48:01.820 --> 01:48:04.180]   I mean, the growth of technology,
[01:48:04.180 --> 01:48:07.060]   I mean, we all like to be heated well in our homes,
[01:48:07.060 --> 01:48:09.820]   and we want to have cars that run quickly
[01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:12.620]   and fast on gas, and that sort of,
[01:48:12.620 --> 01:48:17.040]   I mean, we're all consumers and we all profit from this.
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:20.140]   I don't, not everybody profits from it,
[01:48:20.140 --> 01:48:23.180]   but we want to be comfortable.
[01:48:23.180 --> 01:48:25.620]   And technology has provided us with a comfortable life.
[01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:29.660]   And it's also provided us with this incredible danger,
[01:48:29.660 --> 01:48:31.660]   which it's not solving, at least not now.
[01:48:31.660 --> 01:48:33.740]   - Okay, but-- - And it may solve,
[01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:37.740]   but it's only, my view is, you know what's gonna happen?
[01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:39.380]   A horrible catastrophe.
[01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:42.300]   It's the only way, it's the only way
[01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:45.100]   we will direct ourselves to actually trying
[01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:46.520]   to do something about it.
[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:52.380]   We don't have the wisdom and the,
[01:48:53.380 --> 01:48:56.820]   realism and the sense of purpose.
[01:48:56.820 --> 01:48:59.060]   You know, what's her name?
[01:48:59.060 --> 01:49:01.620]   Greta goes blah, blah, blah, something like that
[01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:06.620]   in her last talk about the environmental summit
[01:49:06.620 --> 01:49:09.780]   in Glasgow or wherever it was.
[01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:15.940]   And, you know, we just don't have it
[01:49:15.940 --> 01:49:19.460]   unless we're hit upside the head really, really hard.
[01:49:19.460 --> 01:49:24.460]   And then maybe, you know, the business with nuclear weapons,
[01:49:24.460 --> 01:49:27.860]   you know, I think somehow we got hit upside the head
[01:49:27.860 --> 01:49:30.380]   and we realized, oh man, you know,
[01:49:30.380 --> 01:49:32.940]   this could really do it to the whole world.
[01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:36.660]   And so we started, you know, serious arms control stuff.
[01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:41.460]   And, you know, but up to that point, you know,
[01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:43.500]   I mean, it was just something about, you know,
[01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:46.080]   Khrushchev's big bomb, his big hydrogen bomb,
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:48.360]   which he exploded in the times,
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:50.420]   I think it was the anniversary or something like that.
[01:49:50.420 --> 01:49:52.460]   You know, I mean, just think what we could have done
[01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:53.580]   to each other.
[01:49:53.580 --> 01:49:55.620]   - Well, that's the double-edged sword of technology.
[01:49:55.620 --> 01:49:57.300]   - Yeah, I agree it's a double-edged sword.
[01:49:57.300 --> 01:49:58.420]   - There's a lot of people,
[01:49:58.420 --> 01:50:01.080]   there's a lot of people that argue that nuclear weapons
[01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:03.780]   is the reason we haven't had a World War III.
[01:50:03.780 --> 01:50:06.860]   So nuclear weapons, the mutually assured destruction
[01:50:06.860 --> 01:50:08.540]   leads to a kind of like,
[01:50:08.540 --> 01:50:11.220]   we've reached a certain level of destructiveness
[01:50:11.220 --> 01:50:15.660]   with our weapons where we were able to catch ourselves,
[01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:20.320]   not to create, like you said, hit really hard.
[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:25.320]   This is the interesting question about kind of hard,
[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:28.640]   hard and really hard upside the head.
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:31.620]   With the environment, I would argue,
[01:50:31.620 --> 01:50:33.860]   see, we can't know the future,
[01:50:33.860 --> 01:50:36.160]   but I would argue as the pressure builds,
[01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:41.160]   there's already, because of this created urgency,
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:44.600]   the amount of innovation that I've seen
[01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:47.200]   that sometimes is unrelated to the environment,
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:49.980]   but kind of sparked by this urgency.
[01:50:49.980 --> 01:50:52.980]   It's been humongous, including the work of Elon Musk,
[01:50:52.980 --> 01:50:55.120]   including the work of just,
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:51:00.120]   you could argue that the SpaceX
[01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:02.600]   and the new exploration of space
[01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:06.040]   is kind of sparked by this environmental like urgency.
[01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:07.200]   I mean, connected to Tesla
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:09.000]   and everything they're doing with electric vehicles
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.280]   and so on, there's a huge amount of innovation
[01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:12.680]   in the space that's happening.
[01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:16.640]   I could see the effect of climate change
[01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:19.760]   resulting in more positive innovation
[01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:22.700]   that improves the quality of life across the world
[01:51:22.700 --> 01:51:26.340]   than the actual catastrophic events that we're describing,
[01:51:26.340 --> 01:51:28.440]   which we cannot even currently predict.
[01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:29.640]   It's not like there's going to be,
[01:51:29.640 --> 01:51:31.560]   there's going to be more extreme weather events.
[01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:32.800]   What does that even mean?
[01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:35.280]   There's going to be a gradual increase
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:38.440]   of the level of water.
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:40.720]   What does that even mean in terms of catastrophic events?
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:42.280]   It's going to be pretty gradual.
[01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:43.520]   There's going to be migration of people.
[01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:45.120]   We can't predict what that means.
[01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:47.520]   And in response to that,
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:52.440]   there's going to be a huge amount of innovators born today
[01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:56.840]   that have dreams and that will build devices and inventions
[01:51:56.840 --> 01:52:01.720]   and from space to vehicles to in the software world
[01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:03.720]   that enable education across the world,
[01:52:03.720 --> 01:52:07.760]   all those kinds of things that will on mass, on average,
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:11.040]   increase the quality of life on average across the world.
[01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:14.480]   So it's not at all obvious that these,
[01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:16.240]   the things that the technologies
[01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:19.920]   that are creating climate change, global warming
[01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:23.520]   are going to have a negative, net negative effect.
[01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:24.760]   We don't know this.
[01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:29.760]   And I'm kind of inspired by the dreamers, the engineers,
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:33.600]   the innovators and the entrepreneurs that build,
[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:37.880]   that wake up in the morning, see problems in the world
[01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:39.500]   and dream that they're going to be the ones
[01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:40.760]   who solve those problems.
[01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:43.000]   That's the human spirit.
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:44.520]   And that I'm not exactly,
[01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:46.720]   it is true that we need those deadlines.
[01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:48.920]   We need to be freaking out about stuff.
[01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:52.080]   And the reason we need to study history
[01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:55.080]   and the worst of human history is then we can say,
[01:52:55.080 --> 01:52:57.020]   oh shit, this too can happen.
[01:52:57.020 --> 01:52:59.360]   It's a slap in the face.
[01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:02.700]   It's a wake up call that if you get complacent,
[01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:04.960]   if you get lazy, this is going to happen.
[01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:08.400]   And that, listen, there's a lot of really intelligent people,
[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:13.400]   ambitious people, dreamers, skilled dreamers
[01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:15.520]   that build solutions that make sure
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:17.240]   this stuff doesn't happen anymore.
[01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:20.520]   So I think there's reason to be optimistic about technology,
[01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:21.840]   not in a naive way.
[01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:25.460]   There's an argument to be made in a realistic way
[01:53:25.460 --> 01:53:29.280]   that like with technology, we can build a better future.
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:32.640]   And then Facebook is a lesson
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:34.320]   in the way Facebook has been done
[01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:37.280]   is a lesson how not to do it.
[01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:42.280]   And that lesson serves as a guide of how to do it better,
[01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:46.640]   how to do it right, how to do it in a positive way.
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:50.040]   And the same, every single sort of failed technology
[01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:53.360]   contains within it the lessons of how to do it better.
[01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:55.460]   I mean, without that,
[01:53:55.460 --> 01:54:00.760]   what's the source of hope for human civilization?
[01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:02.840]   (laughs)
[01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:05.860]   I mean, by way of question,
[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:09.320]   you have truly studied some of the darkest moments
[01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:10.340]   in human history.
[01:54:10.340 --> 01:54:13.260]   Put on your optimist hat.
[01:54:13.260 --> 01:54:15.760]   Where-- - That one.
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:16.600]   - Yes.
[01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:19.720]   - The glimmers of it.
[01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:22.320]   - Yes, what is your source of hope
[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:24.620]   for the future of human civilization?
[01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:28.840]   - Well, I think it resides in
[01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:32.500]   some of what you've been saying,
[01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:37.500]   which is in the persistence of this civilization over time,
[01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:43.340]   despite the incredible setbacks,
[01:54:43.340 --> 01:54:47.540]   two enormous world wars, the nuclear standoff,
[01:54:47.540 --> 01:54:52.740]   the horrible things we're experiencing now
[01:54:52.740 --> 01:54:56.060]   with climate change and migration and stuff like that.
[01:54:56.060 --> 01:55:01.060]   That despite these things, we are persisting
[01:55:01.180 --> 01:55:03.140]   and we are continuing, and like you say,
[01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:04.580]   we're continuing to invent
[01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:07.700]   and we're continuing to try to solve these problems.
[01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:11.300]   And we're continuing to love as well as hate.
[01:55:11.300 --> 01:55:14.620]   And that,
[01:55:14.620 --> 01:55:20.380]   I'm basically, I mean, I have children and grandchildren
[01:55:20.380 --> 01:55:23.260]   and I think they're gonna be just fine.
[01:55:23.260 --> 01:55:27.700]   I'm not a doom and gloomer.
[01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:30.300]   I'm not a Cassandra saying the world is coming to an end.
[01:55:30.300 --> 01:55:31.620]   I'm not like that at all.
[01:55:31.620 --> 01:55:38.260]   I think that things will persist.
[01:55:38.260 --> 01:55:41.380]   Another, by the way, source of tremendous optimism
[01:55:41.380 --> 01:55:44.580]   on my part, the kids I teach.
[01:55:44.580 --> 01:55:49.540]   I teach some unbelievably fantastic young people
[01:55:49.540 --> 01:55:52.380]   who are sort of like you say, they're dreamers
[01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:54.380]   and they're problem solvers.
[01:55:57.140 --> 01:56:01.460]   I mean, they have enormously humane values
[01:56:01.460 --> 01:56:02.980]   and ways of thinking about the world
[01:56:02.980 --> 01:56:05.060]   and they wanna do good.
[01:56:05.060 --> 01:56:09.620]   If you take the kind of, I mean,
[01:56:09.620 --> 01:56:11.940]   this has probably been true all the way along,
[01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:15.140]   but I mean, the percentage of do-gooders
[01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:16.780]   is really enormously large.
[01:56:16.780 --> 01:56:18.140]   Now, whether they end up working
[01:56:18.140 --> 01:56:20.780]   for some kind of shark law firm or something
[01:56:20.780 --> 01:56:24.940]   or that kind of thing,
[01:56:24.940 --> 01:56:26.820]   or whether they end up human rights lawyers
[01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:28.460]   as they all wanna be, right?
[01:56:28.460 --> 01:56:34.060]   Is a different kind of question,
[01:56:34.060 --> 01:56:38.220]   but certainly these young people are talented,
[01:56:38.220 --> 01:56:41.140]   they're smart, they have wonderful values,
[01:56:41.140 --> 01:56:45.260]   they're energetic, they work hard, they're focused.
[01:56:45.260 --> 01:56:48.900]   And of course, it's not just Stanford.
[01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:50.620]   I mean, it's all over the country.
[01:56:50.620 --> 01:56:54.900]   You have young people who really wanna contribute
[01:56:54.900 --> 01:56:55.980]   and they wanna contribute.
[01:56:55.980 --> 01:56:58.980]   I mean, it's true some of them end up
[01:56:58.980 --> 01:57:02.140]   working to get rich.
[01:57:02.140 --> 01:57:03.740]   I mean, that's inevitable, right?
[01:57:03.740 --> 01:57:07.500]   But the percentages are actually rather small,
[01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:08.820]   at least at this age.
[01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:10.700]   Maybe when they get a mortgage and a family
[01:57:10.700 --> 01:57:12.380]   and that sort of thing,
[01:57:12.380 --> 01:57:16.300]   financial well-being will be more important to them.
[01:57:16.300 --> 01:57:20.020]   But right now, you catch this young generation
[01:57:20.020 --> 01:57:21.220]   and they're fantastic.
[01:57:21.220 --> 01:57:22.100]   They're fantastic.
[01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:25.820]   And they're not what they're often portrayed
[01:57:25.820 --> 01:57:30.820]   as being kind of silly and naive and knee jerk leftists
[01:57:30.820 --> 01:57:32.980]   and that, they're not at all like that.
[01:57:32.980 --> 01:57:36.740]   They're really fine young people.
[01:57:36.740 --> 01:57:40.420]   So that's a source of optimism to me too.
[01:57:40.420 --> 01:57:44.020]   - What advice would you give to those young people today,
[01:57:44.020 --> 01:57:47.140]   maybe in high school, in college, at Stanford,
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:52.140]   maybe to your grandchildren about how to have a career
[01:57:52.140 --> 01:57:55.540]   they can be proud of, have a life they can be proud of?
[01:57:55.540 --> 01:57:58.860]   - Pursue careers that are in the public interest
[01:57:58.860 --> 01:58:02.380]   in one fashion or another and not just in their interests.
[01:58:02.380 --> 01:58:07.140]   And that would be, I mean, it's not bad to pursue a career
[01:58:07.140 --> 01:58:08.060]   in your own interests.
[01:58:08.060 --> 01:58:11.100]   I mean, as long as it's something that's useful
[01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:16.100]   and positive for their families or whatever.
[01:58:16.100 --> 01:58:20.020]   But yeah, so I mean, I try to advise kids
[01:58:20.020 --> 01:58:22.220]   to find themselves somehow,
[01:58:22.220 --> 01:58:25.540]   find who they want to be and what they want to be
[01:58:25.540 --> 01:58:27.260]   and try to pursue it.
[01:58:27.260 --> 01:58:30.420]   And the NGO world is growing, as you know,
[01:58:30.420 --> 01:58:34.580]   and a lot of young people are kind of throwing themselves
[01:58:34.580 --> 01:58:39.580]   into it and human rights watch and that kind of stuff.
[01:58:39.580 --> 01:58:43.460]   And they want to do that kind of work.
[01:58:43.460 --> 01:58:45.460]   And it's very admirable.
[01:58:45.460 --> 01:58:50.820]   - I tend to think that even if you're not working
[01:58:50.820 --> 01:58:53.740]   in human rights, there's a certain way in which
[01:58:53.740 --> 01:58:55.400]   if you live with integrity,
[01:58:55.400 --> 01:59:02.820]   I believe that all of us or many of us
[01:59:02.820 --> 01:59:06.020]   have a bunch of moments in our lives
[01:59:06.020 --> 01:59:08.160]   when we're posed with a decision.
[01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:09.500]   It's a quiet one.
[01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:12.500]   Maybe it'll never be written about or talked about.
[01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:13.940]   Well, you get to choose.
[01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:20.780]   There's a choice that is difficult to make.
[01:59:21.300 --> 01:59:23.900]   It may require a sacrifice, but it's the choice
[01:59:23.900 --> 01:59:28.980]   that the best version of that person would make.
[01:59:28.980 --> 01:59:31.580]   That's the best way I can sort of say
[01:59:31.580 --> 01:59:32.740]   how to act with integrity.
[01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:34.700]   It's the very thing that would resist
[01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:36.380]   the early days in Nazi Germany.
[01:59:36.380 --> 01:59:40.460]   It sounds dramatic to say, but those little actions.
[01:59:40.460 --> 01:59:45.420]   And I feel like the best you can do to avoid genocide
[01:59:45.420 --> 01:59:49.180]   on scale is for all of us to live in that way,
[01:59:50.540 --> 01:59:52.940]   within those moments, unrelated potentially
[01:59:52.940 --> 01:59:55.460]   to human rights, to anything else,
[01:59:55.460 --> 01:59:57.420]   is to take those actions.
[01:59:57.420 --> 02:00:00.420]   Like I believe that all of us know the right thing to do.
[02:00:00.420 --> 02:00:01.500]   - I know, that's right.
[02:00:01.500 --> 02:00:02.700]   I think that's right.
[02:00:02.700 --> 02:00:04.020]   You put it very well.
[02:00:04.020 --> 02:00:06.660]   I couldn't have done it better myself.
[02:00:06.660 --> 02:00:07.940]   No, no, I agree.
[02:00:07.940 --> 02:00:09.860]   I agree completely that there are,
[02:00:09.860 --> 02:00:16.780]   to live with truth, which is what Václav Havel
[02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:19.620]   used to say, this famous Czech dissident,
[02:00:19.620 --> 02:00:21.140]   talked about living in truth,
[02:00:21.140 --> 02:00:23.100]   but also to live with integrity.
[02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:26.900]   And that's really super important.
[02:00:26.900 --> 02:00:29.140]   - Well, let me ask you about love.
[02:00:29.140 --> 02:00:31.340]   What role does love play in this whole thing,
[02:00:31.340 --> 02:00:33.260]   in the human condition?
[02:00:33.260 --> 02:00:35.340]   In all the study of genocide,
[02:00:35.340 --> 02:00:39.220]   it does seem that hardship in moments
[02:00:39.220 --> 02:00:41.260]   brings out the best in human nature,
[02:00:41.260 --> 02:00:44.380]   and the best in human nature is expressed through love.
[02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:46.180]   - Well, as I already mentioned to you,
[02:00:46.180 --> 02:00:51.180]   I think hardship is not a good thing.
[02:00:51.180 --> 02:00:53.940]   It's not the best thing for love.
[02:00:53.940 --> 02:00:57.700]   I mean, it's better to not have to suffer,
[02:00:57.700 --> 02:00:59.180]   and not have to-- - You think so?
[02:00:59.180 --> 02:01:00.900]   - Yes, I think it is.
[02:01:00.900 --> 02:01:05.900]   I think it's, as I mentioned to you,
[02:01:05.900 --> 02:01:08.660]   studying concentration camps,
[02:01:08.660 --> 02:01:10.460]   this is not a place for love.
[02:01:10.460 --> 02:01:13.740]   It happens, it happens,
[02:01:13.740 --> 02:01:15.220]   but it's not really a place for love.
[02:01:15.220 --> 02:01:16.620]   It's a place for rape.
[02:01:16.620 --> 02:01:19.340]   It's a place for torture.
[02:01:19.340 --> 02:01:20.420]   It's a place for killing,
[02:01:20.420 --> 02:01:24.060]   and it's a place for inhuman action,
[02:01:24.060 --> 02:01:26.180]   one to another, you know?
[02:01:26.180 --> 02:01:30.460]   And also, as I said, among those who are suffering,
[02:01:30.460 --> 02:01:33.060]   not just between those who are,
[02:01:33.060 --> 02:01:34.780]   and then there are whole gradations,
[02:01:34.780 --> 02:01:36.300]   you know, the same thing in the gulag,
[02:01:36.300 --> 02:01:37.660]   you know, there are gradations,
[02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:40.980]   all the way from the criminal prisoners
[02:01:40.980 --> 02:01:42.900]   who beat the hell out of the political prisoners,
[02:01:42.900 --> 02:01:44.860]   you know, who then have others below them
[02:01:44.860 --> 02:01:45.980]   who they beat down, you know,
[02:01:45.980 --> 02:01:48.420]   so everybody's being the hell out of everybody else.
[02:01:48.420 --> 02:01:53.340]   So I would not idealize in any way suffering as a,
[02:01:53.340 --> 02:01:55.540]   you know-- - A source of beauty.
[02:01:55.540 --> 02:01:57.220]   - A source of beauty and love.
[02:01:57.220 --> 02:01:58.060]   I wouldn't do that.
[02:01:58.060 --> 02:02:00.700]   I think it's a whole lot better
[02:02:00.700 --> 02:02:03.200]   for people to be relatively prosperous,
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:04.780]   I'm not saying super prosperous,
[02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:06.340]   but to be able to feed themselves,
[02:02:06.340 --> 02:02:08.220]   and to be able to feed their families,
[02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:09.820]   and house their families,
[02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:13.120]   and take care of themselves,
[02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:18.960]   you know, to foster loving relations between people.
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:25.000]   And, you know, I think it's no accident
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:28.520]   that, you know, poor families have much,
[02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:33.200]   you know, worse records when it comes to crime
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:34.600]   and things like that, you know,
[02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:37.760]   and also to wife beating,
[02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:40.800]   and to child abuse, and stuff like that.
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:45.800]   I mean, you just, you don't wanna be poor and indigent,
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:49.440]   and not have a roof over your head, be homeless.
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:51.160]   I mean, it doesn't mean, again,
[02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:53.300]   you know, homeless people are mean people,
[02:02:53.300 --> 02:02:54.600]   that's not what I'm trying to say.
[02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:56.960]   What I'm trying to say is that, you know,
[02:02:56.960 --> 02:02:59.080]   what we wanna try to foster in this country
[02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:00.800]   and around the world,
[02:03:00.800 --> 02:03:02.440]   and one of the reasons, you know,
[02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:07.180]   I mean, I'm very critical of the Chinese in a lot of ways,
[02:03:07.180 --> 02:03:08.320]   but I mean, we have to remember
[02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:11.080]   they pulled that country out of horrible poverty, right?
[02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:14.560]   And I mean, there's still poor people in the countryside,
[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:16.640]   there's still problems, you know,
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:21.640]   with want and need among the Chinese people,
[02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:24.380]   but, you know, there were millions and millions of Chinese
[02:03:24.380 --> 02:03:26.520]   who were living at the bare minimum of life,
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:28.260]   which is no way to live, you know,
[02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:30.520]   and no way, again, to foster love,
[02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:33.820]   and compassion, and getting along.
[02:03:33.820 --> 02:03:37.520]   So I wanna be clear, I don't speak for history, right?
[02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:38.360]   (Lex laughing)
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:41.120]   I'm giving you, I mean, there used to be historians,
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:42.320]   you know, in the 19th century
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:45.480]   who really thought they were speaking for history, you know?
[02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:47.020]   I don't think that way at all.
[02:03:47.020 --> 02:03:49.520]   I mean, I understand I'm a subjective human being
[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:54.020]   with my own points of view and my own opinions, but--
[02:03:54.020 --> 02:03:56.120]   - I'm trying to remember in this conversation
[02:03:56.120 --> 02:03:58.880]   that you're, despite the fact that you're brilliant
[02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:02.600]   and you've written brilliant books, that you're just human.
[02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:04.280]   - Well, I am. - With an opinion.
[02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:05.480]   - That's it, yeah.
[02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:07.080]   No, no, that's absolutely true,
[02:04:07.080 --> 02:04:09.680]   and I tell my students that too.
[02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:11.240]   I mean, I make sure they understand
[02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:12.920]   this is not history speaking, you know?
[02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:15.800]   This is me and Norman, and I'm, you know,
[02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:18.440]   and this is what it's about.
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:21.120]   I mean, I spent a long time studying history
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:24.920]   and have enjoyed it enormously,
[02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:29.440]   but, you know, I'm an individual with my points of view,
[02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:33.000]   and one of them is that I've developed over time
[02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:39.080]   is that, you know, human want is a real tragedy for people,
[02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:44.200]   and it hurts people, and it also causes upheavals
[02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:45.660]   and difficulties and stuff.
[02:04:45.660 --> 02:04:47.960]   So I feel for people, you know?
[02:04:47.960 --> 02:04:49.440]   I feel for people in Syria.
[02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:54.440]   I feel for people in, you know, in Ethiopia, in Tigray,
[02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:56.240]   you know, when they don't have enough to eat,
[02:04:56.240 --> 02:04:58.280]   and, you know, what that does,
[02:04:58.280 --> 02:05:00.520]   I mean, it doesn't mean they don't love each other, right?
[02:05:00.520 --> 02:05:03.040]   It doesn't mean they don't love their kids,
[02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:06.720]   but it does mean that it's harder, you know, to do that.
[02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:09.320]   - I'm not so sure.
[02:05:09.320 --> 02:05:11.520]   It's obvious to me that it's harder.
[02:05:11.520 --> 02:05:13.280]   There's suffering, there's suffering,
[02:05:13.280 --> 02:05:16.560]   but the numbers, we've been talking about deaths,
[02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:17.840]   been talking about suffering,
[02:05:17.840 --> 02:05:20.000]   but the numbers we're not quantifying.
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.720]   The history that you haven't perhaps been looking at
[02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:25.000]   is all the times that people have fallen in love deeply
[02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.640]   with friends, with romantic love,
[02:05:27.640 --> 02:05:31.480]   the positive emotion that people have felt,
[02:05:31.480 --> 02:05:34.320]   and I'm not so sure that amidst the suffering,
[02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:36.680]   those moments of beauty and love can't be discovered,
[02:05:36.680 --> 02:05:38.320]   and if we look at the numbers,
[02:05:38.320 --> 02:05:40.520]   I'm not so sure the story's obvious.
[02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:45.780]   I mean, again, I suppose you may disagree
[02:05:45.780 --> 02:05:49.520]   with Viktor Frankl, I may too, maybe, depending on the day.
[02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:52.520]   I mean, he says that if there's meaning to this life at all,
[02:05:52.520 --> 02:05:53.920]   there's meaning to the suffering too,
[02:05:53.920 --> 02:05:56.240]   because suffering is part of life.
[02:05:56.240 --> 02:06:01.240]   There's something about accepting the ups and downs
[02:06:01.680 --> 02:06:03.880]   even when the downs go very low,
[02:06:03.880 --> 02:06:07.800]   and within all of it, finding a source of meaning.
[02:06:07.800 --> 02:06:09.920]   I mean, he's arguing from the perspective of psychology,
[02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:13.440]   but just this life is an incredible gift,
[02:06:13.440 --> 02:06:16.680]   almost no matter what, and I'm not,
[02:06:16.680 --> 02:06:21.120]   it's easy to look at suffering and think,
[02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:24.400]   if we just escape the suffering, it'll all be better,
[02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:27.460]   but we all die.
[02:06:27.460 --> 02:06:30.400]   There's beauty in the whole thing,
[02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:34.080]   and it is true that it's just,
[02:06:34.080 --> 02:06:35.360]   from all the stories I've read,
[02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:37.680]   especially in "Famine" and "Starvation,"
[02:06:37.680 --> 02:06:41.320]   it's just horrible, it is horrible suffering,
[02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:46.000]   but I also just want to say that there's love amidst it,
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:47.360]   and we can't forget that.
[02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:50.320]   - No, no, I don't forget it, I don't forget it, but--
[02:06:50.320 --> 02:06:52.880]   - And I think it's from the stories.
[02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:56.800]   Now, I don't want to make that compromise or that trade,
[02:06:56.800 --> 02:06:59.640]   but the intensity of friendship in war,
[02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:04.560]   the intensity of love in war is very high,
[02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:07.240]   so I'm not sure what to make of these calculations,
[02:07:07.240 --> 02:07:08.860]   but if you look at the stories,
[02:07:08.860 --> 02:07:10.400]   some of the people I'm closest with,
[02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:12.360]   and I've never experienced anything
[02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:14.280]   even close to any of this,
[02:07:14.280 --> 02:07:15.760]   but some of the people I'm closest with
[02:07:15.760 --> 02:07:18.320]   is people I've gone through difficult times with.
[02:07:18.320 --> 02:07:20.040]   There's something about that.
[02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:24.880]   They're a society or a group where things are easy.
[02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:27.600]   The intensity of the connection between human beings
[02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:29.040]   is not as strong.
[02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:31.440]   I don't know what to do with that calculus,
[02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:32.800]   because I, too, agree with you.
[02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:37.600]   I want to have as little suffering in the world as possible,
[02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:39.400]   but we have to remember about the love
[02:07:39.400 --> 02:07:41.000]   and the depth of human connection
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:42.920]   and find the right balance there.
[02:07:42.920 --> 02:07:46.840]   - No, there's something to what you're saying.
[02:07:46.840 --> 02:07:48.480]   There's clearly something to what you're saying.
[02:07:48.480 --> 02:07:50.720]   I was just thinking about the Soviet Union
[02:07:50.720 --> 02:07:53.480]   when I lived there, and people on the streets
[02:07:53.480 --> 02:07:56.760]   were so mean to one another, and they never smiled.
[02:07:56.760 --> 02:07:57.600]   You grew up there?
[02:07:57.720 --> 02:07:58.920]   - No, but you were too young to be.
[02:07:58.920 --> 02:08:00.320]   - No, no, I remember well.
[02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:01.840]   I came here when I was 13, yeah.
[02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:04.680]   - Okay, so anyway, I remember living there
[02:08:04.680 --> 02:08:07.080]   and just how hard people were on each other on the streets,
[02:08:07.080 --> 02:08:09.000]   and when you got inside people's apartments,
[02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.240]   when they started to trust you,
[02:08:11.240 --> 02:08:14.100]   the friendships were so intense and so wonderful.
[02:08:14.100 --> 02:08:19.720]   So in that sense, I mean, they did live a hard life,
[02:08:19.720 --> 02:08:21.480]   but there was enough food on the table,
[02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:23.000]   and there was a roof over their heads.
[02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:24.040]   - There's a certain line.
[02:08:24.040 --> 02:08:26.000]   - There's a certain, there are lines.
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.200]   I don't think there's one line,
[02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:29.960]   but it's kind of a shading.
[02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:31.280]   And the other story I was thinking of
[02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:33.520]   as you were talking was, it's not a story,
[02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:38.480]   it's a history, a book by a friend of mine
[02:08:38.480 --> 02:08:43.480]   who wrote about love in the camps,
[02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:48.260]   in the refugee camps for Jews in Germany after the war.
[02:08:48.260 --> 02:08:51.280]   So these were Jews who had come mostly from Poland,
[02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:56.360]   and some survived the camps, came from awful circumstances,
[02:08:56.360 --> 02:08:58.840]   and then they were put in these camps,
[02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:00.840]   which were not joyful places.
[02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:03.080]   I mean, they were guarded sometimes by Germans even,
[02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:06.280]   but they're basically under the British control,
[02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:08.120]   and they were trying to get to Israel,
[02:09:08.120 --> 02:09:11.920]   trying to get to Palestine right after the war,
[02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:16.060]   and how many pairs there were, how many people coupled up.
[02:09:16.060 --> 02:09:18.640]   But remember, this is after being in the concentration camp.
[02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:20.600]   It's not being in the concentration camp,
[02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:25.600]   and it's also being free, to more or less free.
[02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:28.160]   You know, to express their emotions,
[02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:32.960]   and to be human beings after this horrible thing
[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:34.360]   which they suffered.
[02:09:34.360 --> 02:09:36.400]   So I wonder whether there's, you know,
[02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:38.240]   as you say, some kind of calculus there
[02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:42.680]   where the level of suffering is such
[02:09:42.680 --> 02:09:47.200]   that it's just too much for humans to bear.
[02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:51.120]   And which I would suggest,
[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:52.640]   I mean, I haven't studied this myself,
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:54.440]   I'm just giving you my point of view,
[02:09:54.440 --> 02:09:57.480]   you know, my off-the-cuff remarks here,
[02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:00.040]   but it was very inspiring to read about these couples
[02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:01.840]   who had met right in these camps
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:06.160]   and started to couple up, you know, and get married,
[02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:09.400]   and try to find their way to Palestine,
[02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:11.520]   which was a difficult thing to do then.
[02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:14.440]   - When did you live in Russia, in the Soviet Union?
[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:16.080]   What's your memory of that time?
[02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:18.480]   - Well, so a number of different times.
[02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:22.200]   So I went there, I first went there in '69, '70.
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:23.760]   - Wow. - A long time ago.
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:28.720]   And then I lived in Leningrad mostly,
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:31.600]   but also in Moscow in 1975.
[02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:33.700]   So it was detente time,
[02:10:33.700 --> 02:10:39.480]   but it was also a time of political uncertainty
[02:10:39.480 --> 02:10:44.480]   and also hardship, you know, for Russians themselves.
[02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:46.040]   You know, standing in long lines,
[02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:47.320]   I mean, you must remember this,
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:51.800]   for food and for getting anything was almost impossible.
[02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:55.440]   It was a time when Jews were trying to get out.
[02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:59.880]   In fact, I just talked to a friend of mine from those days
[02:10:59.880 --> 02:11:01.720]   who I helped get out and get to Boston,
[02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:05.360]   and lovely people who had managed to have a good life
[02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:08.760]   in the United States after they left.
[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:10.000]   But it wasn't an easy time.
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:11.720]   It wasn't an easy time at all.
[02:11:11.720 --> 02:11:13.920]   I remember people set fire to their doors,
[02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:17.920]   and, you know, their daughter was persecuted in school,
[02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:21.480]   you know, once they declared that they wanted to immigrate,
[02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:22.400]   and that sort of thing.
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:25.280]   So it was a very, it was a lot of anti-Semitism.
[02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:28.600]   So it was a tough time.
[02:11:28.600 --> 02:11:32.360]   Dissidents, you know, hung out with some dissidents,
[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:34.220]   and one guy was actually killed.
[02:11:34.220 --> 02:11:38.560]   We think by the, nobody knows exactly by the KGB,
[02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:42.320]   but his art studio was, he had a separate studio
[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:44.780]   in Leningrad, St. Petersburg today.
[02:11:44.780 --> 02:11:49.720]   You know, just a small studio where he did his art,
[02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:51.200]   and somebody set it on fire.
[02:11:51.720 --> 02:11:53.320]   And we think it was KGB, but, you know,
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:54.440]   you never really know.
[02:11:54.440 --> 02:11:57.920]   And he died in that fire.
[02:11:57.920 --> 02:12:01.480]   So, you know, it was not a, it was a tough time.
[02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:04.680]   And, you know, you knew you were followed,
[02:12:04.680 --> 02:12:08.360]   you knew you were being reported on as a foreign scholar,
[02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:09.180]   as I was.
[02:12:09.180 --> 02:12:12.400]   There was a formal exchange between the United States
[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:15.060]   and the Soviet Union, and, you know,
[02:12:15.060 --> 02:12:16.680]   they let me work in the archives,
[02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:19.920]   but then, you know, Ivanov got to work in the-
[02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:22.320]   - Right. - In the physics lab
[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:24.200]   at Rochester or something like that.
[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:29.200]   You know, so it was an exchange which sent historians
[02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:33.600]   and literary people and some social scientists to Russia,
[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:35.800]   and they sent all scientists here to, you know,
[02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:38.320]   grab what they could from MIT and those places.
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:39.400]   (Lex laughing)
[02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:40.640]   - How is your Russian?
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:44.560]   Do you have any knowledge of Russian language
[02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:46.320]   that has helped you to understand?
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:47.480]   - Oh, yeah, yeah.
[02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:50.160]   I mean, I can read it fine.
[02:12:50.160 --> 02:12:52.920]   And the speaking, you know, comes and goes,
[02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:54.640]   depending on whether I'm there,
[02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:55.880]   or whether I've been there recently,
[02:12:55.880 --> 02:12:57.480]   or if I spend some time there,
[02:12:57.480 --> 02:12:58.640]   because I really need, you know,
[02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:00.480]   I have Russian friends who speak just Russian.
[02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:04.320]   So, you know, when I'm there, I then, you know,
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:05.800]   I can communicate pretty well.
[02:13:05.800 --> 02:13:08.120]   I can't really write it, unfortunately.
[02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:11.900]   I mean, I can, but it's not very good.
[02:13:11.900 --> 02:13:13.040]   But I get along fine.
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:17.440]   - What's your fondest memory of the Soviet Union
[02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:18.840]   or Russia? - It's friends.
[02:13:18.840 --> 02:13:20.920]   - Friends. - It's friends.
[02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:24.640]   - Was it vodka involved, or is it just vodka involved?
[02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:25.720]   Is it-- - A little bit.
[02:13:25.720 --> 02:13:27.040]   You know, I'm not much of a drinker.
[02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:28.520]   - Yeah. - So I would, you know,
[02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:31.800]   they'd just make fun of me, and I'd make fun of myself.
[02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:32.960]   That was easy enough.
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:35.720]   I don't really like, you know, a heavy drink.
[02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:37.000]   I've done a lot of that.
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:37.880]   - Yeah. - Not a lot.
[02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:40.240]   I've done some of that, but I never really enjoyed it,
[02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:42.600]   and would get sick and stuff.
[02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:45.360]   But no, it's friends.
[02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:49.280]   You know, one friend I made in the dormitory,
[02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:51.480]   you know, it was a dormitory for foreigners,
[02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:56.240]   but also Siberians who had come, you know,
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:13:58.840]   to Leningrad to study.
[02:13:58.840 --> 02:14:00.360]   And so I met a couple of guys,
[02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:04.600]   and one in particular from Omsk became a wonderful friend.
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:06.320]   And we talked and talked and talked.
[02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:08.320]   Outside, you know, we would go walk outside,
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:10.520]   'cause we both knew they were, you know,
[02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:12.060]   people were listening and stuff.
[02:14:12.060 --> 02:14:15.040]   And he would say, well, this is, he was an historian,
[02:14:15.040 --> 02:14:16.840]   you know, and so we would talk history.
[02:14:16.840 --> 02:14:18.560]   And he'd say, well, this was the case, wasn't it?
[02:14:18.560 --> 02:14:21.120]   I said, no, I'm sorry, Sasha, it wasn't the case.
[02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:23.960]   It was, you know, we think Stalin
[02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:26.440]   actually had a role in killing Kirov.
[02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:29.000]   I mean, we're not sure, but, you know, he said, no.
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:29.920]   I said, yeah.
[02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:32.120]   You know, so, you know, we had these conversations,
[02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:36.600]   and he was, he was, what I would,
[02:14:36.600 --> 02:14:38.240]   I don't know if he would agree with me or not.
[02:14:38.240 --> 02:14:41.080]   I mean, we're still friends, so he was--
[02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:42.560]   - He's gonna check in with you after this.
[02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:43.960]   - Maybe he'll listen to the blog,
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:45.240]   or I'll send it to him or something.
[02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:48.160]   He was a kind of naive Marxist-Leninist.
[02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:51.280]   And he thought I was, you know, I was, you know,
[02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:52.800]   I had this capitalist ideology.
[02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:54.280]   He'd say, what ideology do you have?
[02:14:54.280 --> 02:14:56.400]   And I said, I don't have an ideology.
[02:14:56.400 --> 02:14:58.200]   You know, I try to just put together
[02:14:58.200 --> 02:15:02.640]   kind of reason and facts and accurate stories
[02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:03.860]   and try to tell them in that way.
[02:15:03.860 --> 02:15:05.480]   No, no, no, no, you must, you know,
[02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:07.560]   you're a bourgeois, you know, this or that.
[02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:09.160]   I said, no, I'm really not.
[02:15:09.160 --> 02:15:11.940]   And so we would have these talks
[02:15:11.940 --> 02:15:13.160]   and these kind of arguments,
[02:15:13.160 --> 02:15:16.720]   and then, I mean, sure enough, you know,
[02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:19.240]   we corresponded for a while,
[02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:20.960]   and then he had to stop corresponding
[02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:25.640]   because he became a kind of local official in Omsk.
[02:15:25.640 --> 02:15:29.560]   And he sort of migrated more and more to being a Democrat.
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:31.600]   And he was then in the, you know,
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:34.880]   Democratic movement under Gorbachev,
[02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:38.500]   and, you know, in the Council of People's Deputies,
[02:15:38.500 --> 02:15:40.600]   which they set up, which was, you know,
[02:15:41.680 --> 02:15:45.200]   elected as a Democrat from Omsk
[02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:49.480]   and had a political career through the Yeltsin period.
[02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:52.780]   And once Putin came along, you know, it was over.
[02:15:52.780 --> 02:15:56.200]   He didn't like Putin, and, you know,
[02:15:56.200 --> 02:15:59.160]   and Putin didn't like the Yeltsin people, right,
[02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:02.640]   who were, tried to be, some of them tried to be Democrats.
[02:16:02.640 --> 02:16:04.200]   And Sasha was one who really did.
[02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:06.600]   He just published his memoirs in Russian, by the way,
[02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:08.040]   which are very good, I think.
[02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:10.380]   - Yeah, they're really good.
[02:16:11.240 --> 02:16:14.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:16.040]   That's what it's called.
[02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:18.040]   It's hard to translate in English.
[02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:19.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:22.040]   But I translated it four points once for him.
[02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:23.040]   - This is so beautiful.
[02:16:23.040 --> 02:16:27.360]   Like, do you find that the translation is a problem or no?
[02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:28.200]   It's such a different language.
[02:16:28.200 --> 02:16:30.160]   - Yes, translation is very difficult.
[02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:31.320]   - With the Russian language, I mean,
[02:16:31.320 --> 02:16:35.640]   it's the only language I know deeply, except English.
[02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:38.800]   And it seems like so much is lost of the pain,
[02:16:38.800 --> 02:16:40.700]   the poetry, the beauty of the people.
[02:16:40.700 --> 02:16:43.320]   - And translators are to be treasured,
[02:16:43.320 --> 02:16:45.160]   and good ones to be treasured.
[02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:47.780]   I mean, those who do the translations, you know,
[02:16:47.780 --> 02:16:50.600]   when you read things in translation,
[02:16:50.600 --> 02:16:52.080]   sometimes they're quite beautiful, you know,
[02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:54.440]   whether it's Russian or Polish or German or anything,
[02:16:54.440 --> 02:16:55.360]   French, people.
[02:16:55.360 --> 02:16:57.480]   - Yeah, I'm actually traveling to Paris
[02:16:57.480 --> 02:17:01.260]   to talk to the famous translators, the Dostoevsky Tolstoy.
[02:17:01.260 --> 02:17:04.560]   And I'm just gonna do several conversations with them
[02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:06.400]   about, like, you could just sometimes
[02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:07.880]   just grab a single sentence
[02:17:07.880 --> 02:17:10.480]   and just talk about the translation in that sentence.
[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:14.800]   That's, and also, as you said,
[02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:16.140]   I would love to be a fly on the wall
[02:17:16.140 --> 02:17:17.540]   with some of those friends that you had,
[02:17:17.540 --> 02:17:20.420]   because the perspective on history,
[02:17:20.420 --> 02:17:22.840]   non-academic, sort of without,
[02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:26.020]   just as human beings, is so different
[02:17:26.020 --> 02:17:28.340]   from the United States versus Russia.
[02:17:28.340 --> 02:17:30.600]   When you talk about the way the World War II was perceived
[02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:35.240]   and all those kinds of things, it's fascinating.
[02:17:35.240 --> 02:17:39.500]   History also has in it opinion and perspective.
[02:17:39.500 --> 02:17:41.860]   And so sometimes stripping that away is really difficult.
[02:17:41.860 --> 02:17:43.060]   And then I guess that is your job,
[02:17:43.060 --> 02:17:47.540]   and at its highest form, that is what you do as a historian.
[02:17:47.540 --> 02:17:52.540]   Well, Norman, (speaking in foreign language)
[02:17:52.540 --> 02:17:54.540]   I really appreciate your valuable time.
[02:17:54.540 --> 02:17:56.060]   It's truly an honor to talk to you,
[02:17:56.060 --> 02:18:00.280]   and thank you for taking us through a trip
[02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:02.780]   through some of the worst parts of human history,
[02:18:02.780 --> 02:18:06.340]   and talking about hope and love at the end.
[02:18:06.340 --> 02:18:08.020]   So I really appreciate your time today.
[02:18:08.020 --> 02:18:09.100]   - Okay, thank you. - Thank you.
[02:18:09.100 --> 02:18:10.400]   - Thank you for having me.
[02:18:10.400 --> 02:18:12.860]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:18:12.860 --> 02:18:14.260]   with Norman Naimark.

[02:18:17.940 --> 02:18:21.180]   And now, let me leave you with some words from Stalin.
[02:18:21.180 --> 02:18:23.700]   "A single death is a tragedy.
[02:18:23.700 --> 02:18:26.340]   "A million deaths is a statistic."
[02:18:26.340 --> 02:18:30.500]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
