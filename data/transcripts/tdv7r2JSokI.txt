[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   the whole point of relativity is to say there's no such thing as right now when you're far away.
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.200]   And that is doubly true for what's inside a black hole. And you might think, well,
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.960]   the galaxy is very big. It's really not. It's some tens of thousands of light years across
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.920]   and billions of years old. So, you don't need to move at a high fraction of the speed of light to
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:31.760]   fill the galaxy. The number of worlds is very, very, very, very big. Where do those worlds fit?
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:40.000]   Where do they go? So, the short answer is the worlds don't exist in space.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.120]   Space exists separately in each world.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.720]   The following is a conversation with Sean Carroll, his third time in this podcast. He is a theoretical
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.480]   physicist at John Hopkins, host of the Mindscape podcast that I personally love and highly
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.320]   recommend, and author of many books, including the most recent book series called The Biggest Ideas
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.320]   in the Universe, the first book of which is titled Space, Time, and Motion, and it's on the topic of
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.880]   general relativity. And the second, coming out on May 14th, so you should definitely pre-order it,
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.000]   is titled Quanta and Fields, and that one is on the topic of quantum mechanics.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.800]   Sean is a legit active theoretical physicist, and at the same time, is one of the greatest
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.360]   communicators of physics ever. I highly encourage you listen to his podcast, read his books,
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:44.000]   and pre-order the new book to support his work. This was, as always, a big honor and a pleasure
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.960]   for me. This is Alex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.560]   in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Sean Carroll. In book one of the series,
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.600]   The Biggest Ideas in the Universe, called Space, Time, Motion, you take on classical mechanics,
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.240]   general relativity, by taking on the main equation of general relativity and making it
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:15.440]   accessible, easy to understand. So maybe at the high level, what is general relativity?
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.320]   What's a good way to start to try to explain it? - Probably the best way to start to try to explain
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:27.600]   it is special relativity, which came first, 1905. It was the culmination, right, of many decades of
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.880]   people putting things together, but it was Einstein in 1905. In fact, it wasn't even Einstein. I should
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:40.640]   give more credit to Minkowski in 1907. So Einstein in 1905 figured out that you could get rid of the
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.800]   ether, the idea of a rest frame for the universe, and all the equations of physics would make sense
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.320]   with the speed of light being a maximum. But then it was Minkowski, who used to be Einstein's
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.560]   professor in 1907, who realized the most elegant way of thinking about this idea of Einstein's was
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:06.480]   to blend space and time together into space-time, to really imagine that there is no hard and fast
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.560]   division of the four-dimensional world in which we live into space and time separately. Einstein was
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.160]   at first dismissive of this. He thought it was just like, oh, the mathematicians are over-formalizing
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.440]   again. But then he later realized that if space-time is a thing, it can have properties.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.480]   And in particular, it can have a geometry. It can be curved from place to place. And that was what
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.560]   let him solve the problem of gravity. He had previously been trying to fit in what we knew
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.960]   about gravity from Newtonian mechanics, the inverse square law of gravity, to his new relativistic
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:50.160]   theory. It didn't work. So the final leap was to say gravity is the curvature of space-time.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.440]   And that statement is basically general relativity. >> And the tension with Minkowski was,
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.800]   he was a mathematician. >> Yes.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.680]   >> So there's a tension between physics and mathematics. In fact, in your lecture about
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:09.280]   this equation, one of them, you say that Einstein is a better physicist than he gets credit for.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.200]   >> Yep. >> I know, that's hard. That's a little
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.400]   bit of a joke there, right? >> Yeah.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:21.120]   >> Because we all give Einstein a lot of credit. But then we also, partly based on fact, but partly
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.920]   to make ourselves feel better, tell ourselves a story about how later in life, Einstein couldn't
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.720]   keep up. There were younger people doing quantum mechanics and quantum field theory and particle
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.240]   physics. And he was just sort of unable to really philosophically get over his objections to that.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.360]   And I think that that story about the latter part is completely wrong, almost 180 degrees wrong. I
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.760]   think that Einstein understood quantum mechanics as well as anyone, at least up through the 1930s.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.520]   I think that his philosophical objections to it are correct. So he should actually have been
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:02.080]   taken much more seriously about that. And what he did, what he achieved in trying to think these
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:08.640]   problems through is to really basically understand the idea of quantum entanglement, which is kind of
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.760]   important these days when it comes to understanding quantum mechanics. Now, it's true that in the 40s
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:20.720]   and 50s, he placed his efforts in hopes for unifying electricity and magnetism with gravity
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.240]   that didn't really work out very well. All of us try things that don't work out. I don't hold
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.440]   that against him. But in terms of IQ points, in terms of trying to be a clear thinking physicist,
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.960]   he was really, really great. - What does greatness look like for a
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:42.080]   physicist? So how difficult is it to take the leap from special relativity to general relativity?
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:50.400]   How difficult is it to imagine that, to consider space-time together and to imagine that there's
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.360]   a curvature to this whole thing? - Yeah, that's a great question. I think
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.840]   that if you want to make the case for Einstein's greatness, which is not hard to do, there's two
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:09.200]   things you point at. One is in 1905, his famous miracle year, he writes three different papers
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.840]   on three wildly different subjects, all of which would make you famous just for writing that one
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:23.120]   paper. Special relativity is one of them. Brownian motion is another one, which is just the little
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.640]   vibrations of tiny little dust specks in the air. But who cares about that? What matters is
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.960]   it proves the existence of atoms. He explains Brownian motion by imagining there are molecules
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.160]   in the air and deriving their properties. Brilliant. And then he basically starts the
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.280]   world on the road to quantum mechanics with his paper on, which again is given a boring
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.440]   label of the photoelectric effect. What it really was is he invented photons. He showed that light
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.240]   should be thought of as particles as well as waves. And he did all three of those very different
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.760]   things in one year. Okay. But the other thing that gets him genius status is like you say,
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.280]   general relativity. So this takes 10 years from 1905 to 1915. He wasn't only doing general
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.680]   relativity. He was working on other things. He wrote, he invented a refrigerator. He did various
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.320]   interesting things. And he wasn't even the only one working on the problem. There were other people
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:22.560]   who suggested relativistic theories of gravity, but he really applied himself to it. And I think
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:30.080]   as your question suggests, the solution was not a matter of turning a crank. It was something
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:38.240]   fundamentally creative. In his own telling of the story, his greatest moment, his happiest moment
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.520]   was when he realized that if the way that we would say it in modern terms, if you were in a rocket
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:50.640]   ship accelerating at one G, at one acceleration due to gravity, if the rocket ship were very quiet,
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.160]   you wouldn't be able to know the difference between being in a rocket ship and being on the
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:08:00.480]   surface of the earth. Gravity is sort of not detectable or at least not distinguishable
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:05.680]   from acceleration. So number one, that's a pretty clever thing to think. But number two, if you or I
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:11.840]   had that thought, we would have gone, "Huh, we're pretty clever." He reasons from there to say,
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:18.480]   "Okay, if gravity is not detectable, then it can't be like an ordinary force, right? The electromagnetic
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.200]   force is detectable. We can put charged particles around. Positively charged particles and negatively
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:28.320]   charged particles respond differently to an electric field or to a magnetic field." He
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:33.280]   realizes that what his thought experiment showed or at least suggested is that gravity isn't like
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:39.520]   that. Everything responds in the same way to gravity. How could that be the case? And then
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:44.080]   this other leap he makes is, "Oh, it's because it's the curvature of space-time, right?" It's a feature
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:49.360]   of space-time. It's not a force on top of it. And the feature that it is is curvature. And then
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:55.920]   finally he says, "Okay, clearly I'm going to need the mathematical tools necessary to describe
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:03.040]   curvature. I don't know them, so I will learn them." And they didn't have MOOCs or AI helpers
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.200]   back in those days. He had to sit down and read the math papers and he taught himself differential
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.920]   geometry and invented general relativity. >> What about the step of including time
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:18.720]   as just another dimension, so combining space and time? Is that a simple mathematical leap
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.960]   as Minkowski suggested? >> It's certainly not simple, actually.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:30.960]   It's a profound insight. That's why I said I think we should give Minkowski more credit than we do.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:36.640]   He's the one who really put the finishing touches on special relativity. Again, many people had
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:43.840]   talked about how things change when you move close to the speed of light, what Maxwell's equations
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:48.400]   of electromagnetism predict and so forth, what their symmetries are. So people like Lorentz
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.920]   and Fitzgerald and Poincaré, there's a story that goes there. And in the usual telling, Einstein
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:59.440]   sort of puts the capstone on it. He's the one who says, "All of this makes much more sense if there
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:04.320]   just is no ether. It is undetectable. We don't know how fast." Everything is relative, thus the
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:10.720]   name relativity. But he didn't take the actual final step, which was to realize that the underlying
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:17.040]   structure that he had invented is best thought of as unifying space and time together. I honestly
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:23.040]   don't know what was going through Minkowski's mind when he thought that. I'm not sure if he was so
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:28.880]   mathematically adept that it was just clear to him, or he was really struggling it and he did
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.360]   trial and error for a while. I'm not sure. >> I mean, do you, for him or for Einstein,
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.000]   visualize the four-dimensional space, try to play with the idea of time as just another dimension?
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.720]   >> Oh, yeah, all the time. I mean, we, of course, make our lives easy by ignoring
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.440]   two of the dimensions of space. So instead of four-dimensional space-time, we just
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:52.240]   draw pictures of one dimension of space, one dimension of time, the so-called space-time
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:57.920]   diagram. But I mean, maybe this is lurking underneath your question, but even the best
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:04.880]   physicists will draw a vertical axis and a horizontal axis, and they'll go space-time.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:11.280]   But deep down, that's wrong because you're sort of preferring one direction of space and one
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:16.080]   direction of time, and it's really the whole two-dimensional thing that is space-time.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:22.640]   The more legitimate thing to draw on that picture are rays of light, are light cones.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:28.560]   From every point, there is a fixed direction at which the speed of light would represent,
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:34.320]   and that is actually inherent in the structure. The division into space and time is something
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.320]   that's easy for us human beings. >> What is the difference between space
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:43.760]   and time from the perspective of general relativity? >> It's the difference between x and y when you
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.960]   draw axes on a piece of paper. >> So there's really no difference.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:51.920]   >> There's almost no difference. There's one difference that is kind of important, which is
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:57.200]   the following. If you have a curve in space, I'm going to draw it horizontally because that's
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.760]   usually what we do in space-time diagrams. If you have a curve in space, you've heard the motto
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.960]   before that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. If you have a curve
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:12.480]   in time, which is, by the way, literally all of our lives, right? We all evolve in time. So you
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:18.240]   can start with one event in space-time and another event in space-time. What Minkowski points out
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:26.240]   is that the time you measure along your trajectory in the universe is precisely analogous to the
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:33.520]   distance you travel on a curve through space. By precisely, I mean it is also true that the actual
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:38.240]   distance you travel through depends on your path, right? You can go a straight line, shortest
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.680]   distance, and curvy line would be longer. The time you measure in space-time, the literal time that
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:49.680]   takes off on your clock, also depends on your path. But it depends on it the other way. So that
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:55.760]   the longest time between two points is a straight line. And if you zig back and forth in space-time,
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.400]   you take less and less time to go from point A to point B. >>
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:05.760]   How do we make sense of that, the difference between the observed reality and the
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:12.480]   objective reality underneath it? Or is objective reality a silly notion,
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.880]   given general relativity? >> I'm a huge believer in objective
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:20.160]   reality. I think that objective reality objectively is real. But I do think that
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:28.560]   people kind of are a little overly casual about the relationship between what we observe and
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:34.720]   objective reality in the following sense. Of course, in order to explain the world,
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.600]   our starting point and our ending point is our observations, our experimental input,
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:46.480]   the phenomena we experience and see around us in the world. But in between, there's a theory.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:54.720]   There's a mathematical formalization of our ideas about what is going on. And if a theory
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:14:01.120]   fits the data and is very simple and makes sense in its own terms, then we say that the theory is
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:08.800]   right. And that means that we should attribute some reality to the entities that play an important
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.720]   role in that theory, at least provisionally until we come up with a better theory down the road.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:18.560]   >> I think a nice way to test the difference between objective reality and the observed reality
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:28.000]   is what happens at the edge of the horizon of a black hole. So technically, as you get closer
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.200]   to that horizon, time stands still. >> Yes and no. It depends on exactly
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:39.760]   how careful we're being. So here is a bunch of things I think are correct.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:46.880]   If you imagine there is a black hole spacetime, so like the whole solution to Einstein's equation,
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:52.880]   and you treat you and me as what we call test particles. So we don't have any gravitational
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.320]   fields ourselves. We just move around in the gravitational field. That's obviously an
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:01.760]   approximate approximation, but let's imagine that. And you stand outside the black hole,
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:07.760]   and I fall in. And as I'm falling in, I'm waving to you because I'm going into the black hole.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:14.960]   You will see me move more and more slowly. And also the light from me is redshifted,
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.200]   so I kind of look embarrassed because I'm falling into a black hole. And there is a limit.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:27.520]   There's a last moment that light will be emitted from me, from your perspective, forever. Now,
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:34.720]   you don't literally see it because I'm emitting photons more and more slowly because from your
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:41.760]   point of view. So it's not like I'm equally bright. I basically fade from view in that picture. So
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:47.520]   that's one approximation. The other approximation is I do have a gravitational field of my own,
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:52.880]   and therefore, as I approach the black hole, the black hole doesn't just sit there and let me pass
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:16:00.960]   through. It kind of moves out to eat me up because its net energy mass is going to be mine plus its.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.440]   But roughly speaking, yes. So I don't like to go to the dramatic extremes because that's where
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.720]   the approximations break down. But if you see something falling into a black hole,
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.120]   you see its clock ticking more and more slowly. >> How do we know it fell in?
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:19.040]   >> We don't. I mean, how would we? Because it's always possible that right at the last minute,
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:24.560]   it had a change of heart and starts accelerating away, right? If you don't see it pass in,
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.880]   you don't know. And let's point out that as smart as Einstein was, he never figured out
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:34.320]   black holes, and he could have. It's kind of embarrassing. It took decades for people
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:39.280]   thinking about general relativity to understand that there are such things as black holes.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:44.960]   Because basically, Einstein comes up with general relativity in 1915. Two years later,
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:52.640]   Schwarzschild, Carl Schwarzschild, derives the solution to Einstein's equation that represents
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.920]   a black hole, the Schwarzschild solution. No one recognized it for what it was until the '50s,
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.720]   David Finkelstein and other people. And that's just one of these examples of physicists not
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.480]   being as clever as they should have been. >> Well, that's the singularity. That's the
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:12.480]   edge of the theory, the limit. So it's understandable that it's difficult to imagine
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.280]   the limit of things. >> It is absolutely hard
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:19.920]   to imagine, and a black hole is very different in many ways from what we're used to. On the other
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:26.320]   hand, I mean, the real reason, of course, is that between 1915 and 1955, there's a bunch of other
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:30.240]   things that are really interesting going on in physics, all particle physics and quantum field
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:35.920]   theory. So many of the greatest minds were focused on that. But still, if the universe hands you a
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:40.960]   solution to general relativity in terms of curved spacetime and it's kind of mysterious, certain
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:46.160]   features of it, I would put some effort in trying to figure it out. >> So how does a black hole work?
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:51.520]   Put yourself in the shoes of Einstein and take general relativity to its natural conclusion
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:57.360]   about these massive things. >> It's best to think of a black hole as not an object so much as a
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:04.240]   region of spacetime, okay? It's a region with the property, at least in classical general relativity,
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.840]   quantum mechanics makes everything harder, but let's imagine we're being classical for the moment.
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:12.160]   It's a region of spacetime with the property that if you enter, you can't leave.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:19.040]   Literally, the equivalent of escaping a black hole would be moving faster than the speed of light.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.720]   They are both precisely equally difficult. You would have to move faster than the speed of light
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:29.120]   to escape from the black hole. So once you're in, that's fine. In principle, you don't even notice
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:33.760]   when you cross the event horizon, as we call it. The event horizon is that point of no return,
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:39.520]   where once you're inside, you can't leave. But meanwhile, the spacetime is sort of collapsing
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:46.400]   around you to ultimately a singularity in your future, which means that the gravitational
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:51.600]   forces are so strong, they tear your body apart and you will die in a finite amount of time.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.200]   The time it takes, if the black hole is about the mass of the sun,
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:00.800]   to go from the event horizon to the singularity takes about one millionth of a second.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:07.440]   >> And what happens to you if you fall into the black hole? If we think of an object as
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:15.600]   information, that information gets destroyed. >> Well, you've raised a crucially difficult point.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:21.440]   So that's why I keep needing to distinguish between black holes according to Einstein's
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:26.080]   theory of general relativity, which is book one of spacetime and geometry, which is perfectly
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:32.960]   classical. And then come the 1970s, we start asking about quantum mechanics and what happens
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.440]   in quantum mechanics. According to classical general relativity, the information that makes
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:44.160]   up you when you fall into the black hole is lost to the outside world. It's there, it's inside the
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:50.640]   black hole, but we can't get it anymore. In the 1970s, Stephen Hawking comes along and points out
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:56.880]   that black holes radiate. They give off photons and other particles to the universe around them,
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:01.280]   and as they radiate, they lose mass and eventually they evaporate, they disappear.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:08.640]   So once that happens, I can no longer say the information about you or a book that I threw in
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.080]   the black hole or whatever is still there, is hidden behind the black hole, because the black
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:18.720]   hole's gone away. So either that information is destroyed, like you said, or it is somehow
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:24.800]   transferred to the radiation that is coming out, to the Hawking radiation. A large majority of
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:29.360]   people who think about this believe that the information is somehow transferred to the
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:36.160]   radiation and information is conserved. That is a feature both of general relativity by itself
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.320]   and of quantum mechanics by itself. So when you put them together, that should still be a feature.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:44.080]   We don't know that for sure. There are people who have doubted it, including Stephen Hawking for a
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:51.200]   long time. But that's what most people think. And so what we're trying to do now in a topic which
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:56.000]   has generated many, many hundreds of papers, called the Black Hole Information Loss Puzzle,
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.840]   is figure out how to get the information from you or the book into the radiation that is escaping
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:08.720]   the black hole. - Is there any way to observe Hawking radiation to a degree where you can
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.080]   start getting insight? Or is this all just in the space of theory right now?
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:18.320]   - Right now, we are nowhere close to observing Hawking radiation. Here's the sad fact. The
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:26.320]   larger the black hole is, the lower its temperature is. So a small black hole, like a microscopically
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:30.080]   small black hole, might be very visible. It's given off light. But something like the black
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:35.200]   hole at the center of our galaxy, three million times the mass of the Sun or something like that,
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:42.400]   Sagittarius A*, that is so cold and low temperature that its radiation will never be observable.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:47.440]   Black holes are hard to make. We don't have any nearby. The ones we have out there in the
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.040]   universe are very, very faint. So there's no immediate hope for detecting Hawking radiation.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:55.520]   - Allegedly, we don't have any nearby. - As far as we know, we don't have any nearby.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:59.520]   - Could tiny ones be hard to detect somewhere at the edges of the solar system maybe?
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:05.360]   - So you don't want them to be too tiny or they're exploding. They're very bright,
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.200]   and then they will be visible. But there's absolutely a regime where black holes are
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.760]   large enough not to be visible because the larger ones are fainter, not giving off radiation,
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.960]   but small enough to not have been detected through their gravitational effect, yeah.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:21.280]   - Psychologically, just emotionally, how do you feel about black holes? Do they scare you?
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:26.720]   - I love them. I love black holes. But the universe, weirdly, makes it hard to make a
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:32.320]   black hole, right? Because you really need to squeeze an enormous amount of matter and energy
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:39.520]   into a very, very small region of space. So we know how to make stellar black holes. A supermassive
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:44.720]   star can collapse to make a black hole. We know we also have these supermassive black holes at
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:50.080]   the center of galaxies. We're a little unclear where they came from. I mean, maybe stellar black
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:57.280]   holes that got together and combined, but that's, you know, one of the exciting things about new
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:03.680]   data from the James Webb Space Telescope is that quite large black holes seem to exist relatively
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.760]   early in the history of the universe. So it was already difficult to figure out where they came
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:12.320]   from. Now it's an even tougher puzzle. - So these supermassive black holes are
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:17.120]   formed somewhere early on in the universe. I mean, that's a feature, not a bug, right,
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:23.680]   that we don't have too many of them. Otherwise we wouldn't have the time or the space to form
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:30.160]   the little pockets of complexity that we'll call humans. - I think that's fair, yeah. It's always
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:36.320]   interesting when something is difficult, but happens anyway, right? I mean, the probability
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:40.560]   of making a black hole could have been zero. It could have been one, but it's this interesting
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:44.800]   number in between, which is kind of fun. - Are there more intelligent alien civilization than
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:50.400]   there are supermassive black holes? - Yeah, I have no idea, but I think
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:56.880]   your intuition is right that it would have been easy for there to be lots of civilizations and
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:02.240]   then we would have noticed them already, and we haven't. So absolutely the simplest explanation
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:07.840]   for why we haven't is that they're not there. - Yeah, I just think it's so easy to make them,
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:12.720]   though. So there must be, I understand that's the simplest explanation, but also--
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:16.960]   - How easy is it to make life, or eukaryotic life, or multicellular life?
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:21.760]   - It seems like life finds a way. Intelligent alien civilizations,
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:29.680]   sure, maybe there is somewhere along that chain a really, really hard leap. But once you start life,
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:34.480]   once you get the origin of life, it seems like life just finds a way everywhere,
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:39.120]   in every condition. It just figures it out. - I mean, I get it. I get exactly what you're
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:45.760]   thinking. I think it's a perfectly reasonable attitude to have before you confront the data.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.960]   I would not have expected Earth to be special in any way. I would have expected there to be
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:56.800]   plenty of very noticeable extraterrestrial civilizations out there. But even if life
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:03.040]   finds a way, even if by everything you say, how long does it take for life to find a way? What
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:09.680]   if it typically takes 100 billion years? Then we'd be alone. - So it's a time thing. So to you,
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:15.360]   really, there's most likely there's no alien civilizations out there. I just, I can't see it.
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:19.360]   I believe there's a ton of them, and there's another explanation why we can't see them.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:23.920]   - I don't believe that very strongly. Look, I'm not going to place a lot of bets here. I would
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:29.840]   not, I'm both pretty up in the air about whether or not life itself is all over the place. It's
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:36.800]   possible when we visit other worlds, other solar systems, there's very tiny microscopic life,
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:42.320]   ubiquitous, but none of it has reached some complex form. It's also possible there's just,
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:47.360]   there isn't any. It's also possible that there are intelligent civilizations that have better
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:52.000]   things to do than knock on our doors. So I think we should be very humble about these things we
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.480]   know so little about. - And it's also possible there's a great filter where there's something
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:03.520]   fundamental about once a civilization develops complex enough technology, that technology is
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:10.560]   more statistically likely to destroy everybody versus to continue being creative. - That is
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.960]   absolutely possible. I'm actually putting less credence on that one just because you need it to
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:20.080]   happen every single time, right? If even one, I mean, this goes back to von Neumann pointing,
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:26.240]   John von Neumann pointed out that you don't need to send the aliens around the galaxy. You can
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:31.200]   build self-reproducing probes and send them around the galaxy. And you might think, well,
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:36.960]   the galaxy is very big. It's really not. It's some tens of thousands of light years across
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:43.920]   and billions of years old. So you don't need to move at a high fraction of the speed of light to
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:50.000]   fill the galaxy. - So if you were in an intelligent alien civilization, the dictator of one, you would
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.640]   just send out a lot of probes, self-replicating probes. - 100%. - Just spread out. - Yes. And
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:27:00.320]   what you should do, so if you want the optimistic spin, here's the optimistic spin. People looking
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:05.920]   for intelligent life elsewhere often tune in with their radio telescopes, right? At least we did
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:14.400]   before Arecibo was decommissioned. That's not a very promising way to find intelligent life
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.640]   elsewhere because why in the world would a super intelligent alien civilization waste all of its
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:26.000]   energy by beaming it in random directions into the sky? For one thing, it just passes you by,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.200]   right? So if we're here on Earth, we've only been listening to radio waves for a couple hundred
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:37.680]   years, okay? So if an intelligent alien civilization exists for a billion years,
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:43.200]   they have to pinpoint exactly the right time to send us this signal. It is much, much more
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:52.160]   efficient to send probes and to park, to go to the other solar systems, just sit there and wait
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:57.520]   for an intelligent civilization to arise in that solar system. This is kind of the 2001
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:06.320]   monolith hypothesis, right? I would be less surprised to find a sort of quiescent alien
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:12.880]   artifact in our solar system than I would to catch a radio signal from an intelligent civilization.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:17.440]   So you're a sucker for in-person conversations versus remote.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:23.200]   I just want to integrate over time. A probe can just sit there and wait,
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.040]   whereas a radio wave goes right by you.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:30.320]   How hard is it for an alien civilization, again, you're the dictator of one,
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:38.720]   to figure out a probe that is most likely to find a common language with whatever it finds?
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.400]   Couldn't it be like the elected leader of the alien civilization?
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:46.160]   Elected leader of a democratic alien civilization, yes.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:52.320]   I think we would figure out that language thing pretty quickly. I mean, maybe not as quickly as
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:57.280]   we do when different human tribes find each other because obviously there's a lot of commonalities
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:03.600]   in humanity, but there is logic in math and there is the physical world. You can point to a rock and
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:12.160]   go rock, right? I don't think it would take that long. I know that Arrival, the movie, based on a
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:17.520]   Ted Chiang story, suggested that the way that aliens communicate is going to be fundamentally
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:23.040]   different, but also they had precognition and other things I don't believe in. So I think that
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:28.160]   if we actually find aliens, that will not be our long-term problem.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:31.440]   So there's a folks, one of the places you're affiliated with is Santa Fe,
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:36.240]   and they approach the question of complexity in many different ways and ask the question in many
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:44.480]   different ways of what is life, thinking broadly. So do you would be able to find it? You show up,
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:50.960]   a probe shows up to a planet, we'll see a thing and be like, "Yeah, that's a living thing."
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:58.560]   Well, again, if it's intelligent and technologically advanced, the more short-term
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:05.920]   question of if we get some spectroscopic data from an exoplanet, so we know a little bit about
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:11.040]   what is in its atmosphere, how can we judge whether or not that atmosphere is giving us
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:15.520]   a signature of life existing? That's a very hard question that people are debating about.
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:22.640]   I mean, one very simple-minded, but perhaps interesting approach is to say small molecules
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:27.600]   don't tell you anything because even if life could make them, something else could also make them.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:31.440]   But long molecules, that's the kind of thing that life would produce.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:40.000]   - So signs of complexity. I don't know. I just have this nervous feeling that we won't be able
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.760]   to detect. We'll show up to a planet, there'll be a bunch of liquid on it. We take a swim in the
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:54.000]   liquid and we won't be able to see the intelligence in it. Whether that intelligence looks like
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:01.680]   something like ants or we'll see movement, perhaps strange movement, but we won't be able to
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:09.120]   see the intelligence in it or communicate with it. I guess if we have nearly infinite amount of time
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.480]   to play with different ideas, we might be able to.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:17.760]   - You know, I think, I mean, I'm in favor of this kind of humility, this intellectual humility that
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:23.360]   we won't know because we should be prepared for surprises. But I do always keep coming back to
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:31.200]   the idea that we all live in the same physical universe. And if, well, let's put it this way,
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:37.600]   the development of our intelligence has certainly been connected to our ability to manipulate the
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:44.800]   physical world around us. And so I would guess without 100% credence by any means, but my guess
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:52.960]   would be that any advanced kind of life would also have that capability. Both dolphins and
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:32:00.480]   octopuses are potential counter examples to that. But I think in the details, there would be enough
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.080]   similarities that we would recognize it. - I don't know how we got on this topic,
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:09.840]   but I think it was from Supermassive Black Holes. So if we return to Black Holes and talk about the
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:15.200]   holographic principle more broadly, you have a recent paper on the topic. You've been thinking
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:22.800]   about the topic in terms of rigorous research perspective and just as a popular book writer.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:27.120]   So what is the holographic principle? - Well, it goes back to this question
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:33.840]   that we were talking about with the information and how it gets out. In quantum mechanics,
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:40.160]   certainly, arguably even before quantum mechanics comes along in classical statistical mechanics,
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:45.760]   there's a relationship between information and entropy. Entropy is my favorite thing to talk
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:50.160]   about, I've written books about and will continue to write books about. So Hawking tells us that
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:55.760]   black holes have entropy. And it's a finite amount of entropy, it's not an infinite amount.
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:02.080]   But the belief is, and now we're already getting quite speculative, the belief is that the entropy
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:08.400]   of a black hole is the largest amount of entropy that you can have in a region of spacetime.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:14.640]   It's sort of the most densely packed that entropy can be. And what that means is there's sort of a
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:18.880]   maximum amount of information that you can fit into that region of space and you call it a black
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:25.200]   hole. And interestingly, you might expect if I have a box and I'm going to put information in it,
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:29.600]   and I don't tell you how I'm going to put the information in, but I ask,
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:34.960]   how does the information I can put in scale with the size of the box? You might think, well,
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:39.680]   it goes as the volume of the box because the information takes up some volume and I can only
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.680]   fit in a certain amount. And that is what you might guess for the black hole, but it's not
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:50.080]   what the answer is. The answer is that the maximum information as reflected in the black hole entropy
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:56.160]   scales as the area of the black hole's event horizon, not the volume inside.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:03.440]   So people thought about that in both deep and superficial ways for a long time and they proposed
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:10.240]   what we now call the holographic principle, that the way that spacetime and quantum gravity convey
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:18.480]   information or hold information is not different bits or qubits for quantum information at every
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:25.920]   point in spacetime. It is something holographic, which means it's sort of embedded in or located
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:32.720]   in or can be thought of as pertaining to one dimension less of the three dimensions of space
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:36.160]   that we live in. So in the case of the black hole, the event horizon is two-dimensional,
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:40.480]   embedded in a three-dimensional universe, and the holographic principle would say all of the
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:45.680]   information contained in the black hole can be thought of as living on the event horizon rather
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:52.000]   than in the interior of the black hole. I need to say one more thing about that, which is that
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.280]   this was an idea. The idea I just told you was the original holographic principle
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:59.920]   put forward by people like Gerard de Tufte and Leonard Susskind, super famous
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:06.960]   physicist. Leonard Susskind was on my podcast and gave a great talk. He's very good at explaining
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:09.280]   these things. >> "Mindscape" podcast, everybody should listen.
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:12.640]   >> "Mindscape" podcast, that's right, yes. >> And you don't just have physicists on.
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.960]   >> I don't. >> I love "Mindscape".
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.280]   >> Oh, thank you very much. >> Curiosity-driven.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:21.360]   >> Yeah, ideas, great ideas from smart people, yeah. But anyway, what I was trying to get at
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:26.480]   was Susskind and also de Tufte were a little vague. They were a little hand-wavy about holography and
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:32.080]   what it meant. Where holography, the idea that information is sort of encoded on a boundary,
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:40.880]   really came into its own was with Juan Maldacena in the 1990s and the ADS-CFD correspondence,
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:45.040]   which we don't have to get into that into any detail, but it's a whole full-blown theory.
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:52.960]   It's two different theories, one theory in n dimensions of spacetime without gravity,
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:58.400]   and another theory in n+1 dimensions of spacetime with gravity. And the idea is that this n
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:05.440]   dimensional theory is casting a hologram into the n+1 dimensional universe to make it look like it
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:13.440]   has gravity. And that's holography with a vengeance, and that's an enormous source of interest for
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:18.960]   theoretical physicists these days. >> How should we picture what impact that has,
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:24.480]   the fact that you can store all the information you could think of as all the information that
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:28.800]   goes into a black hole can be stored at the event horizon? >> Yeah, I mean, it's a good question.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:37.840]   One of the things that quantum field theory indirectly suggests is that there's not that
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:43.200]   much information in you and me compared to the volume of spacetime we take up. As far as quantum
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:50.640]   field theory is concerned, you and I are mostly empty space. And so we are not information dense,
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:56.240]   right? The density of information in us or in a book or a CD or whatever, computer RAM,
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:01.680]   is indeed encoded by volume. Like there's different bits located at different points
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:07.040]   in space, but that density of information is super duper low. So we're just like the speed
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:12.320]   of light or just like the Big Bang, for the information in a black hole, we are far away
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:17.520]   in our everyday experience from the regime where these questions become relevant. So it's very far
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:21.600]   away from our intuition. We don't really know how to think about these things. We can do the math,
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.880]   but we don't feel it in our bones. >> So you can just write off that
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.920]   weird stuff happens in a black hole. >> Well, we'd like to do better,
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:32.800]   but we're trying. I mean, that's why we have an information loss puzzle, because we haven't
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:41.360]   completely solved it. So here's just one thing to keep in mind. Once spacetime becomes flexible,
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:46.320]   which it does according to general relativity, and you have quantum mechanics, which has
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:52.320]   fluctuations and virtual particles and things like that, the very idea of a location in spacetime
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:56.640]   becomes a little bit fuzzy, right? Because it's flexible and quantum mechanics says you can't
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:03.840]   even pin it down. So information can propagate in ways that you might not have expected. And
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:08.640]   that's easy to say and it's true, but we haven't yet come up with the right way to talk about it
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:11.840]   that is perfectly rigorous. >> But it's crazy how dense
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:17.520]   with information a black hole is. And then plus quantum mechanics starts to come into play. So
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:22.240]   you almost want to romanticize the kind of interesting computation type things that are
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:25.680]   going on inside the black hole. >> You do, you do. But I'll point
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:31.200]   out one other thing. It's information dense, but it's also very, very high entropy.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:39.440]   So a black hole is kind of like a very, very, very specific random number, right? It takes a
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:44.400]   lot of digits to specify it, but the digits don't tell you anything. They don't give you anything
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:49.920]   useful to work on. So it takes a lot of information, but it's not of a form that we can
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:53.760]   learn a lot from. >> But hypothetically,
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:59.760]   I guess as you mentioned, the information might be preserved. The information that goes into a
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:04.160]   black hole, it doesn't get destroyed. So what does that mean when the entropy is really high?
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:10.960]   >> Well, the black hole, I said that the black hole is the highest density of information,
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:15.200]   but it's not the highest amount of information because the black hole can evaporate. And when
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:20.960]   it evaporates, and people have done the equations for this, when it evaporates, the entropy that
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:25.280]   it turns into is actually higher than the entropy of the black hole was, which is good because
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:30.880]   entropy is supposed to go up. But it's much more dilute, right? It's spread across a huge volume
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:38.480]   of space time. So in principle, all that you made the black hole out of, the information that it
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:43.120]   took is still there, we think, in that information, but it's scattered to the four winds.
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:47.200]   >> We just talked about the event horizon of a black hole. What's on the inside?
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.280]   What's at the center of it? >> No one's been there.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.240]   >> I came back to tell. >> So again, this is a theoretical
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:58.080]   prediction. But I'll say one super crucial feature of the black holes that we know and love,
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:03.120]   the kind that Schwarzschild first invented. There's a singularity, but it's not at the middle
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:11.280]   of the black hole. Remember, space and time are parts of one unified space time.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:16.240]   The location of the singularity in the black hole is not the middle of space, but our future.
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:22.480]   It is a moment of time. It is like a Big Crunch. The Big Bang was an expansion from a singularity
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:27.120]   in the past. Big Crunch probably doesn't exist, but if it did, it would be a collapse to a
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:32.480]   singularity in the future. That's what the interiors of black holes are like. You can be
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:37.440]   fine in the interior, but things are becoming more and more crowded. Space time is becoming
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:41.760]   more and more warped, and eventually you hit a limit, and that's the singularity in your future.
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:45.200]   >> I wonder what time is like on the inside of a black hole.
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:49.360]   >> Time always ticks by at one second per second. That's all it can ever do.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:54.640]   Time can tick by differently for different people. And so you have things like the twin paradox,
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:59.760]   where two people initially are the same age. One goes off near the speed of light and comes back.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:04.880]   Now they're not. You can even work out that the one who goes out and comes back will be younger
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:11.600]   because they did not take the shortest distance path. But locally, as far as you and your wrist
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:19.680]   watch are concerned, time is not funny. Your neurological signals in your brain and your
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:24.240]   heartbeat and your wrist watch, whatever's happening to them, is happening to all of
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:28.560]   them at the same time. So time always seems to be ticking along at the same rate.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:33.520]   >> Well, if you fall into a black hole, and then I'm an observer just watching it,
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:40.720]   and then you come out once it evaporates a million years later,
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:45.360]   I guess you'd be exactly the same age. Have you aged at all?
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:49.520]   >> You would be converted into photons. You would not be you anymore.
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:54.960]   >> Right. So it's not at all possible that information is preserved exactly as it went in.
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:59.600]   >> It depends on what you mean by preserved. It's there in the microscopic configuration
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:04.800]   of the universe. It's exactly as if I took a regular book, made a paper, and I burned it.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:10.160]   The laws of physics say that all the information in the book is still there in the heat and light
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:15.120]   and ashes. You're never going to get it. It's a matter of practice, but in principle, it's still
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:17.600]   there. >> But what about the age of things
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.560]   from the observer perspective, from outside the black hole?
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:26.240]   >> From outside the black hole, it doesn't matter because they're inside the black hole.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:30.960]   >> Okay. There's no way to escape the black hole except-
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.840]   >> To let it evaporate. >> To let it evaporate.
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.960]   >> But also, by the way, just in relativity, special relativity, forget about general relativity,
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:46.400]   it's enormously tempting to say, "Okay, here's what's happening to me right now. I want to know
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:50.800]   what's happening far away right now." The whole point of relativity is to say there's no such
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:56.880]   thing as right now when you're far away. That is doubly true for what's inside a black hole.
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:01.360]   You're tempted to say, "Well, how fast is their clock ticking?" or "How old are they now?"
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:07.280]   Not allowed to say that according to relativity. >> Because space and time are treated the same,
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:11.760]   and so it doesn't even make sense. What happens to time in the holographic principle?
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:19.040]   >> As far as we know, nothing dramatic happens. We're not anywhere close to being confident that
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:24.000]   we know what's going on here yet. So there are good unanswered questions about whether time is
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:29.840]   fundamental, whether time is emergent, whether it has something to do with quantum entanglement,
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:36.000]   whether time really exists at all, different theories, different proponents of different
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.200]   things. But there's nothing specifically about holography that would make us change our opinions
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.240]   about time, whatever they happen to be. >> But holography is fundamentally about,
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:47.040]   it's a question of space? >> It really is, yeah.
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:50.640]   >> Okay, so time is just like a- >> Time just goes along for the ride,
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:52.960]   as far as we know, yeah. >> So all the questions about time is just
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.880]   almost like separate questions, whether it's emergent and all that kind of stuff.
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:44:00.000]   >> Yeah, I mean, that might be a reflection of our ignorance right now, but yes.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.800]   >> If we figure out a lot, you know, millions of years from now about black holes,
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:10.240]   how surprised would you be if they traveled back in time and told you everything you want to know
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:17.680]   about black holes? How much do you think there is still to know? And how mind-blowing would it be?
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:27.200]   >> It does depend on what they would say. I think that there are colleagues of mine who think that
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:33.520]   we're pretty close to figuring out how information gets out of black holes, how to quantize gravity,
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:38.000]   things like that. I'm more skeptical that we are pretty close. I think that there's
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.600]   room for a bunch of surprises to come. So in that sense, I suspect I would be surprised.
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:50.160]   The biggest and most interesting surprise to me would be if quantum mechanics itself
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:55.600]   were somehow superseded by something better. As far as I know,
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:45:01.600]   there's no empirical evidence-based reason to think that quantum mechanics is not 100% correct.
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:08.960]   But it might not be, that's always possible. And there are, again, respectable friends of mine who
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:14.560]   speculate about it. So that's something I would – that's the first thing I would want to know.
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:18.160]   >> Oh, so like the black hole would be the most clear illustration.
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:19.360]   >> Yeah, that's where it would show up.
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:21.440]   >> If there's something, it would show up there.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:25.600]   >> I mean, maybe. The point is that black holes are mysterious for various reasons.
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:30.000]   So yeah, if our best theory of the universe is wrong, that might help explain why.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.120]   >> Do you think it's possible we'll find something interesting like black holes
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:42.160]   sometimes create new universes, or black holes are a kind of portal through space-time to another
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:48.240]   place or something like this? And then our whole conception of what is the fabric of space-time
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:51.760]   changes completely because black holes, it's like Swiss cheese type of situation.
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:57.360]   >> Yeah, you know, that would be less surprising to me because I've already written papers about
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:04.720]   that. We don't have, again, strong reason to think that the interior of a black hole leads
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:09.040]   to another universe. But it is possible, and it's also very possible that that's true for some black
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:14.160]   holes and not others. This is stuff we don't know. It's easy to ask questions we don't know the
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:18.720]   answer to. The problem is the questions that are easy to ask that we don't know the answer to are
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:22.000]   super hard to answer. >> Because these objects are very
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.960]   difficult to test and to explore. >> The regimes are just very far away.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:28.960]   So either literally far away in space, but also in energy or mass or time or whatever.
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:34.720]   >> You've published a paper on the holographic principle, or that involves the holographic
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:40.480]   principle. Can you explain the details of that? >> Yeah, you know, I'm always interested in,
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:46.160]   since my first published paper, taking these wild speculative ideas and trying to test them
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:50.560]   against data. And the problem is when you're dealing with wild speculative ideas, they're
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:56.800]   usually not well-defined enough to make a prediction, right? Like it's kind of a,
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:59.520]   I know what's going to happen in some cases, I don't know what's going to happen in other cases.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:06.560]   So we did the following thing. As I've already mentioned, the holographic principle, which is
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:13.280]   meant to reflect the information contained in black holes, seems to be telling us that information,
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:18.240]   there's less information, less stuff that can go on than you might naively expect.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:25.520]   So let's upgrade naively expect to predict using quantum field theory. Quantum field theory is our
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:30.400]   best theory of fundamental physics right now. Unlike this holographic black hole stuff,
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:36.160]   quantum field theory is entirely local. In every point of space, something can go on and then you
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:41.040]   add up all the different points in space, okay? Not holographic at all. So there's a mismatch
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:45.840]   between the expectation for what is happening even in empty space in quantum field theory
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:51.520]   versus what the holographic principle would predict. How do you reconcile these two things?
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:56.880]   So there's one way of doing it that had been suggested previously, which is to say that
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:03.520]   in the quantum field theory way of talking, it implies there's a whole bunch more states,
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:10.480]   a whole bunch more ways the system could be than there really are. And just, I'll do a little bit
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:15.200]   of math just because there might be some people in the audience who like the math. If I draw
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:22.400]   two axes on a two-dimensional geometry, like the surface of the table, right? You know that the
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:26.720]   whole point of it being two-dimensional is I can draw two vectors that are perpendicular to each
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:31.520]   other. I can't draw three vectors that are all perpendicular to each other, right? They need
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:36.800]   to overlap a little bit. That's true for any numbers of dimensions. But I can ask, okay,
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:43.520]   how much do they have to overlap? If I try to put more vectors into a vector space
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:50.080]   than the dimensionality of the vector space, can I make them almost perpendicular to each other?
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:55.360]   And the mathematical answer is, as the number of dimensions gets very, very large,
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:49:00.480]   you can fit a huge extra number of vectors in that are almost perpendicular to each other.
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:06.960]   So in this case, what we're suggesting is the number of things that can happen
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:15.120]   in a region of space is correctly described by holography. It is somewhat overcounted
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:20.240]   by quantum field theory, but that's because the quantum field theory states are not exactly
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:24.560]   perpendicular to each other. I should have mentioned that in quantum mechanics, states
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:28.320]   are given by vectors in some huge dimensional vector space, very, very, very, very large
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:35.040]   dimensional vector space. So maybe the quantum field theory states are not quite perpendicular
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:40.560]   to each other. If that is true, that's a speculation already, but if that's true,
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:46.320]   how would you know? What is the experimental deviation? And it would have been completely
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:51.200]   respectable if we had gone through and made some guesses and found that there is no noticeable
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:55.760]   experimental difference because, again, these things are in regimes very, very far away.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:50:04.480]   We stuck our necks out. We made some very, very specific guesses as to how this weird overlap of
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:12.960]   states would show up in the equations of motion for particles like neutrinos. And then we made
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:17.680]   predictions on how the neutrinos would behave on the basis of those wild guesses, and then we
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:25.280]   compared them with data. And what we found is we're pretty close, but haven't yet reached
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:30.720]   the detectability of the effect that we are predicting. In other words, well, basically,
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:34.080]   one way of saying what we predict is if a neutrino, and there's reasons why it's neutrinos,
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:38.640]   we can go into if you want, but it's not that interesting. If a neutrino comes to us from across
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:44.640]   the universe, from some galaxy very, very far away, there is a probability as it's traveling
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:50.080]   that it will dissolve into other neutrinos because they're not really perpendicular to each other as
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:54.320]   vectors as they would ordinarily be in quantum field theory. And that means that if you look at
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:51:01.680]   neutrinos coming from far enough away with high enough energies, they should disappear. Like if
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:07.520]   you see a whole bunch of nearby neutrinos, but then further away, you should see fewer.
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:15.440]   And there is an experiment called IceCube, which is this amazing testament to the ingenuity of
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:22.800]   human beings where they go to Antarctica and they drill holes and they put photo detectors on a
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:30.480]   string a mile deep in these holes. And they basically use all of the ice in a cube, I don't
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:34.960]   know whether it's a mile or not, but it's like a kilometer or something like that, some big region,
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:41.120]   that much ice is their detector. And they're looking for flashes when a cosmic ray or a
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:46.480]   neutrino or whatever hits a ice molecule, water molecule in the ice.
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:48.960]   RL: Flashes in the ice, they're looking for.
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:50.000]   PW: They're looking for flashes.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.840]   RL: But isn't there some crazy, I mean, what does the detector of that look like?
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:52:01.280]   PW: It's a bunch of strings, many, many, many strings with 360-degree photo detectors.
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:03.920]   RL: Yeah, that's really cool.
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:09.200]   PW: It's extremely cool. And they've done amazing work and they find neutrinos.
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:10.480]   RL: So, they're looking for neutrinos.
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:17.040]   Yeah. So, the whole point is most cosmic rays are protons. Why? Because protons exist
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:22.480]   and they're massive enough that you can accelerate them to very high energies. So,
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:28.160]   high-energy cosmic rays tend to be protons. They also tend to hit the Earth's atmosphere
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:33.760]   and decay into other particles. So, neutrinos, on the other hand, punch right through,
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:37.920]   at least usually, right, to a great extent. So, not just Antarctica, but the whole Earth.
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:44.080]   Occasionally, a neutrino will interact with a particle here on Earth, and a neutrino's going
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:48.880]   through your body all the time, from the Sun, from the universe, etc. And so, if you're patient
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:55.040]   enough and you have a big enough part of the Antarctic ice sheet to look at, the nice thing
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:53:00.400]   about ice is it's transparent. So, you've built yourself, nature has built you a neutrino detector.
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:07.600]   PW: So, why ice? So, is it just because of the low noise and you get to watch this thing and it's...
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:12.160]   It's much more dense than air, but it's transparent.
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:16.160]   LR: So, yeah, much more dense, so higher probability, and then it's transparency,
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:19.840]   and then it's also in the middle of nowhere, so you can... Humans are great.
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:24.160]   PW: That's all you need. There's not that much ice, right? Yeah. So, there's more ice in Antarctica
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:30.320]   than anywhere else, right? So, anyway, you can go and you can get a plot from the IceCube experiment,
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:36.800]   how many neutrinos there are that they've detected with very high energies. And we predict in our
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:42.000]   weird little holographic guessing game that there should be a cutoff. You should see neutrinos as
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   you get to higher and higher energies, and then they should disappear. If you look at the data,
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:53.360]   their data gives out exactly where our cutoff is. That doesn't mean that our cutoff is right. It
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:57.920]   means they lose the ability to do the experiment exactly where we predict the cutoff should be.
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:02.800]   LR: Oh, boy. Okay. But why is there a limit?
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:08.080]   PW: Oh, just because there are fewer and fewer high-energy neutrinos. So, there's a spectrum,
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:14.080]   and it goes down. What we're plotting here is number of neutrinos versus energy. It's fading
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:18.880]   away, and they just get very, very few. LR: And you need the high-energy neutrinos
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:21.520]   for your prediction. PW: Our effect is a little bit
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:26.080]   bigger for higher energies, yeah. And that effect has to do with this almost perpendicular thing.
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:30.080]   LR: And let me just mention the name of Oliver Friedrich, who was a postdoc who led this.
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:34.560]   He deserves the credit for doing this. I was a co-author and a collaborator. I did some work,
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:37.440]   but he really gets the lion's share. PW: Thank you, Oliver. Thank you for
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:44.240]   pushing this wild science forward. Just to speak to that, the meta process of it,
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:51.040]   how do you approach asking these big questions and trying to formulate it as a paper,
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:55.200]   as an experiment that could make a prediction, all that kind of stuff? What's your process?
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:59.680]   LR: There's a very interesting thing that happens once you're a theoretical physicist,
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:03.280]   once you become trained. You're a graduate student, you've written some papers and whatever.
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:07.680]   Suddenly, you are the world's expert in a really infinitesimally tiny
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:11.120]   area of knowledge, right? And you know not that much about other areas.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:16.880]   There's an overwhelming temptation to just drill deep, right? Just keep doing basically the thing
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:22.320]   that you started doing. But maybe that thing you started doing is not the most interesting thing
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:28.720]   to the world or to you or whatever. So you need to separately develop the capability
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:33.200]   of stepping back and going, "OK, now that I can write papers in that area,
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:40.240]   now that I'm sort of trained enough in the general procedure, what is the best match between my
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:46.160]   interests, my abilities, and what is actually interesting?" And honestly, I've not been very
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:55.040]   good at that over my career. My process traditionally was I was working in this general
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:56:02.400]   area of particle physics, field theory, general relativity, cosmology. And I would sort of
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:09.120]   try to take things other people were talking about and ask myself whether or not it really
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:17.280]   fit together. I guess I have three papers that I've ever written that have done super well in
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:21.760]   terms of getting cited and things like that. One was my first ever paper that I get very little
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:26.720]   credit for. That was my advisor and his collaborator set that up. The other two were
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:32.400]   basically my idea. One was right after we discovered that the universe was accelerating.
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:36.720]   So in 1998, observations showed that not only is the universe expanding, but it's expanding
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:43.280]   faster and faster. So that's attributed to either Einstein's cosmological constant or some more
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:47.920]   complicated form of dark energy, some mysterious thing that fills the universe. And people were
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:53.120]   throwing around ideas about this dark energy stuff, what could it be and so forth. Most of
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:56.960]   the people throwing around these ideas were cosmologists. They work on cosmology. They think
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:57:04.960]   about the universe all at once. Since I like to talk to people in different areas, I was sort of
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:11.520]   more familiar than average with what a respectable working particle physicist would think about
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:16.720]   these things. And what I immediately thought was, "You guys are throwing around these theories.
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:20.960]   These theories are wildly unnatural. They're super finely tuned. Any particle physicist
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:26.880]   would just be embarrassed to be talking about this." But rather than just scoffing at them,
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:33.360]   I sat down and asked myself, "Okay, is there a respectable version? Is there a way to keep the
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:38.320]   particle physicists happy but also make the universe accelerate?" And I realized that there
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:44.400]   is some very specific set of models that is relatively natural. And guess what? You can
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:49.680]   make a new experimental prediction on the basis of those. And so I did that. People were very happy
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:51.600]   about that. >> What was the thing that would make
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:59.360]   physicists happy that would make sense of this fragile thing that people call dark energy?
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:06.880]   >> So the fact that dark energy pervades the whole universe and is slowly changing,
[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:12.640]   that should immediately set off alarm bells. Because particle physics is a story of length
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:18.400]   scales and time scales that are generally, guess what? Small, right? Particles are small,
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:24.720]   they vibrate quickly. And you're telling me now, "I have a new field and its typical rate of change
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:31.360]   is once every billion years," right? Like that's just not natural. And indeed, you can formalize
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:37.840]   that and say, "Look, even if you wrote down a particle that evolved slowly over billions of
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:45.360]   years, if you let it interact with other particles at all, that would make it move faster, its
[00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:48.560]   dynamics would be faster, its mass would be higher," et cetera, et cetera. So there's a whole
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:53.440]   story. Things need to be robust and they all talk to each other in quantum field theory. So how do
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:59.440]   you stop that from happening? And the answer is symmetry. You can impose a symmetry that protects
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:05.920]   your new field from talking to any other fields, okay? And this is good for two reasons. Number
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:11.200]   one, it can keep the dynamics slow. So if you just... You can't tell me why it's slow, you just
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:15.600]   made that up, but at least it can protect it from speeding up because it's not talking to any other
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:22.240]   particles. And the other is it makes it harder to detect. Naively, experiments looking for fifth
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:29.520]   forces or time changes of fundamental constants of nature, like the charge of the electron,
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:36.160]   these experiments should have been able to detect these dark energy fields. And I was able to
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:39.600]   propose a way to stop that from happening. >> The detection.
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:44.400]   >> The detection, yeah. Because a symmetry could stop it from interacting with all these other
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:49.360]   fields and therefore makes it harder to detect. And just by luck, I realized, because it was
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:56.320]   actually based on my first ever paper, there's one loophole. If you impose these symmetries,
[00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:59.600]   so you protect the dark energy field from interacting with any other fields,
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:06.000]   there's one interaction that is still allowed that you can't rule out. And it is a very specific
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.400]   interaction between your dark energy field and photons, which are very common. And it has the
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:18.000]   following effect. As a photon travels through the dark energy, the photon has a polarization
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:22.880]   up, down, left, right, whatever it happens to be. And as it travels through the dark energy,
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:29.680]   that photon will rotate its polarization. This is called birefringence. And you can kind of
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:33.040]   run the numbers and say, you know, you can't make a very precise prediction because you're just
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:39.120]   making up this model. But if you want to roughly fit the data, you can predict how much polarization
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:45.600]   rotation there should be. A couple of degrees, okay? Not that much. So that's very hard to
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:51.840]   detect. People have been trying to do it. Right now, literally, we're on the edge of either being
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:56.960]   able to detect it or rule it out using the cosmic microwave background. And there is just, you know,
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:03.200]   truth in advertising. There is a claim on the market that it's been detected, that it's there.
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:11.040]   It's not very statistically significant. If I were to bet, I think it would probably go away. It's
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:16.400]   very hard thing to observe. But maybe as you get better and better data, cleaner and cleaner
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:20.400]   analysis, it will persist and we will have directly detected the dark energy.
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:28.960]   - So if we just take this tangent of dark energy, people will sometimes bring up dark energy and
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:36.720]   dark matter as an example why physicists have lost it, lost their mind. We're just going to
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:41.840]   say that there's this field that permeates everything. It's unlike any other field and
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:48.480]   it's invisible. And it helps us work out some of the math. How do you respond to that?
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:56.080]   - Well, two ways. One way is those people would have had to say the same thing when we discovered
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:03.120]   the planet Neptune. Because it's exactly analogous where we have a very good theory, in that case,
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:08.640]   Newtonian gravity in the solar system. We made predictions. The predictions were slightly off
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:13.760]   for the motion of the outer planets. You found that you could explain that motion
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:19.360]   by positing something very simple, one more planet in a very, very particular place. And
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:24.240]   you went and looked for it and there it was. That was the first successful example of finding dark
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:27.120]   matter in the universe. - Matter that we can't see.
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.400]   - Neptune was dark. - Yeah.
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:33.200]   There's a difference between dark matter and dark energy, right? Dark matter, as far as we
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:39.680]   are hypothesizing it, is a particle of some sort. It's just a particle that interacts with us very
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:44.240]   weakly. So we know how much of it there is. We know more or less where it is. We know some of
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:51.600]   its properties. We don't know specifically what it is. But it's not anything fundamentally
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:58.240]   mysterious. It's a particle. Dark energy is a different story. So dark energy is indeed
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:04.640]   uniformly spread throughout space and has this very weird property that it doesn't seem to evolve
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:09.520]   as far as we can tell. It's the same amount of energy in every cubic centimeter of space from
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:14.800]   moment to moment in time. That's why far and away the leading candidate for dark energy is
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:20.880]   Einstein's cosmological constant. The cosmological constant is strictly constant, 100% constant.
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:27.680]   The data say it had better be 98% constant or better. So 100% constant works, right? And it's
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:31.840]   also very robust. It's just there. It's not doing anything. It doesn't interact with any other
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:35.920]   particles. It makes perfect sense. Probably the dark energy is the cosmological constant.
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:43.760]   The dark matter, super important to emphasize here, it was hypothesized at first in the
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:53.520]   '70s and '80s mostly to explain the rotation of galaxies. Today, the evidence for dark matter
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:04:00.080]   is both much better than it was in the 1980s and from different sources. It is mostly from
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:06.880]   observations of the cosmic background radiation or of large-scale structure. So we have multiple
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:11.120]   independent lines of evidence, also gravitational lensing and things like that, many, many pieces
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:17.840]   of evidence that say that dark matter is there. And also that say that the effects of dark matter
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:23.520]   are different than if we modified gravity. So that was my first answer to your question is
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:30.960]   dark matter we have a lot of evidence for. But the other one is, of course, we would love it
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:38.000]   if it weren't dark matter. Our vested interest is 100% aligned with it being something more cool and
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.240]   interesting than dark matter because dark matter is just a particle. That's the most boring thing
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:45.440]   in the world. >> And it's non-uniformly
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:49.120]   distributed through space, dark matter? >> Absolutely, yeah. You can even see maps of it
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:54.240]   that we've constructed from gravitational lensing. >> So verifiable sort of clumps of dark matter in
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:57.920]   the galaxy that explains stuff. >> Bigger than the galaxy, sadly. We
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:04.800]   think that in the galaxy, dark matter is lumpy, but it's weaker, its effects are weaker. But of
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:09.440]   the scale of large-scale structure and clusters of galaxies and things like that, yes, we can
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:12.240]   show you where the dark matter is. >> Could there be a super cool
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:17.600]   explanation for dark matter that would be interesting as opposed to just another particle
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:21.520]   that sits there in clumps? >> The super cool explanation would be
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:27.280]   modifying gravity rather than inventing a new particle. Sadly, that doesn't really work. We've
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:34.320]   tried, I've tried. That's my third paper that was very successful. I tried to unify dark matter and
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:40.720]   dark energy together. That was my idea. That was my aspiration, not even an idea. I tried to do it,
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:45.760]   it failed even before we wrote the paper. I realized that my idea did not help. It helps,
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:51.760]   it could possibly explain away the dark energy, but it would not explain away the dark matter.
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:56.160]   And so I thought it was not that interesting, actually. And then two different collaborators
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:59.600]   of mine said, "Has anyone thought of this idea?" They had thought of exactly the same idea
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:04.240]   completely independently of me. I said, "Well, if three different people found the same idea,
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:08.960]   maybe it is interesting." And so we wrote the paper. And yeah, it was very interesting. People
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:11.440]   are very interested in it. >> Can you describe this paper a
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:16.720]   little bit? It's just, it's fascinating how much of a thing there is, dark energy and dark matter,
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:22.080]   and we don't quite understand it. So what was your dive into exploring how to unify the two?
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:30.800]   >> So here is what we know about dark matter and dark energy. They become important in regimes
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:38.240]   where gravity is very, very, very weak. That's kind of the opposite from what you would expect
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:43.360]   if you actually were modifying gravity. Like there's a rule of thumb in quantum field theory,
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:49.360]   et cetera, that new effects show up when the effects are strong, right? We understand weak
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:53.440]   fields, we don't understand strong fields. But okay, maybe this is different, right?
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:59.120]   So what do I mean by when gravity is weak? The dark energy shows up late in the history of the
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:04.320]   universe. Early in the history of the universe, the dark energy is irrelevant. But remember,
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:09.280]   the density of dark energy stays constant. The density of matter and radiation go down.
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:14.560]   So at early times, the dark energy was completely irrelevant compared to matter and radiation.
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:19.120]   At late times, it becomes important. That's also when the universe is dilute and gravity
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:24.720]   is relatively weak. Now think about galaxies, okay? A galaxy is more dense in the middle,
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:28.880]   less dense on the outside. And there is a phenomenological fact about galaxies that
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:34.000]   in the interior of galaxies, you don't need dark matter. That's not so surprising because
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.160]   the density of stars and gas is very high there, and the dark matter is just subdominant.
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:44.960]   But there's generally a radius inside of which you don't need dark matter to fit the data,
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:50.080]   outside of which you do need dark matter to fit the data. So that's again when gravity is weak,
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:57.920]   right? So I asked myself, of course, we know in field theory, new effects should show up when
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:03.280]   fields are strong, not weak, but let's throw that out of the window. Can I write down a theory
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:10.800]   where gravity alters when it is weak? And we've already said what gravity is. What is gravity?
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:17.280]   It's the curvature of spacetime. So there are mathematical quantities that measure the curvature
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:22.800]   of spacetime. And generally, you would say like I have an understanding Einstein's equation,
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:27.920]   which I explained to the readers in the book, relates the curvature of spacetime to matter and
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:32.720]   energy. The more matter and energy, the more curvature. So I'm saying what if you add a new
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:41.680]   term in there that says the less matter and energy, the more curvature? No reason to do that
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:47.840]   except to fit the data, right? So I tried to unify the need for dark matter and the need
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.920]   for dark energy. >> That'd be really cool if that was the case.
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:53.840]   >> Super cool, right? It'd be the best. It'd be great. It didn't work.
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:09:00.640]   >> But it'd be really interesting if gravity did something funky when there's not much of it,
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:05.920]   almost like at the edges of it, it gets noisy. >> That was exactly the hope, right?
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:12.560]   But the great thing about physics is there are equations, right? I mean, you can come up with
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:16.720]   the words and you can wave your hands, but then you got to write down the equations, and I did.
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:21.840]   And I figured out that it could help with the dark energy, the acceleration of the universe.
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:27.040]   It doesn't help with dark matter at all, yeah. >> It just sucks that the scale of galaxies and
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:36.320]   scale of solar systems, the physics is kind of boring. >> Yeah, it does. I agree. Again,
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:42.320]   that's why it is a little bit, I tear my hair out when people who are not physicists think,
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:47.760]   you know, accuse physicists, like you say, of sort of losing the plot because they need dark
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:52.880]   matter and dark energy. I don't want dark matter and dark energy. I want something much cooler than
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:59.040]   that. I've tried, but you got to listen to the equations and to the data. >> You mentioned three
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:05.760]   papers, your first ever, your first awesome paper ever, and your second awesome paper ever. Of
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:11.200]   course, you wrote many papers, so you're being very harsh on the others. >> Well, by the way,
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:17.680]   this is not awesomeness, this is impact, right? There's no correlation between awesomeness and
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:24.640]   impact. Some of my best papers fell without a stone, right? Yeah. The first paper was called
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:28.640]   "Limits on the Lorentz and Parity-Violating Modification of Electromagnetism," or
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:33.760]   electrodynamics. So, we figured out how to violate Lorentz invariance, which is the symmetry
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:39.280]   underlying relativity. And the important thing is we figured out a way to do it that didn't violate
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:46.800]   anything else and was experimentally testable, so people love that. The second paper was called
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:52.000]   "Quintessence and the Rest of the World." So, quintessence is this dynamical dark energy field.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.080]   The rest of the world is because I was talking about how the quintessence field would interact
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:00.080]   with other particles and fields and how to avoid the interactions you don't want.
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:10.560]   And the third paper was called "Is Cosmic Speedup Due to Gravitational Physics?" Something like that.
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:15.040]   So, you see the common theme. I'm taking, you know, what we know, the standard model of particle
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:19.920]   physics, general relativity, tweaking them in some way, and then trying to fit the data.
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.560]   And trying to make it so it's experimentally validated.
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.880]   Ideally, yes. That's right. That's the goal.
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:29.520]   You wrote the book "Something Deeply Hidden on the Mysteries of Quantum Mechanics" and
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:35.680]   a new book coming out soon, part of that "Biggest Ideas in the Universe" series we mentioned,
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:40.240]   called "Quanta and Fields." So, that's focusing on quantum mechanics.
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:44.960]   Big question first. "Biggest Ideas in the Universe."
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:51.920]   What to you is most beautiful, or perhaps most mysterious about quantum mechanics?
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:56.080]   Quantum mechanics is a harder one. You know, I wrote a textbook on general relativity,
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:00.720]   and I started it by saying, "General relativity is the most beautiful physical theory ever
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:06.080]   invented." I will stand by that. It is less fundamental than quantum mechanics,
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:12.000]   but quantum mechanics is a little more mysterious. So, it's a little bit kludgy right now.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.560]   You know, if you think about how we teach quantum mechanics to our students,
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:20.960]   the Copenhagen interpretation, it's a god-awful mess. Like, no one's going to accuse that of being
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:26.320]   very beautiful. I'm a fan of the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, and that
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:32.160]   is very beautiful in the sense that fewer ingredients, just one equation, and it could
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:37.440]   cover everything in the world. It depends what you mean by beauty, but I think that the answer
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:45.280]   to your question is quantum mechanics can start with extraordinarily austere, tiny ingredients,
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:53.440]   and in principle, lead to the world, right? That boggles my mind. It's much more comprehensive.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:57.200]   General relativity is about gravity, and that's great. Quantum mechanics is about everything,
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:02.640]   and seems to be up to the task. And so, I don't know, is that beauty or not? But it's
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.960]   certainly impressive. >> So, both for the theory, the predictive
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:09.760]   power of the theory, and the fact that the theory describes tiny things creating everything we see
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:16.320]   around us. >> It's a monist theory. In classical mechanics,
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:20.880]   I have a particle here, a particle there. I describe them separately. I can tell you what
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:24.320]   this particle's doing, what that particle's doing. In quantum mechanics, we have entanglement,
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:30.640]   right? As Einstein pointed out to us in 1935. And what that means is there is a single state
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:36.080]   for these two particles. There's not one state for this particle, one state for the other particle.
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:40.320]   And indeed, there's a single state for the whole universe, called the wave function of the
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:47.600]   universe, if you want to call it that. And it obeys one equation, and it is our job then to
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:52.640]   sort of chop it up, to carve it up, to figure out how to get tables and chairs and things like that
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:54.480]   out of it. >> You mentioned the many worlds
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:14:02.080]   interpretation. And it is, in fact, beautiful. But it's one of your more controversial things,
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:03.440]   you stand behind. >> Yeah.
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.200]   >> You've probably gotten a bunch of flack for it.
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:08.880]   >> I'm a big boy, I can take it. >> Well, can you first explain it,
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:11.920]   and then maybe speak to the flack you may have gotten?
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:17.600]   >> Sure. You know, the classic experiment to explain quantum mechanics to people
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:22.400]   is called the Stern-Gerlach experiment. You're measuring the spin of a particle.
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:28.720]   Okay? And in quantum mechanics, the spin is, you know, it's just a spin. It's the rate at
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:32.880]   which something is rotating around in a very down-to-earth sense, the difference being is
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:39.120]   that it's quantized. So for something like a single electron or a single neutron, it's either
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:43.120]   spinning clockwise or counterclockwise. Those are the only two, let's put it this way, those are
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:48.000]   the only two measurement outcomes you will ever get. There's no, it's spinning faster or slower,
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.040]   it's either spinning one direction or the other, that's it, two choices, okay?
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:58.480]   According to the rules of quantum mechanics, I can set up an electron, let's say, in a state where
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:06.000]   it is neither purely clockwise or counterclockwise, but a superposition of both. And that's not just
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.960]   because we don't know the answer, it's because it truly is both until we measure it. And then
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:15.200]   when we measure it, we see one or the other. So this is the fundamental mystery of quantum mechanics
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:19.360]   is that how we describe the system when we're not looking at it is different from what we see
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:25.280]   when we look at it. So we teach our students in the Copenhagen way of thinking is that the act
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:33.520]   of measuring the spin of the electron causes a radical change in the physical state. It spontaneously
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:40.400]   collapses from being a superposition of clockwise and counterclockwise to being one or the other.
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:44.160]   And you can tell me the probability that that happens, but that's all you can tell me.
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:48.800]   And I can't be very specific about when it happens, what caused it to happen,
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:53.440]   why it's happening, none of that. That's all called the measurement problem of quantum mechanics.
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:16:00.560]   So many worlds just says, "Look, I just told you a minute ago that there's only one
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:06.160]   wave function for the whole universe." And that means that you can't take too seriously
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:10.720]   just describing the electron. You have to include everything else in the universe. In particular,
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:14.720]   you clearly have to interact with the electron in order to measure it.
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:20.320]   So whatever is interacting with the electron should be included in the wave function that
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:24.640]   you're describing. And look, maybe it's just you, maybe your eyeballs are able to perceive it,
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:31.280]   but okay, I'm going to include you in the wave function. And if you do that, let's be, you know,
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:35.280]   since you have a very sophisticated listenership, I'll be a little bit more careful than average.
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:40.960]   What does it mean to measure the spin of the electron? We don't need to go into details,
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:47.520]   but we want the following thing to be true. If the electron were in a state that was 100%
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:53.760]   spinning clockwise, then we want the measurement to tell us it was spinning clockwise. We want
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:59.040]   your brain to go, "Yes, the electron was spinning clockwise." Likewise, if it was 100% counter
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:05.200]   clockwise, we want to see that, to measure that. The rules of quantum mechanics, the Schrodinger
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:11.200]   equation of quantum mechanics is 100% clear that if you want to measure it clockwise when it's
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:16.880]   clockwise and measure it counterclockwise when it's counterclockwise, then when it starts out
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:25.280]   in a superposition, what will happen is that you and the electron will entangle with each other.
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:32.160]   And by that, I mean that the state of the universe evolves into part saying the electron was spinning
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:37.760]   clockwise and I saw it clockwise. And part of the state is it's in a superposition with the part
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:41.200]   that says the electron was spinning counterclockwise and I saw it counterclockwise.
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:47.680]   Everyone agrees with this entirely uncontroversial, straightforward consequence of the Schrodinger
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:53.680]   equation. And then Niels Bohr would say, and then part of that wave function disappears.
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:58.000]   And we're in the other part and you can't predict which part it will be only the probability.
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:02.640]   Hugh Everett, who was a graduate student in the 1950s was thinking about this says,
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:08.320]   I have a better idea. Part of the wave function does not magically disappear. It stays there.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:14.080]   The reason why that idea, Everett's idea that the whole wave function always sticks around and just
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:21.040]   obeys the Schrodinger equation was not thought of years before is because naively you look at it and
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:28.720]   you go, okay, this is predicting that I will be in a superposition, that I will be in a superposition
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:34.080]   of having seen the electron be clockwise and having seen it be counterclockwise.
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:38.480]   No experimenter has ever felt like they were in a superposition. You always see an outcome.
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:46.960]   Everett's move, which was kind of genius was to say, the problem is not the Schrodinger equation.
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:52.400]   The problem is you have misidentified yourself in the Schrodinger equation. You have said,
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:56.800]   oh, look, there's a person who saw counterclockwise. There's a person who saw
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:03.520]   clockwise. I should be that superposition of both. Everett says, no, no, no, you're not.
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:10.720]   Because the part of the wave function in which the spin was clockwise, once that exists,
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:17.520]   it is completely unaffected by the part of the wave function that says the spin was counterclockwise.
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:23.040]   They are apart from each other. They are uninteracting. They have no influence. What
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:28.160]   happens in one part has no influence in the other part. So Everett says the simple resolution is to
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:36.320]   identify yourself as either the one who saw spin clockwise or the one who saw spin counterclockwise.
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:41.440]   There are now two people. Once you've done that experiment, the Schrodinger equation doesn't have
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:46.320]   to be messed with. All you have to do is locate yourself correctly in the wave function. That's
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:49.760]   many worlds. >> The number of worlds is-
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:53.280]   >> Very big. >> Very, very, very big.
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:20:03.280]   Where do those worlds fit? Where do they go? >> So the short answer is the worlds don't exist
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:12.080]   in space. Space exists separately in each world. So I mean, there's a technical answer to your
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:15.680]   question, which is Hilbert space, the space of all possible quantum mechanical states.
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:21.120]   But physically, we want to put these worlds somewhere. That's just a wrong
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:27.360]   intuition that we have. There is no such thing as the physical spatial location of the worlds
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:31.120]   because space is inside the worlds. >> One of the properties of this
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:34.400]   interpretation is that you can't travel from one world to the other.
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:37.440]   >> That's right. >> Which kind of makes you feel
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:44.320]   that they're existing separately. >> They are existing separately
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:46.720]   and simultaneously. >> And simultaneously.
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:51.200]   >> Without locations in space. >> Without locations in space. How is it
[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:54.720]   possible to visualize them existing without a location in space?
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:59.920]   >> The real answer to that, the honest answer is the equations predict it.
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:03.200]   >> Yeah, yeah. >> If you can't visualize it,
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:07.280]   so much worse for you. The equations are crystal clear about what they're predicting.
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:13.360]   >> Is there a way to get to the closer to understanding and visualizing the weirdness
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:16.720]   of the implications of this? >> You know, I don't think it's that
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:24.240]   hard. It wasn't that hard for me. I don't mind the idea that when I make a quantum mechanical
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:30.560]   measurement, there is, later on in the universe, multiple descendants of my present self who got
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:36.880]   different answers for that measurement. I can't interact with them. Hilbert space,
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:40.880]   the space of all quantum wave functions, was always big enough to include all of them.
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:48.160]   I'm going to worry about the parts of the universe I can observe. Let's put it this way.
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:54.640]   Many worlds comes about by taking the Schrodinger equation seriously. The Schrodinger equation was
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:22:00.160]   invented to fit the data, to fit the spectrum of different atoms and different emission and
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:08.000]   absorption experiments. It's perfectly legitimate to say, "Well, okay, you're taking the Schrodinger
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:15.120]   equation. You're extrapolating it. You're trusting it, believing it beyond what we can observe.
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:21.360]   I don't want to do that." That's perfectly legit, except, okay, then what do you believe?
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:27.200]   Come up with a better theory. You're saying you don't believe the Schrodinger equation.
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:31.360]   Tell me the equation that you believe in. Turns out, and people have done that,
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:36.640]   turns out it's super hard to do that in a legitimate way that fits the data.
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:38.960]   >> And many worlds is a really clean-
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:44.800]   >> Absolutely. The most austere, clean, no extra baggage theory of quantum mechanics.
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:54.480]   >> But if it, in fact, is correct, isn't this the weirdest thing of anything we know?
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:23:02.720]   >> Yes. In fact, let me put it this way. The single best reason in my mind to be skeptical
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:07.840]   about many worlds is not because it doesn't make sense, or it doesn't fit the data,
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:14.640]   or I don't know where the worlds are going, or whatever. It's because to make that extrapolation,
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:20.400]   to take seriously the equation that we know is correct in other regimes requires new philosophy,
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:26.960]   requires a new way of thinking about identity, about probability, about prediction, a whole
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:32.080]   bunch of things. It's worked to do that philosophy, and I've been doing it, and others have done it,
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:38.720]   and I think it's very, very doable, but it's not straightforward. It's not a simple
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:43.760]   extrapolation from what we already know. It's a grand extrapolation very far away.
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:50.880]   And if you just wanted to be methodologically conservative and say, "That's a step too far,
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:55.280]   I don't want to buy it," I'm sympathetic to that. I think that you're just wimping out.
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:59.920]   I think that you should have more courage, but I get the impulse.
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:08.480]   >> And there is, under many worlds, an arrow of time where if you rewind it back,
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:14.800]   there's going to be one initial state. >> That's right. All of quantum mechanics,
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:18.960]   all different versions require a kind of arrow of time. It might be different in every kind.
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:26.160]   But the quantum measurement process is irreversible. You can measure something,
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:29.280]   it collapses, you can't go backwards. If someone tells you the outcome, if I say,
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:35.040]   "I've measured an electron, its spin is clockwise," and they say, "What was it before I measured it?"
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:39.520]   You know there was some part of it that was clockwise, but you don't know how much, right?
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:45.200]   In many worlds, it's no different. But the nice thing is that the kind of arrow of time you need
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:50.960]   in many worlds is exactly the kind of arrow of time you need anyway for entropy and thermodynamics
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:55.680]   and so forth. You need a simple, low-entropy initial state. That's what you need in both cases.
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:25:01.120]   >> So if you actually look at under many worlds into the entire history of the universe,
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:05.440]   correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks very deterministic.
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:06.240]   >> Yes.
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:11.440]   >> In each moment, does the moment contain the memory of the entire history of the universe?
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:16.480]   To you, does the moment contain the memory of everything that preceded it?
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:23.120]   >> As far as we know, so according to many worlds, the wave function of the universe,
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:27.040]   all the branches of the universe at once, all the worlds, does contain all the information.
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:35.360]   Calling it a memory is a little bit dangerous because it's not the same kind of memory that
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:39.920]   you and I have in our brains because our memories rely on the arrow of time.
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:46.960]   And the whole point of the Schrodinger equation or Newton's laws is they don't have an arrow of time
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:53.280]   built in. They're reversible. The state of the universe not only remembers where it came from,
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:56.880]   but also determines where it's going to go in a way that our memories don't do that.
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:00.720]   >> But our memories, we could do replay. Can you do this?
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:04.960]   >> We can, but the act of forming a memory increases the entropy of the universe.
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:11.440]   It is an irreversible process also, right? You can walk on a beach and leave your footprints
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:16.640]   there. That's a record of your passing. It will eventually be erased by the ever-increasing
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:20.000]   entropy of the universe. >> But you can imperfectly replay it.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.960]   >> Yes. >> I guess, can we return,
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:28.960]   travel back in time imperfectly? >> Oh, it depends on the level of
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:35.520]   precision you're trying to ask that question. The universe contains the information about where the
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:38.480]   universe was, but you and I don't. We're nowhere close.
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:44.880]   >> And it's, what, computationally very costly to try to consult the universe?
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:49.840]   >> Well, it depends on, again, exactly what you're asking. There are some simple questions,
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:56.320]   like what was the temperature of the universe 30 seconds after the Big Bang? We can answer that,
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:01.440]   right? That's kind of amazing that we can answer that to pretty high precision,
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:04.720]   but if you want to know where every atom was, then no.
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:12.400]   >> What to you is the Big Bang? Why did it happen?
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:18.560]   >> We have no idea. I think that that's a super important question that I can imagine making
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:23.920]   progress on, but right now I'm more or less maximally uncertain about what the answer is.
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:30.000]   >> Do you think black holes will help, potentially? >> No, not that much. Quantum gravity will help,
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:35.360]   and maybe black holes will help us figure out quantum gravity, so indirectly, yes. But we have
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:41.040]   a situation where general relativity, Einstein's theory, unambiguously predicts there was a
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:47.200]   singularity in the past. There was a moment of time when the universe had infinite curvature,
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:53.280]   infinite energy, infinite expansion rate, the whole bit. That's just a fancy way of saying
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:58.240]   the theory has broken down, and classical general relativity is not up to the task of saying what
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:03.760]   really happened at that moment. So it is completely possible there was, in some sense,
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:09.680]   a moment of time before which there were no other moments, and that would be the Big Bang. Even if
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:13.440]   it's not a classical general relativity kind of thing, even if quantum mechanics is involved,
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:17.840]   maybe that's what happened. It's also completely possible there was time before that,
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:23.440]   space and time, and they evolved into our hot Big Bang by some procedure that we don't really
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:25.920]   understand. >> And if time and space are emergent,
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:33.120]   then the before even starts getting real weird. >> Well, I think that if there is a first moment
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:38.400]   of time, that would be very good evidence, or that would fit hand in glove with the idea that
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:43.600]   time is emergent. If time is fundamental, then it tends to go forever, because it's fundamental.
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:48.800]   >> Well, yeah. I mean, the general formulation of this question is what's outside of it,
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:54.960]   what's outside of our universe? So in time and in space. I know it's a pothead question, Sean.
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:59.040]   I understand. I apologize. >> Look, that's my life. My life
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:02.800]   is asking pothead questions. Some of them, the answer is, that's not the right way to think
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:05.920]   about it. >> Okay, but is it possible to think at all
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:12.240]   about what's outside our universe? >> It's absolutely legit to ask questions,
[01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:16.160]   but you have to be comfortable with the possibility that the answer is, there's no such thing as
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:20.160]   outside our universe. That's absolutely on the table. In fact, that is the simplest,
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:24.960]   most likely to be correct answer that we know of. >> But it's the only thing
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:32.720]   in the universe that wouldn't have an outside. >> Yeah, if the universe is the totality of
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:36.240]   everything, it would not have an outside. >> That's so weird to think that there's
[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:45.120]   not an outside. We want there to be. We want there to be sort of a creator, a creative force
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:50.160]   that led to this. An outside, like this is our town, and then there's a bigger world,
[01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:54.080]   and there's always a bigger world. >> Because that is our experience. That's
[01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:59.840]   the world we grew up in, right? The universe doesn't need to obey those rules.
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:02.960]   >> Such a weird thing. >> When I was a kid,
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:05.840]   that used to keep me up at night. Like, what if the universe had not existed?
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:13.200]   >> Right. And it feels like a lot of pressure that if this is the only universe,
[01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:19.920]   and we're here, one of the few intelligent civilizations, maybe the only one,
[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:25.040]   it's the old theories that we're the center of everything. It just feels suspicious.
[01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:30.560]   That's why many worlds is kind of exciting to me, because it's humbling in all the right
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:36.000]   kinds of ways. It feels like infinity is the way this whole thing runs.
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:42.880]   >> There's one pitfall that I'll just mention, because there's a move that is made in these
[01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:46.480]   theoretical edges of cosmology that I think is a little bit mistaken, which is to say,
[01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:54.000]   I'm going to think about the universe on the basis of imagining that I am a typical observer.
[01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:58.640]   I, this is called the principle of typicality, or the principle of mediocrity, or even the
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:04.240]   Copernican principle. Nothing special about me, I'm just typical in the universe. But then you
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:11.040]   draw some conclusions from this, and what you end up realizing is you've been hilariously presumptuous,
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:15.360]   because by saying I'm a typical observer in the universe, you're saying typical observers in the
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:21.920]   universe are like me. And that is completely unjustified by anything. So, I'm not telling
[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:26.480]   you what the right way to do it is, but these kinds of questions that are not quite grounded in
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:33.040]   experimental verification or falsification are ones you have to be very careful about.
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:38.400]   >> That to me is one of the most interesting questions. And there's different ways to
[01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:43.440]   approach it, but like, what's outside of this? How did the big mess start? How do we get something
[01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:50.720]   from nothing? That's always the thing you're sneaking up to. When you're studying all of
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:54.640]   these questions, you're always sneaking, that's where the black hole and the unifying, getting
[01:31:54.640 --> 01:32:00.000]   quantum gravity, all this kind of stuff, you're always sneaking up to that question, where did
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:07.040]   all of this come from? And I think that's probably an answerable question, right?
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:09.200]   >> No.
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:13.840]   >> It doesn't have to be. So, you think there could be a turtle at the bottom of this
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:16.960]   that refuses to reveal its identity?
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:23.040]   >> Yes. I think that specifically the question, why is there something rather than nothing,
[01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:29.360]   does not have the kind of answer that we would ordinarily attribute to why questions.
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:37.600]   Because typical why questions are embedded in the universe, and when we answer them,
[01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:40.560]   we take advantage of the features of the universe that we know and love.
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:43.600]   But the universe itself, as far as we know, is not embedded in anything
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:46.960]   bigger or stronger, and therefore, it can just be.
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:50.720]   >> Do you think it's possible this whole place is simulated?
[01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:51.760]   >> Sure.
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:56.720]   >> It's a really interesting, dark, twisted video game that we're all existing in.
[01:32:56.720 --> 01:33:02.880]   >> You know, my own podcast listeners, Mindscape listeners, tease me because they know from my
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:09.040]   AMA episodes that if you ever start a question by asking, "Do you think it's possible that?"
[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:16.560]   The answer is going to be yes. That might not be the answer that you care about, but it's possible,
[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:21.200]   sure, as long as you're not, you know, adding two even numbers together and getting an odd number.
[01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:24.560]   >> When you say it's possible, there's a mathematically yes,
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:26.320]   and then there's more of like intuitive...
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:30.240]   >> Yeah. You want to know whether it's plausible. You want to know is there a
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:35.200]   reasonable non-zero credence to attach to this. I don't think that there's any
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.640]   philosophical knockout objection to the simulation hypothesis. I also think that
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:47.680]   there's absolutely no reason to take it seriously. >> Do you think humans will try to create one?
[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:53.680]   I guess that's how I always think about it. You know, I've spent quite a bit of time
[01:33:53.680 --> 01:34:03.200]   over the past few years and a lot more recently in virtual worlds, and just am always captivated
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:08.480]   by the possibility of creating higher and higher resolution worlds, and as we'll talk a little bit
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:14.800]   about artificial intelligence, sort of the advancement on the Sora front, that you can
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:20.400]   automatically generate those worlds, and the possibility of existing in those automatically
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:25.680]   generated worlds is pretty exciting, as long as there's a consistent physics, quantum mechanics,
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:32.640]   and general relativity that governs the generation of those worlds. So it just seems like humans will
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:36.400]   for sure try to create this. >> Yeah, I think they will create
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:40.800]   better and better simulations. I think the philosopher David Chalmers has done what I
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:45.440]   consider to be a good job of arguing that we should treat things that happen in virtual reality
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:51.760]   and in simulated realities as just as real as the reality that we experience. I also think that as a
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:58.000]   practical matter, people will realize how much harder it is to simulate a realistic world than we
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.440]   naively believe, so this is not a my lifetime kind of worry.
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:06.480]   >> Yeah, the practical matter of going from a sort of a prototype that's impressive
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:14.320]   to a thing that governs everything. Similar question on this front is in AGI. Yeah,
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:20.080]   you said that we're very far away from AGI. >> I want to eliminate the phrase AGI.
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:26.960]   >> So basically, when you're analyzing large language models and seeing how far are they
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:32.480]   from whatever AGI is, and we could talk about different notions of intelligence that we're not
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:40.400]   as close as kind of some people in public view are talking about. So what's your intuition behind
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:42.880]   that? >> My intuition is basically that
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:50.000]   artificial intelligence is different than human intelligence, and so the mistake that is being
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:57.840]   made by focusing on AGI, among those who do, is an artificial agent, as we can make them now or in
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:04.400]   the near future, might be way better than human beings at some things, way worse than human
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:09.680]   beings at other things. And rather than trying to ask how close is it to being a human-like
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:15.040]   intelligence, we should appreciate it for what its capabilities are, and that will both be more
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:20.560]   accurate and help us put it to work and protect us from the dangers better, rather than always
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:25.440]   anthropomorphizing it. >> I think the underlying idea there,
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:33.600]   under the definition of AGI, is that the capabilities are extremely impressive.
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:37.760]   That's not a precise statement, but meaning— >> No, I get that. I completely agree.
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:43.680]   >> And then the underlying question, where a lot of the debate is, is how impressive is it?
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:48.800]   What are the limits of large-language models? Can they really do things like common-sense
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:53.840]   reasoning? How much do they really understand about the world? Are they just fancy mimicry
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:37:02.400]   machines? And where do you fall on that, as to the limits of large-language models?
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:10.320]   >> I don't think that there are many limits in principle. I'm a physicalist about consciousness
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:15.760]   and awareness and things like that. I see no obstacle to, in principle, building an artificial
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:21.360]   machine that is indistinguishable in thought and cognition from a human being. But we're not trying
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:28.000]   to do that, right? What a large-language model is trying to do is to predict text. That's what it
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:36.720]   does. And it is leveraging the fact that we human beings, for very good evolutionary biology reasons,
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:43.360]   attribute intentionality and intelligence and agency to things that act like human beings.
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:51.440]   As I was driving here to get to this podcast space, I was using Google Maps, and Google Maps
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:57.280]   was talking to me. But I wanted to stop to get a cup of coffee, so I didn't do what Google Maps
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:04.080]   told me to do. I went around a block that it didn't like. And so it gets annoyed, right? It
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:07.760]   says, "No, why are you doing?" It doesn't say exactly in this, but you know what I mean. It's
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:13.680]   like, "No, turn left, turn left," and you turn right. It is impossible as a human being not to
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:19.120]   feel a little bit sad that Google Maps is getting mad at you. It's not. It's not even trying to.
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:24.400]   It's not a large-language model. There's no aspirations to intentionality, but we attribute
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:31.440]   that all the time. Dan Dennett, the philosopher, wrote a very influential paper on the intentional
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:38.000]   stance, the fact that it's the most natural thing in the world for we human beings to attribute more
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:43.680]   intentionality to artificial things than are really there, which is not to say it can't be really
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:49.760]   there. But if you're trying to be rational and clear-thinking about this, the first step is to
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:59.200]   recognize our huge bias towards attributing things below the surface to systems that are able to,
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:05.600]   at the surface level, act human. - So if that huge bias of intentionality is there in the data,
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:12.160]   in the human data, in the vast landscape of human data that AI models, large-language models, and
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:20.080]   video models in the future are trained on, don't you think that that intentionality will emerge
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:25.760]   as fundamental to the behavior of these systems naturally? - Well, I don't think it will happen
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:33.120]   naturally. I think it could happen. Again, I'm not against the principle. But again, the way that
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:40.400]   large-language models came to be and what they're optimized for is wildly different than the way
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:48.400]   that human beings came to be and what they're optimized for. So I think we're missing a chance
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:54.000]   to be much more clear-headed about what large-language models are by judging them against
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:58.240]   human beings, again, both in positive ways and negative ways. - Well, I think sort of to push
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:02.240]   back on what they're optimized for, it's different to describe how they're trained versus what they're
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:09.040]   optimized for. So they're trained in this very trivial way of predicting text tokens. But you
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:13.760]   can describe what they're optimized for and what the actual task at hand is, is to construct a
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:19.920]   world model, meaning an understanding of the world. And that's where it starts getting closer to what
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:25.360]   humans are kind of doing. We're just, in the case of large-language models, know how the sausage is
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:29.520]   made and we don't know how it's made for us humans. - But they're not optimized for that.
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:35.600]   They're optimized to sound human. - That's the fine-tuning. But the actual training is optimized
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:43.120]   for understanding, creating a compressed representation of all the stuff that humans
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:49.120]   have created on the internet. And the hope is that that gives you a deeper understanding
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:54.080]   of the world. - Yeah. So that's why I think that there's a set of hugely interesting questions to
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:41:01.200]   be asked about the ways in which large-language models actually do represent the world. Because
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:08.000]   what is clear is that they're very good at acting human. The open question in my mind is,
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:15.120]   is the easiest, most efficient, best way to act human to do the same things that human beings do?
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:20.080]   Or are there other ways? And I think that's an open question. I just heard a talk by Melanie
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:25.760]   Mitchell at Santa Fe Institute, an artificial intelligence researcher. And she told two stories
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:29.680]   about two different papers, one that someone else wrote and one that her group is following up on.
[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:34.240]   And they were modeling Othello. Othello, the game with a little rectangular board,
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:39.840]   white and black squares. So the experiment was the following. They fed a neural network
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:46.800]   the moves that were being made in the most symbolic form, like E5. Just means that,
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:51.440]   okay, you put a token down E5. So it gives a long string. It does this for millions of games,
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:56.320]   right? Real legitimate games. And then it asks the question, the paper asks the question, okay,
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:02.720]   you've trained it to tell what would be a legitimate next move from not a legitimate next
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:09.040]   move. Did it in its brain, in its little large language model brain, I don't even know if it's
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:13.920]   technically a large language model, but a deep learning network. Did it come up with a representation
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:19.600]   of the Othello board? Well, how do you know? And so they construct a little probe network that they
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:26.320]   insert and you ask it, what is it doing right at this moment, right? And the answer is that the
[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:31.040]   little probe network can ask, would this be legitimate or is this token white or black or
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:40.800]   whatever? Things that in practice would amount to it's invented the Othello board. And it found that
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:47.360]   the probe got the right answer, not 100% of the time, but more than by chance, substantially more
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:54.240]   than by chance. So they said, there's some tentative evidence that this neural network
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:43:00.000]   has discovered the Othello board just out of data, raw data, right? But then Melanie's group
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:07.120]   asked the question, okay, are you sure that that understanding of the Othello board wasn't built
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:13.040]   into your probe? And what they found was like at least half of the improvement was built into the
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:23.360]   probe, not all of it, right? And look, a Othello board is way simpler than the world. So that's
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:31.120]   why I just think it's an open question whether or not the, I mean, it would be remarkable either way
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:37.840]   to learn that large language models that are good at doing what we train them to do are good because
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:42.960]   they've built the same kind of model of the world that we have in our minds or that they're good,
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:46.720]   despite not having that model. Either one of these is an amazing thing. I just don't think
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:51.520]   the data are clear on which one is true. - I think I have some sort of intellectual
[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:56.880]   humility about the whole thing because I was humbled by several stages in the machine learning
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:44:06.720]   development over the past 20 years. And I just would never have predicted that LLMs, the way
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:11.040]   they're trained, on the scale of data they're trained would be as impressive as they are.
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:17.120]   And there, that's where intellectual humility steps in, where my intuition would say something
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:22.720]   like with Melanie, where you need to be able to have very sort of concrete, common sense reasoning,
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:30.640]   symbolic reasoning type things in a system in order for it to be very intelligent. But here,
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:36.960]   I'm so impressed by what it's capable to do, train on the next token prediction, essentially,
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:45.920]   that I just, my conception of the nature of intelligence is just completely, not completely,
[01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:50.480]   but humbled, I should say. - Look, and I think that's perfectly fair. I also
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:55.440]   was, I almost say pleasantly, I don't know whether it's pleasantly or unpleasantly,
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:45:00.640]   but factually surprised by the recent rate of progress. Clearly, some kind of phase transition
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:05.040]   percolation has happened, right? And the improvement has been remarkable, absolutely
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:14.480]   amazing. That I have no arguments with. That doesn't yet tell me the mechanism by which that
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:19.840]   improvement happened. Constructing a model much like a human being would have is clearly one
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:24.000]   possible mechanism, but part of the intellectual humility is to say maybe there are others.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:32.320]   - I was chatting with the CEO of Anthropic, Dario Medet, so behind Klon, and that company,
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:37.200]   but a lot of the AI companies are really focused on expanding the scale of compute.
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:44.480]   Sort of, if we assume that AI is not data limited, but is compute limited,
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:49.680]   you can make the system much more intelligent by using more compute.
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:57.360]   So let me ask you, almost on the physics level, do you think physics can help
[01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:02.240]   expand the scale of compute, and maybe the scale of energy required to make that compute happen?
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:08.080]   - Yeah, 100%. I think this is like one of the biggest things that physics can help with,
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:15.760]   and it's an obvious kind of low-hanging fruit situation where the heat generation,
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:25.040]   the inefficiency, the waste of existing high-level computers is nowhere near the efficiency of our
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:30.160]   brains. It's hilariously worse. And we kind of haven't tried to optimize that hard on that
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:34.240]   frontier. I mean, your laptop heats up when you're sitting on your lap, right? It doesn't need to,
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:41.520]   your brain doesn't heat up like that. So clearly there exists in the world of physics the capability
[01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:45.760]   of doing these computations with much less waste heat being generated,
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:50.480]   and I look forward to people doing that, yeah. - Are you excited for the possibility of nuclear
[01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:53.680]   fusion? - I am cautiously optimistic,
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:59.600]   excited it'll be too strong. I mean, it'd be great, right? But if we really tried solar power,
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:03.840]   it would also be great. - I think Elias Discover said this,
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:10.560]   that the future of humanity on Earth would be just the entire surface of Earth is covered in
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:13.760]   solar panels and data centers. - Why would you waste the surface
[01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:17.520]   of the Earth with solar panels? Put them in space. - Sure, you can go in space, yeah.
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:21.440]   - Space is bigger than the Earth. - Yeah, just solar panels everywhere.
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:24.080]   - Yeah. - I like it.
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:29.520]   - We already have fusion. It's called the sun. - Yeah, that's true. And there's probably
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:32.800]   more and more efficient ways of catching that energy.
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:37.440]   - Sending it down is the hard part, absolutely. But that's an engineering problem, yeah.
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:44.480]   - So I just wonder where data centers, the compute centers can expand to. If that's the future,
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:52.480]   if AI is as effective as it possibly could be, then the scale of computation will keep increasing.
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:58.800]   Perhaps it's a race between efficiency and scale. - There are constraints, right? There's a certain
[01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:02.320]   amount of energy, a certain amount of damage we can do to the environment before it is not
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:07.120]   worth it anymore. So yeah, I think that's a new question. In fact, it's kind of frustrating
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:12.640]   because we get better and better at doing things efficiently, but we invent more things we want to
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:18.000]   do faster than we get good at doing them efficiently. So we're continuing to make
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:21.600]   things worse in various ways. - I mean, that's the dance of humanity,
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:25.760]   where we're constantly creating better and better and better technologies that are potentially
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:30.960]   causing a lot more harm. And that includes for weapons, it includes AI used as weapons,
[01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:36.240]   that includes nuclear weapons, of course. Which is surprising to me that we haven't destroyed
[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:40.720]   human civilization yet, given how many nuclear warheads are out there.
[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:47.040]   - Look, I'm with you. Between nuclear and bioweapons, it is a little bit surprising
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:51.440]   that we haven't caused enormous devastation. Of course, we did drop two atomic bombs on Japan,
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:56.800]   but compared to what could have happened, or could happen tomorrow, it could be much worse.
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:01.760]   - Yeah, it does seem like there's an underlying, speaking of quantum fields,
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:11.120]   there's like a field of goodness within the human heart that, in some kind of game-theoretic way,
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:15.040]   would create really powerful things that could destroy each other. And there's greed and ego
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:22.240]   and all this kind of power-hungry dictators that are at play here in all the geopolitical landscape,
[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:26.880]   but we somehow always don't go too far. - Yeah, but that's exactly what you would say
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:29.120]   right before we went too far. - Right before we went too far.
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:36.000]   And that's why we don't see aliens. So you're, like I mentioned, associated with Santa Fe
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:43.200]   Institute. I just would love to take a stroll down the landscape of ideas explored there.
[01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:45.280]   - Sure. - So they look at complexity
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:50.800]   in all kinds of ways. What do you think about the emergence of complexity from simple things
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:54.240]   interacting simply? - I think it's a fascinating topic. I mean,
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:58.320]   that's why I'm thinking about these things these days rather than the papers that I was describing
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:04.720]   to you before. All of those papers I described to you before are guesses. Like, what if the laws of
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:08.400]   physics are different in the following way? And then you can work out the consequences. At some
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:12.160]   point in my life, I said, like, what is the chance I'm gonna guess right? Einstein guessed right,
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:16.320]   Steven Weinberg guessed right, but there's a very small number of times that people guessed right.
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:22.960]   Whereas with this emergence of complexity from simplicity, I really do think that we haven't
[01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:28.240]   understood the basics yet. I think we're still kind of pre-paradigmatic. There've been some
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:35.760]   spectacular discoveries. People like Jeffrey West at Santa Fe and others have really given us true
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:40.800]   insights into important systems, but still there's a lot of the basics I think are not understood.
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:46.400]   And so searching for the general principles is what I like to do. And I think it's absolutely
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:51.600]   possible that, I mean, to be a little bit more substantive than that, I think this is kind of
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:57.920]   a cliche, I think the key is information. And I think that what we see through the history of the
[01:50:57.920 --> 01:51:04.560]   universe as you go from simple to more and more complex is really subsystems of the universe
[01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:10.320]   figuring out how to use information to do whatever, to survive or to thrive or to reproduce.
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:16.400]   I mean, that's the sort of fuel, the leverage, the resource that we have for a while anyway,
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:20.240]   until the heat death, but that's where the complexity is really driven by.
[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:24.560]   - Yeah, but the mechanism of it, I mean, you mentioned Jeffrey West, what are interesting
[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:30.160]   inklings of progress in this realm and what are systems that interest you in terms of information?
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:36.560]   So, I mean, for me just as a fan of complexity, just even looking at simple cellular automata
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:42.240]   is always just a fascinating way to illustrate the emergence of complexity.
[01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:48.080]   - So for those of the listeners who don't know, viewers, cellular automata come from
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:55.040]   imagining a very simple configuration, for example, a set of ones and zeros along a line.
[01:51:55.040 --> 01:52:00.400]   And then you met a rule that says, okay, I'm gonna evolve this in time. And generally the
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:06.720]   simplest ones start with just each block of three ones and zeros have a rule that they will
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:10.960]   determinously go to either a one or a zero. And you can actually classify all the different
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:16.480]   possibilities, a small number of possible cellular automata of that form. And what was discovered
[01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:22.240]   by various people, including Stephen Wolfram is some of these cellular automata have the feature
[01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:27.120]   that you start from almost nothing like zero, zero, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, zero, zero,
[01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:34.320]   and you let it rip and it becomes wildly complex, okay? So this is very provocative,
[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:41.680]   very interesting. It's also not how physics works at all because as we said, physics conserves
[01:52:41.680 --> 01:52:46.800]   information. You can go forward or backwards. These cellular automata do not. They're not
[01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:52.400]   reversible in any sense. You've built in an arrow of time. You have a starting point and then you
[01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:58.000]   evolve. So what I'm interested in is seeing how in the real world with the real laws of physics
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:03.680]   and underlying reversibility, but macroscopic irreversibility from entropy in the arrow
[01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:08.240]   of time, et cetera, how does that lead to complexity? I think that that's an answerable
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:10.960]   question. I don't think that cellular automata are really helping us in that one.
[01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:17.600]   >> So what is in that, what is the landscape of entropy in the universe look like?
[01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:24.080]   >> Well, entropy is hard to localize. It's a property of systems, not of parts of systems,
[01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:30.480]   right? Having said that, we can do approximate answers to the question. The answer is black
[01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:37.840]   holes are huge in entropy. Most of, let's put it this way, the whole observable universe that we're
[01:53:37.840 --> 01:53:45.120]   in had a certain amount of entropy before stars and planets and black holes started to form,
[01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:51.040]   10 to the 88th. I can even tell you the number, okay? The single black hole at the center of our
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:56.320]   galaxy has entropy, 10 to the 90th. The single black hole at the center of our galaxy has more
[01:53:56.320 --> 01:54:02.000]   entropy than the whole universe used to have not too long ago. So most of the entropy in the
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:05.840]   universe today is in the form of black holes. >> Okay, that's fascinating, first of all.
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:12.400]   But second of all, if we take black holes away, what are the different interesting perturbations
[01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:18.000]   in entropy across space? Where do we earthlings fit into that?
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:25.040]   >> The interesting thing to me is that if you start with a system that is isolated from the
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:31.600]   rest of the universe, and you start it at low entropy, there's almost a theorem that says if
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:37.280]   you're very, very, very low entropy, then the system looks pretty simple. Because low entropy
[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:42.400]   means there's only a small number of ways that you can rearrange the parts to look like that.
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:46.880]   So if there's not that many ways, the answer is going to look simple. But there's also almost
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:51.200]   a theorem that says when you're at maximum entropy, the system is going to look simple,
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:55.920]   because it's all smeared out. If it had interesting structure, then it would be complicated, right?
[01:54:56.560 --> 01:55:02.000]   So entropy in this isolated system only goes up. That's the second law of thermodynamics.
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:07.120]   But complexity starts low, goes up, and then goes down again.
[01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:16.240]   Sometimes people mistakenly think that complexity or life or whatever is fighting against the second
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:20.320]   law of thermodynamics, fighting against the increase of entropy. That is precisely the
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:27.440]   wrong way to think about it. We are surfers riding the wave of increasing entropy. We rely
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:32.640]   on increasing entropy to survive. That is part of what makes us special. This table
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:40.640]   maintains its stability mechanically, by which I mean there's molecules, they have forces on
[01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:47.200]   each other, and it holds up. You and I aren't like that. We maintain our stability dynamically
[01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:52.480]   by ingesting food, fuel, right? Food and water and air and so forth,
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:59.120]   burning it, increasing its entropy. We are non-equilibrium quasi-steady-state systems.
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:05.200]   We are using the fuel the universe gives us in the form of low entropy energy to maintain our
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:10.800]   stability. - I just wonder what that mechanism of surfing looks like. I mean, that's where,
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:16.160]   first of all, I mean, one question to ask, do you think it's possible to have a kind of science of
[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:24.240]   complexity where you have very precise ways or clearly defined ways of measuring complexity?
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:29.680]   - I think it is, and I think we don't. It's possible to have it, I don't think we yet have it.
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:36.320]   In part because complexity is not a univalent thing. There's different ideas that go under
[01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:42.240]   the rubric of complexity. One version is just Kamalgal of complexity, right? If you have a
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:48.960]   configuration or a string of numbers or whatever, can you compress it so that you have a small
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:54.000]   program that will help with that? That's Kamalgal of complexity. But that's the complexity of a
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:57:00.000]   string of numbers, okay? It's not like the complexity of a problem, right? Computational
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:04.160]   complexity, the traveling salesman problem or factoring large numbers. That's a whole different
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:09.440]   kind of question that is also about complexity. So we don't have a sort of unified view of it.
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:13.200]   - Do you think it's possible to have a complexity of a physical system?
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:13.920]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:15.520]   - In the same way we do entropy?
[01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:16.080]   - Yeah.
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:19.040]   - You think that's a Sean Carroll paper or what?
[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:25.840]   - We're working on various things. The glib thing that I'm trying to work on right now with a
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:31.840]   student is complexogenesis. How does complexity come to be if all the universe is doing is moving
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:32.960]   from low entropy to high entropy?
[01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:34.320]   - It's a sexy name.
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:36.960]   - It's a good name. Yeah, I like the name. I just got to write the paper.
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:48.560]   - Sometimes a name arose by any other name. In which context the birth of complexity are you
[01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:49.280]   most interested in?
[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:55.440]   - Well, I think it comes in stages, right? So I think that if you go from the, I'm again a
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:58:02.160]   physicist. So biologists studying evolution will talk about how complexity evolves all the time.
[01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:07.200]   The complexity of the genome, the complexity of our physiology, right? But they take for granted
[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:13.200]   that life already existed and entropy is increasing and so forth. I want to go back to
[01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:18.400]   the beginning and say the early universe was simple and low entropy. And entropy increases
[01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:24.640]   with time and the universe sort of differentiates and becomes more complex. But that statement,
[01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:29.520]   which is indisputably true, has different meanings because complexity has different
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:36.080]   meanings. So sort of the most basic primal version of complexity is what you might think
[01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:41.200]   of as configurational complexity. That's what Komolgorov gets at. How much information do you
[01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:48.400]   need to specify the configuration of the system? Then there's a whole other step where subsystems
[01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:55.920]   of the universe start burning fuel, right? So in many ways, a planet and a star are not that
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:59:00.880]   different in configurational complexity. They're both spheres with density high at the middle and
[01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:05.280]   getting less as you go out. But there's something fundamentally different because the star only
[01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:09.040]   survives as long as it has fuel, right? I mean, then it turns into a brown dwarf or a white dwarf
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:14.880]   or whatever. But as a star, as a main sequence star, it is an out of equilibrium system.
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:20.880]   But it's more or less static, right? Like if I spill the coffee mug and it falls in the process
[01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:26.320]   of falling, it's out of equilibrium, but it's also changing all the time. A specific kind of
[01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:34.080]   system is where it looks sort of macroscopically stationary like a star, but underneath the hood,
[01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:39.840]   it's burning fuel to beat the band in order to maintain that stability. So as stars form,
[01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:44.800]   that's a different kind of complexity that comes to be. Then there's another kind of complexity
[01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:52.000]   that comes to be roughly speaking at the origin of life because that's where you have information
[01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:58.080]   really being gathered and utilized by subsystems of the universe. And then arguably, there's any
[01:59:58.080 --> 02:00:04.560]   number of stages past that. I mean, one of the most obvious ones to me is we talk about simulation
[02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:09.680]   theory, but you and I run simulations in our heads. They're just not that good, but we imagine
[02:00:09.680 --> 02:00:15.040]   different hypothetical futures, right? Bacteria don't do that. So that's the kind of information
[02:00:15.040 --> 02:00:19.040]   processing that is a form of complexity. So I would like to understand all these stages and
[02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:21.760]   how they fit together. Yeah, imagination.
[02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:23.440]   Yeah. Mental time travel.
[02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:29.840]   Yeah. The things going on in my head when I'm imagining worlds are super compressed
[02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:34.400]   representations of those worlds, but they get to the essence of them. And maybe it's possible with
[02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:41.200]   non-human computing type devices to do those kinds of simulations in more and more compressed ways.
[02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:46.240]   There's an argument to be made that literally what separates human beings from other
[02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:51.680]   species on Earth is our ability to imagine counterfactual hypothetical futures.
[02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:59.440]   Yeah. I mean, that's one of the big features. I don't know if it's a-
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:02.640]   Everyone has their own favorite little feature, but that's why I said there's an argument to
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:08.240]   be made. I did a podcast episode on it with Adam Bulley. It developed slowly. I did a different
[02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:12.400]   podcast. Sorry to keep mentioning podcast episodes I did, but Malcolm McIver, who is an engineer at
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:19.120]   Northwestern, has a theory about one of the major stages in evolution is when fish first climbed on
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:23.280]   the land. And I mean, of course, that is a major stage of evolution, but in particular, there's
[02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:30.400]   a cognitive shift. Because when you're a fish swimming under the water, the attenuation length
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:36.240]   of light in water is not that long. You can't see kilometers away. You can see meters away.
[02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:43.680]   And you're moving at meters per second. So all of the evolutionary optimization is make all of your
[02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:48.080]   decisions on a time scale of less than a second. When you see something new, you have to make a
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:53.680]   rapid fire decision what to do about it. As soon as you climb onto land, you can essentially see
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:02:02.160]   forever, right? You can see stars in the sky. So now a whole new mode of reasoning opens up where
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:07.280]   you see something far away. And rather than saying, "Look up, people. I see this. I react,"
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:12.800]   you can say, "Okay, I see that thing. What if I did this? What if I did that? What if I did
[02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:18.000]   something different?" And that's the birth of imagination eventually. >> You've been critical
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:24.320]   on panpsychism. >> Yes, you've noticed that, right. >> Can you make the case for panpsychism
[02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:30.160]   and against it? So panpsychism is the idea that consciousness permeates all matter. Maybe
[02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:41.600]   it's the fundamental force or physics of the fabric of the universe. >> Panpsychism. Thought
[02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:47.680]   everywhere. Consciousness everywhere, right? >> It's to a point of entertainment. The idea
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:54.000]   frustrates you, which sort of as a fan is wonderful to watch. And you've had great episodes
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:03:00.240]   with panpsychists on your podcast where you go at it. >> I had David Chalmers, who's one of the
[02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:07.680]   world's great philosophers, and he is panpsychism curious. He doesn't commit to anything, but he's
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:13.840]   certainly willing to entertain it. Philip Goff, who I've had, who's a great guy, but he is devoted
[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:19.600]   to panpsychism. In fact, he is almost single-handedly responsible for the upsurge of interest in
[02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:25.840]   panpsychism in the popular imagination. And the argument for it is supposed to be that there is
[02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:33.120]   something fundamentally uncapturable about conscious awareness by physical behavior of atoms
[02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:38.960]   and molecules. So the panpsychist will say, "Look, you can tell me maybe someday through advances of
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:46.080]   neuroscience and what have you exactly what happens in your brain and how that translates into thought
[02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:55.120]   and speech and action. What you can't tell me is what it is like to be me. You can't tell me what
[02:03:55.120 --> 02:04:02.080]   I am experiencing when I see something that is red or that tastes something that is sweet.
[02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:07.280]   You can tell me what neurons fire, but you can't tell me what I'm experiencing. That first-person
[02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:15.600]   inner subjective experience is simply not capturable by physics. And therefore,
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:19.840]   this is an old argument, of course, but then the therefore is supposed to be,
[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:25.840]   I need something that is not contained within physics to account for that. And I'm just going
[02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:30.160]   to call it mind. We don't know what it is yet. We're going to call it mind. And it has to be
[02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:36.400]   separate from physics. And then there's two ways to go. If you buy that much, you can either say,
[02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:40.480]   "Okay, I'm going to be a dualist. I'm going to believe that there's matter and mind and they
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:45.920]   are separate from each other and they are interacting somehow." Or that's a little bit
[02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:49.600]   complicated and sketchy as far as physics is going to go. So I'm going to believe in mind,
[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:54.160]   but I'm going to put it prior to matter. I'm going to believe that mind comes first
[02:04:54.160 --> 02:04:59.200]   and that consciousness is the fundamental aspect of reality and everything else,
[02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:06.160]   including matter and physics, comes from it. That would be at least as simple as physics comes first.
[02:05:06.160 --> 02:05:14.560]   Now, the physicalist, such as myself, will say, "I don't have any problem explaining
[02:05:14.560 --> 02:05:20.080]   what it's like to be you or what you experience when you see red. It's a certain way of talking
[02:05:20.080 --> 02:05:27.120]   about the atoms and the neurons, et cetera, that make up you. Just like the hardness or the
[02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:33.360]   brownness of this table, these are words that we attach to certain underlying configurations
[02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:40.080]   of ordinary physical matter. Likewise, sadness and redness or whatever are words that we attach
[02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:47.360]   to you to describe what you're doing." When it comes to consciousness in general, I'm very quick
[02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:55.520]   to say I do not claim to have any special insight on how consciousness works other than I see no
[02:05:55.520 --> 02:05:59.360]   reason to change the laws of physics to account for it. - If you don't have to change the laws
[02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:05.520]   of physics, where do you think it emerges from? Is consciousness an illusion that's almost like
[02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:09.920]   a shorthand that we humans use to describe a certain kind of feeling we have when interacting
[02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:16.720]   with the world? Or is there some big leap that happens at some stage? - I almost never use the
[02:06:16.720 --> 02:06:21.040]   word illusion. Illusion means that there's something that you think you're perceiving
[02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:28.240]   that is actually not there. Like an oasis in the desert is an illusion. It has no causal efficacy.
[02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:33.040]   If you walk up to where the oasis is supposed to be, you'll say you were wrong about it being there.
[02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:37.920]   That's different than something being emergent or non-fundamental but also real. Like this table is
[02:06:37.920 --> 02:06:43.120]   real, even though I know it's made of atoms. That doesn't remove the realness from the table. I
[02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:47.360]   think that consciousness and free will and things like that are just as real in tables and chairs.
[02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:51.920]   - Oasis in the desert does have causal efficacy in that you're thirsty.
[02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:55.760]   - Incorrect causal efficacy. It leads to draw incorrect conclusions about the world.
[02:06:55.760 --> 02:07:03.760]   - Sure, but imagining a thing can sometimes bring it to reality, as we've seen, and that has a kind
[02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:10.000]   of causal efficacy. - Sure, but your understanding of the world
[02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:14.720]   in a way that gives you power over it and influence over it is decreased rather than
[02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:19.680]   increased by believing in that oasis. That is not true about consciousness or this table.
[02:07:19.680 --> 02:07:27.200]   - You don't think you can increase the chance of a thing existing by imagining it existing?
[02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:32.800]   - Unless you build it or make it. - No, that's what I mean. Like
[02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:36.560]   imagining humans can fly. - That's different than imagining
[02:07:36.560 --> 02:07:39.280]   that humans are flying. - Right.
[02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:44.640]   - In terms of counterfactuals in the future, absolutely. Imagination is crucially important.
[02:07:44.640 --> 02:07:49.440]   But that's not an illusion. That's just imagination. - Oh, okay, so the possibility of the
[02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:58.400]   future versus what reality is. I mean, the future is a concept, so you can, well, and time.
[02:07:58.400 --> 02:08:06.160]   Time is just a concept, so you can play with that. But yes, reality.
[02:08:08.800 --> 02:08:14.560]   So to you, so for example, I love asking this. So Donald Hoffman
[02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:22.640]   thinks that the entirety of the conversation we've been having about space-time
[02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:26.400]   is an illusion. Is it possible for you to steelman the case for that?
[02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:35.600]   Can you make the case for and against reality, as I think he writes, that the laws of physics
[02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:40.480]   as we know them with space-time is a kind of interface to a much deeper thing that we don't
[02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:44.320]   at all understand and that we're fooling ourselves by constructing this world?
[02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:48.880]   - Well, I think there's like part of that idea that is perfectly respectable and part of it
[02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:53.120]   that is perfectly nonsensical. And I'm not even gonna try to steelman the nonsensical part.
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:09:02.160]   The real part to me is what is called structural realism. So we don't know what the world is
[02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:09.280]   at a deep fundamental level, right? Let's put ourselves in the minds of people living 200
[02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:12.640]   years ago. They didn't know about quantum mechanics, they didn't know about relativity.
[02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:18.160]   That doesn't mean they were wrong about the universe that they understood. They had Newton's
[02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:24.240]   laws, right? They could predict what time the Sun was gonna rise perfectly well. In the progress of
[02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:32.400]   science, the words that would be used to give the most fundamental description of how you
[02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:37.360]   were predicting the Sun would rise changed because now you have curved space-time and
[02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:40.720]   things like that, right? And you didn't have any of those words 200 years ago.
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:47.040]   But the prediction is the same. Why? Because that prediction, independent of what we thought
[02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:54.640]   the fundamental ontology was, the prediction pointed to something true about our understanding
[02:09:54.640 --> 02:10:01.280]   of reality. To call it an illusion is just wrong, I think. We might not know what the best,
[02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:05.200]   most comprehensive way of stating it is, but it's still true.
[02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:12.800]   >> Is it true in the way, for example, belief in God is true? Because for most of human history,
[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:21.600]   people have believed in a god or multiple gods, and that seemed very true to them.
[02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:29.920]   As an explanation for the way the world is, some of the deeper questions about life itself,
[02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:34.320]   and the human condition, and why certain things happen, that was a good explainer.
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:41.280]   So to you, that's not an illusion? >> No, I think that was completely
[02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:44.880]   an illusion. I think it was a very, very reasonable illusion to be under. There are
[02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:52.000]   illusions. There are substantive claims about the world that go beyond predictions that we can make
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:57.200]   and verify, which later turn out to be wrong. And the existence of God was one of them.
[02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:03.040]   If those people at that time had abandoned their belief in God and replaced it with a
[02:11:03.040 --> 02:11:06.800]   mechanistic universe, they would have done just as well at understanding things.
[02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:12.960]   Again, because there's so many things they didn't understand, it was very reasonable for them to
[02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:17.200]   have that belief. It wasn't that they were dummies or anything like that. But that is,
[02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:22.720]   as we understand the universe better and better, some things stick with us, some things get replaced.
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:31.120]   >> So like you said, you're a believer of the mechanistic universe. You're a naturalist,
[02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:35.200]   and as you've described, a poetic naturalist. >> That's right.
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:39.520]   >> What's the word poetic? What is naturalism, and what is poetic naturalism?
[02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:42.880]   >> Naturalism is just the idea that all that exists is the natural world.
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:47.600]   There's no supernatural world. You can have arguments about what that means,
[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:53.040]   but I would claim that the argument should be about what the word supernatural means,
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:56.560]   not the word natural. The natural world is the world that we learn about by doing science.
[02:11:56.560 --> 02:12:00.560]   The poetic part means that you shouldn't be too,
[02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:07.760]   I want to say, fundamentalist about what the natural world is. As we went from
[02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:16.240]   Newtonian space-time to Einsteinian space-time, something is maintained there. There is a
[02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:22.160]   different story that we can tell about the world, and that story in the Newtonian regime,
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:25.840]   if you want to fly a rocket to the moon, you don't use general relativity. You use Newtonian
[02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:31.360]   mechanics. That story works perfectly well. The poetic aspect of the story is that there are many
[02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:38.560]   ways of talking about the natural world, and as long as those ways latch on to something real and
[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:43.600]   causally efficacious about the functioning of the world, then we attribute some reality and truth
[02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:46.240]   to them. >> So the poetic really looks at the,
[02:12:46.240 --> 02:12:52.320]   let's say, the pothead questions at the edge of science. It's more open to them.
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:57.280]   >> It's doing double duty a little bit, so that's why it's confusing. The more obvious respectable
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:13:03.920]   duty it's doing is that tables are real. Even though you know that it's really a quantum field
[02:13:03.920 --> 02:13:08.560]   theory wave function, tables are still real. They're a different way of talking about
[02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:14.880]   the underlying deeper reality of it. The other duty it's doing is that we move beyond purely
[02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:21.040]   descriptive vocabularies for discussing the universe onto normative and prescriptive and
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:26.320]   judgmental ways of talking about the universe. This painting is beautiful, that one is ugly.
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:32.000]   This action is morally right, that one is morally wrong. These are also ways of talking about the
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:38.080]   universe. They are not fixed by the phenomena. They are not determined by our observations.
[02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:42.720]   They cannot be ruled out by a crucial experiment, but they're still valid. They might not be
[02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:48.800]   universal, they might be subjective, but they're not arbitrary, and they do have a role in describing
[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:51.360]   how the world works. >> So you don't think it's possible to
[02:13:51.360 --> 02:14:01.520]   construct experiments that explore the realms of morality and even meaning? So those are subjective?
[02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:06.160]   >> Yeah, they're human, they're personal. >> But do you think that's just because we
[02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:12.640]   don't have a, the tools of science have not expanded enough to incorporate the human experience?
[02:14:12.640 --> 02:14:17.520]   >> No, I don't think that's what it is. I think that what we mean by aesthetics or morality
[02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:24.320]   are we're attaching categories, properties, to things that happen in the physical world.
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:28.480]   And there is always going to be some subjectivity to our attachment and how we do that, and that's
[02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:31.440]   okay. And the faster we recognize that and deal with it, the better off we'll be.
[02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:38.000]   >> But if we deeply and fully understand the function of the human mind, we'll be able to
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:41.760]   incorporate that? >> No, that will absolutely be helpful in
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:47.280]   explaining why certain people have certain moral beliefs. It won't justify those beliefs as right
[02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:49.200]   or wrong. >> Do you think it's possible to have a kind
[02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:55.600]   of general relativity, but that includes the observer effect where the human mind is the
[02:14:55.600 --> 02:15:04.400]   observer? Sort of like how we morph, in the same way gravity morphs space-time, how does the human
[02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:14.400]   mind morph reality and have a very thorough theory of how that morphing actually happens?
[02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:18.480]   >> That's a very plot-head question, Lex. >> But it is possible.
[02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:24.480]   >> But the answer is yes. I think that there's no, I think that we're part of the physical world,
[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:31.200]   and the natural world. Physicalism would have been just as good a word to use as naturalism,
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:35.120]   maybe even a more accurate word, but it's a little bit more off-putting, so I do want a
[02:15:35.120 --> 02:15:41.760]   snappier, more attractive label than physicalism. >> Are there limits to science?
[02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:45.280]   >> Sure. We just talked about one, right? Science can't tell you right from wrong.
[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:53.120]   You need science to implement your ideas about right and wrong. If you are functioning on the
[02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:57.840]   basis of an incorrect view of how the world works, you might very well think you're doing right but
[02:15:57.840 --> 02:16:02.720]   actually be doing wrong. But all the science in the world won't tell you which action is right
[02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:06.960]   and which action is wrong. >> You know, dictators and people in
[02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:14.240]   power will sometimes use science as an authority to convince you what's right and wrong. Studying
[02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:17.920]   Nazi science is fascinating. >> Yeah, but there's an instrumentalist
[02:16:17.920 --> 02:16:22.480]   view here. You have to first decide what your goals are, and then science can help you achieve
[02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:28.240]   those goals. If your goals are horrible, science has no problem helping you achieve them. Science
[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:31.200]   is happy to help out. >> Let me ask you about the method behind
[02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:37.360]   the madness on several aspects of your life. So you mentioned that your approach to writing for
[02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:42.560]   research and writing popular books, how do you find the time of the day? Like, what's the day
[02:16:42.560 --> 02:16:45.520]   in the life of Sean Carroll looks like? >> Very unclear how I find the time.
[02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:49.760]   >> So you don't have a thing where in the morning you're like, you try to fight for
[02:16:49.760 --> 02:16:52.800]   two hours somewhere? >> I don't. I'm really terrible at that.
[02:16:52.800 --> 02:16:59.600]   My strategy for finding time is just to ignore interruptions and emails. But it's a different
[02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:03.520]   time every day, some days it never happens, some weeks it never happens.
[02:17:03.520 --> 02:17:06.800]   >> Well, really, you're able to pull it off because you're extremely prolific. So you're
[02:17:06.800 --> 02:17:14.400]   able to have days where you don't write and still write the next day. Oh, wow. That's a rare thing,
[02:17:14.400 --> 02:17:21.280]   right? A lot of prolific writers will carve out two hours because otherwise it just disappears.
[02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:30.240]   >> Right. No, I get that. Yeah, I do. And yeah, it's just like everyone has their foibles or
[02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:37.280]   whatever. So I'm not able to do that, therefore I have to just figure it out on the fly.
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:41.360]   >> And what's the actual process look like when you're writing popular stuff? You get
[02:17:41.360 --> 02:17:44.720]   behind a computer? >> Yeah, get behind a computer. And my way
[02:17:44.720 --> 02:17:50.400]   of doing it, so my wife, Jennifer, is a science writer. But it's interesting because our techniques
[02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:54.720]   are entirely different. She will think about something, but then she will free write. She'll
[02:17:54.720 --> 02:18:00.320]   just sit at a computer and write. Like, I think this, I think this. And then that will be vastly
[02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:06.720]   compressed, edited, rewritten or whatever until the final thing happens. I will just sit there
[02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:12.320]   silently thinking for a very long time, and then I will write what is almost the final draft. So a
[02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:16.320]   lot of it happens. There might be some scribbles for an outline or something like that, but a lot
[02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:20.080]   of it is in my brain before it's on the page. >> So that's the case for the biggest ideas in
[02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:22.960]   the universe, the quanta book and the space-time motion book?
[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:27.040]   >> Yeah, quanta and fields, which is actually mostly about quantum field theory and particle
[02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:35.760]   physics. That's coming out in May. And that is, I'm letting people in on things that no other book
[02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:39.920]   lets them in on. So I hope it's worth it. It's a challenge because there's a lot of equations.
[02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:44.320]   >> I mean, you did the same thing with space-time motion. You did something quite interesting,
[02:18:44.320 --> 02:18:48.240]   which is like you made the equation the centerpiece of a book.
[02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:56.400]   >> Right. There's a lot of equations. Book two goes further in those directions than book one did.
[02:18:56.400 --> 02:19:03.440]   So it's more cool stuff. It's also more mind-bending. It's more of a challenge.
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:08.400]   Book three that I'm writing right now is called Complexity and Emergence.
[02:19:08.400 --> 02:19:10.400]   >> Oh, wow. >> And that'll be the final
[02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:12.800]   part of the trilogy. >> Oh, that's fascinating.
[02:19:12.800 --> 02:19:16.880]   So there's a lot of probably ideas there. I mean, that's a real cutting edge.
[02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:23.200]   >> Well, but I'm not trying to be cutting edge. In other words, I'm not trying to speculate in
[02:19:23.200 --> 02:19:28.080]   these books. Obviously, in other books, I've been very free about speculating. But the point of
[02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:33.760]   these books is to say things that 500 years from now will still be true. And so there are some
[02:19:33.760 --> 02:19:38.560]   things we know about complexity and emergence, and I want to focus on those. And I will mention,
[02:19:38.560 --> 02:19:42.640]   I'm happy to say, this is something that needs to be speculated about, but I won't pretend to
[02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:46.240]   be telling you what one is the right one. >> You somehow found the balance between
[02:19:46.240 --> 02:19:49.680]   the rigor of mathematics and still accessible, which is interesting.
[02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:55.440]   >> I try. I mean, look, these three books, the biggest ideas books, are absolutely an experiment.
[02:19:56.160 --> 02:20:02.560]   They're going to appeal to a smaller audience than other books will. But that audience should
[02:20:02.560 --> 02:20:07.440]   love them. My 16-year-old self would have been so happy to get these books, I can't tell you.
[02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:12.640]   >> Yeah, in terms of looking back in history, those books, the trilogy would be truly special
[02:20:12.640 --> 02:20:17.760]   in that way. Worked for Lord of the Rings, so I figured, why not me? You and Tolkien are just-
[02:20:17.760 --> 02:20:21.680]   >> Yeah, different styles, different topics. >> Same ultimate reality.
[02:20:22.880 --> 02:20:31.280]   >> Like we mentioned, Mindscape Podcast, I love it. You interview a huge variety of experts
[02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:36.400]   from all kinds of fields, so just several questions I want to ask. How do you prepare?
[02:20:36.400 --> 02:20:42.160]   Like, how do you prepare to have a good conversation? How do you prepare in a way that
[02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:46.160]   satisfies, makes your own curious mind happy, all that kind of stuff?
[02:20:46.160 --> 02:20:49.520]   >> Yeah, no, these are great questions, and I've sort of struggled and changed my
[02:20:50.160 --> 02:20:54.960]   techniques over the years. It's over five-year-old podcast, might be approaching six years old now.
[02:20:54.960 --> 02:21:03.440]   I started out over-preparing when I first started. I had a journey that I was going to go down.
[02:21:03.440 --> 02:21:08.560]   Many of the people I talk to are academics or thinkers who write books, so they have a story
[02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:14.560]   to tell. I could just say, "Okay, give me your lecture," and then an hour later, stop, right?
[02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:20.720]   So the mistake is to sort of anticipate what the lecture would be and to ask the leading questions
[02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:27.200]   that would pull it out of them. What I do now is much more, here are the points, here are like the
[02:21:27.200 --> 02:21:34.240]   big questions that I'm interested in, and so I have a much sketchier outline to start, and then
[02:21:34.240 --> 02:21:40.720]   try to make it more of a real conversation. I'm helped by the fact that it is not my day job,
[02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:50.320]   so I strictly limit myself to one day of my life per podcast episode, on average. Some days take
[02:21:50.320 --> 02:21:55.120]   more, and that includes not just doing the research, but inviting the guests, recording it,
[02:21:55.120 --> 02:21:59.760]   editing it, publishing it. So I need to be very, very efficient at that, yeah.
[02:21:59.760 --> 02:22:03.280]   >> You enforce constraints for yourself in which creativity can emerge.
[02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:09.920]   >> That's right, that's right. And look, sometimes if I'm interviewing a theoretical physicist,
[02:22:09.920 --> 02:22:15.280]   I can just go in. And when I'm interviewing an economist or a historian, I have to do a lot of
[02:22:15.280 --> 02:22:16.880]   work. >> Do you ever find yourself
[02:22:16.880 --> 02:22:23.520]   getting lost in rabbit holes that serve no purpose except satisfying your own curiosity,
[02:22:23.520 --> 02:22:28.880]   and then potentially expanding the range of things you know that can help your actual
[02:22:28.880 --> 02:22:33.360]   work and research and writing? >> Yes, on both counts. You know, I do,
[02:22:33.360 --> 02:22:39.200]   some people have so many things to talk about that you don't know where to start or finish,
[02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:45.280]   right? Others have a message. And one of the things I discovered over the course of these years
[02:22:45.280 --> 02:22:50.800]   is the correlation with age. Like, there are brilliant people, and I try very hard on the
[02:22:50.800 --> 02:22:55.600]   podcast to sort of get all sorts of people, right, different ages and things like that.
[02:22:55.600 --> 02:23:03.280]   And bless their hearts, the most brilliant young people are not as practiced at wandering past
[02:23:03.840 --> 02:23:09.440]   their literal research, right? They have less mastery over the field as a whole,
[02:23:09.440 --> 02:23:14.400]   much less how to talk about it. Whereas certain older people just like have their patent answers,
[02:23:14.400 --> 02:23:18.320]   and that's kind of boring, right? So you want somewhere in between, you know, the ideal person
[02:23:18.320 --> 02:23:25.360]   has a broad enough scope that they can wander outside their specific papers they've written,
[02:23:25.360 --> 02:23:28.640]   but they're not overly practiced, so they're just giving you their canned answers.
[02:23:28.640 --> 02:23:32.400]   >> I feel like there's like a connection to the metaphor of entropy and complexity,
[02:23:32.400 --> 02:23:40.480]   as you said there. You also do incredible AMAs, and people should sign up to your Patreon because
[02:23:40.480 --> 02:23:49.360]   you can get to ask questions, Sean Carroll. For several hours, you just answer in fascinating
[02:23:49.360 --> 02:23:54.800]   ways some really interesting questions. Is there something you could say about the process of
[02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:58.240]   finding the answers to those? >> That's a great one. Again,
[02:23:58.240 --> 02:24:04.880]   it's evolved over time. Yeah, so the Ask Me Anything episodes were first, when I started
[02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:10.560]   doing them, they were only for Patreon subscribers to both listen to and to ask the questions. But
[02:24:10.560 --> 02:24:15.600]   then I actually asked my Patreon subscribers, "Would you like me to release them publicly?"
[02:24:15.600 --> 02:24:20.080]   And they overwhelmingly voted yes, so I do that. So the Patreon supporters ask the questions,
[02:24:20.080 --> 02:24:26.240]   everyone can listen. And also at some point, I really used to try to answer every question,
[02:24:26.240 --> 02:24:32.160]   but now there's just too many, so I have to pick, and that's fraught with peril. And my personal
[02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:37.440]   standard for picking questions to answer is what are the ones I think I have interesting answers
[02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:43.520]   to give for, right? So that both means if it's kind of the same old question about special
[02:24:43.520 --> 02:24:47.920]   relativity that I've gotten 100 times before, I'm not going to answer it, because you can just
[02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:56.800]   Google that, it's easier. There are some very clear attempts to ask an interesting question
[02:24:56.800 --> 02:25:01.680]   that honestly just I don't have an answer to. Like, "I read this science fiction novel,
[02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:05.520]   what do you think about it?" I'm like, "Well, I haven't read it, so I can't help you there."
[02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:10.480]   "What's your favorite color?" I could tell you what it is, but it's not that interesting.
[02:25:10.480 --> 02:25:18.160]   And so I try to make it a mix. It's not all physics questions, not all philosophy questions.
[02:25:18.160 --> 02:25:23.280]   I will talk about food or movies or politics or religion if that's what people want. I keep
[02:25:23.280 --> 02:25:26.480]   suggesting that people ask me for relationship advice, but they never do.
[02:25:26.480 --> 02:25:33.440]   >> Yeah, I don't think I've heard one. >> I'm willing to do it, but I'm a little
[02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:39.280]   reluctant because I don't actually like giving advice, but I'm happy to talk about those topics.
[02:25:39.280 --> 02:25:46.960]   I want to give several hours of talking, and I want to try to say things that I haven't said
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:50.000]   before and keep it interesting, keep it rolling. If you don't like this question, wait for the
[02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:51.040]   next one. >> What are some of the
[02:25:51.040 --> 02:25:55.520]   harder questions you've gotten, do you remember? What kinds of questions are difficult for you?
[02:25:55.520 --> 02:26:01.440]   >> Rarely, but occasionally, people will ask me a super insightful philosophy question.
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:08.800]   Like, I hadn't thought of things in exactly that way, and I try to recognize that.
[02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:16.560]   A lot of times, it's the opposite, where it's like, OK, you're clearly confused,
[02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:19.920]   and I'm going to try to explain the question you should have asked.
[02:26:19.920 --> 02:26:23.600]   >> I love those. Yeah, why that's the wrong question or that kind of stuff, that's great.
[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:24.720]   >> Right. >> That's great.
[02:26:24.720 --> 02:26:30.000]   >> But the hard questions, I don't know. I don't actually answer personal questions very much.
[02:26:30.720 --> 02:26:34.080]   The most personal I will get are questions like, "What do you think of Baltimore?"
[02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:38.080]   Right? That much I can talk about. Or, "How are your cats doing?" Happy to talk about the cats
[02:26:38.080 --> 02:26:42.480]   in infinite detail. But very personal questions I don't get into.
[02:26:42.480 --> 02:26:45.520]   >> But you even touch politics and stuff like this.
[02:26:45.520 --> 02:26:52.160]   >> Yeah, no, very happy to talk about politics. I try to be clear on what is professional
[02:26:52.160 --> 02:26:55.840]   expertise, what is just me babbling, what is my level of credence in different things,
[02:26:55.840 --> 02:26:59.280]   where you're allowed to disagree, whether if you disagree, you're just wrong.
[02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:08.000]   And people can disagree with that also. But I do think, and I'm happy to go out on a limb
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:11.600]   a little bit. I'm happy to say, "Look, I don't know, but here's my guess." Right?
[02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:16.800]   I just did a whole solo podcast, which was exactly that. And it's interesting, some people are like,
[02:27:16.800 --> 02:27:19.760]   "Oh, this was great." And there's a whole bunch of people like, "Why are you talking
[02:27:19.760 --> 02:27:23.200]   about this thing that you are not the world's expert in?" So, you know?
[02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:28.560]   >> Well, I love the actual dance between humility and having a strong opinion on stuff,
[02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:34.880]   which is a great, it's a fascinating dance to pull off. And I guess the way to do that is to just
[02:27:34.880 --> 02:27:40.000]   expand into all kinds of topics and play with ideas and then change your mind and all that
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:48.240]   kind of stuff. >> Yeah, it's interesting because when people react against you by saying, "You are
[02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:56.000]   being arrogant about this," 99.999% of the time, all they mean is, "I disagree." That's all they
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:05.280]   really mean, right? Like, at a very basic level, people will accuse atheists of being arrogant.
[02:28:05.280 --> 02:28:10.320]   And I'm like, "You think God exists and loves you, and you're telling me that I'm arrogant."
[02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:18.320]   I think that all of this is to say, just advice. When you disagree with somebody,
[02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:23.840]   try to specify the substantive disagreement. Try not to psychologize them, right? Try to say, "Oh,
[02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:29.440]   you're saying this because of this." Maybe it's true, maybe you're right. But if you had an actual
[02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:34.080]   response to what they were saying, that would be much more interesting. >> Yeah, I think, I wonder
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:42.000]   why it's difficult for people to say or to imply, "I respect you, I like you, but I disagree on this,
[02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:51.440]   and here's why I disagree." I wonder why they go to this place of like, "Well, you're an idiot," or
[02:28:51.440 --> 02:29:01.200]   "You're egotistical," or "You're confused," or "You're naive," or all the kinds of words,
[02:29:01.200 --> 02:29:06.240]   as opposed to like, "I respect you as a fellow human being exploring the world of mysteries
[02:29:06.240 --> 02:29:10.880]   all around us, and I disagree." >> I will complicate the question even more,
[02:29:10.880 --> 02:29:17.360]   because there's some people I don't respect or like. And I once wrote a blog post, I think it
[02:29:17.360 --> 02:29:23.440]   was called The Grid of Disputation. And I had a two-by-two grid, and it's, "Are you someone I
[02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:31.680]   agree with or disagree with? Are you someone who I respect or don't?" And all four quadrants are
[02:29:31.680 --> 02:29:38.960]   very populated. And so what that means is, there are people who I like and I disagree with, and
[02:29:38.960 --> 02:29:43.120]   there are people who agree with me and I have no respect for at all, the embarrassing allies
[02:29:43.120 --> 02:29:50.240]   quadrant. That was everyone's favorite. And I just think being honest, trying to be honest about
[02:29:50.240 --> 02:29:55.760]   where people are, but if you actually want to move a conversation forward, forget about whether you
[02:29:55.760 --> 02:30:00.160]   like or don't like somebody. Explain the disagreement, explain the agreement. But
[02:30:00.160 --> 02:30:04.560]   you're absolutely right. I completely agree, as a society, we are not very good at disagreeing.
[02:30:04.560 --> 02:30:08.480]   We instantly go to the insults. >> Yeah, and I mean, even on a deeper level,
[02:30:08.480 --> 02:30:18.240]   I think at some deep level, I respect and love the humanity in the other person.
[02:30:18.240 --> 02:30:23.840]   >> Yep. >> You said that general
[02:30:23.840 --> 02:30:27.120]   relativity is the most beautiful theory ever? >> So far.
[02:30:27.120 --> 02:30:32.960]   >> What do you find beautiful about it? >> Let's put it this way. When I teach courses,
[02:30:34.480 --> 02:30:40.880]   there's no more satisfying subject to teach than general relativity. And the reason why is because
[02:30:40.880 --> 02:30:50.480]   it starts from very clear, precisely articulated assumptions, and it goes so far. And when I give
[02:30:50.480 --> 02:30:54.000]   my talk, you can find it online, I'm probably not going to give it again. The book, one of the
[02:30:54.000 --> 02:31:01.360]   biggest ideas, talk, was building up from, you don't know any math or physics, an hour later,
[02:31:01.360 --> 02:31:07.840]   you know Einstein's equation for general relativity. And the punchline is, the equation
[02:31:07.840 --> 02:31:14.000]   is much smarter than Albert Einstein. Because Albert Einstein did not know about the Big Bang,
[02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:18.800]   he didn't know about gravitational waves, he didn't know about black holes, but his equation did.
[02:31:18.800 --> 02:31:26.960]   And that's a miraculous aspect of science more generally, but general relativity is
[02:31:26.960 --> 02:31:32.800]   where it manifests itself in the most absolutely obvious way. >> A human question,
[02:31:32.800 --> 02:31:39.920]   what do you think of the fact that Einstein didn't get the Nobel Prize for general relativity?
[02:31:39.920 --> 02:31:45.360]   >> Tragedy. He should have gotten maybe four Nobel Prizes, honestly.
[02:31:45.360 --> 02:31:48.320]   >> That one. >> He certainly should have got,
[02:31:48.320 --> 02:31:53.200]   the photoelectric effect was 100% worth the Nobel Prize, because, and people don't quite get this,
[02:31:53.840 --> 02:31:57.920]   who cares about the photoelectric effect? That's like this very minor effect. The point is his
[02:31:57.920 --> 02:32:04.800]   explanation for the photoelectric effect invented something called the photon. That's worth the
[02:32:04.800 --> 02:32:12.880]   Nobel Prize. Max Planck gets credit for this in 1900, explaining black-body radiation by saying
[02:32:12.880 --> 02:32:19.920]   that when a little electron is jiggling in an object at some temperature, gives off radiation
[02:32:20.480 --> 02:32:28.160]   in discrete chunks rather than continuously. He didn't quite say that's because radiation
[02:32:28.160 --> 02:32:32.800]   is discrete chunks, right? It's like having a coffee maker that makes one cup of coffee at
[02:32:32.800 --> 02:32:37.360]   a time. It doesn't mean that liquid comes in one cup quanta, right? It's just that you are
[02:32:37.360 --> 02:32:43.920]   dispensing it like that. It was Einstein in 1905 who said light is quanta, and that was a radical
[02:32:43.920 --> 02:32:49.360]   thing. So that clearly, that was not a mistake, but also special relativity clearly deserved the
[02:32:49.360 --> 02:32:54.080]   Nobel Prize, and general relativity clearly deserved the Nobel Prize. Not only were they
[02:32:54.080 --> 02:32:56.880]   brilliant, but they were experimentally verified, like everything you want.
[02:32:56.880 --> 02:32:58.160]   - So separately, you think?
[02:32:58.160 --> 02:32:59.840]   - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[02:32:59.840 --> 02:33:04.560]   - Oh, humans, whatever the explanation there.
[02:33:04.560 --> 02:33:09.600]   - Edwin Hubble never won the Nobel Prize for finding the universe was expanding.
[02:33:09.600 --> 02:33:14.960]   - Yeah, and even the fact that we give prizes is almost kind of silly, and we limit the number
[02:33:14.960 --> 02:33:16.640]   of people that get the prize and all that.
[02:33:16.960 --> 02:33:23.680]   - I think the Nobel Prize has enormous problems. I think it's probably a net good for the world
[02:33:23.680 --> 02:33:29.680]   because it brings attention to good science. I think it's probably a net negative for science
[02:33:29.680 --> 02:33:32.560]   because it makes people want to win the Nobel Prize.
[02:33:32.560 --> 02:33:39.360]   - Yeah, there's a lot of fascinating human stories underneath it all. Science is its own thing,
[02:33:39.360 --> 02:33:43.520]   but it's also a collection of humans, and it's a beautiful collection. There's tension,
[02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:50.080]   there's competition, there's jealousy, but there's also great collaborations and all that kind of
[02:33:50.080 --> 02:34:00.320]   stuff. Daniel Kahneman, who recently passed, is one of the great stories of collaboration in science.
[02:34:00.320 --> 02:34:07.600]   So all of it, all of it, that's what humans do. And Sean, thank you for being the person that
[02:34:07.600 --> 02:34:13.680]   makes us celebrate science and fall in love with all of these beautiful ideas in science,
[02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:20.400]   for writing amazing books, for being legit and still pushing forward the research science side
[02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:29.680]   of it, and for allowing me and these pothead questions, and also for educating everybody
[02:34:29.680 --> 02:34:36.640]   through your own podcast. Everybody should stop everything and subscribe and listen to every
[02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:41.120]   single episode of Mindscape. So thank you. I've been a huge fan forever. I'm really honored that
[02:34:41.120 --> 02:34:45.680]   you would speak with me in the early days when I was still starting this podcast and meeting the
[02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:47.280]   world. - I appreciate it. Thanks very much
[02:34:47.280 --> 02:34:50.000]   for having me on, now that you're a big deal, still having me on.
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:56.080]   - Thank you, Sean. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sean Carroll. To support this
[02:34:56.080 --> 02:35:01.040]   podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some
[02:35:01.040 --> 02:35:07.760]   words from Richard Feynman. Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined,
[02:35:07.760 --> 02:35:15.040]   irreverent, and original manner possible. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
