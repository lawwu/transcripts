[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   The following is a conversation with Jared Kushner,
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.320]   former senior advisor to the president
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.420]   during the Donald Trump administration
[00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.280]   and author of "Breaking History," a White House memoir.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.840]   He's one of the most influential
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.960]   and effective presidential advisors in modern history,
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.080]   helping conduct negotiations
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.240]   with some of the most powerful leaders in the world
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.360]   and deliver results on trade, criminal justice reform,
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.000]   and historic progress towards peace in the Middle East.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.800]   On Thursday, October 5th,
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.560]   we recorded a conversation on topics of war and peace,
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.840]   history and power in the Middle East and beyond.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.000]   This was about a day and a half
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.120]   before the Hamas attack on Israel.
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.040]   And then we felt we must sit down again
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.920]   on Monday, October 9th,
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.160]   and add a discussion on the current situation.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.540]   We opened the podcast with the second newly recorded part.
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.840]   My heart goes out to everyone
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.520]   who has and is suffering in this war.
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.520]   I pray for your strength
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.120]   and for the long-term peace and flourishing
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.520]   of the Israeli and Palestinian people.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.460]   I love you all.
[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.120]   This is Alex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.660]   And now, dear friends, here's Jared Kushner.
[00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.160]   We did a lot of this conversation
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.360]   before the Hamas attack on Israel,
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.000]   and we decided to sit down again
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.040]   and finish the discussion to address the current situation,
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.840]   which is still developing.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.960]   If I may, allow me to summarize the situation
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.480]   as it stands today.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.360]   It's morning, Monday, October 9th.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.880]   On Saturday, October 7th, at 6.30 a.m. Israel time,
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.600]   Hamas fired thousands of rockets into southern Israel.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.200]   The rocket attack served as cover
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.120]   for a multi-pronged infiltration of Israel territory
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.040]   by over 1,000 Hamas militants.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.860]   This is shortly after, at 7.40 a.m.
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.840]   The Hamas militants went door-to-door in border towns,
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.540]   killing civilians and taking captives,
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.920]   including women and children.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.120]   In response to this,
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.320]   Israeli Air Force began carrying out strikes in Gaza,
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.280]   also fighting on the ground in Israel
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.040]   to clear out Hamas militants from Israel territory,
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.720]   and preparing to mobilize Israeli troops
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.560]   for a potential ground attack on Hamas in Gaza.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.760]   Now, of course, this is what it appears to be right now,
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.240]   and this, along with other things, might change,
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.200]   because the situation is still developing.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.760]   The IDF is ordering civilian residents of Gaza
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.160]   to evacuate their homes for their safety.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.800]   Benjamin Netanyahu declared war in several statements,
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.680]   and warned Israelis to brace themselves
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.700]   for a long and difficult war.
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.680]   Just today, Israeli ministers
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.920]   ordered a, quote, "complete siege of Gaza,"
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.360]   interrupting supplies of electricity, food, water, and fuel
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.280]   from Israel to Gaza.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.040]   As of now, October 9th, the death toll is over 1,200 people,
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.160]   and over 130 hostages taken to Gaza by Hamas.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.120]   So, as I said, the events are rapidly unfolding,
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.240]   so these numbers will sadly increase.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.600]   But hopefully, our words here can at least, in part,
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.600]   speak to the timeless underlying currents of the history,
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.240]   and as you write about, the power dynamics of the region.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.880]   So, for people who don't know,
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.880]   Gaza is a 25 miles long, six miles wide strip of territory
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.600]   along the Mediterranean Sea.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.520]   It borders Israel on the east and north,
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.480]   and Egypt on the southwest.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.240]   It's densely populated, about 2.3 million people,
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.320]   and there's been a blockade of Gaza by Israel and Egypt
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.800]   since 2007, when Hamas took power.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.560]   I could just summarize that Hamas
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.360]   is a Palestinian militant group
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.760]   which rules the Gaza Strip.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.760]   It originated in 1988, and it came to power in Gaza in 2006.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.080]   As part of its charter,
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.800]   it's sworn to the destruction of Israel,
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.760]   and it is designated by the United States,
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.640]   European Union, UK, and, of course,
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.200]   Israel as a terrorist group.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.320]   So, given that context, what are your feelings
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.640]   as a human being, and what is your analysis
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.080]   as the former senior advisor to the president
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.000]   under the Trump administration
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.360]   of the current situation in Israel and Gaza?
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.000]   - So, I think you did an excellent job
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.040]   of summarizing a lot of the context,
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.640]   but watching what's unfolded over the last 48 hours
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.360]   has been truly heartbreaking to see.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.920]   We're still in the early stages of what's developing,
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.920]   but seeing the images on X of militants,
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.720]   terrorists going door to door with machine guns,
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.120]   gunning down innocent civilians,
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.120]   seeing beheaded Israeli soldiers,
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.120]   seeing young 20-year-olds at a rave dance party
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.040]   to celebrate peace with militants flying in
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.000]   and then shooting machine guns
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.080]   to kill people indiscriminately,
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.840]   seeing young children captive and held prisoner,
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.120]   seeing 80-year-old grandmothers, a Holocaust survivor,
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.600]   also being taken captive,
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.840]   these are just images and actions
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.240]   that we have not seen in this world since 9/11.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.520]   This is a terror attack on the scale
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.340]   of which we have not seen,
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.420]   and it's been incredibly hard
[00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.520]   for a lot of people to comprehend.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.000]   My heart goes out, obviously,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.960]   to all of the families of the victims,
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.640]   to the families of those who are held in captive now,
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.540]   and to all of Israel,
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.360]   because one of the beautiful things
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.520]   about the state of Israel is that
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.980]   when one Israeli is hurting,
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.320]   the entire nation comes together.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.960]   It's a shame that it's taking an action like this
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.560]   to unify the nation,
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.800]   but I have seen incredibly beautiful signs
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.040]   over the last 48 hours of a country coming together.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.600]   The Jewish people have been under oppression before.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.580]   The Jewish people know what it's like,
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.380]   and seeing people rally together
[00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.380]   to fight for their homeland,
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.900]   to try to reestablish safety,
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.720]   is a very beautiful thing to watch.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.040]   I wish it wasn't something we had to watch, but it is.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.920]   With that being said, though,
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.600]   the backdrop, I've been speaking to friends
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.460]   over the last couple of days.
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.780]   One friend I spoke with last night
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.620]   who was saying that,
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.100]   a good friend messaged him saying,
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.440]   I'm going in, we're gonna do some operations
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.520]   to try to free some of the hostages,
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.320]   held in one of the kibbutzes,
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.600]   messaged him the next morning.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.400]   He was one of the first through the door
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.480]   to try to free these hostages,
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.440]   and he was killed by a Hamas militant.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.600]   And sadly, we're gonna be hearing many, many more stories
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.600]   of brave Israeli soldiers
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.120]   trying to get these terrorists out of Israel,
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.520]   trying to free innocent civilians
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.900]   who unfortunately are risking their lives to do it.
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.600]   And they're all heroes,
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.840]   but some will have a less good fate than others, sadly.
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.640]   So it's a very, very heartbreaking moment.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.280]   And I do think that it's very important
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.440]   at this moment in time for the entire world
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.460]   to stand behind Israel.
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.240]   I think that Hamas has shown the entire world
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.720]   who they really are.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.120]   I think what their aim is, what they're willing to do.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:37.120]   And all of the strong security that Israel's put in place
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.280]   over the last years,
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.120]   which in some instances was criticized,
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.560]   I think is now being validated
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.800]   that there was a real threat
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.640]   that they were looking to deter.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.560]   So short answer is my heart is broken,
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.600]   praying for peace, praying for strength,
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.240]   praying for Israel to do what it needs to do
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.260]   to avoid being in this situation again,
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.520]   which is either eliminating
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.840]   or severely degrading Hamas's capabilities.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.720]   There cannot be peace in Israel
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.000]   and in the Middle East while there is a terror group
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.520]   that is being funded by Iran,
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.640]   that is allowed to flourish
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.360]   and is allowed to plan operations
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.780]   that are gonna aim to kill innocent civilians.
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.520]   And so as somebody who was formerly in this position,
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.080]   who was intimately involved with Israel,
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.440]   with the strategies to minimize attacks from Hamas
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.080]   and to try to turn the region around.
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.800]   And I think we did do a very substantial job
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.320]   under President Trump.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.160]   The Middle East went from one of the most chaotic regions
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.000]   in the world.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.160]   You had ISIS in 2016.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.520]   ISIS had a caliphate the size of Ohio.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.840]   They're beheading journalists.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.600]   They were killing Christians.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.260]   They controlled 8 million people.
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:58.200]   They were planning attacks all over the world
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.220]   from their caliphate.
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:04.720]   They were using the internet to radicalize people.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.120]   We had the San Bernardino shooting in America.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:12.080]   We had the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.340]   And there was real threat.
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.840]   And then you had Iran,
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.080]   which was given $150 billion in a glide path
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.720]   to a nuclear weapon.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.040]   And they were using their newfound riches
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.640]   to fund Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis,
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.160]   different rebels all over the region
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.560]   that were looking to destabilize further.
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.240]   Syria was in a civil war where 500,000 people were killed.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.240]   Yemen was destabilized.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.200]   Libya was destabilized.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.120]   And it was just a mess.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.600]   And all of America's allies had felt betrayed.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.080]   President Trump came into power.
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.240]   We rebuilt the trust and the relationships
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.080]   with all of our traditional allies.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.640]   We were able to eliminate ISIS, the territorial caliphate.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.020]   And then we were able to project strength in the region,
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.580]   really go after Iran's wallet.
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.160]   We were able to stop through crushing sanctions
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.280]   a lot of their financial resources,
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.960]   which they were using to fund all these terror groups.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.000]   And so we left the Middle East with six peace deals
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.520]   and a fairly peaceful world.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.280]   So seeing what's happening,
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.640]   I think it was completely avoidable.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.420]   I think it's horrible to see that it's occurring.
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:20.620]   And I pray that those in power will make the right decisions
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.880]   to restore safety,
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.360]   but also to potentially create a better paradigm
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.840]   for peace in the future.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.760]   - So I have a lot of questions to ask you
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.080]   about the journey towards this historic progress
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.960]   towards peace with Abraham, of course,
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.660]   but first on the situation,
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.280]   to step back and some of the history,
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.320]   is there things about the history of Hamas in Gaza
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.040]   that's important to understand what is happening now?
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.120]   Just your comments, your thoughts,
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.840]   your understanding of Hamas.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.720]   - I think you did an excellent job, Lex,
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.200]   of really giving the summary.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.840]   Just a couple of things maybe I'll add to it
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.680]   is that Hamas was originally founded
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.620]   from the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt,
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.000]   which is a group that's caused a lot of issues
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.480]   in the region.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.020]   They've attacked Israel many times in the past.
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.960]   There's a lot of discussion about how Israel
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.200]   is an occupying power.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.720]   Well, in Gaza in 2005, they withdrew from all the land,
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.760]   and then they say Israel's an apartheid state.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.020]   Well, Israel then gave governance of the region
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:22.440]   to the Palestinians.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.140]   And then what's happened is the Palestinian people's lives
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.800]   have now gone down, not up since then.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:32.800]   I will say that under Hamas's leadership in Gaza,
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.940]   the people who have suffered the most
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.320]   are the Palestinian people.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.540]   And I see, I've watched cries throughout my time
[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.780]   in government from people saying,
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.960]   "We wanna see the Palestinian people live a better life."
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.140]   I agree with those people.
[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.760]   I think that the Palestinian people in Gaza
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.200]   are essentially hostages.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:56.200]   In Gaza, you have basically 2.2 million people
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.480]   that are being held hostage by 30,000 Hamas terrorists.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.120]   And that's really the problem.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:07.120]   And I would just encourage people to push their attention
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.840]   and energy in this moment and their anger towards Hamas.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.400]   Those are the people who are killing innocent civilians,
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.380]   who are murdering indiscriminately.
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.760]   And those are the people who have held back the Palestinians
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.160]   from having a better life.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.760]   And just finally, what I would say is,
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.540]   what we saw with Hamas was that if you go back to 2007,
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.640]   they basically had just one plan that they did over and over.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.920]   And we were very careful to try to monitor very closely
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.880]   and stop the Iranian money and the resources from coming in.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.360]   And again, we took a little bit of criticism
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.640]   from the international community
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.520]   from keeping the border tight.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.360]   But unfortunately,
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.700]   every time you'd allow construction materials
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.200]   to go into Gaza, they'd use them to build tunnels, not homes.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.200]   You would have equipment that would come in to build pipes.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.240]   They'd turn it into bombs.
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.960]   So it was very, very hard to figure out
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.120]   how do you get the resources into Gaza
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.000]   to help people have a better life,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   while at the same time, the leadership in Gaza
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.760]   was taking all of those resources
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.480]   and turning it into military equipment to attack Israel.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.960]   - What role does Iran play in this war,
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.960]   in this connection to Hamas?
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.920]   Can you speak to the connection between Hamas and Iran
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.280]   that's important to understand,
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:22.440]   especially as this most recent attack unfolds?
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.040]   - Sure, so the correlation,
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.360]   I mean, there's reports that Iran is behind the attack.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.240]   Hamas has thanked Iran for their support.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.000]   And it's been very well known
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.240]   that Iran supports the destruction of the state of Israel.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.760]   And I won't say Iran as a country.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.440]   I'll talk about Iran in the leadership.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.800]   There's actually a beautiful thing I saw on the internet
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.460]   where at one of the soccer games in Iran,
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.480]   they were trying to rally support
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.760]   for the Hamas terror attacks.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.560]   And a lot of people in the crowds were chanting,
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.360]   F-U to the regime,
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.940]   because I think the Iranian people, the Persian people,
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.960]   generally are peace-loving people
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.580]   who don't wanna see this focus
[00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.300]   on destruction and annihilation.
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.200]   But you saw this in 2015, 2016,
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.360]   when the Iranian government had resources,
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.940]   the region was less safe.
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.880]   And since now there's been more resources allowed
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.760]   to go to the Iranian regime
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.840]   by lack of enforcement of sanctions.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:20.120]   And as a result, Iran is funding Hezbollah, Hamas.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.120]   They were funding the Houthis.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.360]   Now there's a little bit of a detente
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.640]   between Saudi and Iran, which has led to that going down,
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.580]   which only further proves that Iran was behind the Houthis,
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.460]   which is what the Saudis had been saying for years
[00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.000]   and Iran was denying.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.040]   So there's a very strong relationship between the two.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.260]   And we always knew that the way that Iran fights wars
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:39.960]   or fights conflicts is never directly,
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.920]   it's usually through its proxies.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:46.800]   And in this case, Hamas has been a proxy for Iran
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.700]   who wanted to obviously see the destruction of Israel,
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.880]   but also does not wanna see the Israelis and the Saudis
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.880]   come together for a peace agreement.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.840]   - So the name of this operation,
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.160]   of the Hamas operation is Al-Aqsa Flood,
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.200]   referring to the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.800]   How much of this attack is about the Al-Aqsa Mosque?
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.360]   - In actuality, I don't think any of it is,
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.120]   but the Al-Aqsa Mosque is something
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:18.120]   that all of the Shia jihadists have used for years
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.460]   in order to justify their actions
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:22.800]   that are aggressive towards Israel.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.120]   So this is something I'll maybe even take a step back
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:26.960]   and go through.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.800]   When I was working initially in my first year
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.360]   on the peace plan, I was doing a lot of listening.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.920]   And quite frankly, a lot of what people were saying to me
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.920]   didn't make sense.
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.760]   And the reason why I was trying to figure out,
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.520]   they were talking about sovereignty over Al-Aqsa Mosque.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.620]   The Al-Aqsa Mosque is a mosque that's built
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.600]   in the holy of holies, the Haram al-Sharif in Israel,
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.960]   where the Jewish Beit Hamikdash, the holy temple,
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.780]   was built in a very religious place
[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.640]   about after the temple was destroyed.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.720]   Then there was a big mosque built there.
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.840]   And it's one of the more holy places in Islam now.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:06.000]   So the big thing everyone was saying is,
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.540]   what do you do with this land where you have a mosque
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.920]   built over a very big Jewish site?
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.800]   And I was hearing all of the experts,
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.160]   and I always say experts with quotes,
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.840]   because only in Washington can you work on something
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.720]   for a decade and continue to fail,
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.960]   and then you basically leave and are considered an expert.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.400]   But that's one of the problems with Washington,
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.680]   which maybe we could talk about later.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.640]   But the notion here was I went and I said,
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.360]   let me try to understand what the issue is
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.360]   with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with the people.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.620]   I always felt the politicians were a little disconnected.
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.180]   So I commissioned several focus groups,
[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:44.160]   one in Amman, one in Cairo, one in Dubai, and one in Ramallah.
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.600]   And I asked people, Muslims,
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.400]   what is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict about?
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.760]   And time and time again,
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.360]   the most popular thing that they said
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.720]   was that Israel was not allowing access to the mosque
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.680]   for Muslims to pray.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.360]   And what was interesting was is that Israel's policy
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.200]   is to allow anyone who wants to come and pray peacefully
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.400]   at the sites to come and pray.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.920]   Sometimes they have security issues
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.840]   when there's provocations.
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.880]   But by and large, since 1967,
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.280]   when Israel was able to take back Jerusalem
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.080]   in a defensive war, just to be very clear,
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.200]   they were attacked in the south
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.440]   and they were attacked from the east.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.480]   And they basically were able to beat back the Jordanians
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.000]   and the Egyptians and then reconquer
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.640]   the old city of Jerusalem.
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.560]   And during that time,
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.520]   immediately after Israel then passed
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.480]   the Protection of Holy Places law,
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.800]   which was they basically took resources they didn't have
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.560]   and they said, we're gonna restore the Christian sites,
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.040]   the Muslim sites, the Jewish sites,
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.320]   and they've worked to allow everyone access to the mosque.
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:48.440]   So today, any Muslim who wants to come
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.120]   can come and pray at the mosque.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:54.080]   The mosque is, Israel's acknowledged that King Abdullah,
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:58.560]   the King of Jordan, is the custodian of the mosque.
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.840]   And as long as people wanna come to the country
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.040]   and pray peacefully, they're able to do that.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.800]   But if you look at a lot of the propaganda
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.560]   that's been used by ISIS or Iran
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:12.560]   to recruit terrorists or to justify their incursions,
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.880]   they often say they're doing it
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.280]   in the name of liberating the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.320]   But from an operational and pragmatic perspective today,
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.580]   any Muslim who wants to go to the mosque,
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.800]   you can book a flight to Israel now through Dubai
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.200]   because there's flights between Israel and Dubai.
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.800]   And as long as your country has relations with Israel
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.500]   and they'll accept your passport in there,
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.380]   you can come and pray and that's what Israel wants.
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.720]   Israel wants Jerusalem to be a place
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.680]   where all religions can come and celebrate together.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.360]   But you have a lot of actors that look to find ways
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:46.800]   to use these religious tensions in order to sow division
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.260]   and justify violent behavior.
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:53.360]   - I wonder how it's possible to lessen the effectiveness
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:57.480]   of that propaganda message that a lot of the war,
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:01.560]   a lot of the attacks are about access to the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.440]   Is there something you can speak to
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.520]   why that message hasn't disseminated across the Arab world?
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.160]   - So Israel's good at a lot of things.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.800]   They're not very good traditionally with public relations.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.920]   You know, after the Abraham Accords,
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.480]   you know, we made the first Abraham Accords deal
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:21.000]   in August 2020 and then we made five other deals.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.100]   We first did United Arab Emirates,
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.680]   then we did a deal with Bahrain,
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.280]   then we did a deal with Kosovo,
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.540]   then we did a deal with Sudan,
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.360]   then we did a deal with Morocco.
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.880]   And then we got the GCC deal done as well,
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:38.880]   the tension between Qatar, Saudi, UAE, Egypt, and Bahrain.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.760]   And that was allowing us to create a pathway
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.640]   to then pursue the Israeli-Saudi normalization.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.040]   So we had so much momentum then
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.120]   that the goal was just keep getting more countries
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.560]   to normalize relations with Israel.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.420]   Once you create the connection between people
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.360]   and create the ability for people to do business together,
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.760]   the ability for flights to fly between,
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.040]   then you would just start naturally having people coming
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.520]   and everyone has a smartphone today
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:06.160]   so they can then post and combat the misinformation
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.120]   that's been out there.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.280]   But this misinformation is not something that's new.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:13.120]   You know, one of the characters who played a very big role
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:17.080]   in spreading the antisemitism and the violence in Israel
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.560]   in the 1920s was a guy named Haj Amin al-Husseini,
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.960]   who was known as the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.600]   He was very close with Hitler and Mussolini
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.160]   and he was working with them to try to get some claims
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.040]   to the Middle East once the Jewish people were annihilated.
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.200]   And what he did for a very long time
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.360]   was he did the same shtick,
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.560]   only it was before you had smartphones and YouTube,
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.760]   where he would say, "The mosque is under attack.
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.700]   "These imperialist Zionists are coming in
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.320]   "to try to destroy the mosque."
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.480]   And he would use that to raise money from Indonesia,
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.840]   from Pakistan, from all over the world,
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.480]   and then use that threat to justify recruiting
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.520]   groups of young, vulnerable Muslim men
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.720]   and then getting them in the name of religious rights
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.640]   to go and kill people,
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.040]   which really is more of a perversion of the religion
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.980]   than I think the true essence of what Islam is.
[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.760]   I think Islam at its core is a peaceful religion
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.840]   and I think that's where a lot of the great leaders
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.240]   in Islam wanna take it.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.640]   But the people who use Islam or the mosque
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.880]   or as a justification for violence,
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.440]   those are people who I think are really,
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.860]   they are disrespecting the Islam religion.
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.520]   - As you said, you helped make major strides
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.520]   towards peace in the Middle East with the Abraham Accords.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:30.120]   Can you describe what it took to accomplish this?
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:33.240]   And maybe this will help us understand
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.480]   what broke down and led to the tragedy this week.
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.640]   - Yeah, so I always believed in foreign policy.
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.680]   I learned very quickly that the difference
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.240]   between a political deal and a business deal
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.940]   is that in a business deal, you have a problem set,
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.480]   you come to a conclusion,
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.120]   and then if you buy or sell something,
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.760]   you either have more cash or you have a company.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.960]   So you have more to do, less to do.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.840]   Political problem set is very different
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.640]   where the conclusion of a problem set
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.760]   is essentially the beginning of a new paradigm.
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.480]   So when I would think about
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.820]   how do you move pieces around the board,
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.680]   you couldn't say, let me just solve the problem.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.200]   You have to think about what happens
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.960]   the day after the signing
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.600]   and how do you create a paradigm that has positivity to it.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.840]   So the biggest piece of what President Trump did
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.440]   during his four years in office
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.920]   was he really strengthened the relationship with Israel.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.320]   Number one.
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:30.040]   And he did things like recognizing Jerusalem
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.560]   as the capital of Israel.
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.400]   He moved the embassy to Jerusalem.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.000]   He recognized the Golan Heights.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.340]   He got out of the Iran deal.
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:39.180]   We did an economic conference in Bahrain
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.880]   where we brought Israelis to meet with Saudi and Emirati
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.520]   and Qatari businessmen, and everyone came together.
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.600]   And each one of these instances were unthinkable previously.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.120]   And everyone said that if you did it,
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.120]   the world was gonna end.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.120]   And every time President Trump did one,
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.120]   the next morning the sun rose, the next evening the sun set,
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.280]   and things moved on.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.000]   And so by doing that, what President Trump did
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.680]   was he slaughtered a lot of the sacred cows
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.480]   of these false barriers that people had erected
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.280]   and showed people that the vast majority
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.420]   of the people in the Middle East,
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:13.320]   whether they're Jewish, Muslim, Christian,
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.280]   whatever religion they are,
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.840]   they just wanna live better lives.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.960]   And so what we basically did was create a paradigm
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:24.480]   where the voices for peace, the voices for together
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:28.240]   now finally had a forum where they were able to do it.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.680]   And we did that in the backdrop.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.080]   The way we were able to be successful
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.200]   was we severely limited the resources of Iran,
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.120]   and they were focused more internally,
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.960]   and they couldn't cause the trouble
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.840]   that they were causing everywhere else.
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.240]   Since we've left, obviously the dynamics have changed,
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.200]   but the way you get to peace is obviously,
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.760]   number one, through strength,
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.800]   and number two, by finding a way for people
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.760]   to be better off tomorrow than they are today.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.920]   And what I found was that most of the voices
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.440]   looking for violence or trouble
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.400]   were people who were just focused on
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.840]   what happened two years ago, 20 years ago,
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.320]   70 years ago, 1,000 years ago.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.440]   People who were trying to solve those problems
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.560]   in that context often were looking more
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:14.560]   to use those past grievances as a justification
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.200]   for their power and for the bad behavior
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.120]   that they were looking to perpetuate.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.400]   - So managing, as we have talked about extensively,
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.600]   managing the power dynamics of the region
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.320]   and providing a plan.
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.680]   This is something you did with the economic plan
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.360]   titled "Peace to Prosperity,
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.840]   a Vision to Improve the Lives
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.180]   of the Palestinian and Israeli People."
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.420]   Can you first of all describe what's in the plan?
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:41.800]   - Sure, so this was something I took on.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.680]   I was working on the political framework
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.520]   between the Israelis and the Palestinians
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.760]   and trying to understand what were the issues.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.320]   And the issues were not very many.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.280]   It basically was you had a land dispute,
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.120]   so you had to figure out
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.880]   where do you put borders ultimately.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.040]   You had a security paradigm,
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.280]   which I was much more favorable to Israel's perspective on.
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.880]   And obviously the events of the past 48 hours
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.980]   have fully justified that bias.
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.200]   And then in addition to that,
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.480]   you had to deal with the religious sites.
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.440]   But I felt operationally that wasn't actually
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.200]   as complicated as people made it
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.160]   because you wanted to just leave it open for everybody.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.520]   Then I went through and I felt that
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.400]   the Palestinian leadership was fairly disincentivized
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:26.040]   to make a deal because there was just this paradigm
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.720]   where they had billions of dollars coming in
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.160]   from the international community.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.200]   And I think that they feared that if they made a deal,
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.500]   they would lose their relevancy internationally
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.920]   and the money would stop flowing into the country.
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.680]   So what I tried to do is to say,
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.680]   my approach when I would get into a hard problem,
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:46.020]   say, how do I understand all the different escape hatches?
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.420]   How do I try to eliminate them?
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:51.160]   And then build a golden bridge that becomes really the only,
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.600]   but also the most desirable pathway
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.420]   for the decision makers to walk through.
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:57.360]   And it wasn't always hard.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.160]   And sometimes you have to go and hold their hand
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.840]   or you try to pick them up and walk them across.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.960]   But a lot of these leaders are very reluctant to change.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.240]   And the dynamics of the Palestinians also were such that
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.320]   I think they were fairly stuck where they were.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:15.760]   So we developed a business plan for Gaza, the West Bank.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:19.720]   We threw in some improvements for Jordan and Egypt as well.
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.680]   I based it off of the vision 2030
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.840]   that they did in Saudi Arabia,
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.120]   which I thought was a visionary document.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.700]   I went back through this process
[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:31.480]   and I studied basically every economic project
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.920]   in the post-World War II period.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.120]   So we looked at what they did in South Korea,
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.520]   why it was successful with some strong industrial planning.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.920]   We looked at Japan, we looked at Singapore,
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.700]   we looked at Poland, why it was successful.
[00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.820]   We spent a lot of time on the Ukraine plan for the country
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:46.120]   and why it wasn't successful.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.520]   And that was mostly because of governance and corruption,
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.120]   which actually resembles a lot of what's gone wrong
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.680]   with the Palestinians where there's no property rights,
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.340]   there's no rule of law.
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.560]   And what we did is we built a plan to show,
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.680]   it's not that hard, right?
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.080]   In the sense that between the West Bank and Gaza,
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.760]   you had 5 million people.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.200]   And we put together a plan,
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.840]   I think it was about $27 billion.
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:11.160]   We got together a conference, I had the head of AT&T,
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.280]   we had Steve Schwarzman from Blackstone came,
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.820]   which was very gracious of them.
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.420]   We had all the leading Arabic businessmen,
[00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:18.500]   the leading builders, leading developers.
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:23.500]   And the general consensus of that conference
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.860]   was that this is very doable.
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.540]   We think that for Gaza in particular,
[00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:30.700]   it would cost maybe seven to $8 billion
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:32.660]   to rebuild the entire place.
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.680]   We felt we could reduce the poverty rate in half,
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.420]   we can create over a million jobs there.
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:39.380]   The only thing that people said was holding it back
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.500]   wasn't Israel, what was holding it back was governance.
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.340]   And people wouldn't have confidence investing there
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:49.100]   with the rule that Hamas was perpetuating.
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.660]   So I encourage people actually to look at the plan,
[00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:53.860]   it was very thoughtful, it was 181 pages.
[00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:58.360]   We went project by project, each project is costed out.
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.240]   It's a real plan that could be implemented,
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.900]   but you need the right governance.
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:03.600]   And all of the different Arabic countries
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.440]   are willing to fund it,
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.180]   the international community is willing to fund it
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:07.980]   because they've just been throwing so much money
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.020]   at the Palestinians for years
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.500]   that's never been outcomes-based
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.740]   or conditions-based, it's just been entitlement money.
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:18.300]   And unfortunately, it hasn't really achieved any outcomes
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:19.220]   that have been successful.
[00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.500]   So it's a great business plan,
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:25.260]   it just shows too, rebuilding Gaza could be easy.
[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.460]   But like I said, the problem that's held
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:28.940]   the Palestinian people back
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.460]   and that's made their lives terrible in Gaza
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:34.760]   has not been Israel, it's really been Hamas' leadership
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.860]   or lack of leadership and their desire to focus on
[00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:41.500]   trying to kill Israelis and start war with Israel
[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.740]   over improving the lives of the Palestinian people.
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:46.780]   - And the current approach of Hamas,
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:49.300]   the more violence they perpetrate,
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.220]   the more they can hold onto power
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:56.020]   versus improving the lives of people.
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.740]   So as you said, maybe you can comment on,
[00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.740]   they do not propose an economics plan.
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:05.540]   - I mean, Hamas has been running it now for 16 years
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:07.140]   and they don't have a lot to show for it.
[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:10.180]   And our posture with them was basically a very simple deal.
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:13.020]   And if you think about what's the end state in Gaza,
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.340]   it's actually not that complicated.
[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:16.940]   There's no territorial disputes, right?
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.380]   The border is the border,
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.700]   there's no religious issues there as well,
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.540]   you're not dealing with Jerusalem.
[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:25.500]   You're basically just dealing with the fact that,
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:28.460]   Israel wants to make sure that there's no threat from Gaza.
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.780]   So it's a demilitarization or some kind of security guarantee
[00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:35.800]   from a credible source where Israel doesn't feel
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:39.060]   like Gaza can be used to stage attacks into Israel
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:41.420]   or to fire rockets into Israel.
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.260]   And by the way, these are things I was saying,
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:46.100]   three, four years ago, that that was the objective
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.620]   and that was really the fear.
[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.460]   Now that's been proven,
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:52.500]   unfortunately the fear has manifested.
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.300]   And in exchange, you can rebuild the place
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.800]   and you can give the people a much better life.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.980]   But Hamas has not shown a desire for that
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:01.340]   or a capability for that.
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:03.060]   And I don't think there's enough trust
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.100]   to allow them to do that,
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:06.760]   which is why, under the current circumstances,
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.440]   if you do wanna have peace there,
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:12.160]   Hamas has to be either eliminated or severely degraded
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.000]   in terms of their military capabilities.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.280]   - I would love to ask you about leadership,
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.780]   especially on the side of the United States.
[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.920]   What has the current administration,
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.240]   the Biden administration done different
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:28.580]   than the Trump administration, as you understand,
[00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:33.360]   that may have contributed to the events we saw this week?
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.320]   - So all I can talk about are where we left them, right?
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:39.520]   We left them a place where they had tremendous momentum
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.440]   in the Middle East.
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.840]   I met with them during the transition and said,
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:47.840]   "Look, we even got the Qatar-Saudi conflict done,"
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:51.000]   which was a big, no peace between Israel and Saudi
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.320]   would have been possible without that.
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:56.120]   So we even got that done in our lame duck period.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.800]   And they came in and they said,
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.400]   "Look, we wanna focus on the three Cs,
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.600]   which is COVID, climate change, and China."
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:03.640]   I said, "That's great."
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.720]   But the Middle East, we have an amazing place right now.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.500]   It's stable, there's momentum.
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.360]   Iran is basically broke.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.720]   We put such crippling sanctions on Iran
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.160]   that they went from about,
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.520]   I think it was 2.6 million barrels a day of oil
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:20.620]   they were selling to about 100,000 under Trump.
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:24.480]   So their foreign currency reserves were basically depleted
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.920]   and they were broke.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:26.860]   Same with the Palestinians.
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:31.860]   We stopped the funding to UNRWA, the UN agency,
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.160]   which is totally corrupt.
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.640]   We've put $10 billion in there over time.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:40.120]   I did a poll in the Middle East, in Gaza to say,
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:43.240]   "Okay, we've invested $10 billion here as a country.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.480]   Are we popular?"
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:45.320]   Right?
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.000]   The US had a 7% approval rating.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.520]   USAID had a 70% approval rating,
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.400]   but it just felt like a waste of our taxpayer dollars.
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.840]   And again, we wanted to make it conditions-based.
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.200]   The Biden administration came in,
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:01.840]   number one, they started insulting Saudi and Russia,
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:02.920]   oil prices went up.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.960]   At the same time, what they did was
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.800]   they stopped domestic production of oil.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.700]   They made it, they disincentivized
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:14.040]   a lot of oil and shale production with regulations.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:17.600]   They stopped pipelines, oil prices went up.
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.600]   They stopped enforcing the sanctions against Iran,
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.280]   probably to get the oil prices lower,
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.120]   to make up for what they were doing.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.500]   They ran to Iran to try to make a deal.
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.500]   They started funding the Palestinians again right away.
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.520]   And I even said, "If you're gonna fund them,
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.280]   if that's your policy, I respect that."
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.040]   Again, elections have consequences
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.920]   and you can take a different policy.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.020]   But what I would recommend is get some conditions,
[00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:38.260]   make them do some reforms,
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.440]   make them give property rights to people,
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:44.280]   make them do real economic investments for people.
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.240]   But they just went right away.
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.080]   So they were funding the Palestinians,
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.920]   not enforcing the sanctions,
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:52.000]   and then overall just projecting a lot of weakness
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:52.840]   in the region.
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:56.360]   So one of the most embarrassing examples
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.640]   is what happened in the United Arab Emirates.
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.600]   Again, an amazing,
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.760]   probably one of America's best allies
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.680]   over the last 20, 30 years.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.380]   They fought with us in Afghanistan.
[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.200]   They were the first Muslim country to stand up and do that
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.680]   after 9/11 because they didn't want it to be a war
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:16.280]   of the West against the Muslim religion.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.380]   So they joined the fight
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:20.400]   because they saw it as a fight between right and wrong.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.480]   They have rockets shot into their country
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:28.240]   from the Houthis.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:33.240]   And they basically don't get a call from the US for 17 days.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.500]   They need their equipment that they buy from the US,
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:36.600]   which creates jobs in the US.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.520]   They need it restocked, we don't call.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:40.680]   So they've severely degraded the trust
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.520]   that we had to rebuild with our allies.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.140]   I think they've been working now to get it back.
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:47.560]   They, after two years, started working with Saudi and Israel,
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.520]   which I think was good.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.280]   I think that they realized after a stint
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.680]   that maybe the process that President Trump
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.600]   had created in the region was the right policy.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.680]   And keep in mind,
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:00.040]   President Trump's policy that I was working on
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:04.120]   was very strongly criticized during the first three years
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.800]   before we were able to achieve the results
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.300]   because it was departure
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.960]   from the failed policies of the past.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.040]   And so first there was return to those policies,
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.760]   appease Iran, let's criticize Saudi Arabia.
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.020]   Then they started embracing
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.580]   and working on the Israel-Saudi deal,
[00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:19.520]   which was really exciting.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.520]   I think we're all very excited about it.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.400]   But they did it in public.
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.200]   And I think that that also was something,
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.880]   and I didn't have access to their intelligence.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:29.280]   So I assumed that by doing it so publicly,
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:31.760]   they thought that they'd either had a deal with Iran
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.240]   'cause they were letting them get all this revenue
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:35.040]   or Iran wouldn't be a problem.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.740]   But one of the reasons with the Abraham Accords,
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:38.840]   we kept it so quiet during the whole time
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.480]   was 'cause we always felt like the troublemakers
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.160]   in the region, particularly Iran,
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:45.720]   who we thought would be disadvantaged
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:48.820]   by having a UAE, Saudi, Israel all together.
[00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:53.600]   Israel's a nuclear power, you have other strong economies.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.500]   Iran seeks instability.
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:59.620]   They seek looking to create a division in the region.
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:01.840]   And if you can create that economic sphere
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.320]   where you have security from Haifa to Muscat,
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.900]   from Israel to Oman, all the way through with Saudi,
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:10.900]   Jordan, UAE, Qatar, Egypt,
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:12.680]   that's an incredibly powerful block.
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.720]   If you can make it secure and then get economic integration,
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.400]   that really could be a Middle East that thrives.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.760]   So Iran obviously wanted nothing to do with that.
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.480]   And that's why they've been working to disrupt.
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.480]   So I think the administration has,
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.560]   they took an incredibly stable situation with momentum.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.480]   I think they underestimated
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:37.360]   the way that Iran would approach the region to undermine.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.040]   I think they gave way too much rope to Iran.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.840]   And I think that they didn't seize
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.440]   when they had an opportunity of strength
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.520]   with the Palestinians to try to drive to a conclusion
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.080]   that I believe could have prevented
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.360]   us being where we are today.
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.000]   Not to mention that, even just three weeks ago,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.160]   I mean, it's a bad look that they just basically
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:58.880]   gave $6 billion to Iran in exchange for hostages.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.360]   And then Iran's basically funding these terror attacks
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:04.880]   or killing American citizens in Israel.
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.840]   And it's just, it's a heartbreaking situation.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.280]   Again, totally avoidable.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.000]   And one that I think has been
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.600]   very badly mismanaged to date.
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.040]   - If Trump was currently president,
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:18.040]   you were still working with him on this part of the world,
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:21.800]   what actions would you take?
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:25.160]   What conversations would you have?
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:27.680]   What ideas would you be working with
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:31.480]   in order to unite the various allies
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:35.000]   that you mentioned in the Middle East over this tragedy?
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.280]   And not let it be a thing that divides the Middle East,
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:44.280]   but make it a thing that catalyzes progress towards peace,
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.400]   further progress towards peace?
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.720]   - So I wanna say one thing, Lex.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:52.080]   I have a lot of friends who are fans of Trump,
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:53.040]   who are not fans of Trump.
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.320]   But one thing I wanna say with absolute certainty
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.800]   is that if President Trump was in office,
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.200]   this never would have happened.
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.920]   And when President Trump was in office,
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:05.720]   anyone who supports Israel or who wants to see
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:08.680]   Jewish people not be innocently slaughtered,
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:10.200]   he would never have allowed that to happen.
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.000]   It did not happen when he was in power.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.400]   And I hope people recognize that
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.480]   as something that's very, very true.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:21.680]   How I would play the ball where it lies right now,
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:24.520]   keep in mind, we transferred the ball, it was on the green.
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:27.240]   Now it's almost like it's gone back 150 yards
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.000]   and it's in a sand trap.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   I think the way that I would play the ball right now
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.520]   is number one is you have to show strength.
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.200]   I actually think President Biden's words
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.040]   were the right words.
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:39.240]   I see that they're moving aircraft carriers to the region.
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.200]   Again, the purpose of having a strong military,
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:45.360]   I believe obviously, if you get into a war,
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.300]   you wanna win the war,
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.200]   but the purpose of a very strong military
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.640]   primarily is to avoid a war.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.160]   I don't know what kind of credibility
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:55.080]   the Biden administration has to show the strength,
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:59.200]   but right now you have to support Israel completely.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.840]   You have to really let people in the region know
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:07.840]   that there'll be consequences if they try to escalate.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.880]   Again, we saw a little bit of rocket skirmish
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:12.120]   from Lebanon, from Hezbollah,
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:13.320]   but again, this is the type of thing
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.840]   that they have to know there'll be severe consequences
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.560]   if they make this a multi-party fight.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.600]   And I think sending a strong message to Iran,
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.920]   I think that they have to see some consequences from this
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.040]   and know that they're not gonna be allowed
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:27.560]   to have a free reign to cause instability
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:30.520]   and that Iran doesn't usually fight face-to-face,
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.880]   they usually do it through proxies,
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.560]   but let's just all be honest about where this is coming from
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.200]   and let them know that there will be a consequence
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:41.840]   if they instigate these actions.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.360]   And again, at least with the Biden administration,
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.720]   they've had contact with Iran,
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.600]   they've been talking with Iran, but they've allowed Iran,
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.680]   I mean, again, the number I saw last year,
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.520]   I think under Trump,
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.880]   the number was maybe like four or $5 billion of oil revenue
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.240]   and in total, I think last year
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.840]   it was something like $45 billion in revenue.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.240]   This year, I think there'll be even more,
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.440]   that's a combination of them driving up oil prices,
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:05.280]   but also allowing much more sales.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.920]   You would think that they would find a way
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:10.120]   to get them to behave and allow them to have this happen,
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.880]   or if that's not the case, then be tough,
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.520]   go back to being tough, that's what you have to do.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.600]   - Building off of Abraham Accords, as you mentioned,
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.840]   Israel-Saudi normalization,
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:25.420]   there's been a lot of promising progress towards this.
[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:29.840]   What does it take to not allow this tragedy
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:33.960]   damage the progress towards Israel-Saudi normalization?
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.600]   - I think right now
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.360]   it's probably not the best to think about that.
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.720]   I think that we wanna think about that
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.960]   after whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen now.
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.440]   I think right now the number one priority for Israel
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:48.720]   has to be to fully regain security in the country,
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.920]   and then number two is to figure out
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:54.440]   how you can, like I said, eliminate or degrade
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:57.280]   the Hamas capability or other Iranian threats
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.960]   to make sure that you have your security apparatus.
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.360]   I think that the Israeli leadership right now
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.200]   should proceed with that,
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:06.360]   and I don't think that they should be thinking about
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.560]   a normalization with Saudi at this moment.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.080]   My instinct, and I've been watching
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:13.840]   this Israeli-Saudi normalization play out,
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.760]   obviously just speaking with people
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.860]   and seeing what I've been reading,
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:19.640]   and watching with great excitement.
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.880]   I think it would be a game changer for the region.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.360]   I think it's one of Iran's worst nightmares
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:27.960]   to have Israel and Saudi interlinked together.
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.600]   I think it'd be great for the Saudi people
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.880]   from a security perspective.
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:33.960]   What they're discussing with America would be very strong.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:37.340]   The ability to get different elements across
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:38.180]   would be incredible.
[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:40.040]   So what I would say with it is that
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:43.120]   the industrial logic held yesterday,
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.180]   and I think it will hold again tomorrow.
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:49.320]   So I always expect countries to act in their interests.
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:53.040]   I think that the deal that's on the table right now
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:57.420]   between Saudi, Israel, and America is in Saudi's interests,
[00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:58.880]   it's in America's interests,
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.540]   and it's in Israel's interests.
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:01.980]   What's gonna happen now, though,
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:04.940]   is the political dynamics are gonna shift,
[00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:07.800]   and I think that, as we've seen with political dynamics,
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:08.640]   they come and go.
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.480]   I think let's get through this moment,
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.960]   and then I hope at the right time
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:15.620]   that those talks will be able to resume
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:17.860]   and conclude in an appropriate way.
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:19.900]   And it's funny, Lex, when I was working
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:23.960]   on the US-Mexico agreement for the trade,
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.520]   we would have, every day there'd be a tweet
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:28.180]   that would go out, or there would be an issue.
[00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:30.520]   I mean, people forget how intense it was
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:32.940]   between America and Mexico,
[00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:34.680]   and I would speak to my counterpart in Mexico
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.780]   after a rough day, and we were working on something,
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:38.900]   we were making progress, it'd get blown up,
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:40.020]   and I'd speak to him and say, "You know what?
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.040]   "Look, they're not moving to America,
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:43.120]   "they're not moving to Mexico.
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.940]   "Let's just stop for today, let's pick up tomorrow,
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:47.500]   "and let's find a new way to bring this forward."
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:50.000]   So I would just encourage everyone working on that
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.820]   not to give up, to keep working hard at it,
[00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:54.540]   and to find a way, but like I said,
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:57.020]   I would take a little bit of a pause for the time being.
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:59.500]   Let's let the current situation play out,
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:02.560]   and then hopefully there'll be a way for it to move forward.
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.620]   - I just hope there's still people on the US side
[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:09.620]   picking up the phone and calling UAE, Saudi Arabia,
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:13.100]   just as human beings, as friends, as allies,
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:15.820]   and just keeping that channel of communication going.
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:17.900]   'Cause maybe you can correct me,
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:22.540]   but I just feel like there's just simple human dynamics
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:25.700]   that play out here, that divisions can form
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:29.780]   and just run away from you over simple misunderstandings,
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:34.780]   over just inability to see a tragedy
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:39.700]   from the same perspective,
[00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:42.940]   because of conversations that could've happened
[00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:44.100]   but didn't happen.
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:46.020]   - I think there'll definitely be communication,
[00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:49.540]   but words on phone calls is only worth so much.
[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:52.620]   It's really trust between people and power.
[00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:55.260]   And obviously when you're in a position of power,
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:58.220]   you represent your country and your country's interests,
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:01.380]   but the ability to have trusting relationships
[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:03.100]   where people feel like they're okay
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:06.220]   taking more risks to help each other,
[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:08.020]   that's actually what's most important.
[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:09.500]   So communication I hope for,
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:13.020]   but deepening and trusting relationships,
[00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:16.400]   that's what I believe makes progress and keeps people safe.
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.100]   - And we talk quite extensively
[00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:21.220]   about the value of trust and negotiation
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:22.900]   and just working with leaders,
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:24.940]   which I think is a fascinating conversation,
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:27.180]   and you've taught me a lot about that.
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:31.020]   Let me ask you about the end here.
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:32.300]   What are the various trajectories
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.560]   this war can take in your view?
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:38.740]   What are some of the end states, as you've said,
[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:43.100]   which are desirable and are achievable?
[00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:45.260]   - I mentioned this earlier,
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:47.380]   but whenever I would get a problem set in government,
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:48.500]   I'd always think through,
[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:50.660]   from a first principles perspective,
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:52.740]   what's the logical outcome, right?
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:54.740]   And forget about all the reasons why it can't happen.
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.020]   That's what everyone in government's
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:57.700]   always rushed to talk about.
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:59.380]   But I do think here, number one,
[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:01.500]   Israel has to have a secure environment
[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:06.260]   where they don't feel threatened from Gaza.
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.140]   And number two is the people in Gaza
[00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:11.100]   need to have an environment where they feel
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:13.620]   like they can live a better life and have opportunities.
[00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:15.220]   So that's the end state.
[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:18.100]   And so I think that the international community
[00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:19.060]   should come together.
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:21.660]   I do think that the people who are usually
[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:24.820]   putting blame on Israel should now realize
[00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:26.740]   that maybe they've been a little bit harsher
[00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:29.300]   and that Hamas has been as big a threat,
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:32.580]   if not an even bigger threat than Israel has been saying.
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:35.500]   And I do think that if the international community
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:38.080]   comes together and unites behind Israel
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:41.380]   and really forces Hamas and their Iranian backers
[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:44.740]   to stop hostilities, to stop saber rattling,
[00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:49.020]   to stop misrepresenting the history
[00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:52.420]   in order to justify their violent behavior.
[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:53.820]   And if they say instead,
[00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:56.740]   we wanna hold you accountable, no more money.
[00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:58.620]   And they all say that they're gonna stand behind
[00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:01.580]   Israel's efforts to eliminate
[00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:03.980]   their national security threats.
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:05.420]   And then we will all come together
[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:08.100]   and only fund again into a framework
[00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:10.460]   that we believe can be a long-term solution
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:12.780]   where the Palestinian people really have a chance
[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:14.060]   to live a better life.
[00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:15.660]   That's really the best way to get there.
[00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:18.260]   There's tons of complicated factors,
[00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:20.260]   but that's the end state that the global community
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:22.460]   should be looking to come together.
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:23.680]   And it's very achievable.
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.540]   It's very, very achievable.
[00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:27.900]   - So there's a, as we stand here today,
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:31.500]   there's a lot of different ways that this war can evolve.
[00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:36.500]   If a ground invasion happens by Israeli forces of Gaza,
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:41.700]   and if the number is correct of 100,000 Israeli soldiers,
[00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.980]   do you worry about various trajectories that can take
[00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:47.140]   of the consequences that might have
[00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:51.180]   of an unprecedented ground troop attack?
[00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:53.340]   - Yeah, so I think as a leader,
[00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:54.660]   you can't change yesterday,
[00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:57.540]   but you have the ability to change tomorrow.
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:00.660]   And that's a very important fundamental.
[00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:02.960]   I mean, that's true for all of us, not just leaders.
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:07.960]   But we saw with 9/11 how America was caught off guard
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:09.480]   by a terrorist attack.
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:13.840]   We acted somewhat rationally, somewhat emotionally,
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:18.460]   which led to a 20-year war with trillions of dollars lost.
[00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:20.560]   I think almost a million lives lost,
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.820]   not just American, but all lives.
[00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:25.140]   And it was a total tragedy what occurred.
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:28.260]   I think right now the temptation is to be strong.
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:30.180]   I think that that's a necessity.
[00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:33.240]   I do think eliminating risk is the right objective.
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:35.020]   I think the goal should be to stay very clear
[00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:36.700]   about what the objective is.
[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:39.940]   But also this attack was very well planned,
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:41.400]   not to walk into another trap.
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:43.380]   I think you have to be very smart, very cautious.
[00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:46.300]   I've been happy to see that what they've been doing
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:49.560]   in retaliation so far has been somewhat measured,
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:51.860]   and they've taken their time to try to assess
[00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:52.860]   what's achievable.
[00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:54.740]   Again, I don't have access to the intelligence,
[00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:58.180]   and we're talking at a very early stage in this conflict.
[00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:02.020]   So a lot could happen even by the time this is published.
[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:07.380]   But my hope is that they'll just stay very focused
[00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:09.560]   on what the objective is and try to make sure
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:12.380]   that they're acting appropriately in order to do that.
[00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:14.340]   And I will say this too, that this has been different
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:15.500]   than what I've seen in the past,
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:20.500]   in that the attacks were so heinous and so violent
[00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:24.220]   and so heinous and so disgusting
[00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:26.020]   that I've seen the international community
[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.800]   rally around Israel more so than I ever have.
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.900]   And I hope that Israel continues
[00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:33.100]   to keep the moral high ground
[00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:36.460]   and continue to communicate what they're fighting for,
[00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:37.580]   why they're fighting.
[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:40.620]   And I do hope that the international community
[00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:41.740]   supports the objective
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:43.780]   and they can work together to achieve it.
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:46.540]   - Benjamin and Yahoo, Bibi,
[00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:49.540]   somebody you've gotten to know well in negotiation,
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:51.420]   in conversation.
[00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:55.740]   He has made statements, he has declared war,
[00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:59.780]   he has spoken about this potentially being a long
[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:00.960]   and difficult war.
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:05.100]   What have you learned about the mind of Benjamin and Yahoo
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:06.980]   that might be important to understand here
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:08.740]   in this current war?
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:10.740]   - Bibi is definitely a historic figure.
[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:12.580]   You know, I meet with a lot of different world leaders
[00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:15.780]   and some of them I would say they're very, very special,
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:18.300]   transformational figures, and some I would say,
[00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.600]   how the hell is this person running a country?
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:24.220]   And Bibi is somebody who has done a lot
[00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:25.140]   for the state of Israel.
[00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:28.780]   He has a tremendous understanding of the security apparatus,
[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:31.300]   he has tremendous global relations.
[00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:32.980]   So for a crisis like this,
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:36.260]   I think Bibi's the leader you want if you're Israel
[00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:39.540]   to be in that seat.
[00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:44.540]   I think he's ambitious in what he's gonna look to achieve.
[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:48.620]   He understands his role in history as somebody
[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:52.580]   who's helped strengthen Israel economically, militarily.
[00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:55.600]   And I don't think he wants to see his legacy
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:49:01.180]   be somebody who left Israel more vulnerable
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:02.580]   than it had to be.
[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:05.620]   So I think in that regard, he'll be incredibly strong,
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:08.620]   but I also think that he'll hopefully be calculating
[00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:10.140]   in the risks that he takes
[00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:13.480]   and not create more risk than's needed.
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:16.020]   And that's easy to say, the two of us sitting here
[00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:18.060]   having a conversation when you're sitting in that chair
[00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:20.620]   as a leader in the fog of war,
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:25.180]   it's a very hard decision to make.
[00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:30.180]   He's been here before, he knows the weight of the situation,
[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:31.820]   I'm sure he knows the moment,
[00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:36.160]   and I pray that he'll do what's right here
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.580]   to bring the best outcome possible.
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:42.300]   - I wonder if you can comment on the internal
[00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:45.780]   political turmoil that BBOE has been operating in
[00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:50.580]   and how that relates to the tragedy that we saw.
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:54.600]   - On the one hand, the political turmoil is,
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:58.460]   it's a sign of a vibrant democracy.
[00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:01.580]   I think it's been actually nice to see
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:03.260]   how people have fought for their country
[00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:04.860]   and their beliefs in a democratic way.
[00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:07.060]   You compare that to the Palestinians
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:09.420]   where there's no democracy, there's no free speech,
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:10.720]   there's no free press.
[00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:16.740]   You can't disagree with the leadership in Israel.
[00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:20.020]   If you wanna be homosexual,
[00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:24.380]   you can go to a parade and live your life.
[00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:27.600]   In Gaza, they'll throw you off a building and kill you.
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:29.260]   So in Israel, you have the freedoms
[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:31.140]   which I think make it a special place
[00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:33.540]   and you have a very vibrant democracy.
[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:36.720]   With that being said, the times in Jewish history
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:39.660]   where the Jewish people have been most vulnerable
[00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:41.160]   have been when there's been division,
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:44.380]   and that's when the temple was destroyed.
[00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:46.420]   But that's not just with the Jewish people and with Israel,
[00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:47.700]   that's in all societies.
[00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:50.420]   So I definitely believe that this division
[00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:55.140]   has left them less prepared for the situation than it would.
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:57.360]   I do think there's real lessons we should be taking
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:58.860]   from this here in America,
[00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:01.320]   where we're in a time where we're very divided,
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:04.740]   but I do think that it'd be very wise for our leaders
[00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:07.660]   to find the areas where we do agree
[00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:10.580]   and find ways to secure our southern border,
[00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:12.780]   to make sure that we know who's in our country,
[00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:15.180]   what risks we all face.
[00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:18.640]   And I do think that division
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.940]   definitely creates risk for countries.
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:24.180]   - Let me switch gears here and just zoom out
[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:28.020]   and look at our society and our public discourse
[00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:28.860]   at the moment.
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:30.500]   What do you make of the scale and nature
[00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:33.100]   of the Palestinian support online
[00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:34.700]   in response to this situation?
[00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:39.900]   - This is something I've observed over the years
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:43.380]   since I got involved with the Israeli-Palestinian issue
[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:46.300]   with a lot of interest.
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:48.460]   I think a lot of the people who are
[00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:52.660]   pledging support for the Palestinian people,
[00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:55.580]   I think that they wanna see the Palestinian people
[00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:57.020]   live a better life.
[00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:59.420]   And I actually agree with them in that regard.
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:01.580]   Unfortunately, I think many of them
[00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:05.820]   are incredibly ill-informed as to the facts on the ground.
[00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:08.900]   I think all of the people who are advocating online
[00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:10.660]   for the Palestinian people,
[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:14.440]   who are going to these marches in support of them,
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:16.020]   I think they'd be best served
[00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:18.560]   if they really care about effectuating the outcome
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:22.300]   of joining with Israel right now
[00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:27.300]   and directing their anger towards the Hamas leadership.
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:29.020]   I think that it's very clear
[00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:31.380]   that the group that's responsible
[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:34.340]   for the Palestinian people living the lives
[00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:37.540]   that all of these people are angry about is Hamas.
[00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:40.940]   And if they direct their anger towards Hamas
[00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:43.620]   and put the attention on the failings of Hamas
[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:44.740]   and put forth a vision
[00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:48.100]   for what they'd like to see leadership in Gaza do,
[00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:51.540]   and they respect that there's a real fear that Israel has
[00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:53.060]   and any country would have
[00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:55.900]   of having a group of terrorists next to them
[00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:58.140]   that's calling for their destruction,
[00:52:58.140 --> 00:52:59.820]   I think that that recognition
[00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:03.500]   of finding a way for Israel to be secure
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:06.700]   and then having an opportunity for the Palestinian people
[00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:09.100]   to live a better life is the right pathway
[00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:10.540]   to try and pursue.
[00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:12.380]   - So to you, there's a clear distinction
[00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:15.140]   between Hamas and the Palestinian people
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:18.000]   in that Hamas is the enemy of progress
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.460]   and the flourishing of the Palestinian people.
[00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:23.040]   - 100%, it's very, very clear.
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:26.220]   And I think that if people were honest about the situation,
[00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:28.100]   if they spent the time to really understand it,
[00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:31.560]   again, if you follow the conference I did in Bahrain,
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:33.000]   we had all the leading businessmen there
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.700]   and they said, "We can rebuild Gaza very easily.
[00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:36.820]   "We all want to."
[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:37.940]   The leading Arab businessmen,
[00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:40.240]   the leading American businessmen, everyone wants to.
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:41.740]   They're just held back by Hamas.
[00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:44.900]   And so I do think having an honest conversation about this
[00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:49.140]   at this point in time has really only one logical conclusion
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:52.100]   and my hope is that maybe this conflict leads
[00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:54.180]   to that conversation being had.
[00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:56.480]   And if it is, then maybe that brings more unity
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:59.660]   and understanding and we kind of get to a conclusion better
[00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:02.220]   that could improve the lives of the Palestinian people.
[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:05.340]   - Pragmatic question about the future.
[00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:08.380]   Do you hope Donald Trump wins in 2024
[00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:12.060]   and how can his administration help bring peace
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:13.220]   to the Middle East?
[00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:15.780]   - I think when Donald Trump was president,
[00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:17.540]   we had a peaceful world.
[00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:19.120]   Everyone said if he was elected,
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:20.980]   we would have World War III.
[00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:24.240]   Meanwhile, he gets elected and he not only is
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:27.460]   the first president in decades to not start any wars,
[00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:30.220]   he's making peace deals, he's making trade deals,
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:31.500]   he's working with our allies,
[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:33.620]   getting them to pay their fair share in NATO.
[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:37.860]   He's having a dialogue with China, with Russia,
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:39.580]   he's weakening Iran.
[00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:41.580]   And so I do think that the job he did
[00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:43.780]   as a foreign policy president was tremendous.
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:47.100]   I think now more and more people are starting
[00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:48.460]   to recognize that.
[00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:50.700]   Again, under President Biden, this is the second war
[00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:52.380]   that's broken out in the world.
[00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:54.860]   And when you have a weak American leadership,
[00:54:54.860 --> 00:54:57.340]   the world becomes a less safe place.
[00:54:57.340 --> 00:55:02.340]   And so my hope and prayers are that President Trump
[00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:06.740]   is reelected and that he's able to then restore
[00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:10.420]   order and calm and peace and prosperity to the world.
[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:12.540]   - From a place of strength.
[00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:15.460]   - That's the only way he knows how to do it.
[00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:19.060]   - What gives you hope about the future of this region,
[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:23.140]   of Israel and of the Middle East?
[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:28.140]   - The Middle East for 20 years was an area of conflict.
[00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:32.500]   They spent all their money on bullets and bombs.
[00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:36.500]   You have young leadership now in Saudi Arabia
[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:38.500]   and UAE and Qatar.
[00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:42.300]   And there's a much more ambitious agenda now for the region
[00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:45.880]   to make it an economic superpower and hub of the world.
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:47.780]   Israel is one of the most burgeoning
[00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:50.980]   and exciting tech economies in the world.
[00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:54.100]   And if you think about it, it's almost like having
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:56.820]   Silicon Valley not connected to California.
[00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:59.820]   The thing that's held the region back for all these years
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:01.740]   has just been the conflict and the division
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:03.500]   and the lack of connectivity.
[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:05.840]   But if you have that region, if it can all come together,
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:08.120]   if you can create a security architecture,
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:10.040]   you have an incredibly young population,
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:12.880]   you have a lot of wealth and resources
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:15.420]   and a lot of capabilities and know-how.
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:19.700]   And so I think that if it's managed correctly
[00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:22.540]   and if Iran is able to be restrained
[00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:24.420]   and suppressed with their ambitions
[00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:27.860]   to cause destabilization, I don't mean Iran the country,
[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:29.060]   I mean the Iranian regime,
[00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:32.700]   because actually once you have this economic sphere,
[00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:33.980]   if you could bring Iraq into it,
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:36.100]   if you could bring Iran into it,
[00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:37.740]   that makes it even bigger and stronger.
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:40.300]   And the Persian people are incredibly entrepreneurial
[00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:41.940]   and incredibly industrious.
[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:44.580]   So I do think that the region has tremendous potential.
[00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:47.340]   It's just been held back by bad policy,
[00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:49.660]   bad leadership, bad objectives.
[00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:52.740]   And again, when President Trump left office in 2010,
[00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:56.980]   in 2021, the Middle East was really
[00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:59.060]   on a very, very positive trajectory.
[00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:02.100]   And if the right things happen, it can continue to be so.
[00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:04.460]   So I'm praying at this moment in time
[00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:06.960]   that we navigate the current crisis,
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:09.640]   that the important objectives are achieved
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:12.460]   of eliminating the terrorists and their threats,
[00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:15.500]   and then allowing the leaders who are focused
[00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:18.180]   on giving their citizens and their neighbors
[00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:20.040]   the opportunity to live a better life,
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:21.220]   are able to work together
[00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:25.460]   and really dream and be ambitious,
[00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:28.100]   and find ways to create a paradigm
[00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:30.540]   where humans can flourish.
[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:34.300]   - What is the best way to defeat hate in the world?
[00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:37.580]   - Hate is a very powerful force,
[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:41.360]   and it's much easier to hate people you don't know.
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:46.620]   It's funny, when I was working on prison reform,
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:50.780]   one of the most interesting people I met was a reverend,
[00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:54.900]   actually down in Texas, who negotiated the first truce
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:56.980]   between the Bloods and the Crips,
[00:57:56.980 --> 00:57:59.260]   two of the notorious gangs in America in prison.
[00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:00.780]   And I was very excited to meet him.
[00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:04.220]   And when I met him, I said, "Well, how'd you do it?"
[00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:05.340]   And he said, "It was very simple."
[00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:08.420]   He says, "I got all the guys together,
[00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:11.740]   and I had a tremendous amount of barbecue brought in."
[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:12.820]   He says, "And I got the meeting."
[00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:13.660]   He says, "No drinking."
[00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:14.940]   He says, "Drinking sometimes gets people
[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:17.260]   a little bit more against each other."
[00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:18.300]   He says, "But I got a meeting,
[00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:19.700]   and they started sitting down together,
[00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:21.460]   and they started saying, 'You know what?
[00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:23.020]   You're just like me.'"
[00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:25.280]   And all of a sudden, they started finding areas
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:26.980]   where they were more together.
[00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:28.980]   Look, I've traveled all over the world now.
[00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:32.100]   I've been very fortunate to meet people
[00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:33.780]   from different states in America.
[00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:35.660]   I've different political persuasions,
[00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:38.380]   different ages, different classes.
[00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:42.980]   And what I found is that there's a fundamental driving
[00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:46.940]   amongst all of us where we all wanna live a better life.
[00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:50.460]   And people don't wanna fight naturally,
[00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:52.660]   but it's easy to fight when you feel wronged
[00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:54.540]   or you feel like somebody disrespected you
[00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:57.700]   or somebody did something from hatred,
[00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:59.780]   and hatred leads to more hatred,
[00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:03.020]   which sometimes just pushes that cycle further and further.
[00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:05.980]   So I believe that each and every one of us
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:08.940]   has the power to stop that cycle.
[00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:10.980]   And we don't do it by being on Twitter
[00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:11.940]   and yelling at people.
[00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:14.900]   We don't do it by just being critical.
[00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:17.540]   We do it by finding the people we disagree with,
[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:19.600]   by listening to them, by asking questions,
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:20.980]   by sitting with them.
[00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:23.500]   And then if we each take responsibility
[00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:25.540]   to try to make the world better,
[00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:27.740]   then I think that there's no limits
[00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:30.740]   to the incredible place that this world can be.
[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:34.220]   - So as you've said, you've traveled all across the world.
[00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:38.660]   Do you think most people are good?
[00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:41.800]   Most people have love in their heart?
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:43.060]   - I do believe that.
[00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:44.260]   Yeah, and you have some bad people.
[00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:45.780]   I mean, you have some real evil people.
[00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:49.500]   I mean, a big part of the work I did was on prison reform.
[00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:52.460]   And previously the mentality was,
[00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:54.580]   is that the prison should basically be a warehouse
[00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:55.460]   for human trash.
[00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:57.740]   And if you've made a mistake in this world,
[00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:59.460]   then we're gonna throw you out
[00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:01.740]   and we're gonna make the rest of your life
[01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:03.500]   incredibly difficult
[01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:04.820]   because you're gonna have a criminal record,
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:06.940]   you're not gonna have access to jobs.
[01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:08.980]   But what I found is when I would sit with people in prison,
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:11.140]   the people I've met through my father's experience
[01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:13.020]   and who I met along the way,
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:15.620]   is that people make mistakes.
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:16.460]   We're all human.
[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:18.460]   I think it's the right thing from a religious perspective
[01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:20.180]   to give people second chances.
[01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:22.780]   I always believe you shouldn't judge people
[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:24.580]   by the worst mistake they make in their life.
[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:26.380]   Unfortunately, now in the era of social media,
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:28.300]   people will say one wrong thing,
[01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:29.380]   it sticks with them forever,
[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:31.580]   they get canceled or they get put out.
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:32.420]   We're all humans.
[01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:33.640]   We grow from our mistakes.
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:35.380]   We learn from our mistakes.
[01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:39.640]   And I think that some people are just evil.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:41.200]   There are some evil people,
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:44.100]   but I do think the vast, vast, vast majority of people
[01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:45.600]   are good.
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.180]   And I do think that people sometimes also can
[01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:51.600]   be in a bad place and then society can push them
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:52.920]   to a worse and worse place,
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:55.180]   but we all have the power to make them feel loved,
[01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:56.700]   make them feel heard.
[01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:59.700]   And I think there's also tremendous power
[01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:03.500]   that we have as people to help people get to a better place.
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.460]   And so, my wife and I,
[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:07.120]   we've always tried to be a force for good.
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.480]   We've always tried to be,
[01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:11.480]   we've always tried to provide a place
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:12.960]   where people can discuss with each other.
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.320]   When we were in Washington,
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:17.460]   we would host dinners at our house all the time,
[01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:20.840]   or we would have Democrats and Republicans sitting together.
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:24.280]   We just had, I saw Senator Feinstein just passed away.
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.440]   We had a great dinner at her house
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.440]   when she was a Senator with her and her husband
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:30.960]   and Mark Meadows when he was on the Freedom Caucus.
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:33.840]   And we actually had a fascinating discussion about Iran.
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:35.840]   Mark was much more hardline than me.
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.120]   I had to actually bite my tongue.
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:38.560]   I was impressed at how much he did.
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:42.180]   Whereas Feinstein and her husband were like super into,
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:43.380]   they knew the Iranians well,
[01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:45.060]   they thought they were peace loving,
[01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:47.540]   and it was an incredibly robust and respectful debate.
[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:51.420]   And so, I don't think we maybe concluded anything that night,
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:53.820]   but it was interesting for people to get together.
[01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:57.420]   Having a dinner at my house where I had Dick Durbin,
[01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:59.940]   the number two ranking Democrat in the Senate,
[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:01.340]   Lindsey Graham and Stephen Miller,
[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:03.140]   who's known to be a very hardline in immigration,
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:06.420]   discussing what an immigration reform could look like.
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:08.300]   I mean, they left that dinner saying,
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:11.360]   "Wow, we hadn't spoken to people on the other side,
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.680]   and we actually agree on like 85% of things.
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:15.320]   Like maybe something is possible."
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:18.400]   And so, I believe that we should always be trying to push
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.660]   to make the world a better place.
[01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:22.600]   And you only do that by listening to people
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:26.120]   and connecting with people and by respecting people.
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.180]   And finally, I'll just say on this is that,
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:33.360]   I meet people all the time who have so much confidence
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:34.360]   in their perspectives.
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:38.460]   And I'm very jealous that these people are able
[01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:40.360]   to be so confident about every single thing,
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:44.040]   because for me, I have some degree of confidence
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:45.880]   in the things that I've studied and what I've learned,
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:48.960]   but I'm always trying to find people who disagree
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:51.600]   to kind of sharpen my perspectives and to help me grow
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:52.720]   and to help me learn further.
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:55.560]   And so, I think that's kind of the beauty of the world
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:58.160]   is that the knowledge base continues to grow,
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.600]   the facts continue to change,
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:03.920]   and what's possible tomorrow continues to become different.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:07.480]   And so, as humans, we have to continue to thrive,
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.600]   to learn and to grow and to connect.
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:11.640]   And if we do that, everything's possible.
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:16.200]   - Well, Jared, thank you for your compassion, first of all,
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.760]   but also your wisdom today on this very difficult,
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:21.520]   this tragic set of events,
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:23.720]   these difficult days for the world.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:28.440]   It's a big honor to speak with you again.
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:32.480]   Every time I speak to you, I learn a lot about the world,
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:34.440]   and I deeply appreciate, like I said,
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:39.200]   your humility and your understanding of the details
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:43.880]   of all the complex power dynamics and human dynamics
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:45.360]   that are going on in the world.
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:48.400]   Once again, thank you for talking today.
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:49.240]   - Thank you.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:51.000]   And Lex, if I could say just one final thing,
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.400]   which is that my thoughts and prayers
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.400]   are really with all of the people in Israel
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:59.360]   and the innocent civilians as well,
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:00.600]   from the Palestinian side,
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.840]   and my prayers are with the IDF soldiers
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:03.800]   that they should be safe
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:07.120]   and they should be really watched by God
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:10.240]   to accomplish whatever mission will enable
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.840]   to make the world a safer place.
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:15.440]   - Thank you for listening to this newly recorded segment
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:18.840]   of the conversation that addresses the current situation
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:20.200]   in Israel and Gaza.
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:24.560]   And now we'll go on to the second part of the conversation
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:27.000]   recorded on Thursday, October 5th.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.120]   Given your experience in negotiating
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.200]   with some of the most powerful
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.480]   and influential leaders in the world,
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:36.120]   what's the key to negotiating difficult agreements
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.400]   in geopolitics?
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:39.280]   I start with a big question.
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:42.520]   - If I look back on the different negotiations I had
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:43.500]   when I was in government,
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:46.360]   either with leaders of countries,
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:48.200]   with representatives of leaders,
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:51.500]   or even with members of Congress to pass legislation,
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:55.360]   the most important thing I would draw back to
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:57.000]   would be trust.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.620]   I think getting to know each other,
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:03.700]   understanding what was motivating the other party
[01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:05.360]   to get to the outcome,
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:09.440]   and making them feel like you weren't going to use
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:11.400]   whatever information they gave you
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:15.420]   to benefit yourself at the expense of them
[01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:18.240]   is probably what I would call table stakes
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:21.780]   to have a shot at accomplishing anything
[01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:24.800]   that was hard in negotiation.
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:26.600]   After that, I would say
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:30.080]   taking maybe a first principles approach
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:34.480]   to what the outcome of whatever problem
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:36.580]   you're looking to solve should be.
[01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:38.540]   Now, you have different kinds of negotiations.
[01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:41.640]   I always try to create a framework in the negotiation
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.960]   where it wasn't me against you.
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:47.680]   It was always, let's agree on what the outcome is
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.360]   that we're trying to accomplish.
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:52.240]   Let's all sit on the same side of the table and say,
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.040]   we want to get to this outcome.
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:55.280]   How do we get there?
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.720]   Really trying to create a roadmap.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:59.280]   And so once you understand the destination
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:01.280]   you want to get to, the end point,
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:02.640]   then you'd have to work backwards
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:05.040]   and really try to put yourself in their shoes
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:09.400]   and try to understand what were their motivations macro.
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.140]   Most of the time, you have to assume
[01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:13.800]   that a leader's primary objective was to stay in power.
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:17.140]   And so all decisions made would be made
[01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:20.360]   through the framework of what it would take to do that
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.900]   and how it would impact their ability to do that.
[01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:26.440]   And then finally, I would just say that in any negotiation,
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:29.240]   you have to understand the power dynamics as well.
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:31.920]   And you have to then weight your approach
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:35.560]   in order to maneuver pieces to accomplish the objective.
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:39.560]   And so in areas where we had stronger power dynamics,
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.340]   I'd always look at it and say,
[01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:42.980]   what are the potential escape routes
[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:44.880]   where a politician would say,
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:46.920]   this is just the reason why we can't get there.
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:47.740]   And I'd always think,
[01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:50.580]   how can you try to eliminate those escape routes
[01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:52.840]   or make them much harder to accomplish?
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.720]   And then ultimately think about what's the golden bridge
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:57.160]   that you wanna create for them
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:59.360]   in order to get to the other side
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:01.660]   where they were motivated to get there
[01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:03.640]   because it was in their self-interest to get there,
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:05.400]   but also because it helped
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.080]   accomplish the different objective.
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:09.840]   And I have many examples that I lived through with that,
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:13.760]   obviously negotiating in Congress for prison reform.
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:16.440]   I had to form a lot of trust with Democrats,
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:19.120]   whether it was Hakeem Jeffries or Dick Durbin,
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.280]   and then also on the Republican side with,
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:24.320]   I had Mike Lee, I had Lindsey Graham,
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:27.240]   I had Tim Scott, Senator Grassley,
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:30.000]   and then also Doug Collins in the House was tremendous.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.520]   And every time we maneuvered something,
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:35.040]   we would get attacked either from the left,
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.800]   there was a time we were being attacked by Nancy Pelosi,
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:41.320]   John Lewis for not being inclusive enough.
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.160]   And then there were times that we maneuvered it,
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:46.040]   we'd be attacked from the right for maybe going too far.
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:48.560]   And ultimately we had to find just the right place
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:49.440]   where we can get it done.
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:52.200]   And the same thing happened with USMCA
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:54.680]   where we were negotiating the biggest trade deal
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:55.760]   in the history of the world,
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:58.840]   which was $1.3 trillion in annual trade
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:03.000]   between Mexico, Canada, the United States of America.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.540]   And we were able to form good trust with the other side
[01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:09.200]   and try to say, how do we create win-win outcomes?
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:11.280]   And ultimately we were able to do something
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:14.640]   in a record time that people thought was very hard to do.
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.400]   And both of them in a divided time
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:19.760]   of the Trump administration were bipartisan wins
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:23.080]   with big, big votes in the Senate and the House.
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.800]   - You have a lot of stories of this kind.
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:27.280]   Sometimes a soft approach, sometimes a hard approach.
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:30.840]   Like there's, I think, a story where with Bibi,
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:34.400]   there was a potential, like a dramatic election coming up
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:38.200]   and you had to say no, no excuses, no delaying.
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.120]   You have to, we have to make this agreement.
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.400]   I know Bibi cares about Israel
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:43.920]   more than the particular dynamics of the election.
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.400]   Like you have to draw a hard line there.
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:49.160]   - Yeah, but in fairness to, like, you know, for him,
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:50.960]   during the time that we were dealing with him,
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.840]   he was always in election versus election and then election.
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.240]   And, you know, what he was saying wasn't wrong.
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:59.480]   And I think he was more expressing his concerns
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:00.520]   given the dynamics.
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:03.360]   And, you know, we never held those concerns against him.
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:05.240]   We just said, those are real concerns he had.
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:07.020]   We respected those concerns,
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:08.800]   but then we helped him prioritize
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:10.800]   to help accomplish the right things.
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:13.120]   And that's ultimately what the partnership is, right?
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.560]   My job was to represent America.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.600]   His job was to represent Israel.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.640]   And you had other parties representing their own interests.
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:20.640]   And as long as you assume that, you know,
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:23.360]   people were acting mostly in good faith,
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.720]   you were able to navigate areas where you didn't have,
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:29.120]   you know, complete overlap of priorities and objectives.
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:31.200]   - Just to go back to the trust thing,
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.880]   you sometimes see that with leaders,
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:35.000]   where they're kind of, it looks like they're trying
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.960]   to screw over the other person when they're talking.
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:41.040]   And so not having that,
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:44.760]   I think is a really powerful thing for earning trust.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:46.880]   Like the people actually can believe
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:48.640]   that your results driven
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:51.680]   and are working towards a certain end.
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.480]   Is there like a skill to that?
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:55.880]   Like what, is that genetics?
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:56.840]   You're born with that?
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:59.800]   Or is that something like you develop?
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:02.920]   So basically it requires you to look at the game of politics
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:05.060]   and not have a kind of cynicism about it
[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:07.280]   to where everybody's trying to manipulate you
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:11.320]   and actually just go in with a kind of open mind
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:15.880]   and open heart and actually speak truthfully to people,
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.720]   like on a basic human level.
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:20.280]   - I would say that I always would think about
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:21.840]   how can I be a partner to others?
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.600]   Like I would want somebody to be a partner to me.
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:27.960]   And a lot of it comes from just my different experiences
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:28.780]   in business.
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:31.720]   I've had great partners, I've had terrible partners.
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:35.040]   My father, you know, again, a lot of my childhood was,
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.040]   I was exposed to business.
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:39.080]   My father, you know, on Sundays he would take us
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:41.160]   to job sites and to the office with him
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:42.280]   instead of to football games,
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:44.560]   like my friends' fathers would do.
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:45.960]   And so we were exposed to business.
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:47.440]   And what he would say about his father,
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:49.560]   who was an immigrant to America,
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:52.340]   came over with nothing, had no formal education,
[01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:53.400]   but he would always say,
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:56.520]   "A good deal with a bad partner will always be a bad deal.
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:59.600]   And a bad deal with a good partner, you'll figure it out."
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.480]   And so going through some of the challenges
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:03.920]   that I had in my life early on,
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:07.520]   whether it was the issue with my father
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:09.480]   that I'm sure we'll talk about,
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:12.280]   or even going through some tougher financial times
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:14.320]   during the great financial crisis,
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.320]   I really learned a lot about partnership.
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:19.760]   And I always thought, how can I act in a way
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:23.320]   where I could be the type of partner or friend to others
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.200]   that I wish others would be to me?
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:29.120]   - So when you look for a good partner,
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:33.760]   don't you think there's the capacity
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:36.440]   for both good and bad in every person?
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:39.600]   So when you talk, when you negotiate with all these leaders,
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:42.520]   aren't there like multiple people
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:44.640]   you're speaking to inside one person
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:47.960]   that you're trying to encourage,
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:50.480]   catalyze the goodness in the human?
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:54.000]   - Yeah, so leaders are generally chosen by their country.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.200]   And so my view was, is if I had an objective,
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:59.760]   I didn't get to choose who was the leader of other countries.
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:02.000]   My job was to deal with that leader,
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.280]   understand their strengths, understand their weaknesses,
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:06.400]   understand their power dynamics as well.
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.720]   One of my greatest takeaways when I grew up,
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:09.720]   I'd read the newspapers
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:12.280]   about all these powerful, famous people,
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:15.600]   and then as I got older and had the chance to meet them
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:16.680]   and do business with them,
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:20.600]   and then ultimately interact with them in government,
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.880]   is I realized that they're just like you and me.
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:25.280]   They wake up every morning, their kids are pissed at them,
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:27.400]   their wife doesn't wanna talk with them,
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:29.400]   and they've got a set of advisors around them.
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:30.880]   One's saying, let's go to war,
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.040]   one's saying, let's make peace,
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:33.040]   one's saying, do the deal,
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:34.720]   one's saying, don't do the deal.
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:36.420]   And they're all thinking, where do I get advice?
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:37.520]   How do I make decisions?
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.760]   And so understanding the true human nature of them
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:43.640]   and then the different power dynamics around them,
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:45.280]   I thought was very key.
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:47.400]   And so I didn't have a choice, do I deal with them or not?
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:50.280]   It was a function of how do you deal with them effectively
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:53.520]   in order to find areas where you have common interests
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:57.560]   and then work well together to pursue those common interests
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:59.960]   in order to achieve a certain goal.
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:03.600]   - First of all, you're incredibly well-read.
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.920]   I've gotten to know you and I've gotten to know Ivanka,
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:09.000]   and the book recommendation list is just incredible.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.920]   So first of all, thank you for that.
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:14.720]   You told me about "The Guns of August" by Barbara Tuchman.
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:17.160]   It's a book on World War I,
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.440]   and I went down a whole rabbit hole there.
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:21.200]   She's like an incredible historian.
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:23.600]   But anyway, there's a bunch of stuff you learn from that,
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:24.800]   but one of the things you told me
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:28.200]   is it influenced your general approach to diplomacy
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:32.640]   of just picking up the phone and giving it a try.
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:37.040]   So as opposed to planning and strategizing,
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.440]   just pick up the phone.
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:41.960]   - Yeah, so this was a book I read way before
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:43.880]   the notion of serving in government
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:48.120]   was ever even on my mind or reality.
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.560]   And I remember thinking about it,
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:52.220]   reading it and thinking how World War I started,
[01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:55.080]   where you had somebody was assassinated
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:57.320]   and then you had all these different alliances
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:59.440]   that were created.
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:03.040]   And then in order to accomplish objectives,
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:07.080]   it triggered all of these people getting in bed
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:09.300]   with everyone else because of documents
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:11.880]   that were created without the intent
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:13.360]   of going to a massive war.
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.960]   And I think in the course of World War I,
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:17.400]   it was one of the greatest atrocities
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:18.600]   that we've seen as humanity.
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:21.280]   We've had 16 million people killed in that war.
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:23.900]   And as I was reading the book, I remember thinking to myself,
[01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:27.320]   even though things are set in a certain way,
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:29.360]   go sit with somebody, go talk to them and say,
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:31.020]   this doesn't make sense, this is wrong.
[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:33.120]   How do we create a better pathway?
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:35.160]   And as a civilian, all my life,
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:36.220]   I would read the newspapers.
[01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:40.160]   I would observe how different leaders would act.
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:43.040]   But when we had the opportunity to serve in government
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:46.520]   and have the position, you realize you're not a civilian.
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:48.640]   You don't have the luxury of sitting back
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:51.360]   and letting the world happen the way it's happening.
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:55.560]   You have agency and you have the potential
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:57.180]   to influence the outcome of things.
[01:14:57.180 --> 01:14:58.800]   And one thing I've seen is,
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.880]   most political prognosticators are wrong.
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:02.940]   Anyone who tells you what's gonna happen
[01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:04.040]   really has no clue.
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:05.340]   And it's not because they're bad
[01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:08.360]   or they're not intelligent, it's because nobody knows.
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:11.140]   And at the end of the day, the outcomes in the world
[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:13.940]   are usually driven by the decisions of humans.
[01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:16.560]   And if you're able to come together, form relationships,
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:18.860]   listen to each other, you can do that.
[01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:21.680]   And one of the great examples that I speak about in the book
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:23.200]   is with North Korea.
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:27.000]   Whereas if you remember in 2017, it was very intense.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.720]   When President Obama was leaving office,
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:32.640]   he told President Trump that the single biggest fear
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:34.920]   that he had, and this is a time when the world was a mess,
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:37.180]   you had the Middle East was on fire,
[01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:40.100]   ISIS was beheading journalists and killing Christians,
[01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:42.200]   they had a caliphate the size of Ohio,
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:44.520]   Libya was destabilized, Yemen was destabilized,
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:48.040]   Syria was in a civil war where 500,000 people were killed,
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:50.480]   Iran was on a quiet path to a nuclear weapon.
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:54.120]   Yet the single biggest fear he had was North Korea.
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:56.220]   And then it got compounded by the fact
[01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:58.440]   that we get into office and President Trump
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:00.680]   brings his generals around and he's learning
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:03.360]   how to interact with all the generals and says,
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:04.680]   okay, what are my options?
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:07.200]   And they said, calm down, we've been using all
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:08.880]   of our ammunition in the Middle East.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.800]   We don't have enough ammunition to go to war over there.
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.720]   And he says, let's not let that be too public,
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:16.360]   let's try to restock and come up with a plan.
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:19.120]   And at the time, there was a lot of banter back and forth.
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:23.060]   And I was able to, I got a call from a friend
[01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:25.960]   who was an old business contact who actually
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:28.040]   had done business in North Korea.
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:31.160]   And he said, I'd love to find a way to solve this.
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:32.800]   And I was getting calls from friends at the time
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:35.160]   saying, I'm trying to go to Hawaii for vacation.
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:36.000]   Should I not be going?
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:36.820]   Is it not safe?
[01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:39.480]   I mean, we forget the psychology
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:41.760]   of how intense that was at the time.
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:44.200]   And then through that interaction,
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.560]   he called some of his contacts in North Korea
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:49.440]   and then we were able with the CIA to open up a back channel
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:53.440]   that ultimately led to the de-escalation,
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:54.960]   the meeting between Trump and Kim Jong-un,
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:56.280]   which led to a de-escalation.
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:58.000]   So that was really the mindset,
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.200]   which was whenever there's a problem,
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:01.560]   just pick up the phone and try.
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:04.400]   And I think President Trump had a very similar approach,
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:06.160]   which was let's give it a shot.
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:09.280]   And he wasn't afraid to go after the hard ones too.
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:10.840]   And I'll say one final thing on this,
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:13.360]   which is that in politics,
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:17.160]   the incentive structure is just much different
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:18.840]   than in the real world, right?
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:21.200]   In the sense that you have a hard problem,
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:23.440]   then if you try to solve a hard problem,
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:25.000]   the likelihood of failure is great.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:25.920]   Whereas in the business world,
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:27.160]   if you're going after a hard problem,
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:29.100]   we celebrate those people, right?
[01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:32.240]   We want our entrepreneurs and our great people
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:34.420]   to go after solving the big hard problems.
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:37.200]   But in politics, if you try to take on a hard problem,
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:38.980]   you have a high likelihood of failure.
[01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:41.600]   You'll get a lot of criticism on your pathway
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:44.160]   to trying to accomplish that if you fail.
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.300]   And then if you fail, it has a higher probability
[01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:50.220]   of leading to you losing your opportunity to serve.
[01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:52.020]   And so it's just one of these things
[01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:53.440]   where people wanna play it safe,
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:56.820]   which is not the notion that really was taken
[01:17:56.820 --> 01:17:59.300]   during the time that President Trump was in office.
[01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:00.900]   - Do you think it has to be that way?
[01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:04.140]   I think there's something in the human spirit,
[01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:06.900]   like in the public, that desires politicians
[01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:11.900]   to take on the big, bold problems, right?
[01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:14.660]   Like why is it the politician
[01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:16.540]   needs to be so afraid of failure?
[01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:18.060]   - I don't think it has to be that way.
[01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:20.700]   And that's, I think, one of the great lessons
[01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:23.140]   from the time of the Trump administration.
[01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:24.260]   He brought a lot of people
[01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:26.540]   from the business world into government.
[01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:29.100]   The business people have a much different mindset
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:31.740]   than government people, and there was a lot of resistance.
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:34.340]   And I think part of why there was so much resistance
[01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:38.220]   was because, I think about it from my personal sense,
[01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:40.460]   was that if I was successful
[01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:43.420]   with no traditional qualifications to do diplomacy,
[01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:44.580]   it meant that all the people
[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:47.620]   with traditional qualifications in diplomacy
[01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:49.380]   didn't necessarily need those qualifications
[01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:50.500]   in order to be successful.
[01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:54.800]   And that same sentiment manifested itself
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:56.140]   in many areas in government.
[01:18:56.140 --> 01:18:58.260]   And I think that in the business world,
[01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:01.500]   it's outcome-oriented, it's results-oriented.
[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:04.020]   And what we would see in New York is there,
[01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:05.020]   they would stab you in the eye,
[01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:06.540]   in DC, they would stab you in the back,
[01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:08.940]   and it just became a whole different dynamic
[01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:11.740]   of how you work through these different areas.
[01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:13.560]   So the answer is it doesn't have to be that way.
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:15.760]   You just need the right, courageous leader.
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.940]   And that's why I'm so optimistic
[01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:20.860]   about what the future of America and the world could be
[01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:22.380]   if you have the right people in power
[01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:25.780]   who are willing to take on the right challenges
[01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:27.020]   and do it in the right way.
[01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:28.780]   - So if we just linger on the North Korea
[01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:30.380]   and the de-escalation and the meeting,
[01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:35.220]   what's the trajectory from this could be
[01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:38.300]   the most catastrophic thing that destroys the world
[01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:42.160]   to you find back channels, you start talking
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:44.460]   and start arranging the meeting?
[01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:46.020]   Is there some insights you can give
[01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:50.060]   to how difficult that is to do in the North Korea case,
[01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:51.740]   which seems like to be one of the more
[01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:53.660]   closed-off parts of the world,
[01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:56.020]   and in the other cases that you worked on?
[01:19:56.020 --> 01:19:58.060]   - Yeah, it's always very challenging,
[01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:00.940]   and especially when you're going against the grain
[01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:02.060]   of what's established, right?
[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:03.700]   We did something different to think
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:06.940]   that an old business contact that I had could then do it.
[01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:09.140]   I mean, that's the type of thing that, you know,
[01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:10.960]   if the press knew what we were doing,
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:13.300]   they would have derided it and criticized it
[01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:15.700]   in every which way, but that was one of the benefits
[01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:17.700]   of operating very much below the radar
[01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:20.060]   is that we were able to try all these different things.
[01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:22.040]   And not all of them worked, but some of them did.
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:23.740]   And, you know, but that is what's amazing
[01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:24.580]   about the world, right?
[01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:26.880]   This could be the biggest story on the front page
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:29.220]   of every paper, and they're inciting fear in everyone,
[01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:30.440]   and it's not a legitimate fear.
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:33.980]   I mean, there were missile tests, you know, over Japan.
[01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:37.900]   I mean, you had a lot of very big challenges with that file,
[01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:39.860]   and then all of a sudden we make contact,
[01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:41.960]   we go through negotiations to set a meeting.
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:44.620]   There's a meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un,
[01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:46.820]   and then all of a sudden there's a framework
[01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:50.760]   to try and move things forward.
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:53.340]   And again, I think that there's a lot of possibility there
[01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:56.500]   for what could happen if it's worked in the right way.
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:58.900]   - I just wanna know, like, how you word that first email
[01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:01.340]   or text message, like what emojis to use,
[01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:03.100]   like the hugging emoji.
[01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:04.920]   I think it's just personally, I've gotten to know
[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:07.700]   a lot of powerful and rich people,
[01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:09.300]   and it's funny that they're all human,
[01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:11.140]   just like you're saying.
[01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:13.700]   And like, a lot of the drama, a lot of the problems
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:16.660]   can be resolved with just like a little camaraderie,
[01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:18.340]   a little kindness, a little like,
[01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:19.980]   just actually just reaching out.
[01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:22.860]   We're all human beings, and people wanna be successful,
[01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:25.380]   and people wanna be good, and you're right too,
[01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:28.080]   there's way more emojis involved in diplomacy
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:29.860]   than I ever would have expected.
[01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:31.900]   - And every leader, I'm sure, has their favorite emoji.
[01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:34.100]   This is also I learned about people that use,
[01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:36.980]   like everybody has their go-to emoji.
[01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:39.860]   Like I usually go to the heart very quickly, emoji.
[01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:41.820]   There's some people who go with the hugging,
[01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:44.600]   whatever that, what do you like, the hugging thing.
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:48.220]   Anyway, this conversation quickly turned to the ridiculous.
[01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:50.740]   But to do another book reference,
[01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:52.980]   you mentioned the book "13 Days in September"
[01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:57.220]   by Lawrence Wright, in discussing all the work you've done
[01:21:57.220 --> 01:21:59.980]   in Israel and the Middle East.
[01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:01.980]   I just wanna ask you sort of the interesting aspect
[01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:06.660]   of that book, which is the influence of the personalities
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:09.720]   and personal relationships on these negotiations.
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:11.720]   You kind of started to allude to that with the trust,
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:14.980]   but how much do the personalities matter in this?
[01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:17.620]   So going from North Korea to the Middle East here,
[01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:20.180]   to within Congress and all that kind of stuff.
[01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:21.540]   - Yeah, completely in every way.
[01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:23.180]   I mean, that's an incredible book,
[01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:24.680]   and it's a very entertaining read.
[01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:28.580]   It has obviously a lot of good historical context
[01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:30.900]   on some of the key players, whether it was Anwar Sadat
[01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:34.820]   or Menachem Begin or Jimmy Carter and Cy Vance,
[01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:37.120]   and a lot of the others who were involved
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:38.580]   with those negotiations.
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:42.560]   And the thing that I kind of took from that experience
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:44.220]   was just how personal it was.
[01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:46.600]   And again, one of my favorite stories from that book
[01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:49.960]   was how Anwar Sadat, who was a big, big leader,
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:52.500]   he had a mystic who was, according to this book,
[01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:54.340]   again, history, I like reading it,
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:57.060]   but I always realize that you have to notice
[01:22:57.060 --> 01:22:58.960]   that this is just the perspective of a given author
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:22:59.800]   that's writing it.
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:00.980]   But the way that they write this book
[01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:03.260]   was that he had an advisor who was a mystic,
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:06.420]   and the mystic was having a back channel with the Israelis.
[01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:10.020]   And the mystic told Sadat, "If you go to Israel
[01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:11.980]   "and you make a speech at the Knesset,
[01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:14.580]   "Begin is ready to give you the Sinai."
[01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:18.840]   And so he goes to Israel, they set this whole thing up,
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:19.920]   he goes and gives the Knesset,
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:21.540]   they go for their meeting after, and Sadat says,
[01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:23.400]   "Okay, well, are we gonna do this thing?"
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:24.980]   And Begin says, "What are you talking about?
[01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:27.640]   "I'm not giving you an inch of our land."
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:29.240]   And it was just one of these things
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:31.240]   where it was a miscommunication
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:34.400]   that brought about the symbolic visit
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:36.720]   of Anwar Sadat to Israel.
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:40.000]   And that was one of these notions
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.520]   that just made everyone think that something was possible
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:45.620]   that they thought was impossible a moment before.
[01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:47.200]   Actually, we had an example like that
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:48.360]   during our time in government
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:50.840]   when we did the Abraham Accords.
[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:54.120]   The first step of the Accords was really a phone call
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:57.200]   between President Trump, Prime Minister Netanyahu,
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:59.520]   and Mohammed bin Zayed, who at that point
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:02.380]   was the crown prince and de facto ruler of the UAE.
[01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:05.440]   But all we had was a phone call
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:08.000]   and then a statement that was released.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.780]   And what was interesting after that is we said,
[01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:11.220]   "Okay, well, how do we integrate countries?
[01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:13.260]   "Nobody's done this in a long time."
[01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:14.960]   And we were trying to figure out all the issues.
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:17.880]   And there's big miscommunications between Israel and UAE,
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:20.640]   and we were navigating through all the issues.
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.020]   And so after a couple of weeks, I said,
[01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:22.960]   "You know what, I've got to go over there
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:24.380]   "and try to sort through these issues.
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:25.600]   "So we make a plan to go to Israel,
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:27.080]   "then we can go to UAE."
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:29.280]   And then a young gentleman who worked with me
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:31.040]   named Avi Berkowitz says,
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:32.620]   "Well, if we're flying from Israel to UAE,
[01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:34.120]   "instead of flying on a government plane,
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:36.320]   "why don't we see if we can get an El Al plane
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:39.040]   "and we'll do the first official commercial flight?"
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.940]   And so I said, "That's a great idea.
[01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:43.840]   "Let's call Ambassador Al-Tayyiba Yusuf,"
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:46.760]   who was a tremendous player in the Abraham Accords,
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:49.080]   working behind the scenes, day and night,
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:51.300]   and was really a big catalyst.
[01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:52.280]   So he calls Yusuf and he said,
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:53.720]   "Sure, no problem, let's give it a shot."
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:55.880]   So we go and we do it.
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:57.160]   And he says, "If we can work out these issues,
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:58.000]   "what we'll do?"
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.680]   So we go to Israel, we do our meetings,
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:02.860]   we get everything back into a good place.
[01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:06.440]   We set up this trip over, we fly in an El Al plane.
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:08.360]   We fill it up, at the time it was during COVID,
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:09.740]   with a health delegation.
[01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:11.500]   We had the financial ministry
[01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:15.160]   because we had to open up banking relationships.
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:17.560]   They could wire money between countries.
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:19.380]   We wanted to get health partnerships.
[01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:20.700]   Then we just had a lot of legal things
[01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:21.740]   and national security things
[01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:24.560]   we wanted to start putting together.
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:29.560]   So we do this flight and we end up landing in UAE.
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:32.100]   And the picture of us coming off the plane,
[01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:36.240]   being greeted by Emiratis and Tobes,
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:39.220]   with an El Al plane with an Israeli flag on it,
[01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:40.860]   just captured everyone's imagination.
[01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:42.980]   And so it was one of these things where it's like,
[01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:45.660]   you work so hard on the details and the negotiation,
[01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:47.400]   I mean, hundreds of hours,
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:48.740]   to kind of make sure everything's perfect.
[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:50.860]   And the one thing that you do kind of,
[01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:52.540]   "Yeah, let's give it a shot."
[01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:54.960]   That image ended up capturing everyone's heart.
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:58.980]   So going back to Sadat, that visit was very critical.
[01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:01.380]   And what was interesting was, is according to this book,
[01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:03.540]   it happened because of a miscommunication.
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:04.420]   That was the first part.
[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:07.140]   The second part of the book, that's just amazing theater,
[01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:08.620]   and actually the book was based on a play,
[01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:10.100]   was just going back and forth
[01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:13.940]   with all of the different methodologies that they tried,
[01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:16.820]   that failed, but they kept trying at it.
[01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:18.860]   And then ultimately seeing how the personalities
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:22.020]   were able to find ways to make the compromise
[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:24.940]   that ultimately was a very, very big thing
[01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:27.540]   for more stability in the Middle East.
[01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:30.380]   And so, amazing book, I would highly recommend it.
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:32.800]   A very entertaining read and something that
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:35.380]   at least gave me encouragement to keep going
[01:26:35.380 --> 01:26:39.620]   when the task I was pursuing seemed so large.
[01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:43.100]   - I mean, if we could just linger on the personalities,
[01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:45.060]   you write in the book that words matter,
[01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:48.460]   or you write in the context of saying,
[01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:50.940]   "In the diplomacy business, words matter."
[01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:53.860]   And then you said that, "We're in the results business."
[01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:57.660]   It's a badass line, but if we just stick
[01:26:57.660 --> 01:27:01.060]   to the diplomacy business and words mattering,
[01:27:01.060 --> 01:27:03.580]   it seems like one of the things you really highlight
[01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:07.460]   is that individual words can really have,
[01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:09.180]   like you can fight over individual words.
[01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:11.180]   So like, how do you operate in a world
[01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:14.380]   where like single words matter?
[01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:17.620]   - I think you have to be respectful to the craft
[01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:19.120]   that you're in where words matter,
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:21.380]   but then realize that they don't matter as much.
[01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:24.180]   And then also focus on the fact that, you know,
[01:27:24.180 --> 01:27:25.900]   the actions are actually what's gonna matter
[01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:26.840]   more than the words.
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:30.460]   And so you have a difference between leaders and politicians.
[01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:32.580]   You know, politicians are there to say the right thing
[01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:33.960]   and to hold the power.
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:36.020]   Leaders are people who are willing to do things
[01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:38.540]   that will be transformational from my perspective.
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:42.440]   And so when I would think about diplomacy,
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:47.100]   words without actions or without the threat of actions,
[01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:49.620]   and that was something that President Trump did very well,
[01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:52.780]   was that people knew that he was willing to take action.
[01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:55.500]   He was very unpredictable in how he would act,
[01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:57.420]   and that made our words much more effective
[01:27:57.420 --> 01:27:58.260]   in what they did.
[01:27:58.260 --> 01:28:00.900]   So it's all a combination, but, you know,
[01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:02.380]   coming from the private sector,
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:03.780]   we were all about results, right?
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:05.280]   If you're in government,
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:07.920]   you can work on something for 10 years and fail,
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:09.780]   and then retire and they consider you an expert.
[01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:11.420]   In the private sector,
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:13.140]   if you work on something for 10 weeks
[01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:15.860]   and you don't have a success, then you're unemployed.
[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:18.740]   So it's a different kind of notion.
[01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:21.540]   And it was just understanding the mentality
[01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:24.420]   and trying to adjust and bridging the divides
[01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:25.860]   between the different trainings.
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:27.020]   - Is that the biggest thing you took
[01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:28.660]   from your business background?
[01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:31.180]   Is that just be really results-focused?
[01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:32.500]   - It was just the only way to be.
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:36.940]   I mean, if I was giving up a nice life in New York,
[01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:39.580]   and if I was giving up the stuff that I really enjoyed,
[01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:41.220]   the company that I'd helped build,
[01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:45.700]   and the life that I was enjoying in order to do government,
[01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:47.040]   I was going there to make a difference,
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:48.740]   and we had to focus on it.
[01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:50.880]   The other skill set, so there was a couple skill sets
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:53.760]   that I found were quite deficient in government.
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:55.940]   First of all, there was a ton of amazing people.
[01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:58.340]   I mean, people talk about the bureaucracy.
[01:28:58.340 --> 01:29:01.740]   What I found was is you had incredibly committed,
[01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:04.580]   passionate, intelligent, capable people
[01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:05.820]   all throughout the government.
[01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:09.240]   And what they were waiting for though was direction
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:12.060]   and then cover in order to get there.
[01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:14.740]   And so there were a lot of tasks that I worked on,
[01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:17.220]   whether it was building the wall at the Southern border,
[01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:20.860]   where I was able to work with Customs Border Patrol,
[01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:26.820]   Army Corps of Engineers, military, DHS professionals, DOD.
[01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:28.620]   We basically all came together,
[01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:31.220]   and then once we had a good project management plan,
[01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:32.960]   we were able to kind of move very, very quickly.
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:36.460]   I think we built about 470 miles of border barrier
[01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:38.700]   in about two years, basically.
[01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:41.820]   And that worked very well
[01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:44.060]   because we basically brought private sector
[01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:45.580]   project management skill sets,
[01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:49.740]   which were quite often missing in government.
[01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:50.900]   The second one is just,
[01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:53.040]   we spoke about negotiation earlier.
[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:54.980]   I would say that most people in government,
[01:29:54.980 --> 01:29:57.140]   it's just a different form of negotiation
[01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:58.940]   than you see in the private sector
[01:29:58.940 --> 01:30:01.200]   and way less effective in that regard,
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:02.780]   which is why I think it's good,
[01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:04.300]   the more we can encourage more people
[01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:07.500]   with private sector experience to do a stint in government
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:10.260]   and to really try to contribute and serve their country.
[01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:11.220]   That's how our founders,
[01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:14.260]   I mean, George Washington and all the founding fathers,
[01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:15.600]   they were working on their farms.
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:17.260]   They left their farms serving government,
[01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:18.240]   then they went back to the farm.
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:20.300]   And that was kind of the design of
[01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:21.420]   the representative government.
[01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:23.220]   It wasn't a career political class.
[01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:27.260]   It was people coming in to show gratitude
[01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:29.300]   for the freedoms and liberties that they enjoyed
[01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:32.700]   and then do their best to kind of help others
[01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:34.860]   have those same opportunities that they had.
[01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:36.460]   And then they'd go back and live their lives.
[01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:39.780]   And so I think that there's a lot of opportunity
[01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:42.660]   with our government of people with more business mindsets
[01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:44.100]   who are gonna think about things
[01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:47.980]   from a solutions perspective, go and serve.
[01:30:47.980 --> 01:30:50.640]   - Is that one of the main problems here?
[01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:52.580]   So you also mentioned the book,
[01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:55.980]   The Great Degeneration by Neil Ferguson,
[01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:58.260]   an awesome historian who's been on this podcast.
[01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:00.020]   It helped you understand the inefficiencies
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:01.940]   of government regulation.
[01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:04.300]   I'd love it if you can give an insight
[01:31:04.300 --> 01:31:08.540]   into why government is so inefficient at times.
[01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:11.060]   Like when it is inefficient, when it doesn't work,
[01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:12.700]   why is that the case?
[01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:14.820]   The bureaucracy that you spoke to,
[01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:17.100]   the negative aspects of the bureaucracy.
[01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:19.220]   - So we don't have enough time on this podcast
[01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:22.060]   to go into it, but it's, look,
[01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:24.420]   there's a lot of aspects that work as well, right?
[01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:26.340]   But I do think we've gotten too big.
[01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:27.860]   Neil's book that you mentioned,
[01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:29.300]   one of the things that I took from that,
[01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:31.780]   I read it, I think in 2012, right?
[01:31:31.780 --> 01:31:34.660]   Kind of in the middle of the great financial crisis was,
[01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:37.680]   he was talking about how government regulation
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:40.500]   often was put in place to deal with old crises, right?
[01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:42.500]   So it was never gonna solve future problems.
[01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:44.900]   It was more to kind of create,
[01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:47.140]   to solve for problems that had happened in the past.
[01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:48.940]   And I remember thinking about that.
[01:31:48.940 --> 01:31:50.260]   One thing I was very proud of,
[01:31:50.260 --> 01:31:52.780]   of the work of the Trump administration was that
[01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:54.540]   you had four years consecutively
[01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:57.540]   where there was a net decrease in the cost of regulations.
[01:31:57.540 --> 01:32:01.460]   So to give you a context, in the last year of Obama in 2016,
[01:32:01.460 --> 01:32:04.980]   there were 6 million man hours spent by the private sector
[01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:07.180]   complying with new federal regulations.
[01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:08.820]   And that's not really what the intent
[01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:10.080]   of our government was, right?
[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:11.700]   If we have rules or regulations,
[01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:13.300]   those should be legislated by Congress.
[01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:16.260]   They shouldn't be put in by bureaucrats
[01:32:16.260 --> 01:32:18.740]   who are basically saying, I wanna follow this objective.
[01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:21.620]   So using kind of the power of the pen in order to do that.
[01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:25.260]   So the deregulatory effort was actually very critical
[01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:28.020]   to Trump's economic success that happened
[01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:29.500]   at the beginning of the administration.
[01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:32.340]   And then what I saw with regulation was anytime
[01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:34.900]   either there was legislation or regulation coming,
[01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:37.780]   the people pushing for it were usually the people
[01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:39.820]   who would benefit from the regulatory captures.
[01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:42.980]   So you had these, you look at the great financial crisis
[01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:45.260]   where you had this big banking reforms.
[01:32:45.260 --> 01:32:47.580]   Well, what happened during the big banking reforms?
[01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:50.020]   Then you had a big reduction in the amount of banks
[01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:52.820]   that occurred and the big banks became even bigger.
[01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:54.460]   Whereas I don't think that was the intention
[01:32:54.460 --> 01:32:56.860]   of the legislation, but the people who were writing
[01:32:56.860 --> 01:32:59.300]   the legislation and influencing it had a lot
[01:32:59.300 --> 01:33:01.580]   of the constituencies from those larger institutions.
[01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:03.580]   And then what happened as a result of that?
[01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:06.540]   A lot of these smaller institutions didn't have the ability
[01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:08.340]   to be as competitive.
[01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:09.980]   They had more restrictions, more costs,
[01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:12.440]   they became less profitable, but these were the banks
[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:13.880]   that were serving small business,
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:17.000]   which is the biggest creator of jobs in our country.
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.100]   And then as a result, the bigger banks got more powerful
[01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:21.900]   and what happened in the country as a result
[01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:24.820]   of the regulations that they put in place,
[01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:27.260]   the wealth gap in the country grew, it didn't shrink.
[01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:31.260]   And so I think oftentimes what they say these regulations
[01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:35.060]   are intended to be, the result often becomes the opposite.
[01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:38.580]   And so what President Trump did in his administration
[01:33:38.580 --> 01:33:40.840]   was they did a massive deregulatory effort.
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:45.020]   And I think they pledged that for every one regulation
[01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:47.000]   they put on, 'cause you do need some regulation
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.240]   in an economy and in a society, they would take off two.
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:53.000]   And in the first year, they limited eight regulations
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:53.840]   for every one.
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:55.840]   And so that was just something I took from it,
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:58.200]   which was, I thought, very interesting.
[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:01.000]   And you had to really, I think you just have to think
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.640]   through what are the consequences gonna be
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:04.640]   of the different actions you take.
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:08.020]   And often government gets it wrong by taking an action
[01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:10.560]   that feels right, but has big negative consequences
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:11.720]   down the road.
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:15.460]   - Let's go to some difficult topics.
[01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:19.260]   You wrote in the book about your experience
[01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:21.260]   with some very low points in government.
[01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:24.980]   You've been attacked quite a bit.
[01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:27.440]   One of the ones that stands out is the accusations
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:29.300]   of collusion with Russia.
[01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:33.140]   And you tell in the book, in general, this whole story,
[01:34:33.140 --> 01:34:34.600]   this whole journey on a personal level,
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:37.300]   on a sort of big political level.
[01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:39.300]   Can you tell me some aspects of this story?
[01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:42.860]   - Sure, so to give the listeners some context,
[01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:46.760]   and people remember this now, it's been kind of swept away
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:48.400]   because it turned out not to be true,
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:53.400]   was that after President Trump won the election in 2016,
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:55.960]   instead of the media saying, "Oh, we were wrong,"
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:59.300]   'cause again, everyone thought he had zero chance of winning,
[01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:00.840]   they said, "Okay, well, we couldn't have been wrong.
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:03.640]   "It must have been the Russians who worked with him."
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:06.200]   And so at first, when this started coming up,
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:07.380]   I thought this was ridiculous.
[01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:09.220]   I mean, I was very intimately involved
[01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:10.600]   with the operations of the campaign.
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:12.320]   I was running the finance of the campaign.
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:14.060]   I was running the digital media of the campaign.
[01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:18.600]   I was running the schedule for the campaign.
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:21.320]   And I knew that on most days we had trouble
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:23.520]   working, coordinating with ourselves,
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:26.680]   let alone collaborating with another government,
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:29.040]   and colluding, as they called it.
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:33.220]   And so we did a great job, I think,
[01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:35.760]   as an underdog campaign, very leanly staffed.
[01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:38.200]   And then they said that we were working with the Russians.
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:42.780]   And so at the time, I didn't take it too seriously
[01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:44.720]   because I knew there was no truth to it.
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:46.720]   But it was amazing to me to start seeing
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:49.440]   all of these institutions, whether it was CNN,
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:50.980]   The Washington Post, New York Times,
[01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:52.760]   these were news organizations that I grew up
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:54.660]   having a lot of respect for,
[01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:57.200]   taking these accusations so seriously,
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:58.720]   and then working themselves up
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:02.760]   in order to just cover it for two years.
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:04.420]   And then as a result, you had a special counsel,
[01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:07.760]   you had a House investigation, a Senate investigation.
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:10.220]   And I personally spent about, I think, over 20 hours
[01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:14.040]   just testifying before these different committees.
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:16.200]   Again, spent millions of dollars out of my own pocket
[01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:19.400]   on my legal fees to make sure I was well-represented.
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:22.120]   And the reason I did that was because I saw in Washington,
[01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:23.440]   it was like a sick game, right?
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:27.040]   It's almost like, even though there was no underlying
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:31.280]   problems to the accusation, I felt like this is one
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:33.500]   of those things where they're gonna try to catch you.
[01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:34.720]   And then if you step on the line,
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:36.320]   they catch you with one misrepresentation,
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:38.200]   they're gonna try to put you in jail or worst of,
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:39.240]   you know, bid, bid, bid.
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:42.560]   And so for me, that was a big concern.
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:44.160]   So, and it was amazing.
[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:47.680]   I mean, my poor mom, I told her to stop reading whatever,
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:49.320]   I said, "I promise you, we didn't do anything wrong,
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:50.160]   it's good."
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:52.880]   But she'd call me and say, "Well, our friends were
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:54.720]   on the Upper East Side, we're talking with Chuck Schumer,
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:56.280]   he says, 'Jared's going to jail.
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:58.000]   We know for sure that he colluded with the Russians."
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.520]   And this is like a leading senator saying things like this.
[01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:04.020]   And so it was just interesting for me to see how
[01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:07.940]   the whole world could believe something and be talking
[01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:12.020]   about it that I knew with 1000% certainty
[01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:13.500]   was just not true.
[01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:15.900]   And so seeing that play out was very, very hard.
[01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:18.300]   Obviously, you know, I was accused of a lot of things.
[01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:20.260]   There were times in Washington, I was radioactive.
[01:37:20.260 --> 01:37:24.340]   I remember one weekend, you know, it was all over CNN,
[01:37:24.340 --> 01:37:26.380]   you know, the people, the panels on CNN,
[01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:28.220]   like the news organization that I grew up thinking
[01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:31.780]   was like the number one trusted name for news in the world,
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:33.420]   talking about how I'd committed treason
[01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:35.280]   because I met with an ambassador and said,
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:38.300]   "We'd like to hear your perspective on what you think
[01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:41.420]   the policy should be in Syria, where there was a big
[01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:45.020]   civil war happening and ISIS and a lot of different things."
[01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:47.460]   So it was quite a crazy time in that regard.
[01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:50.060]   But luckily, again, we were able to fight through it.
[01:37:50.060 --> 01:37:53.180]   It was a major distraction for our administration.
[01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:54.780]   I think we were able to kind of stay focused
[01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:57.980]   on the objectives and the policies, but it was a crazy time.
[01:37:57.980 --> 01:38:00.740]   I learned a lot from that experience.
[01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:03.420]   - It's crazy how just an accusation can be viral
[01:38:03.420 --> 01:38:04.740]   and can just go.
[01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:08.140]   One of the things that worries me is the effect
[01:38:08.140 --> 01:38:10.180]   on your mind, the psychology of it,
[01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:11.780]   to make sure it doesn't make you cynical.
[01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:13.540]   Like people that are trying to do stuff,
[01:38:13.540 --> 01:38:15.740]   those kinds of stories that can destroy their mind.
[01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:18.360]   So one of the things I'd love to sort of understand,
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:21.420]   you kind of rolled in from the business world
[01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:25.300]   and all of a sudden, the entire world, from CNN
[01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:28.060]   to everybody's accusing you of colluding with the Russians.
[01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:31.220]   Like what do you, like when you're sitting at home,
[01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:34.580]   how do you keep a calm mind, a clear mind,
[01:38:34.580 --> 01:38:37.140]   an optimistic one that doesn't become cynical
[01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:38.700]   and actually just keep trying to push on
[01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:39.980]   and do stuff in the world?
[01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:42.040]   - So it was a surreal experience.
[01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:45.260]   I would say number one is I felt very confident
[01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:46.460]   that I hadn't done anything wrong.
[01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:48.900]   So I'd always tell my lawyer, like, you know,
[01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:50.780]   the good news is I've got a good fact problem, right?
[01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:52.340]   Like I need a good lawyer to get me through it,
[01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:54.220]   but it's much easier to be a good lawyer
[01:38:54.220 --> 01:38:55.600]   if you have a very innocent client.
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:58.980]   And so, you know, the fact that I knew that I didn't have,
[01:38:58.980 --> 01:39:02.780]   I didn't believe that I had any legal liability
[01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:05.680]   helped me kind of intellectually separate
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:08.540]   the challenge I needed to do to fight through it from it.
[01:39:08.540 --> 01:39:09.980]   And then I just basically said, like, you know,
[01:39:09.980 --> 01:39:11.460]   I'd had hardship earlier in my life
[01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:13.760]   where I dealt with the situation with my father.
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:16.220]   And what I realized there is that
[01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:18.500]   you can't really spend energy
[01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:20.740]   on the things that you don't control.
[01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:22.780]   All you can do is spend your time and energy
[01:39:22.780 --> 01:39:24.580]   worrying about what you can control,
[01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:27.740]   and then how do you react to the things that you have there?
[01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:30.820]   And so it took a lot of discipline.
[01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:32.180]   It took a lot of strength.
[01:39:32.180 --> 01:39:34.540]   Then again, I give my wife, Ivanka,
[01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:35.980]   and even Donald a lot of credit
[01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:39.220]   for kind of having my back during that time
[01:39:39.220 --> 01:39:42.340]   and encouraging me just to kind of fight through it.
[01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:43.960]   And then I also had to make sure
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:46.180]   that I didn't allow that to distract me from my job.
[01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:49.220]   I felt like I had an amazing opportunity in the White House
[01:39:49.220 --> 01:39:50.460]   to make a difference in the world.
[01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:53.040]   And if I would have spent all my time playing defense,
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:54.900]   you know, in politics, it's a time duration game.
[01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:56.620]   In business, you have whatever duration
[01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:58.060]   you set for yourself.
[01:39:58.060 --> 01:39:59.420]   In politics, it's time duration.
[01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:00.660]   We had four years.
[01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:03.420]   Every day was sand through an hourglass.
[01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:06.700]   My mindset was I need to accomplish as much as I can
[01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:08.140]   in these four years.
[01:40:08.140 --> 01:40:10.820]   And I guess the traditional game that's played in Washington
[01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:12.980]   is whether it's the media, the opposition,
[01:40:12.980 --> 01:40:15.940]   their job is to distract you and then try to stop you
[01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:18.060]   from being as successful as you wanna be.
[01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:19.460]   And so just fought through it.
[01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:23.180]   And it wasn't always fun, but we got through.
[01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:26.140]   And thank God it's something people don't talk about.
[01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:27.540]   And it has been amazing to me,
[01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:31.080]   just the lack of self-awareness and reflection
[01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:35.860]   of a lot of the people who hyped this up for two years.
[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:37.420]   They don't think there was anything wrong with it.
[01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:41.820]   And that's interesting, but my view is we got through it.
[01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:43.140]   It's good, so it's in the past.
[01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:45.040]   And then I started moving to the future,
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:46.340]   and that's really where I spent my time.
[01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:47.700]   - Yeah, but I wanna linger on it
[01:40:47.700 --> 01:40:52.180]   because to me that has a really discouraging effect
[01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:54.260]   on anyone who's trying to do positive in the world.
[01:40:54.260 --> 01:40:56.420]   Like these kinds of attacks are intense.
[01:40:56.420 --> 01:40:57.260]   - Yeah.
[01:40:57.260 --> 01:40:59.380]   - I mean, you say kind of one of the lessons you learned
[01:40:59.380 --> 01:41:01.400]   is that you really have to be perfect,
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:03.780]   but I hate that to be the lesson.
[01:41:03.780 --> 01:41:06.460]   Like I feel like you should be able to do stupid stuff,
[01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:10.820]   take big risks, and like people celebrate the big risks
[01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:14.540]   and not try to weave gigantic stories over nothing.
[01:41:14.540 --> 01:41:18.740]   I just wanna kind of understand the two aspects of this,
[01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:23.740]   how to not have such stories have so much legs,
[01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:26.540]   and the other is how to stay psychologically strong.
[01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:27.580]   So you kind of waved it off
[01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:29.900]   that you didn't have a fact problem,
[01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:32.580]   but it can just have an effect on your psyche.
[01:41:32.580 --> 01:41:33.420]   - Yeah.
[01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:34.460]   - You seem to be pretty stoic about the whole thing,
[01:41:34.460 --> 01:41:37.540]   but like how, I mean, just on the psychology side,
[01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:42.540]   how did you stay calm and not become cynical
[01:41:43.540 --> 01:41:47.300]   where you can continue to do stuff and take big risks?
[01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:48.780]   - I didn't have a choice.
[01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:49.620]   - What do you mean?
[01:41:49.620 --> 01:41:51.780]   - I mean, I could have spent every day feeling sorry
[01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:54.440]   for myself or complaining or saying things aren't fair,
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:58.500]   but the general way I looked at it was that in life,
[01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:01.940]   every opportunity has a cost, and you could look at it
[01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:03.940]   and say maybe this was a massive cost,
[01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:06.820]   either in dollars or in time or in reputation
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:11.820]   or in emotional drain, but you could also say
[01:42:12.780 --> 01:42:15.900]   that I had an opportunity to work in the White House
[01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:17.180]   and I had an opportunity to work
[01:42:17.180 --> 01:42:18.980]   on some of the hardest challenges.
[01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:20.740]   You talk about how that's not celebrated.
[01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:21.960]   That is something very different.
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:24.360]   In the private sector, when you take on big challenges,
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:25.220]   that is celebrated.
[01:42:25.220 --> 01:42:27.540]   In government, when you take on big challenges,
[01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:30.260]   people wanna see it fail or they wanna criticize
[01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:32.340]   those people who are trying to take that on,
[01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:35.020]   and I think that's wrong, and I think that as a country,
[01:42:35.020 --> 01:42:37.140]   we should be thinking big, we should be dreaming big,
[01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:39.340]   and we should be encouraging our politicians
[01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:43.660]   to try and to fail more and to go and to take on big things
[01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:44.740]   knowing that there's risk of failing.
[01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:46.580]   Obviously, we want them to succeed, not to fail,
[01:42:46.580 --> 01:42:48.420]   but let's take on the big things.
[01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:49.560]   Let's try to do that.
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:55.280]   So I think it's just very basic that you're in a situation.
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:56.120]   I've made decisions.
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:58.500]   I can't go back and change decisions in the past.
[01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:01.580]   I still felt very blessed to be in the position I was in,
[01:43:01.580 --> 01:43:03.220]   and I knew that I just had to work through it,
[01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:06.020]   and like I said, I was very lucky to have support
[01:43:06.020 --> 01:43:09.260]   from my wife and from my family and from good friends.
[01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:11.700]   Again, I think I'd chosen very good friends in life,
[01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:13.100]   and my friends were with me.
[01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:16.500]   I had one friend who, my lowest moment,
[01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:18.100]   got on the plane, he lived in Arizona,
[01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:19.880]   got on a plane and came just to have dinner with me
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:21.620]   to say, "Just pick your head up.
[01:43:21.620 --> 01:43:22.660]   "I know you're down now.
[01:43:22.660 --> 01:43:23.560]   "You're gonna be fine.
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:25.100]   "Just fight through."
[01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:28.060]   That meant a lot to me, and again, I always think
[01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:30.780]   in my life, you don't learn as much from your successes.
[01:43:30.780 --> 01:43:32.460]   You don't learn as much from your high points.
[01:43:32.460 --> 01:43:35.460]   You learn the most about who you wanna be
[01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:37.620]   and how the world works from your lowest moments,
[01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:40.540]   and at those lowest moments, it just, it made me better,
[01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:42.780]   and it taught me how to be a better friend
[01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:44.740]   to people who are in tough situations,
[01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:47.960]   and I tried to just get tougher,
[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:50.460]   and I tried to just get better and work through it.
[01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:52.340]   - Yeah, you said that you and Ivanka,
[01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:56.100]   this intense time brought you two together
[01:43:56.100 --> 01:44:00.380]   and helped you kind of deal with the intensity
[01:44:00.380 --> 01:44:01.700]   of the chaos of it all.
[01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:03.440]   - So I think it was just number one,
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:05.140]   knowing that you had a partner and knowing
[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:07.900]   that you had somebody who loved you and believed in you.
[01:44:07.900 --> 01:44:10.940]   I think that was definitely by far the biggest of anything.
[01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:12.060]   - Love is the answer.
[01:44:12.060 --> 01:44:15.420]   - Love is very important, but then there's also a lot
[01:44:15.420 --> 01:44:18.500]   that I've learned from her, always getting me
[01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:20.940]   to read different books or learn different things,
[01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:23.180]   which I love, but she's also, I think,
[01:44:23.180 --> 01:44:25.760]   an amazing role model, and I go through our time
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:28.860]   in Washington where there were so many people
[01:44:28.860 --> 01:44:33.860]   who were, I thought, very nasty to her unfoundedly,
[01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:35.340]   and I'm not talking about individually,
[01:44:35.340 --> 01:44:37.620]   'cause again, most people interacted with her
[01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:41.300]   were super kind, but I would see people on Twitter
[01:44:41.300 --> 01:44:42.580]   or different places go after her,
[01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:43.700]   and she always stayed elegant,
[01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:46.000]   and I felt like that was something
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.740]   that she never stooped down to a lower level.
[01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:51.080]   She kept her elegance the whole time,
[01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:53.700]   and she really went to Washington
[01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:55.020]   wanting to be a force of good,
[01:44:55.020 --> 01:44:58.180]   and I see all the time that she follows her heart,
[01:44:58.180 --> 01:45:03.020]   she does what's right, and she has a very strong
[01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:05.420]   moral compass, and I feel very lucky
[01:45:05.420 --> 01:45:08.300]   to have her as a partner, and I respect her tremendously.
[01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:10.500]   - Yeah, she walks through the fire with grace,
[01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:13.260]   I would say, and she's recommended
[01:45:13.260 --> 01:45:14.460]   a bunch of amazing books to me,
[01:45:14.460 --> 01:45:17.540]   and she has an incredible, a fascinating mind,
[01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:19.860]   but one thing that jumped out to me
[01:45:19.860 --> 01:45:23.460]   is you both love diners, Jersey diners,
[01:45:23.460 --> 01:45:25.700]   so I lived in Philly for a while,
[01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:28.540]   and I've traveled quite a bit,
[01:45:28.540 --> 01:45:30.540]   and traveling from Boston down to Philly,
[01:45:30.540 --> 01:45:33.060]   maybe to DC, you can drive through Jersey.
[01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:35.700]   There's something about Jersey, I don't know what it is.
[01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:36.620]   - It's the best.
[01:45:36.620 --> 01:45:38.660]   - You listen to Bruce Springsteen,
[01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:40.660]   Louis C.K. has this bit where,
[01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:44.100]   I think it's part of criticizing cell phones today
[01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:45.500]   where people are too much on their phone,
[01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:48.180]   they don't just sit there, be bored,
[01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:51.900]   but he uses that story to tell where he's just driving,
[01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:54.340]   and a Bruce Springsteen song comes on,
[01:45:54.340 --> 01:45:56.340]   and he just wants to pull over to the side of the road
[01:45:56.340 --> 01:45:59.480]   and just weep for unexplainable reason,
[01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:04.980]   and I think that's true, 'cause life is difficult.
[01:46:04.980 --> 01:46:07.820]   Life is full of suffering or struggle or challenges,
[01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:10.420]   so sometimes, it's always Bruce Springsteen,
[01:46:10.420 --> 01:46:12.420]   but some kind of song like this
[01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:14.860]   can really make you reflect on life,
[01:46:14.860 --> 01:46:16.180]   that melancholy feeling,
[01:46:16.180 --> 01:46:18.740]   but that melancholy feeling is the other side
[01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:20.560]   of the happiness coin,
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:23.760]   where if you just allow yourself to feel that pain,
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:27.860]   you can also feel the highest joys,
[01:46:27.860 --> 01:46:29.940]   that's sort of the point Louis C.K. makes,
[01:46:29.940 --> 01:46:32.420]   and there's something about Jersey with the diners,
[01:46:32.420 --> 01:46:33.760]   often late at night,
[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:37.060]   that there's several diner experiences, I should say, okay?
[01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:39.420]   There's the family-friendly, there's a nice waitress,
[01:46:39.420 --> 01:46:41.740]   and there's a sweetness, a kindness,
[01:46:41.740 --> 01:46:44.460]   like, "Hello, sweetheart," that kind of thing.
[01:46:44.460 --> 01:46:46.660]   There's also the 3 a.m. diner,
[01:46:46.660 --> 01:46:49.620]   where you're, the ones that are open 24 hours,
[01:46:49.620 --> 01:46:52.320]   that has a romantic element when you're a young man
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:54.500]   or young woman, you're traveling,
[01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:57.440]   the loneliness of that, just all of it.
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:00.280]   The American diner is like,
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:03.740]   from like Jack Kerouac on, represents something.
[01:47:03.740 --> 01:47:04.720]   I'm not sure what that is,
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:08.040]   but it's like a real beautiful experience,
[01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:09.720]   and the food itself too.
[01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:11.120]   - Oh, always fresh, yeah.
[01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:13.640]   The thing with diners, there's so much to love about 'em,
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:15.640]   and I grew up, obviously, in New Jersey,
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:18.520]   when I'd go with my father to business,
[01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:20.600]   he'd always stop, we'd eat at a diner,
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:22.200]   late night I'd be coming back with my friends,
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:23.240]   we'd stop at a diner,
[01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:25.920]   and it's a tradition that Ivanka and I love doing as well,
[01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:28.360]   and I think there's a notion of,
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:30.400]   it's very egalitarian in that,
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:32.920]   people from all places are there,
[01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:34.640]   you could order basically whatever you want,
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:37.880]   I mean, the menus at the diners look like the phone book,
[01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:40.720]   and it's amazing how they keep so much fresh ingredients
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:42.520]   to do it, at least the good ones do.
[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:45.160]   I love, as a Jersey guy, that you get mozzarella sticks
[01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:48.000]   and an omelet at any hour of the day,
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:49.580]   'cause most of 'em are open 24 hours,
[01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:52.160]   and that's basically, Ivanka, my go-to,
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:54.420]   we'll throw in a milkshake or two as well.
[01:47:54.420 --> 01:47:57.280]   But for me as a kid, my father would take me,
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:47:58.760]   sometimes I'd sit with him in the meeting,
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:00.920]   sometimes I'd be at the table next to him,
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:03.380]   he'd give me a bunch of quarters to put in the music machine
[01:48:03.380 --> 01:48:05.360]   that they would have on the wall,
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:07.760]   and it was always just a great experience doing it.
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:10.800]   In Jersey, and I joke that if you grew up in Jersey,
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:13.000]   you grew up with just enough of a chip on your shoulder
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.080]   that you have to go and make something of yourself in life,
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:18.720]   it's a special place, I had an amazing childhood there,
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:20.800]   and very, very proud to be from the state,
[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:22.840]   and I will just give a little bit of a plug now,
[01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:25.740]   because the state has now actually turned the corner,
[01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:28.780]   and they had a $10 billion budget surplus for many years,
[01:48:28.780 --> 01:48:32.000]   it was a state that was basically bankrupt,
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:35.600]   and now actually under a pretty progressive
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:38.060]   Democrat governor, Phil Murphy,
[01:48:38.060 --> 01:48:39.140]   he's turned the state around,
[01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:41.900]   and it actually has a very bright future ahead,
[01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:44.540]   and it's probably one of the best places
[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:45.980]   to raise a family in the country, right?
[01:48:45.980 --> 01:48:47.180]   It's got very low crime,
[01:48:47.180 --> 01:48:49.940]   one of the best public school systems in the country,
[01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:52.520]   pretty good healthcare system, a lot of green parks,
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:55.060]   people know the Turnpike, but it's got a lot to it,
[01:48:55.060 --> 01:48:57.340]   that's really great, so I'm a big, big fan of Jersey.
[01:48:57.340 --> 01:49:00.460]   - I like how this is a first for this particular podcast,
[01:49:00.460 --> 01:49:03.460]   you literally gave a plug to a state.
[01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:04.940]   So New Jersey, everybody.
[01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:07.300]   - It's where it's at.
[01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:08.900]   - There's South Jersey, there's North Jersey,
[01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:10.700]   I mean, there's all kinds of Jerseys too,
[01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:13.980]   I mean, the whole thing, it just, I--
[01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:15.900]   - And don't get me started on the Jersey Shore, Lex,
[01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:16.740]   that's-- - Jersey Shore is a whole thing.
[01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:18.460]   - And I'm not talking about the snooky part,
[01:49:18.460 --> 01:49:20.220]   I'm talking about the real nice parts,
[01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:21.820]   where you have great food, great people.
[01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:24.460]   - I mean, nice parts, it's all beautiful,
[01:49:24.460 --> 01:49:27.740]   the full range of human characters
[01:49:27.740 --> 01:49:29.900]   that are in New Jersey are all beautiful.
[01:49:29.900 --> 01:49:30.740]   - I agree with that.
[01:49:30.740 --> 01:49:32.820]   - And every time I travel across the world,
[01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:34.620]   there's always, I meet somebody from New Jersey
[01:49:34.620 --> 01:49:37.620]   and you kinda give a nod of deep understanding.
[01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:39.980]   It's the cradle of civilization, okay.
[01:49:39.980 --> 01:49:41.900]   So back, I don't know how we got there,
[01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:45.020]   oh, all right, going back to the low points,
[01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:48.300]   you mentioned your father, if we could just return there,
[01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:53.300]   even just the personal story of your father
[01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:58.100]   that you write about, that other betrayal
[01:49:58.100 --> 01:49:59.180]   that happened in his life,
[01:49:59.180 --> 01:50:01.420]   and then how he responds to that betrayal,
[01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:03.780]   and he was, after that, arrested,
[01:50:03.780 --> 01:50:05.740]   can you just tell the story?
[01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:08.940]   - Sure, so my father is an amazing person,
[01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:11.020]   and we grew up in New Jersey,
[01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:14.440]   my father was a big developer, a great entrepreneur,
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:15.960]   built an amazing business.
[01:50:16.900 --> 01:50:20.500]   He got into a dispute with two of his siblings,
[01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:21.980]   and through that dispute,
[01:50:21.980 --> 01:50:24.900]   they basically took all of the documents in his company,
[01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:26.960]   went to the US Attorney's Office,
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:31.420]   and turned from a civil dispute
[01:50:31.420 --> 01:50:33.900]   into a real public dispute.
[01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:36.900]   My father did something wrong in that process,
[01:50:36.900 --> 01:50:39.580]   and when he got arrested for that,
[01:50:39.580 --> 01:50:41.660]   he basically said, "You know what, what I did was wrong,"
[01:50:41.660 --> 01:50:44.940]   and he took his medicine, and he did it like a man,
[01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:46.380]   and he said, "I'm gonna go to prison,"
[01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:47.860]   and he did that for a year.
[01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:52.380]   And so, for me, that was a very challenging time
[01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:54.100]   in the family, obviously.
[01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:57.400]   It was a shock, it was a total change.
[01:50:57.400 --> 01:50:59.820]   I mean, I grew up, my childhood was,
[01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:01.300]   I think, a very nice childhood.
[01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:04.700]   My parents always said, "Do good in school, work hard."
[01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:07.460]   I was very focused on my athletics,
[01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:08.780]   I was captain of the basketball team,
[01:51:08.780 --> 01:51:10.980]   I was captain of the hockey team,
[01:51:10.980 --> 01:51:12.300]   I ran a marathon with my father,
[01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:13.500]   and it was always about pursuing.
[01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:15.940]   Went to Harvard, graduated with honors,
[01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:18.460]   and then was in NYU pursuing a law degree
[01:51:18.460 --> 01:51:20.180]   and a business degree.
[01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:21.420]   And I was working at the Manhattan District
[01:51:21.420 --> 01:51:22.620]   Attorney's Office at the time,
[01:51:22.620 --> 01:51:25.940]   actually thinking I wanted to go into public service,
[01:51:25.940 --> 01:51:27.100]   'cause my father always taught us,
[01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:28.860]   we were always surrounded by politicians,
[01:51:28.860 --> 01:51:32.180]   and he always said, "My parents came to America,
[01:51:32.180 --> 01:51:34.660]   "they lived in the land of opportunity,
[01:51:34.660 --> 01:51:36.520]   "and they had these opportunities
[01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:38.680]   "because this is the best country in the world,
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:41.580]   "and so you should be successful, work hard,
[01:51:41.580 --> 01:51:43.780]   "don't ever let your opportunities
[01:51:43.780 --> 01:51:45.040]   "become your disadvantages,
[01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:46.560]   "because you have advantages in life,
[01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:47.500]   "you have to work harder."
[01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:49.480]   And that's what he instilled in myself and my brother,
[01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:52.640]   and he always pushed us to make the most of ourselves.
[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:55.220]   And when we did that,
[01:51:55.220 --> 01:51:59.860]   everything changed overnight when my father got arrested.
[01:51:59.860 --> 01:52:01.900]   Obviously, it's very embarrassing for a family
[01:52:01.900 --> 01:52:03.460]   when you're on the front page of the papers.
[01:52:03.460 --> 01:52:06.240]   I would see the newspapers writing all these things
[01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:09.580]   about my father that I didn't think were representative
[01:52:09.580 --> 01:52:11.820]   of the person that I knew.
[01:52:12.660 --> 01:52:15.680]   It was a big change for our family.
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:17.480]   And I was angry, I was angry.
[01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:19.800]   I said I could be angry at the prosecutor,
[01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:22.360]   I could be angry at my father's brother,
[01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:24.000]   I could be angry at my father's lawyers,
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.680]   I could be angry at my father for making this mistake.
[01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:31.040]   And then I said, "That's not gonna change anything."
[01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:33.680]   And I had a real shift, and I do think
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:35.360]   that that was a turning point in my life
[01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:37.260]   where I basically said,
[01:52:37.260 --> 01:52:39.420]   "Let me focus on the things I can control,
[01:52:39.420 --> 01:52:42.040]   "let me focus on the positive things I can do."
[01:52:42.040 --> 01:52:43.400]   And from that moment forward, I said,
[01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:45.100]   "How can I be a great son to my father?
[01:52:45.100 --> 01:52:49.120]   "How could I be a great older brother/substitute father
[01:52:49.120 --> 01:52:51.560]   "for my two sisters and my younger brother?
[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:52.860]   "How could I be there for my mother?
[01:52:52.860 --> 01:52:55.220]   "How could I be there for my father's business?"
[01:52:55.220 --> 01:52:57.360]   And I just went into battle mode,
[01:52:57.360 --> 01:53:01.800]   and I put my armor on and I just ran into it.
[01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:05.060]   And for the next two years, every day was painful.
[01:53:05.060 --> 01:53:06.020]   I mean, I was dealing with banks,
[01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:08.060]   I was dealing with the company who still had subpoenas.
[01:53:08.060 --> 01:53:08.960]   I was still in law school.
[01:53:08.960 --> 01:53:10.880]   I tell my father I wanted to drop out
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:11.920]   of law school and business school,
[01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:12.880]   but he said, "Please don't."
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:16.040]   So I would basically go to law school one day a week,
[01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:17.480]   or maybe I'd skip it most days,
[01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:18.720]   and I'd go to his office every day.
[01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:20.080]   And my friends would joke
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:21.920]   that if my professors wanted to fail me,
[01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:24.660]   the law professor would have to give me a test
[01:53:24.660 --> 01:53:25.940]   that had four pictures and say,
[01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:27.560]   "Circle who your professor is."
[01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:28.880]   But I would basically take a week off,
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:32.260]   I'd read the books, and I did well, and I got my degrees.
[01:53:32.260 --> 01:53:34.600]   And it was just a very, very challenging time.
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:36.380]   But like I said to you before,
[01:53:36.380 --> 01:53:38.920]   is that you learn the most about life,
[01:53:38.920 --> 01:53:42.240]   and you learn the most about humanity and yourself
[01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:44.000]   when you're in your most challenging periods.
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:48.320]   And I'll say that that experience also changed
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:49.720]   the people I interacted with.
[01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:51.260]   Spending weekends with my father
[01:53:51.260 --> 01:53:52.960]   down in a prison in Alabama,
[01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:56.120]   I met the other inmates, I met their families.
[01:53:56.120 --> 01:53:58.800]   I spent time then trying to advise
[01:53:58.800 --> 01:53:59.960]   the children of other people
[01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:01.520]   who were going through the same experience
[01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:05.320]   that I'd gone through on how to navigate it correctly.
[01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:06.920]   And you just learn a lot about the world,
[01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:09.200]   and you see that in life,
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:10.560]   everything could get taken from you,
[01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:12.560]   your status, your money, your friends.
[01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:16.160]   I saw that certain people were very disloyal
[01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:18.480]   to my father at the time, who he thought were friends.
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:20.500]   It was only a handful, but again,
[01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:21.480]   I learned from those people,
[01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:23.420]   how can I be a true friend to people?
[01:54:23.420 --> 01:54:25.040]   How can I be better?
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:29.080]   And I learned a tremendous amount through that experience.
[01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:30.960]   - You write that your father told you,
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:33.880]   while being humble, I'd love to ask you about this,
[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:36.000]   that in life sometimes we get so powerful
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:39.960]   that we start to think we're the dealers of our own fate.
[01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:42.480]   We're not the dealers, God is the dealer.
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:44.520]   Sometimes we have to be brought back down to earth
[01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:47.000]   to get perspective on what is really important.
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:48.400]   What do you think he meant by that?
[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:51.080]   What did you learn from that experience?
[01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:52.600]   - The way I interpreted it at the time,
[01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:54.680]   and those were very, very memorable words,
[01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:56.520]   and it occurred, I was down,
[01:54:56.520 --> 01:54:58.920]   after I picked up my father from the arraignment,
[01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:00.960]   I drove him down, I drove the car,
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:03.400]   and my father and I were very, very close,
[01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:05.280]   and he didn't say a word for the whole time.
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:08.720]   And I think he was processing, number one,
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:12.180]   what was happening to him, and I couldn't even imagine,
[01:55:12.180 --> 01:55:14.240]   but I actually think the bigger pain for him,
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:17.600]   because my father is such a committed person to the family,
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:19.400]   is like, did I let my family down?
[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:20.560]   Did I let my kids down?
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:22.640]   And I do think he felt at that moment
[01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:24.140]   like his life was over.
[01:55:24.140 --> 01:55:25.920]   He couldn't really see past
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:28.720]   what this challenge was gonna bring,
[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:30.840]   and if there would be a life for him after it.
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:33.360]   So I could see that he had a lot of fear,
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:34.640]   and he really wasn't saying much.
[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:36.800]   And then I didn't know what to do,
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:39.640]   and so I just stood by him and stood close.
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:44.640]   And later that day, or the next day,
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:46.240]   he got up and started walking.
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:47.200]   He had an ankle monitor.
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:50.240]   For whatever reason, the prosecutor was so aggressive,
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:51.080]   he was a flight risk,
[01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:52.440]   so they made him wear an ankle monitor.
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:54.120]   They were very, very aggressive and nasty.
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:56.360]   And at the time, my father was the biggest donor
[01:55:56.360 --> 01:55:58.480]   to Democrats, the prosecutor was a Republican.
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:00.480]   It was a very political thing.
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:04.720]   And what happened was is he was walking around the pool,
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:05.880]   and I just started walking with him.
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:07.960]   And he said to me, "Jared, in life,
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:09.560]   "sometimes we get so powerful
[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:12.280]   "that we believe that we're the dealer."
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:13.120]   He says, "But we're not the dealer.
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:15.960]   "God's the dealer, and we have to come down to earth
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:17.320]   "to understand," like you said.
[01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:20.200]   So what I took from that was that my father,
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:23.840]   with all of his success, had started to believe
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:28.200]   that maybe certain rules didn't apply to him.
[01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:30.600]   And I think that that's where he made a mistake.
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:32.840]   And I think he had a lot of regret that he made the mistake.
[01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:35.080]   And my father is a very humble person.
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:37.280]   He's a very moral person.
[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:39.740]   For me, with my humility, my brother and I joke
[01:56:39.740 --> 01:56:41.600]   that we give our credit for being humble,
[01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:42.880]   number one, to being Mets fans,
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:45.200]   because every year you have a lot of promise,
[01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:46.640]   and then it never ends up paying off,
[01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:47.660]   although now with Steve Cohen,
[01:56:47.660 --> 01:56:49.680]   hopefully we're on a different trajectory.
[01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:51.240]   But the other thing is also our mother.
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:55.600]   Our mother really raised us to be very humble,
[01:56:57.880 --> 01:57:00.120]   and we knew we had a lot, but every Sunday morning,
[01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:01.640]   my mom was there clipping the coupons.
[01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:04.600]   The cereal we ate in our house was based on,
[01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:08.400]   it was based on what was on sale versus what we liked.
[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:10.480]   When we would have a problem with our teachers in school,
[01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:12.120]   and I'd say, "Well, the teacher doesn't like me,"
[01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:13.300]   she'd say, "Well, I'm not calling them.
[01:57:13.300 --> 01:57:15.440]   "It's your job to make the teacher like you."
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:18.040]   And so my mother gave us a lot of that.
[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:20.720]   My father gave us a lot of the grounding.
[01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:24.960]   And I think during that time, my father was just realizing
[01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:28.160]   that maybe he had gotten disconnected
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:31.980]   from the grounding and the values.
[01:57:31.980 --> 01:57:33.960]   And again, I think he also accepted,
[01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:35.920]   maybe he could have blamed others
[01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:37.200]   for acting inappropriately,
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:40.760]   but I respect the fact that he took responsibility himself
[01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:43.640]   and said, "I can't control the actions of other people.
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:46.060]   "I can't control what they do is right and wrong.
[01:57:46.060 --> 01:57:47.980]   "I can just control my actions."
[01:57:47.980 --> 01:57:51.500]   And as I go on the next journeys in my life,
[01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:53.420]   and I go to government, I go to Washington,
[01:57:53.420 --> 01:57:55.400]   I mean, I even think through the craziness
[01:57:55.400 --> 01:57:58.160]   of going from visiting my father in a prison
[01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:01.200]   to 10 years later, sitting in the office in the White House
[01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:03.280]   next to the President of the United States.
[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:05.720]   And I think about that story
[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:08.240]   and that it's a story that only God could write.
[01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:10.880]   And I really believe that you have to have a lot of faith
[01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:15.880]   because the lows and the highs are both so extreme
[01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:20.320]   and unbelievable that I feel like those low moments
[01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:22.520]   in some ways allowed me to keep my grounding
[01:58:22.520 --> 01:58:25.700]   and to understand what was truly important in life
[01:58:25.700 --> 01:58:28.500]   for when I ended up going through those other moments.
[01:58:28.500 --> 01:58:32.220]   - Your father was betrayed, perhaps over money by siblings.
[01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:37.060]   Is there some deeper wisdom you can draw from that?
[01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:39.140]   Have you seen money or perhaps power
[01:58:39.140 --> 01:58:41.060]   cloud people's judgment?
[01:58:41.060 --> 01:58:43.920]   - Oh, 100%, 100%.
[01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:48.920]   - Is there some kind of optimistic thing you can take
[01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:52.580]   from that about human nature of how to escape
[01:58:52.580 --> 01:58:56.780]   that clouding of judgment when you're talking about leaders,
[01:58:56.780 --> 01:59:01.520]   when you're talking about government, even business?
[01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:04.460]   'Cause you mentioned there's a power dynamics at play always
[01:59:04.460 --> 01:59:06.340]   when you're negotiating.
[01:59:06.340 --> 01:59:09.740]   Is there a way to see the common humanity
[01:59:09.740 --> 01:59:13.300]   and not see the sort of will to power in the whole thing?
[01:59:13.300 --> 01:59:17.340]   - Definitely, you mentioned about power, money corrupting.
[01:59:17.340 --> 01:59:19.480]   There's a great quote I heard a friend of mine say.
[01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:22.440]   It's a guy, Michael Harris, who was one of the founders
[01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:23.400]   of Death Row Records.
[01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:26.000]   And he was being interviewed recently
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.720]   and they asked him about what happened with Shook Knight.
[01:59:28.720 --> 01:59:32.040]   And his line was, "Money just makes you more
[01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:33.560]   "of what you already are,"
[01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:35.800]   which I thought was a very elegant way of saying it.
[01:59:35.800 --> 01:59:39.440]   And I would see this time and time again in the White House
[01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:41.440]   where you had people who were now given
[01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:44.840]   a lot of responsibility and power and it went to their head
[01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:49.840]   and they acted very crazily and maybe didn't act in a way
[01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:53.580]   that I thought was always conducive to the objective.
[01:59:53.580 --> 01:59:57.460]   So I think it's a very big problem that you have.
[01:59:57.460 --> 01:59:59.440]   Whether it's something that's solvable,
[01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:01.020]   I think it's about having the right leaders
[02:00:01.020 --> 02:00:03.100]   and hopefully for the leaders, having good friends.
[02:00:03.100 --> 02:00:05.180]   I mean, I'm still friends with a lot of the people
[02:00:05.180 --> 02:00:06.900]   I interacted with when I was in government.
[02:00:06.900 --> 02:00:09.540]   And the number one thing I try to be to them
[02:00:09.540 --> 02:00:10.380]   is just a good friend.
[02:00:10.380 --> 02:00:13.420]   I try to be somebody who they can talk about things with.
[02:00:13.420 --> 02:00:15.080]   I don't go in trying to tell them what to do
[02:00:15.080 --> 02:00:16.080]   on different things.
[02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:19.600]   And I think that that's a big thing
[02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:22.240]   is that people just need friends and they need conversation.
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:24.360]   And if they have that, then hopefully that allows them
[02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:26.920]   to keep their head in the right place.
[02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:30.480]   - I think this is a good place to ask
[02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:34.000]   about one aspect of the fascinating work you've done,
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.940]   which is on prison reform.
[02:00:35.940 --> 02:00:37.340]   Can you take me through your journey
[02:00:37.340 --> 02:00:42.120]   of helping the bipartisan bill get passed?
[02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:44.960]   Just working on prison reform in the White House in general,
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:47.720]   how you made that happen, how you help make that happen.
[02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:48.600]   - Sure.
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:52.220]   So we passed a law called the First Step Act,
[02:00:52.220 --> 02:00:56.320]   which was the largest prison and criminal justice reform bill
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:59.760]   that's been done maybe in 30, 40, 50 years in the US.
[02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:02.840]   And so what it basically did was two things.
[02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:05.780]   Number one is it took the prison system
[02:01:05.780 --> 02:01:08.200]   and it took a certain class of offenders
[02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:11.600]   and allowed them to become eligible for earlier release
[02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:14.280]   if they go through the certain trainings
[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:17.120]   that will allow them to have a lower probability
[02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:17.960]   of going back.
[02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:21.080]   So stepping back, you look at the prison system,
[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:22.160]   you say, what's the purpose?
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:23.680]   Is it to punish?
[02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:24.800]   Is it to warehouse?
[02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:26.400]   Is it to rehabilitate?
[02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:28.040]   And I do think that we're a country
[02:01:28.040 --> 02:01:29.400]   that believes in second chances.
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:33.680]   I saw firsthand when my father was a client of the system,
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:36.840]   how inefficient it was and how much better it could be.
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:38.880]   And when my father got out,
[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:40.520]   we didn't run from that experience.
[02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:42.680]   We started hiring people from Rikers Island
[02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:45.560]   and different prisons into the company
[02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:47.600]   into a second chance program,
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:49.440]   which we're very, very proud of doing.
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:51.800]   And what we saw through our micro experience
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:54.360]   was that if you give people mentorship,
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:56.260]   if you give them job training,
[02:01:56.260 --> 02:01:59.720]   a lot of people leave, they have addiction issues
[02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:00.800]   and they can't find housing.
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:04.520]   And so people leave prison with a criminal record
[02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:07.400]   and they're less likely to go back
[02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:10.280]   and reintegrate in society without help
[02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:15.240]   from different institutions that can help them do that.
[02:02:15.240 --> 02:02:17.800]   So we modeled the reforms off of what they did in Texas
[02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:19.560]   and Georgia and other states
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:21.560]   where they basically put a lot of job training,
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:25.120]   alcohol and addiction treatment programs in the prisons
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:28.900]   as a way to incentivize the prisoners to work on themselves
[02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:31.040]   while they're there in order to allow them
[02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:32.920]   to reenter society.
[02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:34.620]   It's turned out to be very successful so far.
[02:02:34.620 --> 02:02:36.640]   They just had a report that showed that
[02:02:36.760 --> 02:02:41.200]   the general population has had a 47% recidivism rate,
[02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:43.280]   meaning that people who leave federal prison,
[02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:44.640]   half of them go back
[02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:46.480]   and people who have now taken this program,
[02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:48.020]   only 12% of them go back.
[02:02:48.020 --> 02:02:50.600]   So number one, you're making communities safer
[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:52.800]   because if people are gonna now get a job
[02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:55.040]   and enter society instead of committing future crimes,
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:56.760]   you're avoiding future crimes.
[02:02:56.760 --> 02:03:00.680]   And number two, you're giving people a second chance at life.
[02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:02.240]   And so that was the first part of it.
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:05.180]   The second thing we did was there was a rule passed
[02:03:05.180 --> 02:03:10.180]   in the '90s that basically penalized crack cocaine
[02:03:10.180 --> 02:03:14.780]   at a hundred times the penalty of what regular cocaine was.
[02:03:14.780 --> 02:03:16.700]   And I think a lot of the motivations
[02:03:16.700 --> 02:03:18.560]   what people say in retrospect
[02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:20.660]   was that crack was more of a black drug
[02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:22.560]   and cocaine was more of a white drug.
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:24.840]   And so there was a really racial disparity
[02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:28.020]   in terms of what the application of these sentences were.
[02:03:28.020 --> 02:03:32.400]   So they then revised that to make it 18 to one.
[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:33.720]   And what we did in this bill
[02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:35.540]   is we allowed it to go retroactive
[02:03:35.540 --> 02:03:38.820]   to allow people who were in prison with sentences
[02:03:38.820 --> 02:03:41.860]   under what we thought was the racist law
[02:03:41.860 --> 02:03:43.920]   to be able to make an application to a judge
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:44.980]   in order to be dismissed.
[02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:46.680]   And it was based on good behavior,
[02:03:46.680 --> 02:03:50.020]   being rehabilitated and the fact
[02:03:50.020 --> 02:03:51.420]   that they would have a low probability
[02:03:51.420 --> 02:03:52.880]   of offending in the future.
[02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:54.300]   And so that was really the meat of it.
[02:03:54.300 --> 02:03:56.260]   And there was a couple other things in there we did as well,
[02:03:56.260 --> 02:03:58.300]   which were also quite good.
[02:03:58.300 --> 02:04:01.300]   So we did it, worked very closely
[02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:03.920]   with the Democrats, Republicans to do it.
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:06.200]   At first, President Trump was a little bit skeptical of it
[02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:09.480]   because he's a big, strong law and order supporter,
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:11.000]   but he made me work very hard
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:14.480]   to put together a coalition of Republicans and Democrats
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:15.480]   and law enforcement.
[02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:19.680]   We had the support from the policemen,
[02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:21.560]   we had the support from the ACLU,
[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:23.320]   and ultimately we were able to get it together.
[02:04:23.320 --> 02:04:24.880]   And it was an amazing thing.
[02:04:24.880 --> 02:04:26.980]   We ended up getting 87 votes in the Senate.
[02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:31.060]   This happened for me at a time,
[02:04:31.060 --> 02:04:34.980]   while the Russia investigation stuff was still happening,
[02:04:34.980 --> 02:04:36.940]   a new chief of staff came in, John Kelly,
[02:04:36.940 --> 02:04:39.840]   he basically marginalized me and the operations.
[02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:42.220]   So I had kind of less day-to-day responsibilities
[02:04:42.220 --> 02:04:43.300]   in the White House.
[02:04:43.300 --> 02:04:45.140]   And so for me, this effort became
[02:04:45.140 --> 02:04:46.380]   one of my full-time efforts
[02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:49.300]   along with negotiating the Mexico trade deal
[02:04:49.300 --> 02:04:51.500]   and along with the Middle East efforts.
[02:04:51.500 --> 02:04:52.980]   And the reason why that was great
[02:04:52.980 --> 02:04:55.700]   was because it didn't have a lot of support
[02:04:55.700 --> 02:04:57.980]   from the Republican caucus originally,
[02:04:57.980 --> 02:05:00.300]   and people thought there was no way it would happen.
[02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:03.680]   So I really was able to be the chief executive,
[02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:06.540]   the middle executive, the low executive, the intern.
[02:05:06.540 --> 02:05:09.740]   And through that process, I really got an education
[02:05:09.740 --> 02:05:12.500]   on how Congress works, on how to pass legislation.
[02:05:12.500 --> 02:05:15.620]   I was negotiating texts, I was negotiating back and forth,
[02:05:15.620 --> 02:05:16.760]   and I built a lot of trust.
[02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:18.860]   Again, I would deal with, whether it's Hakeem Jeffries
[02:05:18.860 --> 02:05:21.460]   or Cedric Richmond, we built a lot of trust.
[02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:23.080]   We'd speak three times a day.
[02:05:23.080 --> 02:05:25.740]   These guys had my back, the ACLU.
[02:05:25.740 --> 02:05:27.700]   Again, I never thought they were suing our administration
[02:05:27.700 --> 02:05:29.460]   every day or every other day on something,
[02:05:29.460 --> 02:05:31.540]   but for whatever reason, we built trust
[02:05:31.540 --> 02:05:33.240]   and we were able to work together.
[02:05:33.240 --> 02:05:36.500]   And then also with the real conservative groups,
[02:05:36.500 --> 02:05:39.280]   because there was a lot, a big part of the conservative base
[02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:42.420]   that felt like we should be giving people a second chance.
[02:05:42.420 --> 02:05:45.700]   And in addition to that, this will keep our country safer
[02:05:45.700 --> 02:05:47.980]   and it will reduce the cost of what we spend on prisons.
[02:05:47.980 --> 02:05:51.340]   And so it was a great effort, and I was very, very proud
[02:05:51.340 --> 02:05:53.860]   that we were able to get it done under President Trump.
[02:05:53.860 --> 02:05:55.580]   - How'd you convince the Republicans?
[02:05:55.580 --> 02:05:57.540]   So they were skeptical at first.
[02:05:57.540 --> 02:06:00.060]   Are we talking about like just phone conversations,
[02:06:00.060 --> 02:06:03.820]   going out to lunch, just back to the emojis or what?
[02:06:03.820 --> 02:06:05.740]   - Hand-to-hand combat, meetings.
[02:06:05.740 --> 02:06:07.220]   You know, like the cool thing about this is,
[02:06:07.220 --> 02:06:09.820]   so everyone always says, I always get frustrated
[02:06:09.820 --> 02:06:11.980]   when I hear a lawmaker say, "Oh, the Senate's not
[02:06:11.980 --> 02:06:14.880]   "what it used to be," or "Congress isn't what it used to be.
[02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:16.220]   "Things are broken today."
[02:06:16.220 --> 02:06:17.380]   I don't think that's true.
[02:06:17.380 --> 02:06:19.960]   I think, you know, going through the process,
[02:06:19.960 --> 02:06:22.820]   I think that our founders were totally genius
[02:06:22.820 --> 02:06:25.940]   in the way that they designed our system of government.
[02:06:25.940 --> 02:06:27.620]   And what I saw is you just have to work it.
[02:06:27.620 --> 02:06:29.960]   So everyone knows the power of their vote.
[02:06:29.960 --> 02:06:31.220]   Some would give it to me easily,
[02:06:31.220 --> 02:06:32.380]   some wouldn't give it to me easily,
[02:06:32.380 --> 02:06:33.740]   some would trade it for other things,
[02:06:33.740 --> 02:06:35.180]   some would withhold it because they were pissed
[02:06:35.180 --> 02:06:37.780]   about other things, and it was just hand-to-hand combat.
[02:06:37.780 --> 02:06:39.940]   So it was just making calls, using the phone,
[02:06:39.940 --> 02:06:41.900]   going, walking the halls, going to lunches,
[02:06:41.900 --> 02:06:43.340]   you know, hosting dinners at my house.
[02:06:43.340 --> 02:06:46.380]   It was just, it was a nonstop lobbying effort.
[02:06:46.380 --> 02:06:48.100]   And by the way, it was also adjudicating issues
[02:06:48.100 --> 02:06:50.280]   and making people feel like they were heard,
[02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:53.180]   hearing their issues, and then trying to find solutions
[02:06:53.180 --> 02:06:56.180]   that you don't put something in that then tips off
[02:06:56.180 --> 02:06:58.100]   where you lose, you know, a whole coalition.
[02:06:58.100 --> 02:06:59.540]   So it was really a balancing act,
[02:06:59.540 --> 02:07:01.380]   but it was an amazing thing.
[02:07:01.380 --> 02:07:04.260]   And I worked very closely on that with Van Jones
[02:07:04.260 --> 02:07:06.860]   and Jessica Jackson, who also gave me a lot of help
[02:07:06.860 --> 02:07:10.020]   on the left, and it was an amazing thing.
[02:07:10.020 --> 02:07:11.220]   Had a great team, too.
[02:07:11.220 --> 02:07:12.980]   - So you mentioned the importance of trust
[02:07:12.980 --> 02:07:15.080]   at the very beginning of the conversation.
[02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:18.180]   From the outsider perspective,
[02:07:18.180 --> 02:07:20.780]   just maybe a dark question,
[02:07:20.780 --> 02:07:25.060]   which is like how much trust is there in Washington?
[02:07:25.060 --> 02:07:27.500]   How much, the flip side of that,
[02:07:27.500 --> 02:07:29.780]   how much backstabbing is there?
[02:07:29.780 --> 02:07:34.620]   Can you form like long-term relationships with people
[02:07:34.620 --> 02:07:39.780]   on a basic human level where you know
[02:07:39.780 --> 02:07:43.260]   you're not going to be betrayed, screwed over,
[02:07:43.260 --> 02:07:47.260]   manipulated for, again, going back to the old money and power?
[02:07:47.260 --> 02:07:50.340]   - The answer is yes, and the answer is no.
[02:07:50.340 --> 02:07:53.980]   So I made some incredible friends, lifelong friends,
[02:07:53.980 --> 02:07:55.860]   through my time in Washington.
[02:07:55.860 --> 02:07:58.900]   But the way I think about it from politics,
[02:07:58.900 --> 02:08:00.500]   and I think in geopolitics as well,
[02:08:00.500 --> 02:08:02.660]   is I would say that politicians
[02:08:02.660 --> 02:08:05.620]   really don't have friends, politicians have interests.
[02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:08.140]   And as long as you kind of follow that rule,
[02:08:08.140 --> 02:08:11.980]   you should be able to know how to rate
[02:08:11.980 --> 02:08:15.140]   where your relationship with a given person falls
[02:08:15.140 --> 02:08:16.040]   in the spectrum.
[02:08:16.040 --> 02:08:17.460]   But I do think I was the exception.
[02:08:17.460 --> 02:08:19.580]   I did make some tremendous friends,
[02:08:19.580 --> 02:08:23.180]   and again, I'd go back to what I said about negotiation,
[02:08:23.180 --> 02:08:26.180]   where when you're in a situation
[02:08:26.180 --> 02:08:27.780]   where there's really nothing in it
[02:08:27.780 --> 02:08:29.940]   for any of you personally,
[02:08:29.940 --> 02:08:31.260]   but you're in a foxhole together,
[02:08:31.260 --> 02:08:32.340]   and nobody in Washington
[02:08:32.340 --> 02:08:33.860]   can get anything done by themselves.
[02:08:33.860 --> 02:08:35.900]   So you have people coming from all different backgrounds,
[02:08:35.900 --> 02:08:38.800]   all different experiences, all different geographies,
[02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:41.500]   coming together, agreeing on an objective,
[02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:44.500]   creating a plan, and then every day rowing together
[02:08:44.500 --> 02:08:45.940]   in order to get it done.
[02:08:45.940 --> 02:08:46.860]   It's a beautiful thing,
[02:08:46.860 --> 02:08:48.660]   and you really learn what people are about.
[02:08:48.660 --> 02:08:51.740]   And so when you go through an experience like that,
[02:08:51.740 --> 02:08:53.120]   you learn who's in it for themselves,
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:54.520]   you learn who's in it for the cause.
[02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:57.660]   And for every thing you read about in the press,
[02:08:57.660 --> 02:09:00.860]   if a fight I had with somebody because we were at odds,
[02:09:00.860 --> 02:09:04.200]   I have about 100 people who have become lifelong friends
[02:09:04.200 --> 02:09:06.220]   because I respect the way
[02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:07.820]   that when we were under fire together,
[02:09:07.820 --> 02:09:09.700]   they got better, they were competent,
[02:09:09.700 --> 02:09:11.400]   and they were there to serve for the right reason.
[02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:15.740]   And so I guess the answer is yes, it is possible.
[02:09:15.740 --> 02:09:16.620]   You have to be careful
[02:09:16.620 --> 02:09:20.100]   because there are a lot of mercurial people there.
[02:09:20.100 --> 02:09:22.540]   I always say the politicians are like gladiators.
[02:09:22.540 --> 02:09:25.460]   I didn't have as much respect for politicians
[02:09:25.460 --> 02:09:26.900]   till I got there, but if you think about it,
[02:09:26.900 --> 02:09:30.100]   everyone who's got a congressional seat or a Senate seat,
[02:09:30.100 --> 02:09:32.540]   there's 25 people back at home who want their job,
[02:09:32.540 --> 02:09:33.700]   who think they're smarter than them,
[02:09:33.700 --> 02:09:35.500]   who are trying to backstab them.
[02:09:35.500 --> 02:09:38.540]   And so I always say that the political dynamic,
[02:09:38.540 --> 02:09:40.700]   it's like in the private sector,
[02:09:40.700 --> 02:09:42.260]   you're standing on flat ground.
[02:09:42.260 --> 02:09:44.300]   You choose which fights you take on,
[02:09:44.300 --> 02:09:46.660]   when you take them on, how you fight them.
[02:09:46.660 --> 02:09:49.140]   In politics, it's like you're standing on a ball.
[02:09:49.140 --> 02:09:51.140]   And what you have to realize is that
[02:09:51.140 --> 02:09:53.620]   there's maybe like 10 things that you have to do,
[02:09:53.620 --> 02:09:56.260]   but there's a potential cost to taking on each one
[02:09:56.260 --> 02:09:57.980]   that might destabilize you.
[02:09:57.980 --> 02:09:59.140]   You fall off the ball,
[02:09:59.140 --> 02:10:01.660]   and then you lose your opportunity to pursue those.
[02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:05.500]   You have to always be kind of marking everything to market
[02:10:05.500 --> 02:10:07.600]   and going through your calculations
[02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:10.020]   to make sure you can accomplish what you want to
[02:10:10.020 --> 02:10:11.860]   without falling off the ball
[02:10:11.860 --> 02:10:14.460]   and losing your opportunity to make a difference.
[02:10:14.460 --> 02:10:16.020]   - I guess people like power.
[02:10:16.020 --> 02:10:20.980]   And I just feel like to be a good politician,
[02:10:20.980 --> 02:10:24.780]   you should be willing, like good meaning good for humanity,
[02:10:24.780 --> 02:10:26.420]   be willing to let go of power.
[02:10:26.420 --> 02:10:29.280]   You know, try to do the right thing.
[02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:31.220]   If there's somebody back home
[02:10:31.220 --> 02:10:32.460]   that does manipulative stuff,
[02:10:32.460 --> 02:10:35.660]   screws you over and takes power from you, it's okay.
[02:10:35.660 --> 02:10:39.500]   I feel like that kind of humility
[02:10:39.820 --> 02:10:42.340]   is required to be a great leader.
[02:10:42.340 --> 02:10:44.060]   And I feel like that's actually a good way
[02:10:44.060 --> 02:10:45.820]   to have long-term power
[02:10:45.820 --> 02:10:49.620]   because karma has a viral aspect to it.
[02:10:49.620 --> 02:10:53.620]   Just doing good by others, I feel like is a--
[02:10:53.620 --> 02:10:55.580]   - I'd like to say that's true, Lex.
[02:10:55.580 --> 02:10:58.700]   I think it's just way more complicated.
[02:10:58.700 --> 02:10:59.960]   I mean, you look what happened this week
[02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:01.620]   with Kevin McCarthy, right?
[02:11:01.620 --> 02:11:03.900]   He did what he thought was morally right.
[02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:07.500]   He thought, you know, he did a bipartisan deal.
[02:11:07.500 --> 02:11:09.660]   He was told that they would have his back
[02:11:09.660 --> 02:11:12.060]   and then the moment things got tough, they cut him loose.
[02:11:12.060 --> 02:11:15.660]   So again, I don't know if that was the right thing
[02:11:15.660 --> 02:11:16.500]   or the wrong thing, right?
[02:11:16.500 --> 02:11:19.100]   I've also seen leaders on the other end say,
[02:11:19.100 --> 02:11:23.220]   I'm gonna do things that are short-term or selfish,
[02:11:23.220 --> 02:11:26.420]   but the way they justify to themselves is to say,
[02:11:26.420 --> 02:11:29.020]   I believe that myself staying in power
[02:11:29.020 --> 02:11:31.940]   is existential to the greater good,
[02:11:31.940 --> 02:11:33.900]   so I will do things that maybe are not
[02:11:33.900 --> 02:11:35.140]   in the greater good now
[02:11:35.140 --> 02:11:39.740]   because I believe that my maintaining power is.
[02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:41.780]   And so it's complicated.
[02:11:41.780 --> 02:11:44.140]   In an idealized world, I'd love to believe that's the case,
[02:11:44.140 --> 02:11:46.820]   but it's just way more complicated than that.
[02:11:46.820 --> 02:11:48.220]   - Yeah.
[02:11:48.220 --> 02:11:50.300]   - I wish it wasn't, but it is.
[02:11:50.300 --> 02:11:51.140]   - Yeah.
[02:11:51.140 --> 02:11:56.060]   I mean, I do just wish people zoomed out,
[02:11:56.060 --> 02:11:57.540]   people in politics zoomed out a bit
[02:11:57.540 --> 02:12:00.560]   and just asked themselves, what are we all doing this for?
[02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:03.800]   You know, like sometimes you can get like a little bit lost
[02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:04.740]   in the game of it.
[02:12:05.540 --> 02:12:07.700]   If you zoom out, you realize like integrity
[02:12:07.700 --> 02:12:12.180]   is way more important than like little gains in money
[02:12:12.180 --> 02:12:15.660]   or little gains in power in the long-term.
[02:12:15.660 --> 02:12:17.140]   It's when you look at yourself in the mirror
[02:12:17.140 --> 02:12:18.860]   at the end of the day,
[02:12:18.860 --> 02:12:21.380]   and also how history remembers you.
[02:12:21.380 --> 02:12:26.380]   I just feel like people do some dark stuff
[02:12:26.380 --> 02:12:29.820]   when they're like in that moment when they're losing power
[02:12:29.820 --> 02:12:32.540]   and they try to hold on a little too hard.
[02:12:32.540 --> 02:12:36.060]   This is when they can do really dark things,
[02:12:36.060 --> 02:12:38.620]   like bring out the worst in themselves.
[02:12:38.620 --> 02:12:40.500]   And it's just sad to see,
[02:12:40.500 --> 02:12:43.580]   and I wish there was a kind of machinery of government
[02:12:43.580 --> 02:12:46.860]   would inspire people to be their best selves
[02:12:46.860 --> 02:12:49.940]   in their last days versus their worst selves.
[02:12:49.940 --> 02:12:51.780]   - When that system gets invented,
[02:12:51.780 --> 02:12:53.620]   you know, you'll share with me what it is,
[02:12:53.620 --> 02:12:56.500]   but it's, look, let me give you another way to frame it,
[02:12:56.500 --> 02:12:58.980]   which is, and this was kind of the revelation
[02:12:58.980 --> 02:13:00.860]   we spoke before about, you know,
[02:13:00.860 --> 02:13:02.260]   kind of when I was getting my butt kicked
[02:13:02.260 --> 02:13:05.780]   by the Russia investigation and all the different areas,
[02:13:05.780 --> 02:13:07.940]   but kind of the basic framework I looked at was I said,
[02:13:07.940 --> 02:13:10.460]   "Okay, you know, this all feels tough,"
[02:13:10.460 --> 02:13:11.460]   but I said, "The game's the game.
[02:13:11.460 --> 02:13:14.320]   "The game's been here way longer, you know,
[02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:15.380]   "but way before I came,
[02:13:15.380 --> 02:13:18.420]   "and it'll be here way long after I leave."
[02:13:18.420 --> 02:13:19.860]   And so I have two choices.
[02:13:19.860 --> 02:13:22.060]   I can complain that the game's tough, it's not fair,
[02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:24.860]   it's not moral, or I can go and I can try to play the game
[02:13:24.860 --> 02:13:25.980]   as hard as possible.
[02:13:25.980 --> 02:13:28.420]   And I think that there's two different things, right?
[02:13:28.420 --> 02:13:30.780]   You have people who are willing to kind of sit in the stands
[02:13:30.780 --> 02:13:32.660]   and they're willing to yell at the players
[02:13:32.660 --> 02:13:37.620]   or make their points known,
[02:13:37.620 --> 02:13:39.020]   or you have people who are willing to suit up
[02:13:39.020 --> 02:13:40.500]   and get in the arena and go play.
[02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:42.980]   And I have a lot of respect for the people
[02:13:42.980 --> 02:13:44.540]   who suit up and go play.
[02:13:44.540 --> 02:13:46.340]   And again, some of them, you know,
[02:13:46.340 --> 02:13:48.020]   I wish they would play for different means,
[02:13:48.020 --> 02:13:49.460]   but the fact that they're willing to put their name
[02:13:49.460 --> 02:13:51.620]   on the ballot, make the sacrifice,
[02:13:51.620 --> 02:13:54.300]   and go put on the pads and get hit and hit others,
[02:13:54.300 --> 02:13:56.020]   I think that you need those people.
[02:13:56.020 --> 02:13:59.060]   And I wish more people who had maybe the moral wiring
[02:13:59.060 --> 02:14:01.740]   that you discussed would be putting on a helmet
[02:14:01.740 --> 02:14:04.060]   and going to play, 'cause it's hard, it's hard.
[02:14:04.060 --> 02:14:05.140]   - I agree with you.
[02:14:05.140 --> 02:14:07.260]   I just would love to fix the aspect
[02:14:07.260 --> 02:14:09.420]   of the Russia collusion accusation,
[02:14:09.420 --> 02:14:10.740]   the virality, the power of that,
[02:14:10.740 --> 02:14:14.140]   'cause that's a really discouraging thing for people.
[02:14:14.140 --> 02:14:15.260]   Maybe it's the way it has to be,
[02:14:15.260 --> 02:14:20.140]   but it seems like a disincentive to people to participate.
[02:14:20.140 --> 02:14:23.060]   - It is, but I'll give you again an optimistic side of it,
[02:14:23.060 --> 02:14:25.900]   is that, you know, what you're seeing now with social media
[02:14:26.020 --> 02:14:29.540]   is I do think with what's happening at X,
[02:14:29.540 --> 02:14:31.700]   there is now more of a reversion
[02:14:31.700 --> 02:14:33.460]   towards more egalitarian, right?
[02:14:33.460 --> 02:14:37.080]   And egalitarianism of information.
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:39.140]   And so for many years,
[02:14:39.140 --> 02:14:42.060]   the media publications were the gate holders,
[02:14:42.060 --> 02:14:43.660]   they were the gatekeepers.
[02:14:43.660 --> 02:14:46.220]   And then you had these social media companies that grew,
[02:14:46.220 --> 02:14:47.960]   they became so powerful,
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:49.580]   but then they were tilting the scales,
[02:14:49.580 --> 02:14:52.180]   why they were doing it, you know,
[02:14:52.180 --> 02:14:54.680]   we can go through long explanations for that.
[02:14:54.680 --> 02:14:56.700]   But if there truly is a real forum
[02:14:56.700 --> 02:14:58.820]   and a democratization of information,
[02:14:58.820 --> 02:15:00.820]   then you would think that the marketplace of ideas
[02:15:00.820 --> 02:15:04.060]   would surface the real ones and discredit the non-real ones.
[02:15:04.060 --> 02:15:05.300]   And I think that as a society,
[02:15:05.300 --> 02:15:07.860]   we're starting to kind of come to grips with the fact
[02:15:07.860 --> 02:15:10.420]   that the power dynamic is changing
[02:15:10.420 --> 02:15:12.440]   and that some of these institutions
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:14.300]   that we used to have a lot of faith in
[02:15:14.300 --> 02:15:15.400]   don't deserve our faith.
[02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:16.460]   And some of them, you know,
[02:15:16.460 --> 02:15:18.620]   will actually reform and maybe re-earn our faith.
[02:15:18.620 --> 02:15:22.220]   So I think that there could be an optimistic tone.
[02:15:22.220 --> 02:15:23.500]   Again, the years of Trump,
[02:15:23.500 --> 02:15:27.160]   I think that, you know, he was an outsider
[02:15:27.160 --> 02:15:29.280]   and, you know, he represented something
[02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:31.400]   that was existential to the system, right?
[02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:33.800]   You think about for the 30 years before,
[02:15:33.800 --> 02:15:34.860]   you were either part of, you know,
[02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:37.480]   the Clinton dynasty or the Bush dynasty.
[02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:40.520]   I think a lot of people in the country felt like
[02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:41.760]   that whole class,
[02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:43.440]   whether you were wearing a red shirt or a blue shirt,
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:45.520]   wasn't representing them.
[02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:49.100]   And Trump represented a true outsider to that system.
[02:15:49.100 --> 02:15:51.200]   And I do think that as he went in there,
[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:53.680]   there was a lot of norms that were broken
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:55.520]   to try to stop him from
[02:15:55.520 --> 02:15:57.440]   changing the traditional power structure.
[02:15:57.440 --> 02:16:00.480]   So I think that we're at a time where
[02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:04.560]   maybe there will be an optimistic breakthrough
[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:06.640]   where you'll have institutions that will allow
[02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:11.180]   for a lot more transparency into what truth really is.
[02:16:11.180 --> 02:16:15.080]   - I'd love to go back and talk to you about the Middle East
[02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:17.960]   'cause there's so many interesting components to this.
[02:16:17.960 --> 02:16:19.760]   Let's talk about Saudi Arabia.
[02:16:19.760 --> 02:16:22.880]   And first, let me ask you about MBS,
[02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:25.120]   Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince.
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:26.560]   So you've gotten to know him pretty well.
[02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:28.320]   You've become friends with him.
[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:29.640]   What's he like as a human being,
[02:16:29.640 --> 02:16:31.200]   just on a basic human level?
[02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:32.040]   What's he like?
[02:16:32.040 --> 02:16:33.880]   - So for the listeners,
[02:16:33.880 --> 02:16:37.800]   Mohammed bin Salman is now the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.
[02:16:37.800 --> 02:16:40.080]   He has risen to that position
[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:41.460]   over the last couple of years.
[02:16:41.460 --> 02:16:44.640]   And he's been a tremendous reformer for the country.
[02:16:44.640 --> 02:16:48.160]   He's gone in and he's really modernized the economy.
[02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:50.880]   He's put a lot more investment into the country.
[02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:54.360]   He's marginalized the religious police
[02:16:54.360 --> 02:16:55.880]   and he's really done a good job
[02:16:55.880 --> 02:16:58.520]   to bring modernization and a lot of reform.
[02:16:58.520 --> 02:17:00.480]   So he's been a great reformer.
[02:17:00.480 --> 02:17:05.160]   What he's like as a person is he's very high energy.
[02:17:05.160 --> 02:17:09.720]   He's got a tremendous candle power, very, very smart,
[02:17:09.720 --> 02:17:10.720]   incredibly well-read.
[02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:14.040]   When he was younger, his father would give him a book a week
[02:17:14.040 --> 02:17:16.980]   and make him report on it on the weekend.
[02:17:16.980 --> 02:17:19.960]   He was trained as a leader and as a politician
[02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:21.880]   really by his father.
[02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:23.120]   He's not Western educated.
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:25.840]   So he grew up in the Saudi culture
[02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:27.440]   and he's a real Saudi nationalist.
[02:17:27.440 --> 02:17:30.480]   He loves their history, loves their heritage,
[02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:35.380]   has a deep understanding of the tribal nature of the region.
[02:17:35.380 --> 02:17:37.740]   And his father was actually known
[02:17:37.740 --> 02:17:39.400]   to be a tremendous politician.
[02:17:39.400 --> 02:17:41.760]   So when he was governor of Riyadh,
[02:17:41.760 --> 02:17:44.300]   people who I speak to today about him say that
[02:17:44.300 --> 02:17:45.600]   if they had a full election,
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:46.920]   he would have won in a landslide.
[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:48.680]   He's every time somebody went to the hospital,
[02:17:48.680 --> 02:17:50.540]   he was the first person to call.
[02:17:50.540 --> 02:17:51.700]   Anytime there was a funeral,
[02:17:51.700 --> 02:17:53.640]   he was the first person to show up.
[02:17:53.640 --> 02:17:55.440]   He's a very, very beloved leader.
[02:17:55.440 --> 02:17:59.720]   Mohammed bin Salman, he was a businessman
[02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:01.760]   before he got into Crown Prince.
[02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:05.280]   So he thinks really with a business mindset
[02:18:05.280 --> 02:18:07.540]   about how he runs the country.
[02:18:07.540 --> 02:18:10.840]   And he's brought, I think, a different mindset and energy
[02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:12.560]   to the Middle East.
[02:18:12.560 --> 02:18:15.240]   One thing I'll say that maybe that comes to mind here
[02:18:15.240 --> 02:18:19.280]   is that I remember early on talking with him
[02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:22.040]   about all the different initiatives he was taking on.
[02:18:22.040 --> 02:18:25.120]   He's building a big city called Neom in the desert
[02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:27.600]   in a place where there really was nothing on the Red Sea.
[02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:28.940]   And a lot of people were criticizing
[02:18:28.940 --> 02:18:30.160]   the ambition of the plan.
[02:18:30.160 --> 02:18:31.880]   And I was sitting with him one night and I said,
[02:18:31.880 --> 02:18:34.440]   "Why are you taking on all these things?
[02:18:34.440 --> 02:18:36.480]   You've got a lot of different programs,
[02:18:36.480 --> 02:18:40.240]   but what most politicians do is they set lower expectations
[02:18:40.240 --> 02:18:41.780]   and then they exceed the expectations."
[02:18:41.780 --> 02:18:43.260]   And he looked at me without hesitation.
[02:18:43.260 --> 02:18:46.640]   He says, "Jared, the way I look at it
[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:49.660]   is that in five years from now, if I set five goals
[02:18:49.660 --> 02:18:52.180]   and I achieve five goals, I'll achieve five things.
[02:18:52.180 --> 02:18:55.260]   If I set 100 goals and I fail at 50 of them,
[02:18:55.260 --> 02:18:57.260]   then five years I'll accomplish 50 things."
[02:18:57.260 --> 02:19:00.820]   And so it's a very different mindset as a leader.
[02:19:00.820 --> 02:19:02.840]   The way I got to work with him was,
[02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:06.420]   Saudi Arabia was a big topic in the campaign.
[02:19:06.420 --> 02:19:09.180]   President Trump was basically saying during the campaign
[02:19:09.180 --> 02:19:12.380]   that they've got to pay for their fair share,
[02:19:12.380 --> 02:19:14.620]   they haven't been a great partner in the region.
[02:19:14.620 --> 02:19:16.900]   He's very critical of Saudi.
[02:19:16.900 --> 02:19:19.220]   And then during the transition,
[02:19:19.220 --> 02:19:20.760]   I was asked by several friends to meet
[02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:22.180]   with a representative of Saudi Arabia.
[02:19:22.180 --> 02:19:24.060]   I said, "I don't wanna meet with them."
[02:19:24.060 --> 02:19:25.620]   But I came over and I met and they said,
[02:19:25.620 --> 02:19:26.940]   "Well, we wanna make changes."
[02:19:26.940 --> 02:19:29.820]   And I said, "Well, you have to make changes
[02:19:29.820 --> 02:19:30.860]   to how you treat women."
[02:19:30.860 --> 02:19:33.060]   Then women couldn't drive, they had guardianship laws.
[02:19:33.060 --> 02:19:35.740]   So you gotta start working with Israel.
[02:19:35.740 --> 02:19:37.420]   You have to be paying more of your fair share
[02:19:37.420 --> 02:19:39.740]   and you have to be stopping the Wahhabism
[02:19:39.740 --> 02:19:41.660]   that's being spread.
[02:19:41.660 --> 02:19:42.780]   Again, I had no knowledge.
[02:19:42.780 --> 02:19:44.820]   These were just kind of the traditional talking points
[02:19:44.820 --> 02:19:45.740]   about Saudi Arabia.
[02:19:45.740 --> 02:19:48.140]   So the guy I was with basically said,
[02:19:48.140 --> 02:19:49.620]   is a guy Fadal Tunzi,
[02:19:49.620 --> 02:19:52.180]   who's a very respected minister there.
[02:19:52.180 --> 02:19:54.380]   He says, Jared, he says,
[02:19:54.380 --> 02:19:56.020]   "You don't know much about Saudi Arabia, do you?"
[02:19:56.020 --> 02:19:57.100]   I said, "No, no, no, I don't.
[02:19:57.100 --> 02:20:01.340]   It's just really what I've kind of been told or what I read."
[02:20:01.340 --> 02:20:03.200]   And he says, "Okay, let me do this.
[02:20:03.200 --> 02:20:06.220]   We wanna be great allies with America.
[02:20:06.220 --> 02:20:09.260]   We've traditionally been great allies with America.
[02:20:09.260 --> 02:20:10.880]   Can I come back to you with a proposal
[02:20:10.880 --> 02:20:12.460]   on ways that we can make progress
[02:20:12.460 --> 02:20:15.180]   on all of the different areas where we have joint interests?"
[02:20:15.180 --> 02:20:16.620]   And keep in mind at that point in time,
[02:20:16.620 --> 02:20:17.740]   the Middle East was a mess
[02:20:17.740 --> 02:20:20.900]   and probably the single biggest issue we had
[02:20:20.900 --> 02:20:23.580]   after ISIS was the ideological battle.
[02:20:23.580 --> 02:20:25.860]   If you remember in 2016,
[02:20:25.860 --> 02:20:28.420]   there was the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando,
[02:20:28.420 --> 02:20:30.380]   you had the San Bernardino shooting
[02:20:30.380 --> 02:20:34.820]   and people were being radicalized online with the extremism.
[02:20:34.820 --> 02:20:36.060]   And then there was a lot of crimes
[02:20:36.060 --> 02:20:38.300]   that were happening because of that.
[02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:40.580]   And it was a big topic in the campaign.
[02:20:40.580 --> 02:20:42.800]   And so that, when I was thinking about,
[02:20:42.800 --> 02:20:43.920]   talking to different generals
[02:20:43.920 --> 02:20:47.280]   and what capabilities the US had to really combat
[02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:49.480]   the extremism and the ideological battle,
[02:20:49.480 --> 02:20:51.320]   what we realized was that Saudi Arabia
[02:20:51.320 --> 02:20:54.080]   is the custodian of the two holiest sites in Islam,
[02:20:54.080 --> 02:20:56.360]   the Mecca, Medina,
[02:20:56.360 --> 02:20:58.320]   that that would be the best partner to work with
[02:20:58.320 --> 02:20:59.160]   if they were willing to.
[02:20:59.160 --> 02:21:00.960]   But for years, they really hadn't been willing
[02:21:00.960 --> 02:21:03.200]   to kind of lean into this fight.
[02:21:03.200 --> 02:21:05.400]   So I said, "Sure, give a proposal."
[02:21:05.400 --> 02:21:06.560]   So they come back, give a proposal.
[02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:08.520]   And they said, "Look, if you make President Trump's
[02:21:08.520 --> 02:21:10.160]   first trip to Saudi Arabia,
[02:21:10.160 --> 02:21:14.100]   we will do all these different things.
[02:21:14.100 --> 02:21:16.500]   We'll increase our military spending and cooperation.
[02:21:16.500 --> 02:21:18.820]   We'll counter all the terror financing."
[02:21:18.820 --> 02:21:20.740]   Unbelievable layer.
[02:21:20.740 --> 02:21:21.900]   So I took the proposal.
[02:21:21.900 --> 02:21:23.720]   I went to the national, then it was General Flynn.
[02:21:23.720 --> 02:21:27.660]   I said, "If Saudi Arabia did these things,
[02:21:27.660 --> 02:21:29.660]   would this be considered a big,
[02:21:29.660 --> 02:21:31.140]   unbelievable, but it will never happen?"
[02:21:31.140 --> 02:21:32.300]   I said, "Well, they're telling me
[02:21:32.300 --> 02:21:33.340]   they wanna do these things."
[02:21:33.340 --> 02:21:35.260]   Again, having no foreign policy experience,
[02:21:35.260 --> 02:21:36.700]   I'm just saying I've got somebody telling me
[02:21:36.700 --> 02:21:37.520]   they wanna do it.
[02:21:37.520 --> 02:21:40.540]   And that's kind of where we started.
[02:21:40.540 --> 02:21:43.220]   Again, to office, I don't think much more about it.
[02:21:43.220 --> 02:21:45.220]   And then I think it was like maybe a month in,
[02:21:45.220 --> 02:21:49.400]   President Trump has a call with King Salman.
[02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:52.240]   And before the call, we're in the Oval Office.
[02:21:52.240 --> 02:21:54.460]   And the President's basically saying,
[02:21:54.460 --> 02:21:57.500]   "Well, this is what we wanna go through."
[02:21:57.500 --> 02:22:01.440]   And I have Secretary Mattis and Secretary Tillerson,
[02:22:01.440 --> 02:22:03.580]   the Minister of Defense and the Secretary of State
[02:22:03.580 --> 02:22:07.600]   basically saying, "You have to deal with MBN."
[02:22:07.600 --> 02:22:10.620]   MBN is the guy who's been our partner for all these years.
[02:22:10.620 --> 02:22:12.500]   He's the head of intelligence and he's been a great partner.
[02:22:12.500 --> 02:22:13.820]   I said, "Well, if he's been a great partner,
[02:22:13.820 --> 02:22:15.580]   then why do we have all these problems
[02:22:15.580 --> 02:22:17.500]   that you guys are complaining about with Saudi?"
[02:22:17.500 --> 02:22:19.420]   I said, "I've been told that we have this proposal
[02:22:19.420 --> 02:22:22.260]   from MBS, who's the deputy crown prince,
[02:22:22.260 --> 02:22:24.640]   and that's who we should be dealing with on this."
[02:22:24.640 --> 02:22:27.140]   And so the phone call starts,
[02:22:27.140 --> 02:22:29.360]   and President Trump listened to both of us.
[02:22:29.360 --> 02:22:31.360]   And on the phone call with King Salman,
[02:22:32.940 --> 02:22:33.860]   President Trump says, "Okay,
[02:22:33.860 --> 02:22:34.820]   we'll go through all these things.
[02:22:34.820 --> 02:22:36.580]   These are the things we wanna get done."
[02:22:36.580 --> 02:22:38.340]   And he says, "Well, who should we deal with?"
[02:22:38.340 --> 02:22:41.140]   And King Salman says, "Deal with my son,
[02:22:41.140 --> 02:22:42.980]   the deputy crown prince, MBS."
[02:22:42.980 --> 02:22:44.820]   And so President Trump's on the phone,
[02:22:44.820 --> 02:22:46.460]   have him deal with Jared,
[02:22:46.460 --> 02:22:48.340]   because I think he knew that if he put him
[02:22:48.340 --> 02:22:50.560]   with the other guys, they were not believers
[02:22:50.560 --> 02:22:52.540]   in what he had the ability to do.
[02:22:52.540 --> 02:22:54.660]   And that's how I got assigned to work with him.
[02:22:54.660 --> 02:22:55.980]   I get back to my office after that,
[02:22:55.980 --> 02:22:58.700]   have an email from him, spoke to him for the first time.
[02:22:58.700 --> 02:22:59.820]   And then we just went to work.
[02:22:59.820 --> 02:23:02.660]   And a lot of people were betting against that trip.
[02:23:02.660 --> 02:23:04.620]   They thought it wasn't gonna be successful.
[02:23:04.620 --> 02:23:06.100]   And they've been betting against him.
[02:23:06.100 --> 02:23:08.400]   And he's been underestimated,
[02:23:08.400 --> 02:23:10.600]   but he's been doing an incredible job.
[02:23:10.600 --> 02:23:12.580]   And the whole Middle East is different today
[02:23:12.580 --> 02:23:14.940]   because of the work that he's done.
[02:23:14.940 --> 02:23:17.460]   - Maybe it's instructive to go through the mental journey
[02:23:17.460 --> 02:23:20.380]   that you went on from the talking points,
[02:23:20.380 --> 02:23:23.660]   the basic narratives, the very basic talking points,
[02:23:23.660 --> 02:23:26.220]   understanding of Saudi Arabia,
[02:23:26.220 --> 02:23:31.220]   to making that human connection with MBS,
[02:23:31.820 --> 02:23:33.500]   and making the positive connection
[02:23:33.500 --> 02:23:35.020]   that it's actually possible to solve problems.
[02:23:35.020 --> 02:23:37.180]   Like, what was that journey like?
[02:23:37.180 --> 02:23:39.340]   Why was it so difficult to take for others?
[02:23:39.340 --> 02:23:42.140]   And why were you effective in being able
[02:23:42.140 --> 02:23:43.660]   to take that journey yourself?
[02:23:43.660 --> 02:23:46.620]   - Maybe some of it came from my inexperience,
[02:23:46.620 --> 02:23:50.360]   but my desire to listen and hear people.
[02:23:50.360 --> 02:23:52.460]   So, I had this proposal.
[02:23:52.460 --> 02:23:54.900]   I was told that all of these things were good.
[02:23:54.900 --> 02:23:56.820]   Then we're trying to schedule this trip.
[02:23:56.820 --> 02:23:59.180]   And the National Security Council calls a meeting
[02:23:59.180 --> 02:24:00.500]   where we're in the situation room,
[02:24:00.500 --> 02:24:03.460]   and we have Homeland Security,
[02:24:03.460 --> 02:24:05.660]   Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State,
[02:24:05.660 --> 02:24:07.660]   and everyone's saying, "This is gonna be a disaster."
[02:24:07.660 --> 02:24:09.140]   They said, "If we go to Saudi Arabia,
[02:24:09.140 --> 02:24:11.240]   "the Saudis never keep their promises."
[02:24:11.240 --> 02:24:13.220]   And our Secretary of State at the time
[02:24:13.220 --> 02:24:15.300]   was a gentleman named Rex Tillerson,
[02:24:15.300 --> 02:24:17.480]   who'd been the CEO of Exxon.
[02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:20.860]   So, he dealt with all these people very extensively.
[02:24:20.860 --> 02:24:22.840]   And he basically said, "In my experience,
[02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:24.060]   "the Saudis won't come through.
[02:24:24.060 --> 02:24:25.340]   "And Jared, you don't know what you're doing.
[02:24:25.340 --> 02:24:27.060]   "You're wasting your time."
[02:24:27.060 --> 02:24:28.560]   And I basically was at a point where I said,
[02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:30.720]   "Look, guys, but they're saying
[02:24:30.720 --> 02:24:31.820]   "they wanna do all these things.
[02:24:31.820 --> 02:24:34.620]   "Shouldn't we at least give 'em a chance to try to do it?
[02:24:34.620 --> 02:24:39.540]   "Why do we wanna predetermine their direction
[02:24:39.540 --> 02:24:41.200]   "by not giving them a chance to change?
[02:24:41.200 --> 02:24:42.460]   "Just because things in the past
[02:24:42.460 --> 02:24:44.260]   "haven't gotten the way you want them to,
[02:24:44.260 --> 02:24:47.060]   "that doesn't mean they can't go that way in the future."
[02:24:47.060 --> 02:24:48.380]   So, we fought the battle.
[02:24:48.380 --> 02:24:51.100]   They basically deferred and let me go through with it.
[02:24:51.100 --> 02:24:53.080]   But when I do the planning meetings for the trip,
[02:24:53.080 --> 02:24:54.060]   nobody would show up,
[02:24:54.060 --> 02:24:54.900]   because they all thought
[02:24:54.900 --> 02:24:56.660]   it was gonna be an absolute disaster.
[02:24:56.660 --> 02:24:58.380]   And by the way, they probably weren't wrong to think that,
[02:24:58.380 --> 02:24:59.980]   'cause I'd never planned a foreign trip before,
[02:24:59.980 --> 02:25:02.540]   and I'd never done any foreign policy before.
[02:25:02.540 --> 02:25:06.020]   So, during the planning, I'd speak to MBS almost every day,
[02:25:06.020 --> 02:25:07.700]   and I'd go through all the different details
[02:25:07.700 --> 02:25:09.800]   and the things that would be coming up.
[02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:10.640]   And I said, "Look, I really need
[02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:11.840]   "to get these things in writing."
[02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:14.900]   He sent over a guy, Dr. Masada Aiban,
[02:25:14.900 --> 02:25:17.420]   who's a tremendous diplomat for them.
[02:25:17.420 --> 02:25:19.500]   And he came to Washington, stayed for three weeks,
[02:25:19.500 --> 02:25:21.620]   and we worked through all the different details
[02:25:21.620 --> 02:25:22.920]   of what we needed,
[02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:24.800]   and we ended up coming to an arrangement
[02:25:24.800 --> 02:25:25.640]   on what it should be.
[02:25:25.640 --> 02:25:28.620]   So, I think about now, in retrospect,
[02:25:28.620 --> 02:25:32.580]   why I was so focused on getting things like this done,
[02:25:32.580 --> 02:25:36.200]   and why I even believed that they could be possible.
[02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:38.080]   But the answer is, is really,
[02:25:38.080 --> 02:25:40.960]   the people I was talking to on the other end
[02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:42.800]   were telling me that these things were possible.
[02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:45.720]   And so, just because they hadn't been done before,
[02:25:45.720 --> 02:25:47.600]   and just because others around me
[02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:49.840]   didn't believe that they could be done,
[02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:52.360]   I wasn't willing to just say, "Well, let's not try."
[02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:55.480]   It just seems like that cynicism that takes over
[02:25:55.480 --> 02:25:57.760]   is paralyzing.
[02:25:57.760 --> 02:26:01.040]   And you sent me a great essay from Paul Graham,
[02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:02.760]   I'm a big fan of,
[02:26:02.760 --> 02:26:05.760]   that I think explains a lot of your success.
[02:26:05.760 --> 02:26:07.840]   The essay's called "How to Do Great Work."
[02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:10.360]   And people should go definitely read the full essay.
[02:26:10.360 --> 02:26:13.240]   There's a few things I could read from it.
[02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:15.620]   Some quotes, "Having new ideas is a strange game,
[02:26:15.620 --> 02:26:17.740]   "because it usually consists of seeing things
[02:26:17.740 --> 02:26:19.600]   "that were right under your nose.
[02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:22.740]   "Once you've seen a new idea, it tends to seem obvious.
[02:26:22.740 --> 02:26:25.260]   "Why did no one think of this before?
[02:26:25.260 --> 02:26:28.920]   "Seeing something obvious sounds easy,
[02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:31.880]   "and yet empirically, having new ideas is hard.
[02:26:31.880 --> 02:26:35.420]   "And the steps you took seem trivial,
[02:26:35.420 --> 02:26:37.640]   "and yet, nobody was taking them,
[02:26:37.640 --> 02:26:39.800]   "or at least in the past, they weren't successful."
[02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:41.880]   So the successes you've had
[02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:44.280]   were as simple as essentially picking up the phone,
[02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:45.100]   or trying.
[02:26:45.100 --> 02:26:48.720]   There's a lot of interesting things here
[02:26:48.720 --> 02:26:53.720]   to talk about this aspect of doing the seemingly simple
[02:26:53.720 --> 02:26:56.360]   that seems to be so hard to do.
[02:26:56.360 --> 02:26:57.920]   It, as Paul describes,
[02:26:57.920 --> 02:27:00.600]   requires a willingness to break rules.
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:03.240]   There are two ways to be comfortable breaking rules,
[02:27:03.240 --> 02:27:06.360]   to enjoy breaking them, and to be indifferent to them.
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:07.960]   That's an interesting distinction.
[02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:10.060]   I call these two cases being aggressively
[02:27:10.060 --> 02:27:12.340]   and passively independent-minded.
[02:27:12.340 --> 02:27:14.760]   So again, that's to enjoy breaking the rules,
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:17.120]   or to be indifferent to the rules.
[02:27:17.120 --> 02:27:18.600]   The aggressively independent-minded
[02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:19.920]   are the naughty ones.
[02:27:19.920 --> 02:27:23.100]   Rules don't merely fail to stop them.
[02:27:23.100 --> 02:27:25.520]   Breaking rules gives them additional energy.
[02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:26.480]   For this sort of person,
[02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:28.540]   delight at the sheer audacity of a project
[02:27:28.540 --> 02:27:30.760]   sometimes supplies enough activation energy
[02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:31.980]   to get it started.
[02:27:31.980 --> 02:27:33.040]   The other way to break the rules
[02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:34.560]   is not to care about them at all,
[02:27:34.560 --> 02:27:37.640]   or perhaps even to know they exist.
[02:27:37.640 --> 02:27:39.740]   This is why novices and outsiders
[02:27:39.740 --> 02:27:41.860]   often make new discoveries.
[02:27:41.860 --> 02:27:43.840]   Their ignorance of a field,
[02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:45.640]   ignorance, maybe in quotes,
[02:27:45.640 --> 02:27:46.960]   of a field's assumptions
[02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:48.840]   act as a source of temporary
[02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:51.060]   passive independent-mindedness.
[02:27:51.060 --> 02:27:53.800]   Aspies also seem to have a kind of immunity
[02:27:53.800 --> 02:27:55.040]   to conventional beliefs.
[02:27:55.040 --> 02:27:57.560]   Several I know say that this helps them
[02:27:57.560 --> 02:27:59.400]   to have new ideas.
[02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:01.760]   So the aggressive and the passive,
[02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:04.800]   it's such an interesting way of looking at it.
[02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:07.240]   Perhaps some aspect of this,
[02:28:07.240 --> 02:28:08.240]   at least in the story you tell,
[02:28:08.240 --> 02:28:09.680]   there's some passive aspect,
[02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:13.560]   where you're like not even acknowledging,
[02:28:13.560 --> 02:28:15.560]   not even caring that there was rules,
[02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:18.160]   just kind of asking the simple question
[02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:19.600]   and taking the simple action.
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:21.720]   - I think that is funny.
[02:28:21.720 --> 02:28:23.080]   That was an essay I read,
[02:28:23.080 --> 02:28:24.700]   and we're doing just a snippet of it,
[02:28:24.700 --> 02:28:26.120]   but I would encourage anyone listening
[02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:28.020]   to go and find it and read the entire thing,
[02:28:28.020 --> 02:28:31.120]   because it's something that really spoke to me
[02:28:31.120 --> 02:28:34.480]   as I was transitioning into my new career now,
[02:28:34.480 --> 02:28:35.400]   and I just loved it.
[02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:37.280]   But when we were talking about
[02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:39.200]   why certain people
[02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:41.220]   who don't have traditional qualifications
[02:28:41.220 --> 02:28:43.960]   are able to come in and do incredible work
[02:28:43.960 --> 02:28:46.140]   and solve complex problems,
[02:28:46.140 --> 02:28:47.220]   it made me think of that essay,
[02:28:47.220 --> 02:28:48.340]   which is why I shared it.
[02:28:48.340 --> 02:28:50.840]   And I think that in the context
[02:28:50.840 --> 02:28:53.040]   of the work that I was doing here,
[02:28:53.040 --> 02:28:57.400]   perhaps not having the historical context
[02:28:57.400 --> 02:28:58.780]   became an advantage,
[02:28:58.780 --> 02:29:01.180]   and obviously went back and then tried to study it.
[02:29:01.180 --> 02:29:03.160]   But if you go into a problem,
[02:29:03.160 --> 02:29:04.160]   I always find that,
[02:29:04.160 --> 02:29:06.160]   especially in the political realm,
[02:29:06.160 --> 02:29:08.440]   my favorite political issues
[02:29:08.440 --> 02:29:11.920]   are ones where they're contrarian by being obvious.
[02:29:11.920 --> 02:29:14.120]   And sometimes they feel very intuitive,
[02:29:14.120 --> 02:29:15.560]   and so you take them on.
[02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:16.980]   There's always a lot of resistance
[02:29:16.980 --> 02:29:19.440]   when you go against something that's been accepted
[02:29:19.440 --> 02:29:23.640]   as the way that you're supposed to do things.
[02:29:23.640 --> 02:29:25.840]   And I came to learn over the course
[02:29:25.840 --> 02:29:26.840]   of my time in government
[02:29:26.840 --> 02:29:30.120]   that when everyone was agreeing with what I was doing,
[02:29:30.120 --> 02:29:32.060]   then it actually made me more nervous,
[02:29:32.060 --> 02:29:34.640]   because I felt like you have these problems,
[02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:36.800]   they haven't been solved for a long time,
[02:29:36.800 --> 02:29:38.960]   and then if you take the same approach as others,
[02:29:38.960 --> 02:29:40.420]   you're gonna fail just like they did.
[02:29:40.420 --> 02:29:42.400]   So taking a different approach
[02:29:42.400 --> 02:29:43.800]   doesn't mean you're gonna succeed,
[02:29:43.800 --> 02:29:45.280]   but at least if you fail,
[02:29:45.280 --> 02:29:47.640]   you're gonna fail in an original way.
[02:29:47.640 --> 02:29:50.260]   And so I did like this a lot,
[02:29:50.260 --> 02:29:53.760]   and I think that what I saw
[02:29:53.760 --> 02:29:56.360]   was the people who were very good at getting things done
[02:29:56.360 --> 02:29:58.300]   that hadn't been done before
[02:29:58.300 --> 02:30:00.600]   were people who came with different qualifications,
[02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:02.120]   different perspectives,
[02:30:02.120 --> 02:30:04.360]   and they came in and really worked the problem
[02:30:04.360 --> 02:30:05.480]   in untraditional ways.
[02:30:05.480 --> 02:30:07.400]   And so I think in the Middle East,
[02:30:07.400 --> 02:30:09.640]   I came in with a very different approach
[02:30:09.640 --> 02:30:10.980]   than people before me,
[02:30:10.980 --> 02:30:12.520]   not because I came in deliberately
[02:30:12.520 --> 02:30:13.680]   trying to do it differently,
[02:30:13.680 --> 02:30:17.400]   but because I came in trying to listen and understand
[02:30:17.400 --> 02:30:20.360]   from people why the problem hadn't been solved,
[02:30:20.360 --> 02:30:23.000]   and then think from a first principles perspective
[02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.320]   on what's the right perspective today,
[02:30:25.320 --> 02:30:27.160]   not based on what happened 50 years ago,
[02:30:27.160 --> 02:30:29.560]   or not based on what somebody's feelings who were hurt,
[02:30:29.560 --> 02:30:31.880]   but what's the right thing to make people's lives better,
[02:30:31.880 --> 02:30:34.000]   to make the world a safer
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:37.000]   and more prosperous place tomorrow.
[02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:40.520]   - So if we can go back to MPS for a little bit,
[02:30:40.520 --> 02:30:42.880]   from the person to the vision,
[02:30:42.880 --> 02:30:45.040]   there's something called Vision 2030
[02:30:45.040 --> 02:30:47.920]   about his vision for Saudi Arabia in the future.
[02:30:47.920 --> 02:30:50.560]   Can you maybe look from his perspective,
[02:30:50.560 --> 02:30:53.480]   what is his vision for the region?
[02:30:53.480 --> 02:30:54.960]   - Sure, so it's funny,
[02:30:54.960 --> 02:30:58.740]   we were talking before about how we wish leaders
[02:30:58.740 --> 02:31:01.760]   would set big audacious goals and take on big things.
[02:31:01.760 --> 02:31:04.880]   Well, that's what he did with Vision 2030.
[02:31:04.880 --> 02:31:05.840]   When he was young, and again,
[02:31:05.840 --> 02:31:07.520]   this is something that was derided,
[02:31:07.520 --> 02:31:09.640]   and a lot of people were very skeptical of it,
[02:31:09.640 --> 02:31:11.840]   but the people who actually picked it up and read it
[02:31:11.840 --> 02:31:15.160]   said this is a very thoughtful plan that's very achievable.
[02:31:15.160 --> 02:31:16.720]   So he studied his country and said,
[02:31:16.720 --> 02:31:19.120]   "What's our place in the world?
[02:31:19.120 --> 02:31:20.200]   "What are our advantages?
[02:31:20.200 --> 02:31:21.880]   "What are our disadvantages?"
[02:31:21.880 --> 02:31:24.880]   And then he set publicly KPIs
[02:31:24.880 --> 02:31:26.680]   that he wanted to hold his country to,
[02:31:26.680 --> 02:31:28.520]   and then put in place plans and committees,
[02:31:28.520 --> 02:31:31.100]   and really worked hard to push things in that direction,
[02:31:31.100 --> 02:31:33.240]   which was pretty remarkable.
[02:31:33.240 --> 02:31:34.780]   I think that it's something, when I saw it,
[02:31:34.780 --> 02:31:37.020]   I thought it was very refreshing.
[02:31:37.020 --> 02:31:40.160]   I said, "Wait, in America, why don't we all have set goals?
[02:31:40.160 --> 02:31:41.880]   "Why don't we have KPIs?"
[02:31:41.880 --> 02:31:43.800]   And I do think that it's something that most countries,
[02:31:43.800 --> 02:31:45.700]   if not all countries, should have, right?
[02:31:45.700 --> 02:31:49.040]   One of my favorite quotes was from "The Alice in Wonderland"
[02:31:49.040 --> 02:31:51.680]   where the Cheshire Cat says,
[02:31:51.680 --> 02:31:52.760]   "If you don't know where you're going,
[02:31:52.760 --> 02:31:54.680]   "it doesn't matter which path you take."
[02:31:54.680 --> 02:31:56.680]   And so I think that that's something
[02:31:56.680 --> 02:31:59.520]   that really helped set them on a good path,
[02:31:59.520 --> 02:32:01.440]   and they've been very successful with it.
[02:32:01.440 --> 02:32:04.600]   One of the things he told me about putting that together
[02:32:04.600 --> 02:32:06.900]   was he said, "My father's generation,
[02:32:06.900 --> 02:32:09.120]   "they created this country from almost nothing.
[02:32:09.120 --> 02:32:11.020]   "They came here, they were a poor country,
[02:32:11.020 --> 02:32:12.840]   "they were Bedouins in the desert,
[02:32:12.840 --> 02:32:13.780]   "and then they look back
[02:32:13.780 --> 02:32:15.560]   "and see what they've done over 50 years,
[02:32:15.560 --> 02:32:18.060]   "and they say it's absolutely remarkable."
[02:32:18.060 --> 02:32:20.120]   He said, "His generation, they come in and they say,
[02:32:20.120 --> 02:32:23.280]   "we're very grateful for everything that's been done today,
[02:32:23.280 --> 02:32:25.900]   "but we have so much opportunity
[02:32:25.900 --> 02:32:27.420]   "that we're not taking advantage of."
[02:32:27.420 --> 02:32:30.400]   And so he's now empowered the next generation
[02:32:30.400 --> 02:32:33.080]   to be ambitious and think big and grow with it.
[02:32:33.080 --> 02:32:35.240]   What that means for his vision for the Middle East
[02:32:35.240 --> 02:32:39.040]   is that the general architecture that should exist,
[02:32:39.040 --> 02:32:41.520]   and now there's excitement in the discussions with Israel
[02:32:41.520 --> 02:32:43.820]   that have advanced, was the general view
[02:32:43.820 --> 02:32:45.960]   of what we thought from a Trump perspective
[02:32:45.960 --> 02:32:47.320]   should be the new Middle East
[02:32:47.320 --> 02:32:50.860]   is having an economic and security corridor
[02:32:50.860 --> 02:32:55.040]   all the way from Haifam to Muscat, from Oman to Israel,
[02:32:55.040 --> 02:32:56.400]   where basically you go through,
[02:32:56.400 --> 02:33:00.680]   and if you can create a security area
[02:33:00.680 --> 02:33:03.480]   where people can live free of fear of terrorism
[02:33:03.480 --> 02:33:06.200]   and of conflict, the Middle East for the last 20 years
[02:33:06.200 --> 02:33:10.680]   has been a sinkhole for arms, for death, for terrorism.
[02:33:10.680 --> 02:33:11.880]   It's been awful.
[02:33:11.880 --> 02:33:14.880]   It's been a big national security threat for America,
[02:33:14.880 --> 02:33:18.440]   a big place where our treasure is gone.
[02:33:18.440 --> 02:33:21.920]   We've had a lot of our young, amazing American soldiers
[02:33:21.920 --> 02:33:23.800]   killed in action there,
[02:33:23.800 --> 02:33:26.220]   and the same thing for the Arab countries as well.
[02:33:26.220 --> 02:33:29.640]   So if we can create a security architecture for that region,
[02:33:29.640 --> 02:33:31.860]   and then we can create economic integration
[02:33:31.860 --> 02:33:33.380]   between all of the different countries,
[02:33:33.380 --> 02:33:35.800]   I mean, the amount of innovation happening in Israel
[02:33:35.800 --> 02:33:36.680]   is unbelievable.
[02:33:36.680 --> 02:33:38.560]   Think of it like Silicon Valley's
[02:33:38.560 --> 02:33:40.700]   not connected to the rest of California.
[02:33:40.700 --> 02:33:42.220]   You have a very young population,
[02:33:42.220 --> 02:33:44.120]   a very digital savvy population.
[02:33:44.120 --> 02:33:45.800]   You have a lot of resources.
[02:33:45.800 --> 02:33:48.120]   And so if you can get that whole set,
[02:33:48.120 --> 02:33:50.000]   the potential for it is unbelievable.
[02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.040]   I do think that that's his ultimate vision
[02:33:52.040 --> 02:33:54.920]   is to become a really strong country economically,
[02:33:54.920 --> 02:33:56.040]   and then to become a place
[02:33:56.040 --> 02:33:58.320]   where you could be funding advancements in science,
[02:33:58.320 --> 02:33:59.440]   advancements in humanity,
[02:33:59.440 --> 02:34:01.480]   advancements in artificial intelligence,
[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:04.160]   and think about ways to be a positive influence
[02:34:04.160 --> 02:34:05.580]   in the world.
[02:34:05.580 --> 02:34:07.480]   - So a difficult question,
[02:34:07.480 --> 02:34:12.480]   one big source of tension between the United States and Saudi
[02:34:12.480 --> 02:34:15.880]   is the case of Jamal Khashoggi.
[02:34:15.880 --> 02:34:18.080]   I was wondering if you can comment
[02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:20.400]   on what MBS has said about it to you.
[02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:21.600]   You've spoken to him about it,
[02:34:21.600 --> 02:34:23.760]   and what MBS has said about it publicly
[02:34:23.760 --> 02:34:25.320]   on "60 Minutes" and after.
[02:34:25.320 --> 02:34:27.760]   - Yeah, so what he said to me was no different
[02:34:27.760 --> 02:34:29.540]   than what he ultimately said on "60 Minutes,"
[02:34:29.540 --> 02:34:34.320]   which was, you know, as somebody helping lead this country,
[02:34:34.320 --> 02:34:35.480]   I bear responsibility,
[02:34:35.480 --> 02:34:38.680]   and I'm gonna make sure that those who were involved
[02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:39.720]   are brought to justice,
[02:34:39.720 --> 02:34:43.400]   and I'm gonna make sure that we put in place reforms
[02:34:43.400 --> 02:34:45.200]   to make sure things like this don't happen again.
[02:34:45.200 --> 02:34:48.440]   It was a horrible situation that occurred.
[02:34:48.440 --> 02:34:51.420]   What I saw from him after that was just a doubling
[02:34:51.420 --> 02:34:54.880]   and a tripling down on the positive things he was doing,
[02:34:54.880 --> 02:34:58.520]   figuring out ways to kind of continue to modernize society,
[02:34:58.520 --> 02:35:00.840]   build opportunity in the kingdom,
[02:35:00.840 --> 02:35:02.440]   and to continue to be a better ally
[02:35:02.440 --> 02:35:04.000]   to all the different countries
[02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.200]   that wanted to be aligned with them.
[02:35:06.200 --> 02:35:09.280]   - One thing I learned from this case
[02:35:09.280 --> 02:35:13.380]   is how one particular situation, a tragedy,
[02:35:13.380 --> 02:35:17.520]   can destroy so much progress and the possibility of progress
[02:35:17.520 --> 02:35:21.240]   and the possibility of connection between the bridges
[02:35:21.240 --> 02:35:23.280]   that are built between different nations.
[02:35:24.480 --> 02:35:28.040]   And how narratives around that can take off
[02:35:28.040 --> 02:35:31.880]   and take such a long time to repair.
[02:35:31.880 --> 02:35:34.080]   And you've worked with this in the Middle East
[02:35:34.080 --> 02:35:36.940]   with Israel and so on, how the history,
[02:35:36.940 --> 02:35:40.440]   the narratives, the stories,
[02:35:40.440 --> 02:35:44.560]   they kind of have this momentum that's so hard to break,
[02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:47.960]   even when you have new leaders, new blood,
[02:35:47.960 --> 02:35:51.040]   new ideas that come in.
[02:35:51.040 --> 02:35:53.900]   And it's just sad to see that, yes,
[02:35:53.900 --> 02:35:57.880]   this tragedy happens,
[02:35:57.880 --> 02:36:01.200]   but it doesn't mean that you can't make progress.
[02:36:01.200 --> 02:36:05.400]   I don't know if you have kind of lessons from that,
[02:36:05.400 --> 02:36:08.520]   just how much of a dramatic impact it had
[02:36:08.520 --> 02:36:12.080]   on creating tension between the United States and Saudi,
[02:36:12.080 --> 02:36:13.800]   and in general in the Middle East,
[02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:19.120]   that somehow Saudi's not a friend,
[02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:22.760]   but is against the ideals and the values
[02:36:22.760 --> 02:36:24.200]   of the United States.
[02:36:24.200 --> 02:36:26.700]   - Yeah, so it definitely created massive tension,
[02:36:26.700 --> 02:36:30.120]   and it became a very high-profile action
[02:36:30.120 --> 02:36:32.400]   that actually overshadowed a lot of the good work
[02:36:32.400 --> 02:36:33.880]   that was being done in the region
[02:36:33.880 --> 02:36:36.800]   and a lot of the progress we were making.
[02:36:36.800 --> 02:36:38.120]   But when you think about this,
[02:36:38.120 --> 02:36:40.360]   or you think about the other issues
[02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:42.840]   that we've gone through today,
[02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:44.360]   I think the general framework
[02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:46.200]   that I always try to approach things with
[02:36:46.200 --> 02:36:49.520]   is you can't change what happened yesterday,
[02:36:49.520 --> 02:36:51.020]   you can only learn from it,
[02:36:51.020 --> 02:36:54.040]   and then you can change how you deal with tomorrow.
[02:36:54.040 --> 02:36:57.200]   And when I think about the people in power,
[02:36:57.200 --> 02:36:59.720]   what do I hope that they're spending their time focused on?
[02:36:59.720 --> 02:37:01.380]   Number two basic things.
[02:37:01.380 --> 02:37:04.720]   Number one is how do I create safety and security
[02:37:04.720 --> 02:37:08.160]   for my people and for the world?
[02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:10.260]   And then how do I give people the opportunity
[02:37:10.260 --> 02:37:11.680]   to live a better life?
[02:37:11.680 --> 02:37:14.220]   And so when things like this happen,
[02:37:14.220 --> 02:37:18.760]   obviously there are certain reactions that are appropriate,
[02:37:18.760 --> 02:37:21.380]   but ultimately you have to think through
[02:37:21.380 --> 02:37:23.180]   how do you not allow the paradigm
[02:37:23.180 --> 02:37:24.800]   that you're creating in the world
[02:37:24.800 --> 02:37:28.580]   to lead to worse outcomes than would happen otherwise?
[02:37:28.580 --> 02:37:31.120]   And so when I would think about foreign policy in general,
[02:37:31.120 --> 02:37:34.620]   one of the differences between foreign policy and business
[02:37:34.620 --> 02:37:37.300]   is that in business, the conclusion of a problem said,
[02:37:37.300 --> 02:37:41.160]   you finish a deal, you either have a company or a property,
[02:37:41.160 --> 02:37:44.420]   or if you sell it, you have less to do and more capital,
[02:37:44.420 --> 02:37:46.680]   hopefully if it's successful, right?
[02:37:46.680 --> 02:37:50.140]   In a political deal, it's always about paradigms.
[02:37:50.140 --> 02:37:51.440]   So the end of a problem set
[02:37:51.440 --> 02:37:53.580]   is always the beginning of a new paradigm.
[02:37:53.580 --> 02:37:54.980]   And you're always thinking through
[02:37:54.980 --> 02:37:58.300]   how do you create an environment that leads to
[02:37:58.300 --> 02:38:01.680]   hopefully the best amount of positive outcomes
[02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:04.780]   that could occur versus creating a paradigm
[02:38:04.780 --> 02:38:06.500]   that will lead to negative outcomes.
[02:38:06.500 --> 02:38:10.860]   So bad things happen a lot in the world
[02:38:10.860 --> 02:38:13.580]   and you have to make sure that when those happen,
[02:38:13.580 --> 02:38:15.420]   people are held accountable for it,
[02:38:15.420 --> 02:38:18.000]   but you also don't wanna make sure that in the process
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:21.140]   of making sure that there's accountability for these actions,
[02:38:21.140 --> 02:38:23.480]   you don't set a lot of progress
[02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:24.920]   that the world is making back
[02:38:24.920 --> 02:38:29.840]   that will lead to worse off situation for many more people.
[02:38:29.840 --> 02:38:33.660]   - If we can go back to the incredible work
[02:38:33.660 --> 02:38:36.580]   with Abraham Accords and Israel in the Middle East,
[02:38:36.580 --> 02:38:41.500]   first, the big question about peace.
[02:38:41.500 --> 02:38:44.020]   Why is it so difficult to achieve peace
[02:38:44.020 --> 02:38:45.560]   in this part of the world?
[02:38:45.560 --> 02:38:46.900]   Between Israel and Palestine
[02:38:46.900 --> 02:38:48.500]   and between Israel and the other countries
[02:38:48.500 --> 02:38:52.740]   in the Middle East or any sort of peace-like agreements?
[02:38:52.740 --> 02:38:54.340]   - If I had to give you the most simple answer,
[02:38:54.340 --> 02:38:56.100]   I would say that it's structural.
[02:38:56.100 --> 02:38:59.140]   And if you go back to the incentive structure
[02:38:59.140 --> 02:39:01.560]   of different leaders, this whole peace process
[02:39:01.560 --> 02:39:04.220]   between Israel and the Palestinians,
[02:39:04.220 --> 02:39:07.440]   and again, I've gotten criticized for saying this,
[02:39:07.440 --> 02:39:09.140]   but it's what I believe, so I'm gonna say it,
[02:39:09.140 --> 02:39:11.820]   is that the incentive structure was all wrong.
[02:39:11.820 --> 02:39:14.820]   And when I went before the United Nations Security Council
[02:39:14.820 --> 02:39:16.940]   to discuss the peace plan that I proposed,
[02:39:16.940 --> 02:39:19.140]   which again, was more of an operational plan
[02:39:19.140 --> 02:39:20.340]   and it was a pragmatic plan.
[02:39:20.340 --> 02:39:22.860]   It was over 180 pages in detail.
[02:39:22.860 --> 02:39:26.020]   In politics, people don't like putting forward detail
[02:39:26.020 --> 02:39:27.780]   because it just gives a lot of places
[02:39:27.780 --> 02:39:29.500]   for you to get criticized on.
[02:39:29.500 --> 02:39:32.300]   Nobody actually criticized the detail of my plan.
[02:39:32.300 --> 02:39:35.720]   They just criticized the fact that it was coming from us
[02:39:35.720 --> 02:39:38.060]   and didn't want to debate the merits
[02:39:38.060 --> 02:39:40.220]   of the operational pieces of it.
[02:39:40.220 --> 02:39:45.220]   So I created a slide where I showed from the Oslo Accords
[02:39:45.220 --> 02:39:46.700]   till the day I was there,
[02:39:46.700 --> 02:39:48.140]   all the different peace discussions.
[02:39:48.140 --> 02:39:50.260]   I put a dove in the slide for those.
[02:39:50.260 --> 02:39:52.420]   And then I put a tank for every time there was a war
[02:39:52.420 --> 02:39:53.420]   'cause there was always skirmishes
[02:39:53.420 --> 02:39:56.940]   between Hamas and Hezbollah and the Palestinians.
[02:39:56.940 --> 02:39:58.660]   And then I showed two lines and they both went
[02:39:58.660 --> 02:40:02.300]   from the bottom of the page all the way up like this.
[02:40:02.300 --> 02:40:04.820]   One of the lines was Israeli settlements.
[02:40:04.820 --> 02:40:07.580]   So every time a negotiation failed,
[02:40:07.580 --> 02:40:09.620]   Israel was able to get more land.
[02:40:09.620 --> 02:40:12.740]   And then the other one was money to the Palestinians.
[02:40:12.740 --> 02:40:15.000]   And I said, every time a negotiation failed,
[02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.460]   the Palestinians would get more money.
[02:40:17.460 --> 02:40:18.740]   The problem with that money though
[02:40:18.740 --> 02:40:21.340]   was that it wasn't going to the people.
[02:40:21.340 --> 02:40:22.660]   Some of it would make its way down,
[02:40:22.660 --> 02:40:24.360]   but most of it was going to the politicians.
[02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:26.620]   You had leadership of the Palestinians
[02:40:26.620 --> 02:40:28.180]   who was basically, I think at that point,
[02:40:28.180 --> 02:40:30.240]   it was in like the 16th year of a four-year term.
[02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:32.300]   So it wasn't democratically elected.
[02:40:32.300 --> 02:40:33.740]   And a lot of what I tried to show
[02:40:33.740 --> 02:40:36.040]   was that there was no rule of law.
[02:40:36.040 --> 02:40:37.680]   There was no judicial system.
[02:40:37.680 --> 02:40:39.360]   There were no property rights.
[02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:41.460]   And there was no opportunity or hope
[02:40:41.460 --> 02:40:42.980]   for the people to live a better life.
[02:40:42.980 --> 02:40:47.140]   And so all of the envoys to date
[02:40:47.140 --> 02:40:49.960]   were basically trained to go and do the same things.
[02:40:49.960 --> 02:40:52.060]   And again, I got massively criticized
[02:40:52.060 --> 02:40:53.740]   by all the previous envoys
[02:40:53.740 --> 02:40:55.840]   for not doing it the same way they did.
[02:40:55.840 --> 02:40:57.740]   But I thought the problem structurally
[02:40:57.740 --> 02:40:59.100]   just didn't make sense.
[02:40:59.100 --> 02:41:02.460]   And so I felt like the incentive structure was all wrong
[02:41:02.460 --> 02:41:04.620]   and I took a different approach.
[02:41:04.620 --> 02:41:07.060]   - And so what's the different approach?
[02:41:07.060 --> 02:41:08.780]   - I started writing down a document.
[02:41:08.780 --> 02:41:10.820]   These are the 11 issues,
[02:41:10.820 --> 02:41:13.800]   but there's really only three issues that matter.
[02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:16.700]   I said, just tell me what you think the compromise is
[02:41:16.700 --> 02:41:18.340]   that you think the other side could live with
[02:41:18.340 --> 02:41:19.760]   that you would accept.
[02:41:19.760 --> 02:41:21.940]   And it was very hard to get them talking about this.
[02:41:21.940 --> 02:41:23.420]   Oh, you have to go back to 1972.
[02:41:23.420 --> 02:41:24.620]   You have to go back to 1982.
[02:41:24.620 --> 02:41:26.020]   You have to go back to 2001.
[02:41:26.020 --> 02:41:26.860]   You have to go to camp.
[02:41:26.860 --> 02:41:28.460]   And I was just like, I don't need a headache
[02:41:28.460 --> 02:41:29.540]   and I don't need a history lesson.
[02:41:29.540 --> 02:41:30.820]   Just I want a very simple thing.
[02:41:30.820 --> 02:41:35.460]   Here today in 2017, what's the outcome that you would accept?
[02:41:35.460 --> 02:41:38.260]   And I was dealing with their negotiators,
[02:41:38.260 --> 02:41:39.860]   their back channel secret negotiators,
[02:41:39.860 --> 02:41:40.780]   their double secret.
[02:41:40.780 --> 02:41:43.040]   And I was just like, this whole thing is like,
[02:41:43.040 --> 02:41:45.880]   it's a process created where nobody wants to talk about
[02:41:45.880 --> 02:41:48.700]   the actual solution.
[02:41:48.700 --> 02:41:51.100]   So coming from the business world, I said, okay,
[02:41:51.100 --> 02:41:53.260]   let me just write down a proposed solution
[02:41:53.260 --> 02:41:54.700]   that I think is fair.
[02:41:54.700 --> 02:41:56.060]   And let me have each side react.
[02:41:56.060 --> 02:41:57.880]   Like, don't tell me about theoretical things.
[02:41:57.880 --> 02:42:00.780]   Like tell me, I want to move the line from here to here.
[02:42:00.780 --> 02:42:01.700]   I want to change this word.
[02:42:01.700 --> 02:42:04.480]   So I tried to make it much more tactical.
[02:42:04.480 --> 02:42:08.360]   And what I realized was like, the Palestinians,
[02:42:08.360 --> 02:42:11.320]   they'd worked so hard to get the Arab world
[02:42:11.320 --> 02:42:14.320]   to stay with the line of the Arab Peace Initiative.
[02:42:14.320 --> 02:42:17.080]   And so I went back and I read the Arab Peace Initiative.
[02:42:17.080 --> 02:42:18.840]   It was 10 lines and it didn't have any detail.
[02:42:18.840 --> 02:42:20.040]   So it was a concept.
[02:42:20.040 --> 02:42:21.500]   And so they liked that concept
[02:42:21.500 --> 02:42:23.560]   because it allowed them to reject everything.
[02:42:23.560 --> 02:42:24.600]   They kept getting more money.
[02:42:24.600 --> 02:42:27.080]   I mean, Bibi Netanyahu, who runs
[02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:29.040]   one of the most incredible economies in the world,
[02:42:29.040 --> 02:42:32.420]   who runs an incredible superpower militarily
[02:42:32.420 --> 02:42:34.580]   for the size of their country,
[02:42:34.580 --> 02:42:36.240]   he would fly to Washington to meet us
[02:42:36.240 --> 02:42:39.080]   and he'd be taking a commercial El Al plane.
[02:42:39.080 --> 02:42:42.100]   Abbas, who runs a refugee organization,
[02:42:42.100 --> 02:42:43.440]   a refugee group, right,
[02:42:43.440 --> 02:42:45.220]   that claims that they don't have a state
[02:42:45.220 --> 02:42:47.920]   that gets billions of dollars in aid every year
[02:42:47.920 --> 02:42:48.760]   from the global community,
[02:42:48.760 --> 02:42:51.680]   would fly in a $60 million Boeing BBJ.
[02:42:51.680 --> 02:42:55.240]   So the whole thing was just very corrupt and off.
[02:42:55.240 --> 02:42:57.920]   And I do think that that's why it,
[02:42:57.920 --> 02:43:01.020]   I don't think people were incentivized to solve it,
[02:43:01.020 --> 02:43:02.140]   to be honest.
[02:43:02.140 --> 02:43:05.120]   - What do you think an actual plan on that part,
[02:43:05.120 --> 02:43:09.920]   if you can, just before we talk about Abraham Accords,
[02:43:09.920 --> 02:43:11.920]   if there is a peace plan that works
[02:43:11.920 --> 02:43:13.200]   between Israel and Palestine,
[02:43:13.200 --> 02:43:15.440]   what do you think it looks like?
[02:43:15.440 --> 02:43:17.660]   - You have to separate it into two different issues.
[02:43:17.660 --> 02:43:19.440]   And I think that that's actually how we came
[02:43:19.440 --> 02:43:21.180]   to the Abraham Accords is that,
[02:43:21.180 --> 02:43:24.120]   I tell the story in the book
[02:43:24.120 --> 02:43:26.400]   and it was one of my favorite experiences
[02:43:26.400 --> 02:43:27.760]   during my time in diplomacy
[02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:30.320]   where I went to meet with Sultan Qaboos,
[02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:32.300]   who was the Sultan of Oman.
[02:43:32.300 --> 02:43:33.820]   And we fly out there
[02:43:33.820 --> 02:43:36.060]   because he'd had a secret meeting with Bibi.
[02:43:36.060 --> 02:43:39.260]   And I thought maybe he was open to normalizing with Israel.
[02:43:39.260 --> 02:43:40.380]   So after he meets with Bibi,
[02:43:40.380 --> 02:43:42.780]   he calls me and says, "I want you to come see me."
[02:43:42.780 --> 02:43:44.740]   So I go over to see him.
[02:43:44.740 --> 02:43:46.080]   And again, I tell the story,
[02:43:46.080 --> 02:43:48.780]   it was a crazy night and all these different areas.
[02:43:48.780 --> 02:43:51.060]   But when I was talking to him,
[02:43:51.060 --> 02:43:53.020]   he basically says to me,
[02:43:53.020 --> 02:43:55.220]   "I feel badly for the Palestinian people
[02:43:55.220 --> 02:43:58.660]   that they carry with them the burden of the Muslim world."
[02:43:58.660 --> 02:44:00.180]   And that line just like stuck with me.
[02:44:00.180 --> 02:44:02.700]   And a couple of days later, I was thinking about it.
[02:44:02.700 --> 02:44:04.060]   And I said, "Wait a minute,
[02:44:04.060 --> 02:44:07.580]   who elected the Palestinian people
[02:44:07.580 --> 02:44:10.880]   to represent the Muslim world on the Al-Aqsa Mosque?"
[02:44:10.880 --> 02:44:14.520]   And so the reason why I felt like it had never been solved
[02:44:14.520 --> 02:44:15.480]   was it was a riddle, A,
[02:44:15.480 --> 02:44:18.160]   that I believed was designed to not be solved.
[02:44:18.160 --> 02:44:20.360]   But B, you were conflating two separate issues.
[02:44:20.360 --> 02:44:23.320]   You had the issue between Israel and the Muslim world,
[02:44:23.320 --> 02:44:25.740]   which really was the issue of the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
[02:44:25.740 --> 02:44:28.100]   And then you had just a territorial dispute,
[02:44:28.100 --> 02:44:29.380]   which throughout history,
[02:44:29.380 --> 02:44:30.900]   you have lots of territorial disputes
[02:44:30.900 --> 02:44:33.340]   and they're usually resolved in different ways.
[02:44:33.340 --> 02:44:36.480]   So if you go back to the Israeli-Palestinian issue,
[02:44:36.480 --> 02:44:38.860]   there's just a couple of components you need to solve.
[02:44:38.860 --> 02:44:41.300]   Number one is territorial contiguity, right?
[02:44:41.300 --> 02:44:43.320]   You need to figure out where do you draw the lines?
[02:44:43.320 --> 02:44:45.220]   And that's something that,
[02:44:45.220 --> 02:44:48.260]   you can talk about what people were owed 70 years ago,
[02:44:48.260 --> 02:44:50.140]   but it's much more productive to say,
[02:44:50.140 --> 02:44:52.860]   "This is what you can make work today."
[02:44:52.860 --> 02:44:54.340]   And that's kind of what we did.
[02:44:54.340 --> 02:44:56.460]   We literally spent months and months drawing a map
[02:44:56.460 --> 02:44:57.500]   and we put something out,
[02:44:57.500 --> 02:44:59.000]   probably change a couple of lines here and there,
[02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:02.260]   but by and large, it was a very pragmatic solution
[02:45:02.260 --> 02:45:03.100]   that I think could work.
[02:45:03.100 --> 02:45:04.460]   And I think it could work for the safety
[02:45:04.460 --> 02:45:07.280]   and security of Israel, which was number one.
[02:45:07.280 --> 02:45:09.080]   So first issue is drawing a map.
[02:45:09.080 --> 02:45:10.620]   Second issue is security.
[02:45:10.620 --> 02:45:14.460]   Again, Israel, and again, this is one issue
[02:45:14.460 --> 02:45:16.300]   we were incredibly sympathetic with Israel,
[02:45:16.300 --> 02:45:19.660]   which is you can't expect a prime minister of Israel
[02:45:19.660 --> 02:45:21.580]   to make a deal where he's gonna make his people
[02:45:21.580 --> 02:45:23.220]   less secure than before.
[02:45:23.220 --> 02:45:25.580]   So we worked very closely with them on a security apparatus.
[02:45:25.580 --> 02:45:27.280]   We laid something out that I think
[02:45:27.280 --> 02:45:29.700]   would keep the whole area safer
[02:45:29.700 --> 02:45:31.260]   and it would make sure Israel was safe
[02:45:31.260 --> 02:45:33.020]   and also keep the Palestinian issue safe.
[02:45:33.020 --> 02:45:34.500]   So you need security.
[02:45:34.500 --> 02:45:36.140]   Number three was the religious sites.
[02:45:36.140 --> 02:45:39.140]   And that was one that was actually always made
[02:45:39.140 --> 02:45:42.580]   much more complicated by people, the Al-Aqsa Mosque,
[02:45:42.580 --> 02:45:44.300]   because you basically have Haram al-Sharif,
[02:45:44.300 --> 02:45:46.000]   which is a place where the mosque was built
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:47.640]   in the seventh or eighth century.
[02:45:47.640 --> 02:45:51.260]   But originally it was where the Holy of Holies were
[02:45:51.260 --> 02:45:52.980]   and the Beit Hamigdash for the Jewish people.
[02:45:52.980 --> 02:45:55.040]   So, and then, compounding by the fact
[02:45:55.040 --> 02:45:57.340]   that you have all of the Christian holy sites in Jerusalem,
[02:45:57.340 --> 02:46:00.940]   it's a city that should be bringing everyone together,
[02:46:00.940 --> 02:46:03.940]   but in fact has become a place where you have wars
[02:46:03.940 --> 02:46:07.380]   and hatred and a lot of different conflicts
[02:46:07.380 --> 02:46:08.900]   that have arisen because of it.
[02:46:08.900 --> 02:46:11.060]   But what I said was instead of fighting over concepts
[02:46:11.060 --> 02:46:14.180]   of sovereignty, which is interesting how I got to the notion
[02:46:14.180 --> 02:46:16.260]   that this wasn't really the big issue,
[02:46:16.260 --> 02:46:17.460]   I basically just operationally,
[02:46:17.460 --> 02:46:18.540]   why don't we just make it simple?
[02:46:18.540 --> 02:46:20.620]   Let everyone come and be able to worship
[02:46:20.620 --> 02:46:23.140]   as long as they're being able to worship peacefully.
[02:46:23.140 --> 02:46:26.760]   So that's really the contours of it.
[02:46:26.760 --> 02:46:29.320]   And what the Palestinians have done is they've kind of
[02:46:29.320 --> 02:46:31.460]   deflected from a lot of their own shortcomings.
[02:46:31.460 --> 02:46:33.360]   And a lot of the Arab leaders did that as well,
[02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:35.600]   kind of in the pre-Abraham Accord days,
[02:46:35.600 --> 02:46:37.760]   by kind of allowing this issue to be so prevalent.
[02:46:37.760 --> 02:46:40.920]   So one thing I'll say on the Palestinians is that,
[02:46:40.920 --> 02:46:44.640]   what we tried to do by laying out a plan was we said,
[02:46:44.640 --> 02:46:49.480]   okay, what are the reasons why the Palestinian people
[02:46:49.480 --> 02:46:52.120]   are not having the lives that they deserve?
[02:46:52.120 --> 02:46:53.080]   And I'll give you a couple of things.
[02:46:53.080 --> 02:46:57.460]   One is I studied the economies of Jordan,
[02:46:57.460 --> 02:47:00.860]   West Bank, Gaza, Egypt, Morocco.
[02:47:00.860 --> 02:47:03.200]   This was numbers from like 2019.
[02:47:03.200 --> 02:47:05.940]   But what was interesting was the GDP per capita
[02:47:05.940 --> 02:47:08.560]   of somebody living in the West Bank
[02:47:08.560 --> 02:47:10.180]   was actually the same as Jordan.
[02:47:10.180 --> 02:47:12.860]   And it was actually more than somebody living in Egypt.
[02:47:12.860 --> 02:47:16.260]   And the debt of GDP that the Palestinians had
[02:47:16.260 --> 02:47:18.880]   was like 30, 40% compared to Egypt,
[02:47:18.880 --> 02:47:22.500]   which is at like 130% and Jordan, which was at 110%.
[02:47:22.500 --> 02:47:24.420]   And Lebanon, which is at 200%.
[02:47:24.420 --> 02:47:28.240]   And so, you're in a situation where a lot of this stuff
[02:47:28.240 --> 02:47:30.880]   didn't make sense, but if you draw lines,
[02:47:30.880 --> 02:47:33.260]   create institutions where Palestinian people
[02:47:33.260 --> 02:47:34.860]   can now feel like they have property rights
[02:47:34.860 --> 02:47:36.260]   and have ownership over their place
[02:47:36.260 --> 02:47:39.020]   and let the money flow past the leadership ranks
[02:47:39.020 --> 02:47:41.500]   to the people, let them have jobs,
[02:47:41.500 --> 02:47:43.100]   let them have opportunity,
[02:47:43.100 --> 02:47:45.300]   and then let all Muslims from throughout the world
[02:47:45.300 --> 02:47:48.920]   have access to the mosque and Israel,
[02:47:48.920 --> 02:47:50.660]   making sure that they can control the security,
[02:47:50.660 --> 02:47:52.460]   which I think the Jordanians and a lot of others
[02:47:52.460 --> 02:47:55.420]   want Israel to have strong security control there
[02:47:55.420 --> 02:47:58.220]   to prevent the radicalists and the extremists from coming,
[02:47:58.220 --> 02:48:00.780]   you could have peace there very easily.
[02:48:00.780 --> 02:48:02.900]   - So, there's a lot of things to say here.
[02:48:02.900 --> 02:48:06.540]   One is just to emphasize Al-Aqsa Mosque.
[02:48:06.540 --> 02:48:08.660]   So, this is a holy place,
[02:48:08.660 --> 02:48:11.140]   and this is something in our conversations
[02:48:11.140 --> 02:48:15.620]   and in my own travels, I've seen the importance
[02:48:15.620 --> 02:48:20.060]   of sort of frictionless access to those sites
[02:48:20.060 --> 02:48:21.620]   from the entirety of the Muslim world,
[02:48:21.620 --> 02:48:25.380]   and that's what Abraham, of course, took big leaps on.
[02:48:25.380 --> 02:48:27.820]   Okay, so we'll talk about that a little bit more,
[02:48:27.820 --> 02:48:30.740]   but that's kind of a religious component,
[02:48:30.740 --> 02:48:34.100]   that's a dignity in the religious practice
[02:48:34.100 --> 02:48:35.600]   and faith component.
[02:48:35.600 --> 02:48:38.600]   But then the other thing you mentioned so simply,
[02:48:38.600 --> 02:48:45.820]   which is you have money flow past the leadership ranks.
[02:48:45.820 --> 02:48:48.740]   How do you have money flow past the leadership ranks
[02:48:48.740 --> 02:48:51.580]   in Palestine?
[02:48:51.580 --> 02:48:56.020]   So, make sure that the money that's invested in Palestine,
[02:48:56.020 --> 02:48:58.780]   the West Bank, gets to the people.
[02:48:58.780 --> 02:49:01.380]   - So, to date, all of the aid that's been given
[02:49:01.380 --> 02:49:03.420]   to the Palestinians has been an entitlement.
[02:49:03.420 --> 02:49:04.700]   It's not conditions-based.
[02:49:04.700 --> 02:49:06.100]   It's always just we give the money
[02:49:06.100 --> 02:49:08.020]   and there's no expectations.
[02:49:08.020 --> 02:49:08.860]   It's very simple.
[02:49:08.860 --> 02:49:10.100]   You make the aid conditions-based,
[02:49:10.100 --> 02:49:11.300]   you fight for transparency,
[02:49:11.300 --> 02:49:14.220]   you do it through institutions other than the PA,
[02:49:14.220 --> 02:49:16.340]   or you put reformers into the PA
[02:49:16.340 --> 02:49:18.660]   that will allow it to go down that way.
[02:49:18.660 --> 02:49:20.500]   - PA being the Palestinian Authority,
[02:49:20.500 --> 02:49:21.340]   which is the leadership.
[02:49:21.340 --> 02:49:22.340]   - It's not hard to do.
[02:49:22.340 --> 02:49:24.580]   It just takes people who actually wanna do it.
[02:49:24.580 --> 02:49:27.900]   But I think that the mindset of the international community
[02:49:27.900 --> 02:49:29.500]   has not been let's solve this problem.
[02:49:29.500 --> 02:49:31.340]   It's like, let's just throw a little bit of money.
[02:49:31.340 --> 02:49:32.460]   The money's Novocain.
[02:49:32.460 --> 02:49:34.180]   Let's put a little Novocain on the problem
[02:49:34.180 --> 02:49:35.860]   and let's not have to deal with it.
[02:49:35.860 --> 02:49:38.060]   But nobody's ever said, oh, let's do an accounting
[02:49:38.060 --> 02:49:39.980]   of the $20 billion we've given them
[02:49:39.980 --> 02:49:42.260]   and see how many jobs it's done and where it's gone.
[02:49:42.260 --> 02:49:43.580]   That just hasn't happened.
[02:49:43.580 --> 02:49:46.780]   Again, it's an incredibly corrupt organization.
[02:49:46.780 --> 02:49:49.260]   You think about the post-World War II dynamic.
[02:49:49.260 --> 02:49:50.260]   You had a lot of refugees.
[02:49:50.260 --> 02:49:53.140]   My grandparents were refugees post-World War II.
[02:49:53.140 --> 02:49:55.180]   Every other refugee class has been resettled
[02:49:55.180 --> 02:49:57.880]   and you only have one permanent refugee organization
[02:49:57.880 --> 02:49:59.060]   ever created.
[02:49:59.060 --> 02:49:59.900]   Why was this done?
[02:49:59.900 --> 02:50:01.820]   It was done to perpetuate the conflict
[02:50:01.820 --> 02:50:04.220]   so that a lot of Arab leaders could basically deflect
[02:50:04.220 --> 02:50:06.780]   from a lot of their shortcomings at home.
[02:50:06.780 --> 02:50:08.400]   And so I think for Israel,
[02:50:08.400 --> 02:50:10.180]   they view all these things as existential.
[02:50:10.180 --> 02:50:11.120]   They value their safety.
[02:50:11.120 --> 02:50:13.300]   They've been under attack for a long time.
[02:50:13.300 --> 02:50:16.500]   I do think having a deal where we can say,
[02:50:16.500 --> 02:50:19.380]   how do the Jews and the Muslims come together?
[02:50:19.380 --> 02:50:20.860]   I think King Abdullah from Jordan's
[02:50:20.860 --> 02:50:22.860]   been an incredible custodian for the mosque.
[02:50:22.860 --> 02:50:25.700]   I think everyone in my travels recognized
[02:50:25.700 --> 02:50:27.240]   that he's the right guy for that,
[02:50:27.240 --> 02:50:28.940]   that the King of Jordan should be the custodian
[02:50:28.940 --> 02:50:30.820]   of the mosque.
[02:50:30.820 --> 02:50:32.220]   We should have some kind of framework
[02:50:32.220 --> 02:50:33.380]   to make sure everyone has access.
[02:50:33.380 --> 02:50:35.860]   The more countries that have diplomatic relations
[02:50:35.860 --> 02:50:38.620]   with Israel, the more Muslims and Arabs
[02:50:38.620 --> 02:50:40.580]   that should be able to come and visit.
[02:50:40.580 --> 02:50:43.100]   And by the way, the more you have these normalizations,
[02:50:43.100 --> 02:50:45.100]   think about what that will do to the economy
[02:50:45.100 --> 02:50:47.540]   of the West Bank, where they'll have great hotels,
[02:50:47.540 --> 02:50:50.220]   hospitality, tremendous tourism industry
[02:50:50.220 --> 02:50:52.620]   because of all the Christian, Muslim,
[02:50:52.620 --> 02:50:54.280]   and Jewish holy sites that they have there.
[02:50:54.280 --> 02:50:56.340]   So there's a lot of potential there.
[02:50:56.340 --> 02:50:58.260]   We just have to get unstuck.
[02:50:58.260 --> 02:51:01.980]   I believe that it's so possible
[02:51:01.980 --> 02:51:05.780]   if the leaders wanna make tomorrow better that they can.
[02:51:05.780 --> 02:51:08.820]   And unfortunately, the people who suffer the most
[02:51:08.820 --> 02:51:11.780]   are really, are just the Palestinian people.
[02:51:11.780 --> 02:51:15.220]   And I think that in Gaza, they're hostages to Hamas,
[02:51:15.220 --> 02:51:18.520]   and in the West Bank, they're just held back
[02:51:18.520 --> 02:51:22.500]   because their leadership just is afraid
[02:51:22.500 --> 02:51:26.460]   or too self-interested to give them the opportunity
[02:51:26.460 --> 02:51:31.300]   to change their paradigm and pursue the potential
[02:51:31.300 --> 02:51:32.140]   of what they have.
[02:51:32.140 --> 02:51:35.300]   And by the way, it's an incredibly well-educated population.
[02:51:35.300 --> 02:51:37.860]   It's an incredibly capable population.
[02:51:37.860 --> 02:51:39.740]   And they're right next to Israel, where the economy,
[02:51:39.740 --> 02:51:41.620]   they need everything.
[02:51:41.620 --> 02:51:43.500]   And so the potential should be incredible
[02:51:43.500 --> 02:51:45.940]   if you can just move some of these pieces.
[02:51:45.940 --> 02:51:48.940]   But again, there's still a lot of emotion and hatred
[02:51:48.940 --> 02:51:50.580]   you have to work through as well.
[02:51:50.580 --> 02:51:52.580]   But I do believe that you're not gonna solve that
[02:51:52.580 --> 02:51:53.820]   by litigating the past.
[02:51:53.820 --> 02:51:56.340]   You're only gonna solve that by creating
[02:51:56.340 --> 02:51:58.380]   an exciting paradigm for the future
[02:51:58.380 --> 02:52:01.740]   and getting everyone to buy in and then move towards that.
[02:52:01.740 --> 02:52:04.340]   - And maybe increase the chance of being able
[02:52:04.340 --> 02:52:08.100]   to establish an economy where the entrepreneurs can flourish
[02:52:08.100 --> 02:52:10.820]   in the West Bank and so on in Palestine.
[02:52:10.820 --> 02:52:15.820]   Once the relationship across the Arab world is normalized.
[02:52:15.820 --> 02:52:19.260]   - So one thing on that, which is very interesting,
[02:52:19.260 --> 02:52:23.620]   is when I got into my job in the Middle East,
[02:52:23.620 --> 02:52:26.220]   all the conventional thinkers said to me,
[02:52:26.220 --> 02:52:28.100]   the separation in the Muslim world
[02:52:28.100 --> 02:52:29.980]   is between the Sunnis and the Shias.
[02:52:29.980 --> 02:52:32.020]   And that's really the big divide.
[02:52:32.020 --> 02:52:32.980]   And as I was traveling,
[02:52:32.980 --> 02:52:36.100]   I didn't think there was any divide in that regard.
[02:52:36.100 --> 02:52:38.700]   The divide that I saw was between leaders
[02:52:38.700 --> 02:52:42.380]   who wanted to give a better opportunity for their people
[02:52:42.380 --> 02:52:44.660]   and create economic reforms and opportunity,
[02:52:44.660 --> 02:52:47.980]   and leaders who wanted to use religion or fear
[02:52:47.980 --> 02:52:50.140]   to keep their stronghold on power.
[02:52:50.140 --> 02:52:51.820]   And so if you think about who's not creating
[02:52:51.820 --> 02:52:53.500]   the opportunity for their people,
[02:52:53.500 --> 02:52:56.380]   is the Palestinian leadership and the Iranian leadership.
[02:52:56.380 --> 02:52:58.500]   All the other Arab countries were focused on
[02:52:58.500 --> 02:53:00.720]   how do we give opportunity for our people
[02:53:00.720 --> 02:53:02.420]   to live a better life.
[02:53:02.420 --> 02:53:05.140]   - And there is a big foundation
[02:53:05.140 --> 02:53:07.400]   on which that framework can succeed,
[02:53:07.400 --> 02:53:11.500]   which I think is the, in general,
[02:53:11.500 --> 02:53:15.500]   the idea of Arab-Israeli normalization.
[02:53:15.500 --> 02:53:18.220]   So that's where Abraham Accords come in.
[02:53:18.220 --> 02:53:20.740]   Can you tell the story of that?
[02:53:20.740 --> 02:53:23.220]   - Sure, so it's an amazing thing.
[02:53:23.220 --> 02:53:26.140]   And I sit here today, somebody not in government,
[02:53:26.140 --> 02:53:30.260]   and every day I see another flight that goes between,
[02:53:30.260 --> 02:53:32.580]   or I see an Israeli student studying
[02:53:32.580 --> 02:53:34.620]   at a university in Dubai,
[02:53:34.620 --> 02:53:37.860]   or a new synagogue opening up in Abu Dhabi,
[02:53:37.860 --> 02:53:41.100]   and it just gives me such, or Bahrain,
[02:53:41.100 --> 02:53:43.420]   it gives me such tremendous pride
[02:53:43.420 --> 02:53:46.140]   to see all of the progress that's been made.
[02:53:46.140 --> 02:53:49.540]   How it occurred, part of why I wrote the book
[02:53:49.540 --> 02:53:51.740]   was to put this down for history's sake,
[02:53:51.740 --> 02:53:54.100]   to go through all the different intentional,
[02:53:54.100 --> 02:53:56.820]   unintentional, circumstantial things that occurred.
[02:53:56.820 --> 02:53:59.540]   It's funny, we left government,
[02:53:59.540 --> 02:54:00.380]   there's a lot of people saying,
[02:54:00.380 --> 02:54:01.200]   "Well, this is why I did that."
[02:54:01.200 --> 02:54:03.240]   I said, "I was kind of at the middle of it,
[02:54:03.240 --> 02:54:06.140]   "and I couldn't even perfectly articulate why it happened,"
[02:54:06.140 --> 02:54:09.660]   because it was an evolution of a lot of things.
[02:54:09.660 --> 02:54:13.780]   And I joke that we made peace on Plan C,
[02:54:13.780 --> 02:54:16.700]   but only because we went through the alphabet three times,
[02:54:16.700 --> 02:54:18.940]   failing at every letter, and by the time,
[02:54:18.940 --> 02:54:20.340]   but we didn't give up, and we kept going,
[02:54:20.340 --> 02:54:21.300]   and we got it done.
[02:54:21.300 --> 02:54:24.700]   - And maybe this is a good place to also step back and say,
[02:54:24.700 --> 02:54:27.260]   what is Arab-Israeli normalization?
[02:54:27.260 --> 02:54:28.100]   - Sure.
[02:54:28.100 --> 02:54:29.740]   - What is the state of things,
[02:54:29.740 --> 02:54:31.460]   for people who may not be aware,
[02:54:31.460 --> 02:54:33.640]   before the progress you made?
[02:54:33.640 --> 02:54:35.320]   - That's probably the best place to start.
[02:54:35.320 --> 02:54:37.960]   So what we did is we made a peace deal
[02:54:37.960 --> 02:54:40.760]   between Israel and the United Arab Emirates,
[02:54:40.760 --> 02:54:42.560]   and then Israel and Bahrain.
[02:54:42.560 --> 02:54:44.800]   Then we did a deal with Israel and Sudan,
[02:54:44.800 --> 02:54:47.820]   then Israel and Kosovo, Israel and Morocco,
[02:54:47.820 --> 02:54:49.000]   where basically countries
[02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:50.820]   that didn't recognize each other before,
[02:54:50.820 --> 02:54:52.960]   ended up recognizing each other.
[02:54:52.960 --> 02:54:55.000]   All of these were Muslim-majority countries,
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.480]   and getting them to integrate with Israel
[02:54:57.480 --> 02:54:58.640]   was a very big thing.
[02:54:59.520 --> 02:55:01.740]   The traditional thinking had always been,
[02:55:01.740 --> 02:55:03.580]   was that Muslim Arab countries
[02:55:03.580 --> 02:55:05.780]   would not make peace with Israel
[02:55:05.780 --> 02:55:10.020]   until the Israeli-Palestinian issue was solved.
[02:55:10.020 --> 02:55:12.360]   And what we were able to do is separate the issues,
[02:55:12.360 --> 02:55:15.780]   and then make these connections,
[02:55:15.780 --> 02:55:18.060]   which are leading to amazing interaction
[02:55:18.060 --> 02:55:19.260]   between Jews and Muslims.
[02:55:19.260 --> 02:55:21.060]   So when I think about,
[02:55:21.060 --> 02:55:22.660]   obviously you have national security,
[02:55:22.660 --> 02:55:26.060]   you have emotional benefits from these things,
[02:55:26.060 --> 02:55:29.180]   but the single biggest benefit that I've seen
[02:55:29.180 --> 02:55:34.180]   from the accords is that if you were an Arab or a Muslim,
[02:55:34.180 --> 02:55:39.300]   and you were willing to say positive things about Israel
[02:55:39.300 --> 02:55:41.660]   or the Jews before this came out,
[02:55:41.660 --> 02:55:44.500]   you would've been viciously attacked by the media
[02:55:44.500 --> 02:55:46.140]   or the hordes of influencers
[02:55:46.140 --> 02:55:49.740]   or the extremists in these different countries.
[02:55:49.740 --> 02:55:52.380]   What this did was it brought out into the public
[02:55:52.380 --> 02:55:55.300]   the fact that Jews and Muslims can be together,
[02:55:55.300 --> 02:55:57.580]   and they can be respectful,
[02:55:57.580 --> 02:55:59.300]   they can have meals together,
[02:55:59.300 --> 02:56:02.180]   and that the cultures can live together in peace.
[02:56:02.180 --> 02:56:03.640]   - So just to linger on this,
[02:56:03.640 --> 02:56:10.100]   it's like a once subtle and in another sense,
[02:56:10.100 --> 02:56:12.380]   like transformative.
[02:56:12.380 --> 02:56:15.260]   So normalization means you're allowed to travel
[02:56:15.260 --> 02:56:16.860]   from one place to the other.
[02:56:16.860 --> 02:56:20.020]   That has a kind of ripple effect
[02:56:20.020 --> 02:56:21.940]   of that you can now start talking
[02:56:21.940 --> 02:56:24.400]   in a little bit more accepting way.
[02:56:24.400 --> 02:56:28.720]   You can start integrating, traveling,
[02:56:28.720 --> 02:56:32.040]   communicating, doing business with, socializing.
[02:56:32.040 --> 02:56:36.560]   So the cultures mix, conversations mix, all of this.
[02:56:36.560 --> 02:56:38.720]   And this kind of has a ripple effect
[02:56:38.720 --> 02:56:41.760]   on the basic connection
[02:56:41.760 --> 02:56:45.400]   between these previously disparate worlds.
[02:56:45.400 --> 02:56:49.500]   I don't know if there's a nice way
[02:56:49.500 --> 02:56:53.040]   to kind of make clear why these agreements
[02:56:53.040 --> 02:56:55.160]   have such a transformative effect,
[02:56:55.160 --> 02:56:56.920]   especially in the long term.
[02:56:56.920 --> 02:57:00.040]   - I would say the simplest form is it's just a mindset.
[02:57:00.040 --> 02:57:02.900]   And it's almost like you're taught all your life,
[02:57:02.900 --> 02:57:07.400]   we're enemies or we can't be friends with that tribe
[02:57:07.400 --> 02:57:10.480]   on the other side of the fence.
[02:57:10.480 --> 02:57:12.400]   And then like one day the leaders get up and say,
[02:57:12.400 --> 02:57:13.820]   no, it's okay now.
[02:57:13.820 --> 02:57:16.260]   And there was never an issue between the people.
[02:57:16.260 --> 02:57:18.000]   The people were just taught different things
[02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:19.400]   and they were separated from each other.
[02:57:19.400 --> 02:57:21.800]   But again, one of the things that I respect
[02:57:21.800 --> 02:57:24.160]   about the work you do is you believe
[02:57:24.160 --> 02:57:25.520]   in the power of conversation
[02:57:25.520 --> 02:57:27.120]   and the power of human interaction.
[02:57:27.120 --> 02:57:32.120]   And these issues and gaps between us feel so big
[02:57:32.120 --> 02:57:34.840]   when we think about them, when we're told about them,
[02:57:34.840 --> 02:57:36.320]   when we read about them.
[02:57:36.320 --> 02:57:38.280]   But when we go and sit with each other,
[02:57:38.280 --> 02:57:40.440]   all of a sudden we realize maybe we have a lot more
[02:57:40.440 --> 02:57:43.200]   in common than we have that divides us.
[02:57:43.200 --> 02:57:45.480]   For me, what I've seen about it
[02:57:45.480 --> 02:57:48.360]   that's made the biggest difference is I've seen people
[02:57:48.360 --> 02:57:51.320]   who wouldn't have the ability to be together,
[02:57:51.320 --> 02:57:55.120]   be together, and that's now forming a nucleus
[02:57:55.120 --> 02:57:57.240]   of togetherness, which is a restoration.
[02:57:57.240 --> 02:57:59.800]   So you think about the modern Middle East
[02:57:59.800 --> 02:58:04.800]   from post-Holocaust to now, again, in 1948
[02:58:04.800 --> 02:58:07.880]   after that war of independence,
[02:58:07.880 --> 02:58:12.120]   you had Jews living in Baghdad and Cairo.
[02:58:12.120 --> 02:58:14.880]   Then they became so anti-Jewish
[02:58:14.880 --> 02:58:16.960]   that they then expelled all of the Jews
[02:58:16.960 --> 02:58:19.160]   from all these capitals of those cities.
[02:58:19.160 --> 02:58:22.080]   So you think about the Jewish history in Baghdad.
[02:58:22.080 --> 02:58:23.960]   I mean, I think the Talmud was written in Baghdad.
[02:58:23.960 --> 02:58:26.160]   It was a place where in Babylon
[02:58:26.160 --> 02:58:27.880]   where the Jewish people thrived.
[02:58:27.880 --> 02:58:32.320]   I think in 570 BCE when Nebuchadnezzar conquered Jerusalem,
[02:58:32.320 --> 02:58:35.280]   he took about 10,000 Jews back with him to Babylon
[02:58:35.280 --> 02:58:36.680]   because he thought it'd be good for his economy.
[02:58:36.680 --> 02:58:39.800]   And during that place, the Jews actually flourished
[02:58:39.800 --> 02:58:41.240]   and had a good life there.
[02:58:41.240 --> 02:58:45.520]   So for a thousand years before the Second World War,
[02:58:45.520 --> 02:58:48.960]   the Jews and the Muslims lived very peacefully together.
[02:58:48.960 --> 02:58:52.080]   So people say that what we're doing now is an aberration.
[02:58:52.080 --> 02:58:53.520]   I actually think it's not an aberration.
[02:58:53.520 --> 02:58:55.900]   I think it's actually a return to the time
[02:58:55.900 --> 02:58:58.280]   where people can live together culturally.
[02:58:58.280 --> 02:58:59.800]   And so this is the beginning
[02:58:59.800 --> 02:59:02.120]   of the end of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
[02:59:02.120 --> 02:59:03.920]   And it's the beginning of togetherness,
[02:59:03.920 --> 02:59:05.960]   which again, you think about how much war,
[02:59:05.960 --> 02:59:08.320]   how much provocation, how much terrorism
[02:59:08.320 --> 02:59:11.860]   has been made in the name of religious conflict.
[02:59:11.860 --> 02:59:14.040]   This is, I think, the start of the process
[02:59:14.040 --> 02:59:17.360]   of religious respect and understanding.
[02:59:17.360 --> 02:59:20.080]   - We've talked about you being attacked in the press
[02:59:20.080 --> 02:59:22.880]   for the Russian collusion and other topics.
[02:59:22.880 --> 02:59:25.540]   One of the most recent set of attacks comes on the topic
[02:59:25.540 --> 02:59:29.000]   of Saudi Public Investment Fund giving $2 billion
[02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:33.200]   to your investment firm after you left government.
[02:59:33.200 --> 02:59:37.200]   So that includes a 1.25% asset management fee
[02:59:37.200 --> 02:59:39.320]   of $25 million a year.
[02:59:39.320 --> 02:59:42.480]   Can you respond to these recent set of attacks?
[02:59:42.480 --> 02:59:43.300]   - Sure.
[02:59:43.300 --> 02:59:46.360]   So I left government, obviously worked for four years.
[02:59:46.360 --> 02:59:49.680]   It was a very action-packed time.
[02:59:49.680 --> 02:59:50.560]   That's why I wrote the book.
[02:59:50.560 --> 02:59:53.280]   I wanted to put down all those experiences.
[02:59:53.280 --> 02:59:56.240]   I started thinking like, what do I wanna do next?
[02:59:56.240 --> 02:59:59.160]   So my previous career, I'd been in real estate.
[02:59:59.160 --> 03:00:02.260]   I'd worked with my brother on some technology businesses
[03:00:02.260 --> 03:00:05.960]   that I'd started, and then I got into government.
[03:00:05.960 --> 03:00:07.600]   So I kinda had a career shift.
[03:00:07.600 --> 03:00:11.560]   In my previous career, obviously, it was very successful.
[03:00:11.560 --> 03:00:14.400]   The New York Times, they violated
[03:00:14.400 --> 03:00:18.780]   and they published my financial statements.
[03:00:18.780 --> 03:00:21.000]   They showed I was making about $50 million a year
[03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:22.840]   in the private sector before I went to government.
[03:00:22.840 --> 03:00:26.440]   I went into government and I volunteered.
[03:00:26.440 --> 03:00:27.440]   I didn't take a salary.
[03:00:27.440 --> 03:00:29.380]   I paid for my own health insurance for four years,
[03:00:29.380 --> 03:00:30.480]   my wife and I.
[03:00:30.480 --> 03:00:31.600]   And then we went and I was thinking,
[03:00:31.600 --> 03:00:33.760]   should I go back to my old company
[03:00:33.760 --> 03:00:35.600]   or should I start something new?
[03:00:35.600 --> 03:00:40.480]   And my thinking was is that through my time in government,
[03:00:40.480 --> 03:00:41.600]   I'd met so many people.
[03:00:41.600 --> 03:00:43.040]   I'd learned so much about the world.
[03:00:43.040 --> 03:00:44.640]   I had a big understanding now
[03:00:44.640 --> 03:00:47.560]   for how the macroeconomic picture worked.
[03:00:47.560 --> 03:00:50.440]   And I did feel like there was a lot more that I could do
[03:00:50.440 --> 03:00:52.440]   than just going back to real estate.
[03:00:52.440 --> 03:00:54.120]   In the meantime, I was getting a lot of calls
[03:00:54.120 --> 03:00:56.920]   from different CEOs and companies saying,
[03:00:56.920 --> 03:00:58.240]   can you help me with this company?
[03:00:58.240 --> 03:00:59.480]   Can you help me with that company?
[03:00:59.480 --> 03:01:03.520]   Your knowledge could be helpful to help this company
[03:01:03.520 --> 03:01:06.440]   navigate this challenge or to expand internationally.
[03:01:06.440 --> 03:01:07.320]   And so I said, you know what?
[03:01:07.320 --> 03:01:10.080]   Maybe I should create a business to do an investment firm
[03:01:10.080 --> 03:01:12.080]   where I can do something different,
[03:01:12.080 --> 03:01:15.760]   where I'm putting together geopolitical expertise
[03:01:15.760 --> 03:01:18.560]   and traditional private equity and growth investing
[03:01:18.560 --> 03:01:19.840]   and figure out how to do that,
[03:01:19.840 --> 03:01:21.800]   where I can do something differentiated,
[03:01:21.800 --> 03:01:23.760]   where I can invest in growing things
[03:01:23.760 --> 03:01:27.400]   and help with my navigation skills and relationships.
[03:01:27.400 --> 03:01:29.440]   So that was kind of the thesis of what I thought
[03:01:29.440 --> 03:01:32.440]   could make sense as kind of a next step.
[03:01:32.440 --> 03:01:34.040]   I called different friends.
[03:01:34.040 --> 03:01:36.820]   They were very excited to back the effort.
[03:01:36.820 --> 03:01:38.800]   Obviously, this was coming off the success
[03:01:38.800 --> 03:01:40.040]   that I just had in the Middle East
[03:01:40.040 --> 03:01:43.400]   where I did six peace deals there.
[03:01:43.400 --> 03:01:45.680]   And one of the notions I wanted to be able to do
[03:01:45.680 --> 03:01:48.720]   with the firm was to be able to take money from the Gulf
[03:01:48.720 --> 03:01:50.880]   and then to be able to invest it in Israel
[03:01:50.880 --> 03:01:53.000]   to continue to build the economic links
[03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:53.960]   between the countries.
[03:01:53.960 --> 03:01:56.080]   Again, if countries have more economic ties,
[03:01:56.080 --> 03:01:59.960]   I think war and fighting is less likely.
[03:01:59.960 --> 03:02:01.400]   And then in addition to that,
[03:02:01.400 --> 03:02:03.680]   I wanted to figure out how do you bring
[03:02:03.680 --> 03:02:06.560]   the entrepreneurs together from both of those countries?
[03:02:06.560 --> 03:02:09.120]   So that was really the mission of what I set out to do.
[03:02:09.120 --> 03:02:10.640]   So far, I've been enjoying it.
[03:02:10.640 --> 03:02:11.480]   It's been a lot of fun.
[03:02:11.480 --> 03:02:12.920]   I've been learning a ton.
[03:02:12.920 --> 03:02:15.000]   I think we're doing very well with it.
[03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.120]   In terms of the criticisms,
[03:02:17.120 --> 03:02:19.760]   I think that I've been criticized in every step
[03:02:19.760 --> 03:02:21.360]   of everything I've always done in my life.
[03:02:21.360 --> 03:02:23.960]   And so what I would say is,
[03:02:23.960 --> 03:02:26.880]   this business is actually an objective metric business.
[03:02:26.880 --> 03:02:27.720]   It's about returns.
[03:02:27.720 --> 03:02:30.560]   So in three, four years from now, five years from now,
[03:02:30.560 --> 03:02:31.380]   see how I do.
[03:02:31.380 --> 03:02:34.320]   Hopefully I'll do very well and judge me based on that.
[03:02:34.320 --> 03:02:38.040]   In terms of any of the nefarious things,
[03:02:38.040 --> 03:02:41.920]   I haven't been accused of violating any laws.
[03:02:41.920 --> 03:02:44.920]   And I haven't violated any of the ethics rules either.
[03:02:44.920 --> 03:02:45.840]   When I was in government,
[03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:49.200]   I every year submitted all my financials
[03:02:49.200 --> 03:02:50.640]   to the Office of Government Ethics.
[03:02:50.640 --> 03:02:52.160]   They certified it every year.
[03:02:52.160 --> 03:02:54.440]   And I followed every rule and every law possible.
[03:02:54.440 --> 03:02:58.600]   So to my critics, I'll say, criticize me before,
[03:02:58.600 --> 03:03:00.040]   you'll criticize me now.
[03:03:00.040 --> 03:03:03.200]   I'm gonna keep doing me and gonna keep pursuing things
[03:03:03.200 --> 03:03:04.880]   that I think are worthwhile.
[03:03:04.880 --> 03:03:08.200]   And I'm very excited about this chapter of my career.
[03:03:08.200 --> 03:03:10.000]   - Maybe this is a good place to ask,
[03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:14.040]   in working closely with Donald Trump,
[03:03:14.040 --> 03:03:17.880]   what in your sense, looking into the mind of the man,
[03:03:17.880 --> 03:03:21.960]   what's the biggest strength of Donald Trump as a leader?
[03:03:21.960 --> 03:03:24.560]   - I would say his unpredictability.
[03:03:24.560 --> 03:03:27.080]   I think that as a leader,
[03:03:27.080 --> 03:03:30.880]   he consumes a ton of information.
[03:03:30.880 --> 03:03:33.440]   He doesn't like to be managed
[03:03:33.440 --> 03:03:35.080]   or have his information filtered.
[03:03:35.080 --> 03:03:36.780]   So he'll speak to a lot of people
[03:03:36.780 --> 03:03:39.320]   to draw his information himself.
[03:03:39.320 --> 03:03:40.400]   He's very pragmatic.
[03:03:40.400 --> 03:03:42.720]   I don't see him as terribly ideological.
[03:03:42.720 --> 03:03:45.400]   I see him as somebody who's about results.
[03:03:45.400 --> 03:03:48.180]   I think he wants to deliver results.
[03:03:48.180 --> 03:03:52.600]   And I think ultimately, I mean, he's an incredible fighter.
[03:03:52.600 --> 03:03:55.160]   He's a big counter puncher,
[03:03:55.160 --> 03:03:56.840]   but he also wants to get along with people.
[03:03:56.840 --> 03:03:58.780]   And that's probably the biggest surprise
[03:03:58.780 --> 03:04:01.520]   that people found with him.
[03:04:01.520 --> 03:04:04.800]   I mean, you look at even situations like,
[03:04:04.800 --> 03:04:07.240]   I would always tell people, if you disagree with him,
[03:04:07.240 --> 03:04:09.600]   don't go on television and criticize him,
[03:04:09.600 --> 03:04:12.200]   pick up the phone and call him and go see him.
[03:04:12.200 --> 03:04:13.320]   And he'll talk to you about it.
[03:04:13.320 --> 03:04:14.780]   He may not agree with you,
[03:04:14.780 --> 03:04:16.520]   but again, that's what Kim Kardashian did
[03:04:16.520 --> 03:04:19.120]   when she had a case of clemency
[03:04:19.120 --> 03:04:22.440]   with a woman, Alice Johnson, that she felt strongly about.
[03:04:22.440 --> 03:04:23.320]   We went through the case.
[03:04:23.320 --> 03:04:24.240]   I wouldn't have had her call
[03:04:24.240 --> 03:04:25.760]   if I didn't think it was a legitimate case.
[03:04:25.760 --> 03:04:27.720]   So we spent about eight months
[03:04:27.720 --> 03:04:29.240]   quietly working through the case,
[03:04:29.240 --> 03:04:30.880]   working through the details
[03:04:30.880 --> 03:04:33.180]   to make sure that it really was a worthy case.
[03:04:33.180 --> 03:04:35.600]   I brought it to President Trump,
[03:04:35.600 --> 03:04:37.120]   said, "She'd like to come meet with you
[03:04:37.120 --> 03:04:39.140]   to talk about this case."
[03:04:39.140 --> 03:04:40.660]   And he said, "How recommend?"
[03:04:40.660 --> 03:04:42.320]   So she came in, we went through the case,
[03:04:42.320 --> 03:04:45.280]   and President Trump ultimately granted the clemency
[03:04:45.280 --> 03:04:48.000]   to Alice Johnson, who was a woman
[03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:51.220]   who was accused of being part of a drug ring.
[03:04:51.220 --> 03:04:53.880]   She had basically a life sentence for doing it.
[03:04:53.880 --> 03:04:55.920]   She'd served 22 years in prison.
[03:04:55.920 --> 03:04:58.240]   While in prison, I mean, she basically was a grandmother,
[03:04:58.240 --> 03:05:01.600]   and she was putting on the prison plays.
[03:05:01.600 --> 03:05:03.640]   She was mentoring young women in prison,
[03:05:03.640 --> 03:05:06.440]   somebody who, again, there's always a risk,
[03:05:06.440 --> 03:05:08.960]   but by and large had a very, very, very low risk
[03:05:08.960 --> 03:05:11.800]   of committing a crime in the future.
[03:05:11.800 --> 03:05:13.400]   And then it goes back to the notion of,
[03:05:13.400 --> 03:05:15.480]   are we gonna judge people
[03:05:15.480 --> 03:05:17.320]   by the worst decision they make in their life?
[03:05:17.320 --> 03:05:20.080]   And so President Trump was willing
[03:05:20.080 --> 03:05:21.280]   to grant the clemency, and it went.
[03:05:21.280 --> 03:05:24.320]   And I think that it just goes to the notion of,
[03:05:24.320 --> 03:05:26.040]   maybe this goes back to his unpredictability
[03:05:26.040 --> 03:05:27.640]   in a positive way, which is,
[03:05:27.640 --> 03:05:29.680]   if you go sit with him and you make your case,
[03:05:29.680 --> 03:05:31.360]   he'll hear you, he'll listen to you,
[03:05:31.360 --> 03:05:32.760]   and he's not afraid to act,
[03:05:32.760 --> 03:05:35.060]   and he's not afraid to be controversial,
[03:05:35.060 --> 03:05:36.040]   which I think is a good thing.
[03:05:36.040 --> 03:05:39.360]   So from a foreign policy point of view in particular,
[03:05:39.360 --> 03:05:41.000]   his unpredictability just meant
[03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:43.340]   that everyone was always on their back foot.
[03:05:43.340 --> 03:05:46.560]   People were afraid to kind of cross America.
[03:05:46.560 --> 03:05:48.360]   And what I would tell people who don't like Trump
[03:05:48.360 --> 03:05:50.640]   is I would say, think about how crazy he's making you
[03:05:50.640 --> 03:05:51.840]   and his enemies.
[03:05:51.840 --> 03:05:53.960]   He did that to the enemies of America.
[03:05:53.960 --> 03:05:57.160]   And yeah, so he was a very, very strong president,
[03:05:57.160 --> 03:05:58.560]   and I think did a great job.
[03:05:58.560 --> 03:05:59.840]   - So in some of these agreements
[03:05:59.840 --> 03:06:01.080]   that we've been talking about,
[03:06:01.080 --> 03:06:02.880]   and speaking with leaders,
[03:06:02.880 --> 03:06:05.520]   how do you think the unpredictability helps?
[03:06:05.520 --> 03:06:08.760]   - So in all the agreements that I was negotiating,
[03:06:08.760 --> 03:06:10.520]   I wasn't doing it as a principal.
[03:06:10.520 --> 03:06:12.960]   I was doing it on behalf of President Trump.
[03:06:12.960 --> 03:06:15.840]   And people knew that I had access to President Trump,
[03:06:15.840 --> 03:06:18.560]   and they knew that I could say,
[03:06:18.560 --> 03:06:20.380]   you may say this that we don't like,
[03:06:20.380 --> 03:06:21.740]   but I'm gonna have to take it back to him,
[03:06:21.740 --> 03:06:23.160]   and then we'll see what he does.
[03:06:23.160 --> 03:06:24.620]   And one of the biggest instances
[03:06:24.620 --> 03:06:26.460]   was on the USMCA trade deal,
[03:06:26.460 --> 03:06:31.280]   where that deal happened because Mexico
[03:06:31.280 --> 03:06:34.120]   was legitimately concerned, and smartly so,
[03:06:34.120 --> 03:06:36.880]   that President Trump was going to impose tariffs
[03:06:36.880 --> 03:06:37.880]   on the car industry,
[03:06:37.880 --> 03:06:40.560]   which would have been decimating to their economy.
[03:06:40.560 --> 03:06:42.280]   And by the way, he was ready to do it.
[03:06:42.280 --> 03:06:43.680]   We were holding him back from doing it
[03:06:43.680 --> 03:06:45.880]   with every ounce of strength that we could,
[03:06:45.880 --> 03:06:46.800]   so it wasn't a bluff.
[03:06:46.800 --> 03:06:48.620]   I mean, that one was actually real,
[03:06:48.620 --> 03:06:51.400]   but they were smart to read that it was real.
[03:06:51.400 --> 03:06:54.580]   And ultimately, we created a great win-win deal.
[03:06:56.160 --> 03:06:57.000]   I'll tell you a funny story,
[03:06:57.000 --> 03:06:59.240]   it just popped into my mind from the tariffs,
[03:06:59.240 --> 03:07:03.720]   is we did also, we used a 232 national security exemption
[03:07:03.720 --> 03:07:05.240]   to protect our steel industry,
[03:07:05.240 --> 03:07:07.640]   and we put tariffs on steel and aluminum.
[03:07:07.640 --> 03:07:09.060]   And again, I thought about this,
[03:07:09.060 --> 03:07:11.560]   'cause we also negotiated them with Canada.
[03:07:11.560 --> 03:07:12.920]   And there was a very funny phone call
[03:07:12.920 --> 03:07:15.200]   where Trudeau was calling Trump,
[03:07:15.200 --> 03:07:17.900]   and again, they got along decently well.
[03:07:17.900 --> 03:07:20.440]   And Trudeau's calling and saying,
[03:07:20.440 --> 03:07:23.320]   you can't put national security tariffs on us in Canada.
[03:07:23.440 --> 03:07:26.360]   We're your NATO ally, we fought wars with you,
[03:07:26.360 --> 03:07:28.200]   we do military together.
[03:07:28.200 --> 03:07:29.440]   And Trump says to him,
[03:07:29.440 --> 03:07:32.040]   "Didn't you burn the White House down in 1812?"
[03:07:32.040 --> 03:07:33.200]   And Trudeau says, "That was the French."
[03:07:33.200 --> 03:07:35.520]   He says, "No, it was the Canadians."
[03:07:35.520 --> 03:07:37.640]   And so it was just, like I said,
[03:07:37.640 --> 03:07:39.740]   he's always keeping everyone on their toes.
[03:07:39.740 --> 03:07:44.600]   But he took very calculated risks.
[03:07:44.600 --> 03:07:49.480]   And like I said, everyone was outraged all the time
[03:07:49.480 --> 03:07:52.120]   with everything, but if you look at his body of work,
[03:07:52.120 --> 03:07:53.520]   people said if he was elected,
[03:07:53.520 --> 03:07:54.720]   he would start World War III.
[03:07:54.720 --> 03:07:57.600]   Meanwhile, we inherited a world filled with wars,
[03:07:57.600 --> 03:07:59.460]   no new wars, right?
[03:07:59.460 --> 03:08:02.200]   Three years, he made peace deals, no new wars.
[03:08:02.200 --> 03:08:03.920]   He was tough, he was strong.
[03:08:03.920 --> 03:08:06.760]   People respected him, he built relationships,
[03:08:06.760 --> 03:08:09.760]   and got trade deals done, got peace deals done.
[03:08:09.760 --> 03:08:11.440]   The economy was rocking.
[03:08:11.440 --> 03:08:14.120]   His body of work, I think, was pretty strong as president.
[03:08:14.120 --> 03:08:15.300]   - Like you said, no new wars.
[03:08:15.300 --> 03:08:19.080]   This makes me think, if Donald Trump won the presidency,
[03:08:19.080 --> 03:08:22.280]   what the current situation in Ukraine would look like.
[03:08:22.280 --> 03:08:25.360]   But let me just ask you, zoom out and ask you broadly,
[03:08:25.360 --> 03:08:29.760]   do you think the war in Ukraine could have been avoided?
[03:08:29.760 --> 03:08:33.040]   And what do you think it takes to bring it to an end?
[03:08:33.040 --> 03:08:36.920]   - I think 100%, it would have been avoided, not 99%.
[03:08:36.920 --> 03:08:39.600]   President Trump, for four years,
[03:08:39.600 --> 03:08:41.440]   had no problems with Russia.
[03:08:41.440 --> 03:08:45.120]   We were arming Ukraine, but we were working with Russia.
[03:08:45.120 --> 03:08:47.200]   And again, the first two years,
[03:08:47.200 --> 03:08:48.920]   we had a little bit of issue working with Russia
[03:08:48.920 --> 03:08:51.440]   because they were accused of colluding with us
[03:08:51.440 --> 03:08:54.040]   since we had to go through that investigation.
[03:08:54.040 --> 03:08:56.020]   But in the second two years,
[03:08:56.020 --> 03:08:59.240]   we were trying to focus Russia on what are the areas
[03:08:59.240 --> 03:09:00.920]   where we can collaborate together.
[03:09:00.920 --> 03:09:03.640]   I think Russia, we thought it was in their strategic
[03:09:03.640 --> 03:09:07.880]   advantage to play US and China against each other
[03:09:07.880 --> 03:09:10.440]   because of the way that everything was done before.
[03:09:10.440 --> 03:09:13.880]   They were stuck with China, but not getting a lot for it.
[03:09:13.880 --> 03:09:15.340]   Under Bush, they took Georgia.
[03:09:15.340 --> 03:09:17.200]   Under Obama, they took Crimea.
[03:09:17.200 --> 03:09:19.320]   Under Trump, there was no problems.
[03:09:19.320 --> 03:09:22.280]   And then under Biden, unfortunately,
[03:09:22.280 --> 03:09:24.120]   I think they misplayed a couple of things,
[03:09:24.120 --> 03:09:28.600]   which I think provoked Russia to go forward.
[03:09:28.600 --> 03:09:30.240]   Still no excuse to do what they did.
[03:09:30.240 --> 03:09:32.240]   I think that the invasion was a terrible thing
[03:09:32.240 --> 03:09:34.320]   and should not have occurred.
[03:09:34.320 --> 03:09:38.240]   But with that being said, I think 100%,
[03:09:38.240 --> 03:09:39.280]   if Trump was president,
[03:09:39.280 --> 03:09:41.260]   there would not be a war in Ukraine today.
[03:09:41.260 --> 03:09:44.140]   - Coming to the table and negotiating a peace,
[03:09:46.040 --> 03:09:48.320]   whether it's Donald Trump, whether it's Biden,
[03:09:48.320 --> 03:09:51.320]   whether it's anybody, what do you think it takes?
[03:09:51.320 --> 03:09:53.320]   Do you think it's possible?
[03:09:53.320 --> 03:09:57.440]   And if you're in a room, if Jared Kushner is in the room
[03:09:57.440 --> 03:10:00.760]   with Vladimir Putin and Vladimir Zelensky,
[03:10:00.760 --> 03:10:04.220]   what does it take to have a productive conversation?
[03:10:04.220 --> 03:10:07.000]   And what does it take for that conversation to fail?
[03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:08.560]   Like what are the trajectories
[03:10:08.560 --> 03:10:10.480]   that lead to success and failure?
[03:10:10.480 --> 03:10:12.420]   - I think we go back to negotiations.
[03:10:12.420 --> 03:10:13.760]   Number one is trust, right?
[03:10:13.760 --> 03:10:16.400]   Both leaders have to have the ability
[03:10:16.400 --> 03:10:20.780]   to communicate what an off-ramp is
[03:10:20.780 --> 03:10:22.640]   without fearing it's gonna leak to the public.
[03:10:22.640 --> 03:10:26.400]   So if you go to the posture of Zelensky right now,
[03:10:26.400 --> 03:10:27.760]   and by the way, President Zelensky,
[03:10:27.760 --> 03:10:30.560]   I have a lot of respect for the courage he showed,
[03:10:30.560 --> 03:10:32.400]   especially initially.
[03:10:32.400 --> 03:10:34.480]   You saw what Ghani did in Afghanistan.
[03:10:34.480 --> 03:10:36.200]   They were getting attacked by the Taliban.
[03:10:36.200 --> 03:10:38.240]   He took the cash and got the hell out of there.
[03:10:38.240 --> 03:10:41.040]   Staying in Kiev when he did, how he did it,
[03:10:41.040 --> 03:10:44.040]   was one of the most brave things we've seen in a long time.
[03:10:44.040 --> 03:10:45.560]   And he has a ton of my respect
[03:10:45.560 --> 03:10:47.440]   and admiration for doing that.
[03:10:47.440 --> 03:10:49.640]   But now he's promising his people,
[03:10:49.640 --> 03:10:51.120]   we're gonna win the war.
[03:10:51.120 --> 03:10:55.360]   And the military action has not necessarily
[03:10:55.360 --> 03:10:57.800]   coincided with that sentiment.
[03:10:57.800 --> 03:11:01.120]   And so there has to be some form of off-ramp,
[03:11:01.120 --> 03:11:02.680]   but he can't say that publicly.
[03:11:02.680 --> 03:11:05.480]   So for him to be able to work privately
[03:11:05.480 --> 03:11:08.020]   with somebody who can help create a new paradigm
[03:11:08.020 --> 03:11:09.480]   where both leaders can say,
[03:11:09.480 --> 03:11:10.720]   we're gonna stop the bloodshed,
[03:11:10.720 --> 03:11:13.200]   we're gonna stop the risk of nuclear war for the world,
[03:11:13.200 --> 03:11:16.880]   we're gonna stop what's happening,
[03:11:16.880 --> 03:11:18.360]   that's really what it will take.
[03:11:18.360 --> 03:11:21.000]   How that occurs, again, it's not something
[03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:23.120]   I'm involved in now, so I don't know
[03:11:23.120 --> 03:11:26.000]   who the right broker is or how to put that together.
[03:11:26.000 --> 03:11:28.760]   But essentially, they need somebody in between them
[03:11:28.760 --> 03:11:32.040]   who can figure out how do you create a landing zone
[03:11:32.040 --> 03:11:34.640]   that works, 'cause neither party's gonna jump
[03:11:34.640 --> 03:11:36.640]   until the pool is filled with water.
[03:11:36.640 --> 03:11:40.160]   And you have to outline what the go forward looks like,
[03:11:40.160 --> 03:11:42.240]   because you can't just stop it
[03:11:42.240 --> 03:11:44.280]   for then it to get worse for both parties.
[03:11:44.280 --> 03:11:48.360]   You have to move it forward into what happens next
[03:11:48.360 --> 03:11:51.480]   that hopefully can start to turn the tide
[03:11:51.480 --> 03:11:55.200]   to benefit both sides where they can focus on the future
[03:11:55.200 --> 03:11:58.860]   instead of being stuck into the old paradigm
[03:11:58.860 --> 03:12:01.080]   of who started what, who's to blame for what,
[03:12:01.080 --> 03:12:02.420]   who did what to who.
[03:12:02.420 --> 03:12:06.480]   It's just a lot of tough stuff now that's occurred
[03:12:06.480 --> 03:12:08.460]   that's gonna be hard to walk back.
[03:12:08.460 --> 03:12:10.600]   And it's a big task to get it done,
[03:12:10.600 --> 03:12:13.200]   but for the sake of the world, it'd be amazing
[03:12:13.200 --> 03:12:16.520]   if we were able to reach a conclusion to that conflict.
[03:12:16.520 --> 03:12:21.100]   - Just going back to your earlier mention of North Korea,
[03:12:21.100 --> 03:12:24.000]   what do you think it takes to bring Vladimir Putin
[03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:26.840]   and Vladimir Zelensky to the table together?
[03:12:26.840 --> 03:12:27.680]   - Leadership.
[03:12:27.680 --> 03:12:33.340]   - So you're saying it has to be a US president?
[03:12:33.340 --> 03:12:36.280]   - It has to be somebody who's willing
[03:12:36.280 --> 03:12:39.160]   to put themself on the line to go and do it.
[03:12:39.160 --> 03:12:41.660]   And again, if you're the US president
[03:12:41.660 --> 03:12:44.000]   and you're the most powerful nation in the world,
[03:12:44.000 --> 03:12:45.480]   you should be trying.
[03:12:45.480 --> 03:12:48.180]   But I do think, again, the posture that the US has taken
[03:12:48.180 --> 03:12:51.260]   has probably been in a place where they,
[03:12:51.260 --> 03:12:54.180]   it would be very hard for them to get the trust of Russia
[03:12:54.180 --> 03:12:58.460]   based on the way that they've played their moves to date.
[03:12:58.460 --> 03:12:59.580]   I always thought from the beginning
[03:12:59.580 --> 03:13:03.020]   that Putin would try to bring in President Xi in China
[03:13:03.020 --> 03:13:05.500]   to resolve it, to basically give a big screw you
[03:13:05.500 --> 03:13:09.820]   to America to say, "China's now the one in charge of this."
[03:13:09.820 --> 03:13:14.060]   But that hasn't seemed to manifest itself to date either.
[03:13:14.060 --> 03:13:15.660]   But it takes leadership.
[03:13:15.660 --> 03:13:17.140]   The leaders have to get in and say,
[03:13:17.140 --> 03:13:19.380]   "Let's get everyone together and let's try to get this done
[03:13:19.380 --> 03:13:23.000]   "because every day it goes on, A, more people are dying,
[03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:27.080]   "and B, we do risk a nuclear war for the world,
[03:13:27.080 --> 03:13:29.460]   "which is not a good situation."
[03:13:29.460 --> 03:13:32.660]   - Let me ask, since you helped set up phone calls
[03:13:32.660 --> 03:13:36.140]   between Donald Trump, Putin, and the King of Saudi Arabia,
[03:13:36.140 --> 03:13:38.940]   if I were to interview Putin, what advice would you give
[03:13:38.940 --> 03:13:45.020]   on how to get a deep understanding of the human being?
[03:13:45.020 --> 03:13:48.700]   - Yeah, so I didn't deal with Russia a ton,
[03:13:48.700 --> 03:13:52.660]   but in my interaction with Putin and with Russia,
[03:13:52.660 --> 03:13:55.780]   I would kind of point out a couple of things.
[03:13:55.780 --> 03:13:58.740]   Number one is when America was hit with COVID
[03:13:58.740 --> 03:14:00.900]   and New York was looking like we were gonna run
[03:14:00.900 --> 03:14:02.780]   out of ventilators and masks,
[03:14:02.780 --> 03:14:04.940]   Russia was the second country that sent us
[03:14:04.940 --> 03:14:06.620]   a plane load of supplies.
[03:14:06.620 --> 03:14:08.580]   And they didn't send that because they hate America,
[03:14:08.580 --> 03:14:10.540]   they sent that because we were starting
[03:14:10.540 --> 03:14:12.300]   to make progress together as countries,
[03:14:12.300 --> 03:14:14.900]   and they thought that they wanted to show goodwill
[03:14:14.900 --> 03:14:17.840]   to figure out how can we start working together.
[03:14:17.840 --> 03:14:19.580]   And again, people may attack me for saying
[03:14:19.580 --> 03:14:21.180]   that that sounds naive.
[03:14:21.180 --> 03:14:24.300]   Again, the past 15 years may show that that's not the case,
[03:14:24.300 --> 03:14:27.060]   but I don't believe that countries have permanent enemies,
[03:14:27.060 --> 03:14:29.340]   and I don't believe countries have permanent allies.
[03:14:29.340 --> 03:14:32.260]   Again, you think about the US and Russia in World War II,
[03:14:32.260 --> 03:14:35.300]   we worked together to defeat the Nazis, right?
[03:14:35.300 --> 03:14:37.020]   And now we're great allies with Germany,
[03:14:37.020 --> 03:14:40.260]   who basically was our great enemy in World War II.
[03:14:40.260 --> 03:14:41.500]   We're great allies with Japan,
[03:14:41.500 --> 03:14:42.980]   who was our great enemy in World War II.
[03:14:42.980 --> 03:14:46.420]   So it goes back to the notion we discussed earlier
[03:14:46.420 --> 03:14:50.940]   of you shouldn't condemn tomorrow to be like yesterday
[03:14:50.940 --> 03:14:52.460]   if you're unhappy with yesterday.
[03:14:52.460 --> 03:14:56.500]   So number one is I would definitely ask him about that.
[03:14:56.500 --> 03:14:58.720]   The phone call that you mentioned was after we did
[03:14:58.720 --> 03:15:01.980]   a pretty intense negotiation to create the largest oil cut
[03:15:01.980 --> 03:15:03.800]   in the history of oil production.
[03:15:03.800 --> 03:15:07.660]   So during COVID, demand just shut off like crazy,
[03:15:07.660 --> 03:15:10.300]   and it was stopping very quickly.
[03:15:10.300 --> 03:15:13.240]   Saudi and Russia at that time were having a conflict,
[03:15:13.240 --> 03:15:15.340]   they created this thing called OPEC+,
[03:15:15.340 --> 03:15:17.780]   which goes back, again, history between the two countries
[03:15:17.780 --> 03:15:20.700]   where they had conflicts, and then all of a sudden,
[03:15:20.700 --> 03:15:22.820]   they were working together to try to stabilize
[03:15:22.820 --> 03:15:25.380]   the oil markets, but they couldn't agree on the cuts,
[03:15:25.380 --> 03:15:28.660]   so Saudi actually increased production.
[03:15:28.660 --> 03:15:30.280]   So you had two things hitting at once,
[03:15:30.280 --> 03:15:32.960]   where Saudi and Russia were both increasing production
[03:15:32.960 --> 03:15:34.100]   and demand was dropping.
[03:15:34.100 --> 03:15:35.840]   So you were headed for a real crisis,
[03:15:35.840 --> 03:15:38.000]   and I was starting to get calls from a lot of the
[03:15:38.000 --> 03:15:40.300]   oil industry executives here in America saying,
[03:15:40.300 --> 03:15:42.060]   "You don't understand, we can't just flip a switch
[03:15:42.060 --> 03:15:43.040]   "and turn off our oil wells,
[03:15:43.040 --> 03:15:45.300]   "like we're running out of storage here."
[03:15:45.300 --> 03:15:48.960]   And I said, "Look, President Trump likes low oil prices,
[03:15:48.960 --> 03:15:51.180]   "so he's not upset about what's happening.
[03:15:51.180 --> 03:15:53.600]   "You have to call him, and if he gives me permission
[03:15:53.600 --> 03:15:55.480]   "or the instruction, then I can try to intervene,
[03:15:55.480 --> 03:15:59.440]   "but right now, he's not inclined to intervene."
[03:15:59.440 --> 03:16:01.700]   After a little bit, he said, "You know what, it's time.
[03:16:01.700 --> 03:16:03.720]   "Get involved, go do it."
[03:16:03.720 --> 03:16:05.860]   It was right over Passover, this was during COVID.
[03:16:05.860 --> 03:16:08.120]   I spent three days nonstop on the phone
[03:16:08.120 --> 03:16:12.040]   with Kirill Dmitriev from Russia and with MBS directly,
[03:16:12.040 --> 03:16:13.200]   and I was dealing with Dan Burlett,
[03:16:13.200 --> 03:16:16.280]   who was our energy minister, going back and forth,
[03:16:16.280 --> 03:16:18.200]   and it was like, it was crazy.
[03:16:18.200 --> 03:16:20.140]   I mean, it was just one of the craziest negotiations.
[03:16:20.140 --> 03:16:23.360]   We ended up agreeing on the largest oil cut
[03:16:23.360 --> 03:16:24.820]   in the history of the world,
[03:16:24.820 --> 03:16:27.000]   but the story you went to before, which was pretty funny,
[03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:31.320]   was finally make the deal, and we set up a call
[03:16:31.320 --> 03:16:34.120]   between King Salman, Vladimir Putin,
[03:16:34.120 --> 03:16:37.240]   and President Trump to announce the deal.
[03:16:37.240 --> 03:16:39.080]   I'm like, "Oh, this is great."
[03:16:39.080 --> 03:16:41.120]   So President Trump gets on, says, "Congratulations,
[03:16:41.120 --> 03:16:43.180]   "we have a deal," and then King Salman says,
[03:16:43.180 --> 03:16:44.580]   "We don't have a deal.
[03:16:44.580 --> 03:16:46.840]   "Mexico hasn't agreed to their cuts."
[03:16:46.840 --> 03:16:47.680]   And he's saying, "What do you mean?"
[03:16:47.680 --> 03:16:50.680]   And so they were part of the OPEC Plus,
[03:16:50.680 --> 03:16:52.600]   and so I get a note saying, "You gotta go call Mexico."
[03:16:52.600 --> 03:16:54.080]   So I'm calling Mexico, and we're dealing,
[03:16:54.080 --> 03:16:55.360]   they're saying, "We're not doing any cuts."
[03:16:55.360 --> 03:16:56.200]   I said, "Why?"
[03:16:56.200 --> 03:16:57.040]   I said, "We're hedged at $55."
[03:16:57.040 --> 03:16:59.180]   He said, "Why didn't you tell us that in the beginning?"
[03:16:59.180 --> 03:17:00.680]   So I'm telling the Saudis,
[03:17:00.680 --> 03:17:02.960]   so we were working through this whole thing.
[03:17:02.960 --> 03:17:04.580]   So meanwhile, we were trying to find
[03:17:04.580 --> 03:17:06.440]   the compromise with Mexico.
[03:17:06.440 --> 03:17:08.560]   I set up a call with Trump and Putin
[03:17:08.560 --> 03:17:10.680]   so they can kind of talk this through,
[03:17:10.680 --> 03:17:12.440]   and he was always trying to play the game
[03:17:12.440 --> 03:17:15.080]   of how do we get Russia away from China.
[03:17:15.080 --> 03:17:17.120]   He always thought that that was not the right
[03:17:17.120 --> 03:17:20.040]   strategic framework for US interests,
[03:17:20.040 --> 03:17:24.600]   and again, we had no problems with them during that time.
[03:17:24.600 --> 03:17:28.600]   What I would say is that for Zelensky and Putin,
[03:17:28.600 --> 03:17:30.200]   any conversation with both of them
[03:17:30.200 --> 03:17:33.080]   is about understanding their perspective.
[03:17:33.080 --> 03:17:35.560]   I think with Putin, he's a student of history
[03:17:35.560 --> 03:17:37.960]   from the things that I saw with him.
[03:17:37.960 --> 03:17:40.280]   If you look at Russia over the last 500 years,
[03:17:40.280 --> 03:17:44.600]   I think they were attacked by the Polish in early 1600.
[03:17:44.600 --> 03:17:48.280]   I think they were attacked by the Swedes in the 1700s.
[03:17:48.280 --> 03:17:51.200]   I think they were attacked by Napoleon in the 1800s,
[03:17:51.200 --> 03:17:54.480]   and then in the 1900s, they were attacked by Germany twice.
[03:17:54.480 --> 03:17:59.040]   And so from his perspective, there is,
[03:17:59.040 --> 03:18:00.660]   in the early days of Russia,
[03:18:00.660 --> 03:18:03.520]   they were attacked by the Mongols.
[03:18:03.520 --> 03:18:04.820]   They were very vulnerable,
[03:18:04.820 --> 03:18:07.720]   and a lot of the geography of Russia today
[03:18:07.720 --> 03:18:09.720]   is really designed for defensive purposes,
[03:18:09.720 --> 03:18:11.160]   that they have natural barriers
[03:18:11.160 --> 03:18:12.560]   that makes them easier to defend.
[03:18:12.560 --> 03:18:14.040]   And Russia's a massive landmass.
[03:18:14.040 --> 03:18:15.320]   It's twice the size of America.
[03:18:15.320 --> 03:18:17.800]   They have 11 time zones in the country.
[03:18:17.800 --> 03:18:21.560]   And so I do think that for Vladimir Putin,
[03:18:21.560 --> 03:18:26.480]   his biggest concern is how do we create a security paradigm
[03:18:26.480 --> 03:18:29.840]   in the west of his country that won't be a creep?
[03:18:29.840 --> 03:18:32.360]   And I think that there's two different parts of the mindset.
[03:18:32.360 --> 03:18:34.960]   The people who are most cynical of Putin will say,
[03:18:34.960 --> 03:18:37.040]   well, he's just trying to recreate the USSR.
[03:18:37.040 --> 03:18:38.720]   He's being expansionist.
[03:18:38.720 --> 03:18:41.520]   And the people who wanna be sympathetic to him will say,
[03:18:41.520 --> 03:18:43.160]   well, if you think about it,
[03:18:43.160 --> 03:18:46.680]   the Russian perception of the NATO arrangement
[03:18:46.680 --> 03:18:48.600]   was that they wouldn't be expanding westward.
[03:18:48.600 --> 03:18:50.320]   Over the last years,
[03:18:50.320 --> 03:18:52.320]   they've included all these countries that they said,
[03:18:52.320 --> 03:18:54.520]   they promised they wouldn't include,
[03:18:54.520 --> 03:18:58.080]   who knows what the promises were or weren't.
[03:18:58.080 --> 03:19:00.200]   But what I do know from his perspective
[03:19:00.200 --> 03:19:04.160]   is allowing Ukraine into NATO was always a red line,
[03:19:04.160 --> 03:19:05.480]   and that's why we never offered it.
[03:19:05.480 --> 03:19:06.800]   We never provoked it.
[03:19:06.800 --> 03:19:07.640]   We never brought it up.
[03:19:07.640 --> 03:19:08.520]   We said, we're gonna arm 'em,
[03:19:08.520 --> 03:19:10.080]   and we basically said, just calm down.
[03:19:10.080 --> 03:19:11.100]   We don't want any conflicts there.
[03:19:11.100 --> 03:19:12.000]   We have bigger issues
[03:19:12.000 --> 03:19:14.280]   and bigger opportunities to work from.
[03:19:14.280 --> 03:19:15.840]   So I do think you have to think through
[03:19:15.840 --> 03:19:17.880]   what's a paradigm that he can accept.
[03:19:17.880 --> 03:19:22.880]   And I do think that he'll give the justification
[03:19:22.880 --> 03:19:25.140]   for why he's done what he's done.
[03:19:25.140 --> 03:19:27.480]   And then I think the framework for a solution
[03:19:27.480 --> 03:19:31.400]   is about how do we move both parties forward.
[03:19:31.400 --> 03:19:32.240]   Tough job.
[03:19:32.240 --> 03:19:33.560]   I hope you get the opportunity to do it
[03:19:33.560 --> 03:19:35.080]   because I think it's a conversation
[03:19:35.080 --> 03:19:38.040]   that will only help the world
[03:19:38.040 --> 03:19:40.320]   hopefully find a pathway forward.
[03:19:40.320 --> 03:19:42.760]   - And I should mention, 'cause you mentioned geography,
[03:19:42.760 --> 03:19:45.400]   one of the many books you've recommended to me
[03:19:45.400 --> 03:19:48.520]   that gives a very interesting perspective on history.
[03:19:48.520 --> 03:19:51.760]   It's called "Prisoners of Geography" by Tim Marshall.
[03:19:51.760 --> 03:19:56.120]   And it has a very interesting perspective
[03:19:56.120 --> 03:20:01.120]   on the geopolitical conflicts and perspective of Russia
[03:20:01.120 --> 03:20:04.100]   from a geography perspective.
[03:20:04.100 --> 03:20:08.120]   And also for China in the second chapter.
[03:20:08.120 --> 03:20:09.520]   And there's a lot of understanding
[03:20:09.520 --> 03:20:13.640]   of why the expansion of NATO is such a concern for Russia.
[03:20:13.640 --> 03:20:16.920]   Because geography still, even in the 21st century,
[03:20:16.920 --> 03:20:19.440]   less and less so because of technology and so on,
[03:20:19.440 --> 03:20:21.400]   but it still plays a major role
[03:20:21.400 --> 03:20:25.360]   in conflicts between nations, rivers, mountains.
[03:20:25.360 --> 03:20:27.360]   - And understanding the DNA of countries.
[03:20:27.360 --> 03:20:29.120]   It was one of the most phenomenal books
[03:20:29.120 --> 03:20:31.240]   and I just found it on Amazon randomly,
[03:20:31.240 --> 03:20:32.840]   but I loved every minute of it.
[03:20:32.840 --> 03:20:34.680]   The chapter on America is also incredible.
[03:20:34.680 --> 03:20:37.880]   Going through the evolution of how we became
[03:20:37.880 --> 03:20:39.920]   the country we are, the different acquisitions,
[03:20:39.920 --> 03:20:40.760]   the different changes,
[03:20:40.760 --> 03:20:43.440]   why we have all these geographic advantages.
[03:20:43.440 --> 03:20:45.520]   And it's an unbelievable book
[03:20:45.520 --> 03:20:48.360]   for anyone who's interested in geopolitics.
[03:20:48.360 --> 03:20:51.640]   - So I have to ask on several aspects of China.
[03:20:51.640 --> 03:20:55.400]   First on the president, the meeting.
[03:20:55.400 --> 03:20:57.280]   You helped set up a first call and first meeting
[03:20:57.280 --> 03:21:00.240]   between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping.
[03:21:00.240 --> 03:21:01.360]   Can you tell the story of that?
[03:21:01.360 --> 03:21:02.320]   Because that's also interesting.
[03:21:02.320 --> 03:21:04.800]   Again, that first phone call, the reaching out,
[03:21:04.800 --> 03:21:07.720]   the forming the human connection,
[03:21:07.720 --> 03:21:10.560]   which ultimately leads to the connection between nations
[03:21:10.560 --> 03:21:12.400]   and the possibility of collaboration.
[03:21:12.400 --> 03:21:13.840]   - So during the transition,
[03:21:13.840 --> 03:21:17.280]   President Trump took a call from the head of Taiwan
[03:21:17.280 --> 03:21:21.800]   and that sent the Chinese into a real tailspin.
[03:21:21.800 --> 03:21:24.480]   And he didn't do it, I think, to be provocative to them
[03:21:24.480 --> 03:21:26.280]   as much as just as a businessman,
[03:21:26.280 --> 03:21:27.760]   he felt you answer your call.
[03:21:27.760 --> 03:21:29.760]   Somebody wants to speak to you, you speak to him like you.
[03:21:29.760 --> 03:21:32.200]   You wanna have conversations, hear their point of view.
[03:21:32.200 --> 03:21:34.240]   But it was taken as a very big insult
[03:21:34.240 --> 03:21:36.120]   and it was against tradition and norm.
[03:21:36.120 --> 03:21:40.240]   And so that was something that set us off
[03:21:40.240 --> 03:21:41.560]   in a wrong direction.
[03:21:42.320 --> 03:21:44.040]   My view at the time was that,
[03:21:44.040 --> 03:21:47.120]   we are kind of entering a G2 world,
[03:21:47.120 --> 03:21:49.440]   whether people want to admit it or not.
[03:21:49.440 --> 03:21:52.240]   And that a lot of these countries
[03:21:52.240 --> 03:21:54.280]   in what I call the middle market countries
[03:21:54.280 --> 03:21:56.480]   were basically playing, this one China was being aggressive
[03:21:56.480 --> 03:21:57.520]   with their one belt, one road.
[03:21:57.520 --> 03:22:00.960]   They were basically playing US and China against each other.
[03:22:00.960 --> 03:22:04.480]   And I thought that by the two leaders coming together,
[03:22:04.480 --> 03:22:07.240]   there were some things they wouldn't agree on,
[03:22:07.240 --> 03:22:09.200]   but there was a lot that they probably could agree on,
[03:22:09.200 --> 03:22:12.920]   which could lead to resolutions
[03:22:12.920 --> 03:22:15.080]   to a lot of issues in the world.
[03:22:15.080 --> 03:22:17.360]   That was like my most optimistic view.
[03:22:17.360 --> 03:22:21.360]   My most more pragmatic view was that President Trump
[03:22:21.360 --> 03:22:23.280]   had very big issues on trade
[03:22:23.280 --> 03:22:24.760]   that he wanted to get to with China.
[03:22:24.760 --> 03:22:27.760]   He felt like China, their trade practices were unfair.
[03:22:27.760 --> 03:22:30.680]   They weren't following all the global rules of trade.
[03:22:30.680 --> 03:22:31.640]   He was a little bit nervous
[03:22:31.640 --> 03:22:33.360]   that they would be provocative with Taiwan.
[03:22:33.360 --> 03:22:35.600]   And I felt like the two of them getting together
[03:22:35.600 --> 03:22:38.080]   would be the best way to try and resolve that.
[03:22:38.080 --> 03:22:42.120]   So the Chinese are very proud and a lot of it is about face.
[03:22:42.120 --> 03:22:46.920]   And so in order to negotiate for that first call,
[03:22:46.920 --> 03:22:48.960]   we basically agreed on what would happen in the call.
[03:22:48.960 --> 03:22:51.080]   So not let's just have a call, say hi, nice to meet you,
[03:22:51.080 --> 03:22:53.960]   it was a question of President Trump basically agreed
[03:22:53.960 --> 03:22:55.880]   that he would acknowledge the one China policy,
[03:22:55.880 --> 03:22:57.880]   which he didn't see as a big concession
[03:22:57.880 --> 03:22:59.640]   because you could always unacknowledge it the next day.
[03:22:59.640 --> 03:23:01.440]   So yeah, I'll acknowledge it and then we'll go.
[03:23:01.440 --> 03:23:05.240]   And in exchange, President Xi was gonna come over to the US
[03:23:05.240 --> 03:23:07.320]   for a visit so they could sit together.
[03:23:07.320 --> 03:23:08.960]   And they want to do it outside the White House.
[03:23:08.960 --> 03:23:10.240]   And so we agreed on Mar-a-Lago,
[03:23:10.240 --> 03:23:11.680]   which I also thought was good
[03:23:11.680 --> 03:23:13.920]   'cause President Trump always felt much more comfortable
[03:23:13.920 --> 03:23:16.320]   when he was hosting at his properties
[03:23:16.320 --> 03:23:17.440]   and he just felt at home.
[03:23:17.440 --> 03:23:19.400]   And so he liked having people as his guests
[03:23:19.400 --> 03:23:20.600]   and he loved it.
[03:23:20.600 --> 03:23:23.840]   He always felt really relaxed and it was great.
[03:23:23.840 --> 03:23:25.000]   So that was really what we did.
[03:23:25.000 --> 03:23:29.600]   Then the Chinese come over, very much anticipated visit
[03:23:29.600 --> 03:23:30.440]   and it was incredible.
[03:23:30.440 --> 03:23:33.520]   So they were supposed to sit together for 15 minutes
[03:23:33.520 --> 03:23:36.120]   and they sent about an hour and a half together.
[03:23:36.120 --> 03:23:37.640]   And during that meeting, President Trump, they said,
[03:23:37.640 --> 03:23:39.080]   "Look, let's just set some ground rules
[03:23:39.080 --> 03:23:40.160]   to this relationship.
[03:23:40.160 --> 03:23:41.520]   Like, let's just not talk about Taiwan.
[03:23:41.520 --> 03:23:43.800]   Like, just don't do anything I don't want on the table.
[03:23:43.800 --> 03:23:45.920]   If it does, I'm gonna have to do harsh things.
[03:23:45.920 --> 03:23:47.440]   I still want this to be a problem for four years.
[03:23:47.440 --> 03:23:49.000]   We got bigger issues."
[03:23:49.000 --> 03:23:50.560]   They basically just, again,
[03:23:50.560 --> 03:23:52.400]   you notice four years of Trump administration,
[03:23:52.400 --> 03:23:53.880]   no Taiwan talk whatsoever.
[03:23:53.880 --> 03:23:55.560]   It was a non-issue.
[03:23:55.560 --> 03:23:57.080]   Started talking about the trade issues.
[03:23:57.080 --> 03:23:59.320]   They spent a lot of time on North Korea.
[03:23:59.320 --> 03:24:01.240]   President Trump was trying to get the perspective
[03:24:01.240 --> 03:24:03.880]   from President Xi about North Korea
[03:24:03.880 --> 03:24:06.400]   because that was, again, considered from Obama,
[03:24:06.400 --> 03:24:07.840]   the biggest national security issue
[03:24:07.840 --> 03:24:09.760]   that we faced at the time.
[03:24:09.760 --> 03:24:13.120]   And they just had a good feeling for each other.
[03:24:13.120 --> 03:24:16.600]   It also helped that, you know, my wife and I,
[03:24:16.600 --> 03:24:20.160]   we actually had a Chinese nanny and teacher in our house
[03:24:20.160 --> 03:24:22.720]   and our kids learned fluent Mandarin.
[03:24:22.720 --> 03:24:24.960]   And our daughter actually opened
[03:24:24.960 --> 03:24:27.760]   when President Xi and President Trump were together
[03:24:27.760 --> 03:24:31.160]   with Melania and with Madam Peng.
[03:24:32.840 --> 03:24:35.480]   My daughter actually sang them a couple of Chinese songs.
[03:24:35.480 --> 03:24:38.160]   And I thought that was a nice way to show,
[03:24:38.160 --> 03:24:40.040]   you know, we're tough, but we respect your culture.
[03:24:40.040 --> 03:24:41.680]   'Cause the Chinese have an incredible culture
[03:24:41.680 --> 03:24:43.160]   that goes back thousands of years.
[03:24:43.160 --> 03:24:46.120]   They're very proud in how they do it.
[03:24:46.120 --> 03:24:48.320]   And I think that sign of respect also set things off
[03:24:48.320 --> 03:24:50.560]   in a very warm way for President Trump
[03:24:50.560 --> 03:24:52.560]   saying my granddaughter speaks Chinese
[03:24:52.560 --> 03:24:55.100]   and we're showing you the respect,
[03:24:55.100 --> 03:24:57.120]   which I think is very important.
[03:24:57.120 --> 03:24:59.160]   And he did have respect for them.
[03:24:59.160 --> 03:25:00.720]   The next part about the visit, I mean,
[03:25:00.720 --> 03:25:02.640]   obviously we had a lot of discussions on trade,
[03:25:02.640 --> 03:25:05.280]   but the part that was probably most impactful to me
[03:25:05.280 --> 03:25:10.120]   was President Xi basically did an hour monologue at lunch
[03:25:10.120 --> 03:25:13.760]   where he just went through Chinese history
[03:25:13.760 --> 03:25:14.760]   from his perspective.
[03:25:14.760 --> 03:25:18.560]   And he talked about, with particular emphasis
[03:25:18.560 --> 03:25:20.560]   on kind of the Treaty of Unequals
[03:25:20.560 --> 03:25:23.080]   and then the 100 Years of Humiliation.
[03:25:23.080 --> 03:25:26.640]   And then you go through from Mao all the way to today
[03:25:26.640 --> 03:25:29.720]   and you had, you know, China coming back and rising.
[03:25:29.720 --> 03:25:31.960]   And you could tell that he was,
[03:25:31.960 --> 03:25:33.960]   learned the lessons from the past
[03:25:33.960 --> 03:25:36.400]   and was very committed to kind of seeing China go through.
[03:25:36.400 --> 03:25:37.740]   So that was a different time, right?
[03:25:37.740 --> 03:25:41.600]   So China today is different than it was in 2017.
[03:25:41.600 --> 03:25:45.740]   In 2017, I remember President Xi was at Davos
[03:25:45.740 --> 03:25:47.800]   and he was vetted by all the top business people
[03:25:47.800 --> 03:25:49.400]   in the world as the, you know,
[03:25:49.400 --> 03:25:52.000]   Donald Trump was the threat to the global world order.
[03:25:52.000 --> 03:25:54.400]   President Xi was the champion of free trade
[03:25:54.400 --> 03:25:57.040]   and the biggest champion of environmentalism
[03:25:57.040 --> 03:25:58.920]   and fighting for climate change.
[03:25:58.920 --> 03:26:02.800]   And what occurred was President Trump came in
[03:26:02.800 --> 03:26:03.640]   and basically said, like,
[03:26:03.640 --> 03:26:05.360]   "I think China has not been following
[03:26:05.360 --> 03:26:07.120]   "the rules-based order."
[03:26:07.120 --> 03:26:09.500]   Took very, very drastic approaches with tariffs.
[03:26:09.500 --> 03:26:11.520]   Every time he would do the tariffs, again,
[03:26:11.520 --> 03:26:13.880]   you know, I had Mnuchin, our treasury secretary,
[03:26:13.880 --> 03:26:15.480]   come to Vankama House, "If he does this,
[03:26:15.480 --> 03:26:16.960]   "this is gonna crash the whole economy."
[03:26:16.960 --> 03:26:19.280]   I mean, these, and by the way, he believed it.
[03:26:19.280 --> 03:26:21.680]   I mean, these were things that people were telling him
[03:26:21.680 --> 03:26:23.480]   would be very tough to do.
[03:26:23.480 --> 03:26:25.280]   You know, President Trump had a gentleman named
[03:26:25.280 --> 03:26:27.720]   Ambassador Lighthizer, Robert Lighthizer.
[03:26:27.720 --> 03:26:29.440]   He was really the tip of the spear
[03:26:29.440 --> 03:26:31.600]   on all of our trade negotiations.
[03:26:31.600 --> 03:26:33.680]   He worked very well with Secretary Mnuchin.
[03:26:33.680 --> 03:26:36.000]   And they ended up, we ended up increasing tariffs
[03:26:36.000 --> 03:26:41.000]   to numbers that hadn't even been thought could happen.
[03:26:41.000 --> 03:26:43.040]   So we did the first round of tariffs.
[03:26:43.040 --> 03:26:44.960]   Then, you know, the Chinese came back
[03:26:44.960 --> 03:26:46.560]   and retaliated very surgically,
[03:26:46.560 --> 03:26:48.480]   trying to hit us in all the areas
[03:26:48.480 --> 03:26:49.920]   that politically would have been difficult.
[03:26:49.920 --> 03:26:52.480]   And what Trump did was instead of backing down,
[03:26:52.480 --> 03:26:55.160]   he took some of the revenue from the tariffs,
[03:26:55.160 --> 03:26:56.300]   gave it to the farmers and said,
[03:26:56.300 --> 03:26:57.700]   "I know that this is gonna hurt your business,
[03:26:57.700 --> 03:26:59.600]   "but I'm gonna make sure you guys are made whole."
[03:26:59.600 --> 03:27:02.080]   And then he doubled down and basically went back
[03:27:02.080 --> 03:27:03.600]   at the Chinese with even more tariffs.
[03:27:03.600 --> 03:27:05.200]   So what we watched over a year and a half
[03:27:05.200 --> 03:27:09.200]   was probably the biggest hand of poker that was ever played.
[03:27:09.200 --> 03:27:12.580]   And it was an amazing experience to be a part of it.
[03:27:12.580 --> 03:27:14.400]   And the role I played was really working
[03:27:14.400 --> 03:27:17.120]   for Secretary Mnuchin and Ambassador Lighthizer
[03:27:17.120 --> 03:27:19.120]   as a back channel with the Chinese
[03:27:19.120 --> 03:27:21.920]   to make sure we can just deescalate things
[03:27:21.920 --> 03:27:25.720]   and get to solutions in the best way possible.
[03:27:25.720 --> 03:27:29.360]   And so, anyway, it was a fascinating time.
[03:27:29.360 --> 03:27:31.840]   But if you think about the global awareness
[03:27:31.840 --> 03:27:35.760]   of the bad practices that China was putting in place today
[03:27:35.760 --> 03:27:38.220]   versus what they were in 2016,
[03:27:38.220 --> 03:27:41.040]   I think one of President Trump's most successful policies
[03:27:41.040 --> 03:27:44.280]   was shifting the way the entire world
[03:27:44.280 --> 03:27:46.840]   understood the threat of China
[03:27:46.840 --> 03:27:50.380]   and then putting in place the beginning of a regime
[03:27:50.380 --> 03:27:53.280]   to try and rebalance the world
[03:27:53.280 --> 03:27:55.600]   so that we could have more economic parity.
[03:27:55.600 --> 03:27:56.880]   - So you mentioned to me the book,
[03:27:56.880 --> 03:27:59.720]   "The 100-Year Marathon" by Michael Pillsbury
[03:27:59.720 --> 03:28:02.180]   when we discussed China.
[03:28:02.180 --> 03:28:07.200]   And I've got a chance to read parts of it.
[03:28:07.200 --> 03:28:08.840]   And I'd highly recommend people read it
[03:28:08.840 --> 03:28:10.440]   'cause there's a few,
[03:28:10.440 --> 03:28:13.060]   it's definitely an eye-opening perspective.
[03:28:13.060 --> 03:28:15.440]   I don't know if I agree with all of it.
[03:28:15.440 --> 03:28:16.640]   I don't know if you agree with all of it,
[03:28:16.640 --> 03:28:18.640]   but it certainly opens,
[03:28:18.640 --> 03:28:20.880]   it gives a very intense perspective on China.
[03:28:20.880 --> 03:28:24.680]   And you said it was instructive to how you thought,
[03:28:24.680 --> 03:28:26.580]   how Donald Trump thought about China.
[03:28:26.580 --> 03:28:30.440]   Can you describe the main thesis of the book
[03:28:30.440 --> 03:28:32.640]   and maybe with a hopeful view
[03:28:32.640 --> 03:28:35.040]   how it's possible to have a trajectory
[03:28:35.040 --> 03:28:39.080]   of these two superpowers working together in 21st century
[03:28:39.080 --> 03:28:42.760]   versus fighting against each other?
[03:28:42.760 --> 03:28:45.360]   - Perfect, so it's a very, very big book.
[03:28:45.360 --> 03:28:47.840]   And I think it's a book definitely worth reading.
[03:28:47.840 --> 03:28:51.120]   Michael is tremendous.
[03:28:51.120 --> 03:28:52.880]   He speaks fluent Mandarin.
[03:28:52.880 --> 03:28:56.120]   So he spent a lot of time researching to do the book.
[03:28:56.120 --> 03:28:57.720]   So I highly recommend it to everyone.
[03:28:57.720 --> 03:29:02.000]   And it was considered more of a fringe perspective in 2016,
[03:29:02.000 --> 03:29:03.440]   but it really, I think,
[03:29:03.440 --> 03:29:05.000]   came to represent the underpinning
[03:29:05.000 --> 03:29:07.480]   of what the collective thought was
[03:29:07.480 --> 03:29:09.480]   of the Trump administration.
[03:29:09.480 --> 03:29:12.760]   And maybe you could argue that it was even more cynical.
[03:29:12.760 --> 03:29:15.280]   The whole thesis of the book was that
[03:29:15.280 --> 03:29:18.000]   China from 1949 to 2049
[03:29:18.000 --> 03:29:20.800]   was working to reclaim their position
[03:29:20.800 --> 03:29:22.300]   as the global leader, right?
[03:29:22.300 --> 03:29:24.080]   So you had the Chinese empire.
[03:29:24.080 --> 03:29:26.920]   One of the things, I don't know if it's from this book
[03:29:26.920 --> 03:29:28.040]   or a different book that I read
[03:29:28.040 --> 03:29:30.720]   that spoke about how in the late 1700s,
[03:29:30.720 --> 03:29:32.480]   basically the emperor of China
[03:29:32.480 --> 03:29:36.360]   was offered some of the industrial capability from England,
[03:29:36.360 --> 03:29:39.080]   which was basically now becoming an industrial,
[03:29:39.080 --> 03:29:40.220]   the industrial revolution.
[03:29:40.220 --> 03:29:41.280]   And basically, no, we're fine.
[03:29:41.280 --> 03:29:42.440]   We're the great Chinese empire.
[03:29:42.440 --> 03:29:44.560]   We don't need any of these things.
[03:29:44.560 --> 03:29:46.280]   We're better than that.
[03:29:46.280 --> 03:29:48.840]   And by rejecting that, the rest of the world got stronger.
[03:29:48.840 --> 03:29:50.760]   China remained weaker.
[03:29:50.760 --> 03:29:53.140]   Then you had the opium wars.
[03:29:53.140 --> 03:29:55.100]   The Chinese had big opium problems
[03:29:55.100 --> 03:29:57.100]   through all the trade back and forth.
[03:29:57.100 --> 03:30:00.620]   And then China from about 1840 to 1940,
[03:30:00.620 --> 03:30:02.420]   at 100 years, where they really,
[03:30:02.420 --> 03:30:05.060]   after all these treaties,
[03:30:05.060 --> 03:30:07.460]   were really a second-class country.
[03:30:07.460 --> 03:30:10.460]   And so then you have the People's Revolution that comes in.
[03:30:10.460 --> 03:30:13.100]   And he talks about how China, very strategically,
[03:30:13.100 --> 03:30:14.700]   as a very, very poor country,
[03:30:14.700 --> 03:30:18.780]   would fight their way back and build brick by brick.
[03:30:18.780 --> 03:30:20.360]   And he proffers in the book
[03:30:20.360 --> 03:30:22.400]   that Nixon didn't go to China and open China.
[03:30:22.400 --> 03:30:24.080]   It was China that actually went to Nixon
[03:30:24.080 --> 03:30:26.760]   and was able to use Nixon in order to open up.
[03:30:26.760 --> 03:30:28.160]   And then they talk about how under Carter,
[03:30:28.160 --> 03:30:30.360]   they were able to get the US to contribute
[03:30:30.360 --> 03:30:31.960]   to a lot of their,
[03:30:31.960 --> 03:30:34.680]   they were able to kind of start borrowing the US know-how
[03:30:34.680 --> 03:30:36.600]   from our university systems, from our medical,
[03:30:36.600 --> 03:30:38.360]   from our science, from our research.
[03:30:38.360 --> 03:30:40.700]   And the whole notion that was the conventional thinking
[03:30:40.700 --> 03:30:43.840]   of American leaders was that
[03:30:43.840 --> 03:30:45.360]   the more we help China advance,
[03:30:45.360 --> 03:30:47.720]   the more they would become a free-market economy
[03:30:47.720 --> 03:30:48.660]   and it was a great market.
[03:30:48.660 --> 03:30:49.580]   The only difference was,
[03:30:49.580 --> 03:30:51.680]   was that they weren't allowing us access.
[03:30:51.680 --> 03:30:54.360]   They were making our companies basically give them
[03:30:54.360 --> 03:30:55.680]   all of their technical knowledge.
[03:30:55.680 --> 03:30:58.000]   They were stealing our intellectual property.
[03:30:58.000 --> 03:31:01.540]   They were doing espionage to steal a lot of the patents.
[03:31:01.540 --> 03:31:03.240]   They were just ignoring our patents
[03:31:03.240 --> 03:31:05.000]   and they weren't following any of the rules
[03:31:05.000 --> 03:31:06.520]   of international trade.
[03:31:06.520 --> 03:31:09.560]   Then they started becoming the world's manufacturing hub.
[03:31:09.560 --> 03:31:11.040]   They basically became the world's factory.
[03:31:11.040 --> 03:31:12.680]   And then they started this whole initiative
[03:31:12.680 --> 03:31:14.440]   called the Belt and Road Initiative
[03:31:14.440 --> 03:31:17.040]   in order to start locking in their lines of trades.
[03:31:17.040 --> 03:31:18.660]   They were buying up all the ports everywhere.
[03:31:18.660 --> 03:31:20.260]   They were building railways,
[03:31:20.260 --> 03:31:23.180]   thinking how do we lock in our distribution
[03:31:23.180 --> 03:31:24.780]   so that we can maintain the dominance
[03:31:24.780 --> 03:31:26.760]   as the world's global factory.
[03:31:26.760 --> 03:31:28.500]   And so it was a brilliant long-term plan
[03:31:28.500 --> 03:31:30.260]   that they were doing.
[03:31:30.260 --> 03:31:33.300]   And by raising awareness, by putting the tariffs,
[03:31:33.300 --> 03:31:34.760]   Trump slowed them down a lot.
[03:31:34.760 --> 03:31:37.380]   The real question is,
[03:31:37.380 --> 03:31:40.060]   is if they actually did achieve this full objective
[03:31:40.060 --> 03:31:43.440]   of becoming the world dominant country,
[03:31:43.440 --> 03:31:44.460]   what they would have done with it,
[03:31:44.460 --> 03:31:46.260]   whether they would have been nefarious or not.
[03:31:46.260 --> 03:31:47.580]   I think from my perspective,
[03:31:47.580 --> 03:31:49.380]   even with some of the divisions and issues
[03:31:49.380 --> 03:31:50.940]   we have now in America,
[03:31:50.940 --> 03:31:53.480]   I still would rather an American-led world order
[03:31:53.480 --> 03:31:55.140]   than a Chinese-led world order.
[03:31:55.140 --> 03:31:58.060]   But the notion was is that they were playing
[03:31:58.060 --> 03:32:00.740]   a very zero-sum game and really going to be
[03:32:00.740 --> 03:32:03.340]   the dominant leader in this new world order.
[03:32:03.340 --> 03:32:06.500]   So that really framed the perspective.
[03:32:06.500 --> 03:32:07.780]   And it wasn't necessarily,
[03:32:07.780 --> 03:32:11.460]   and the Chinese were always fearing,
[03:32:11.460 --> 03:32:13.300]   is Trump trying to stop our rise?
[03:32:13.300 --> 03:32:15.180]   And you have a great book also by Graham Allison
[03:32:15.180 --> 03:32:16.740]   that he writes about,
[03:32:16.740 --> 03:32:19.260]   are we destined for war between US and China?
[03:32:19.260 --> 03:32:21.500]   And he goes through different historical times
[03:32:21.500 --> 03:32:24.660]   where you have a power and a rising superpower.
[03:32:24.660 --> 03:32:27.100]   And I think more than half the time
[03:32:27.100 --> 03:32:28.180]   it ends up leading to war.
[03:32:28.180 --> 03:32:31.020]   So the question is, is what's gonna happen here?
[03:32:31.020 --> 03:32:33.540]   And I do think that Trump's perspective,
[03:32:33.540 --> 03:32:34.820]   and this is my interpretation,
[03:32:34.820 --> 03:32:36.660]   because everything was always tactical day-to-day
[03:32:36.660 --> 03:32:39.120]   and he was unpredictable to the Chinese,
[03:32:39.120 --> 03:32:40.140]   which they couldn't deal with.
[03:32:40.140 --> 03:32:42.340]   And he was unpredictable even to his team sometimes
[03:32:42.340 --> 03:32:44.880]   because he was playing it day-by-day
[03:32:44.880 --> 03:32:47.580]   and issue-by-issue and always changing and adjusting,
[03:32:47.580 --> 03:32:49.980]   which is how an entrepreneur thinks.
[03:32:49.980 --> 03:32:53.720]   He respected the job they did by building their country.
[03:32:53.720 --> 03:32:55.620]   They moved 300 million people out of poverty
[03:32:55.620 --> 03:32:56.460]   into the middle class.
[03:32:56.460 --> 03:32:59.400]   They did it at the expense of a lot of other countries
[03:32:59.400 --> 03:33:01.620]   throughout the world, especially America.
[03:33:01.620 --> 03:33:04.580]   But Trump says, look, stupid politicians made deals.
[03:33:04.580 --> 03:33:06.740]   I respect China for doing what they did.
[03:33:06.740 --> 03:33:09.500]   But what I wanna do is I wanna change the paradigm
[03:33:09.500 --> 03:33:11.420]   so that for the next 20 years
[03:33:11.420 --> 03:33:13.580]   we can maintain our advantage over them.
[03:33:13.580 --> 03:33:16.100]   We can maintain our competitive dynamic.
[03:33:16.100 --> 03:33:18.460]   And his general view was that America
[03:33:18.460 --> 03:33:20.040]   is the best private sector in the world.
[03:33:20.040 --> 03:33:23.540]   We have a lot of the best minds in the world.
[03:33:23.540 --> 03:33:26.220]   And if we can just have a level playing field
[03:33:26.220 --> 03:33:29.740]   with set rules, then America should be able to outperform.
[03:33:29.740 --> 03:33:32.620]   And so that's really what we were trying to do.
[03:33:32.620 --> 03:33:33.860]   We were trying to kind of get rid
[03:33:33.860 --> 03:33:35.720]   of some of their state subsidies,
[03:33:35.720 --> 03:33:36.800]   get rid of, make them follow
[03:33:36.800 --> 03:33:39.180]   some of these international rules of trade,
[03:33:39.180 --> 03:33:43.700]   and not allowing them to do predatory investments
[03:33:43.700 --> 03:33:47.180]   that then undercut different industries that we had
[03:33:47.180 --> 03:33:49.020]   so that they can have global market dominance
[03:33:49.020 --> 03:33:50.480]   or monopolies on different industries
[03:33:50.480 --> 03:33:54.700]   and then have pricing power, but also geopolitical power.
[03:33:54.700 --> 03:33:57.460]   So like one of the examples that people talk about now
[03:33:57.460 --> 03:34:00.660]   is China for the last 20 years was very advanced
[03:34:00.660 --> 03:34:03.460]   on seeing this electrification trend.
[03:34:03.460 --> 03:34:06.700]   They went, they subsidized solar panels.
[03:34:06.700 --> 03:34:09.040]   A lot of the American solar panel players
[03:34:09.040 --> 03:34:09.940]   were put out of business.
[03:34:09.940 --> 03:34:12.320]   So now I think it's like 90 plus percent
[03:34:12.320 --> 03:34:15.680]   of solar panels in the world are manufactured in China.
[03:34:15.680 --> 03:34:17.360]   Then all the rare earths that you need
[03:34:17.360 --> 03:34:20.400]   in order to make these solar panels
[03:34:20.400 --> 03:34:22.420]   and to make these electric vehicles,
[03:34:22.420 --> 03:34:23.860]   China's bought up most of them
[03:34:23.860 --> 03:34:25.760]   and a lot of the refining capacities in China.
[03:34:25.760 --> 03:34:28.220]   So thinking through strategically,
[03:34:28.220 --> 03:34:29.940]   how do we create an even playing field
[03:34:29.940 --> 03:34:32.180]   so that we're not at the mercy of them
[03:34:32.180 --> 03:34:35.100]   and how you can have a rules-based world order,
[03:34:35.100 --> 03:34:36.740]   that was really kind of the thought
[03:34:36.740 --> 03:34:39.860]   of what we were trying to work towards.
[03:34:39.860 --> 03:34:44.860]   - So there's this SNL skit where Jimmy Fallon plays you
[03:34:44.860 --> 03:34:49.020]   and you're walking into the Oval Office looking cool,
[03:34:49.020 --> 03:34:52.660]   wearing shades and a bulletproof vest
[03:34:52.660 --> 03:34:55.380]   to the song "Unbelievable" by EMF.
[03:34:55.380 --> 03:34:57.580]   I don't know if you've seen it, but it's pretty epic.
[03:34:57.580 --> 03:35:00.700]   And then Trump says that you've traveled the world
[03:35:00.700 --> 03:35:02.400]   representing the administration,
[03:35:02.400 --> 03:35:04.560]   but no one has ever heard you speak.
[03:35:04.560 --> 03:35:06.540]   So there's a lot of questions I can ask about that
[03:35:06.540 --> 03:35:08.940]   but one of them is, can you introspect
[03:35:08.940 --> 03:35:11.020]   why you choose this low-key approach
[03:35:11.020 --> 03:35:14.860]   of kind of operating behind the scenes
[03:35:14.860 --> 03:35:17.780]   and not speaking much to the public, at least at the time?
[03:35:17.780 --> 03:35:19.460]   You've spoken a little bit more
[03:35:19.460 --> 03:35:22.020]   and today you've spoken for a really long time,
[03:35:22.020 --> 03:35:23.700]   which I deeply appreciate.
[03:35:23.700 --> 03:35:25.220]   - No, it's been a pleasure to do this
[03:35:25.220 --> 03:35:26.620]   and thank you for the opportunity
[03:35:26.620 --> 03:35:28.460]   to talk about these things.
[03:35:28.460 --> 03:35:31.020]   And so that was a really funny skit.
[03:35:31.020 --> 03:35:35.900]   And it's funny, the thing I got made fun of the most for that
[03:35:35.900 --> 03:35:36.940]   was the wardrobe.
[03:35:36.940 --> 03:35:40.500]   And that came from after three months in the administration,
[03:35:40.500 --> 03:35:42.620]   we were having dinner with all the generals
[03:35:42.620 --> 03:35:46.120]   and they were saying, updating us on the war with ISIS.
[03:35:46.120 --> 03:35:47.780]   And General Dunford said to me after,
[03:35:47.780 --> 03:35:48.860]   "Look, the president can't come
[03:35:48.860 --> 03:35:50.700]   "to see how we're fighting this war,
[03:35:50.700 --> 03:35:53.040]   "but I'd like to invite you to come with me to Iraq
[03:35:53.040 --> 03:35:55.100]   "and come see, and would you come with me?"
[03:35:55.100 --> 03:35:57.580]   I said, "No, that's great, I always learned in business
[03:35:57.580 --> 03:36:00.340]   "that you can't make decisions from just an ivory tower.
[03:36:00.340 --> 03:36:01.540]   "You have to go to the front lines
[03:36:01.540 --> 03:36:03.700]   "and see what's actually happening."
[03:36:03.700 --> 03:36:05.820]   So I said, "No problem, I'd love to go."
[03:36:05.820 --> 03:36:07.420]   Meanwhile, two days before I'm about to go,
[03:36:07.420 --> 03:36:09.760]   the doc from the White House stops by my office and says,
[03:36:09.760 --> 03:36:10.780]   "We need to get your blood type."
[03:36:10.780 --> 03:36:11.860]   So what do you mean my blood type is?
[03:36:11.860 --> 03:36:13.060]   You're going to an active war zone.
[03:36:13.060 --> 03:36:15.500]   I'm like, okay, so I guess I'll go to a war zone.
[03:36:15.500 --> 03:36:17.880]   I didn't really think this thing fully through.
[03:36:17.880 --> 03:36:22.100]   So I get on the plane with Dunford and we land in Iraq
[03:36:22.100 --> 03:36:25.900]   and he looks like GI Joe, he's a great general,
[03:36:25.900 --> 03:36:28.620]   he's very, very well-respected in the military.
[03:36:28.620 --> 03:36:32.900]   And we go in and we get on Black Hawk helicopter.
[03:36:32.900 --> 03:36:33.920]   They said, "You know what, today's a nice day,
[03:36:33.920 --> 03:36:36.340]   "let's take the sides off."
[03:36:36.340 --> 03:36:39.660]   And so I get on the plane and there's a guy,
[03:36:39.660 --> 03:36:44.300]   a military service officer who then takes a machine gun,
[03:36:44.300 --> 03:36:46.420]   locks it into a thing, takes the bullets,
[03:36:46.420 --> 03:36:48.380]   puts them into the gun and is sitting there saying,
[03:36:48.380 --> 03:36:49.340]   "We're ready to go."
[03:36:49.340 --> 03:36:50.180]   And then I'm looking out
[03:36:50.180 --> 03:36:52.260]   and there's like three other helicopters with guys.
[03:36:52.260 --> 03:36:55.300]   One was an Osprey with a guy buckled in,
[03:36:55.300 --> 03:36:56.860]   also with a machine gun looking out.
[03:36:56.860 --> 03:36:59.300]   We take off and we're flying over Baghdad
[03:36:59.300 --> 03:37:02.480]   from the airport to the embassy.
[03:37:02.480 --> 03:37:06.380]   And as we're going, I'm sitting in an open air helicopter
[03:37:06.380 --> 03:37:08.880]   with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
[03:37:08.880 --> 03:37:10.740]   guys with machine guns everywhere.
[03:37:10.740 --> 03:37:12.380]   - This is a new experience for you.
[03:37:12.380 --> 03:37:13.220]   You haven't experienced this previously.
[03:37:13.220 --> 03:37:14.040]   - I would say slightly.
[03:37:14.040 --> 03:37:15.900]   I mean, I was doing real estate like three months ago,
[03:37:15.900 --> 03:37:18.100]   you know, and now I'm flying over Iraq
[03:37:18.100 --> 03:37:21.100]   and the chairman says, "That's Saddam Hussein's palace."
[03:37:21.100 --> 03:37:22.660]   And I look down, there's like a big bomb
[03:37:22.660 --> 03:37:23.500]   right through the middle.
[03:37:23.500 --> 03:37:26.340]   Then you see the area with the two swords in the hands.
[03:37:26.340 --> 03:37:28.140]   I'm saying to myself, like, "How the hell did I get here?
[03:37:28.140 --> 03:37:30.060]   "Like, what is happening?"
[03:37:30.060 --> 03:37:32.560]   So meanwhile, we ended up going to the front lines
[03:37:32.560 --> 03:37:34.680]   to be with the service, the Iraqi military,
[03:37:34.680 --> 03:37:37.120]   which the US military was working closely with.
[03:37:37.120 --> 03:37:39.040]   And I had a meeting that night with the president of Iraq.
[03:37:39.040 --> 03:37:41.520]   And so I wore, what do you wear to the front lines
[03:37:41.520 --> 03:37:42.360]   in a battle zone?
[03:37:42.360 --> 03:37:43.880]   And also me and the president.
[03:37:43.880 --> 03:37:45.720]   So I put a sports jacket on.
[03:37:45.720 --> 03:37:49.760]   We land at the front line and they give me a bulletproof vest
[03:37:49.760 --> 03:37:50.800]   that says Kushner on it.
[03:37:50.800 --> 03:37:51.920]   I tape it.
[03:37:51.920 --> 03:37:55.640]   I just, I put it on, I go out and I cover the NER.
[03:37:55.640 --> 03:37:57.120]   So it just said Kush.
[03:37:57.120 --> 03:37:59.920]   And I went and I didn't realize they were taking pictures.
[03:37:59.920 --> 03:38:00.760]   And so-
[03:38:00.760 --> 03:38:01.580]   - I think the picture looks pretty epic.
[03:38:01.580 --> 03:38:02.620]   You with sunglasses.
[03:38:02.620 --> 03:38:03.580]   I think I love it.
[03:38:03.580 --> 03:38:05.720]   - So anyway, so that was the funny story behind that.
[03:38:05.720 --> 03:38:09.040]   And then actually my brother was at some society event
[03:38:09.040 --> 03:38:11.700]   in New York and he ran into Jimmy Fallon.
[03:38:11.700 --> 03:38:13.400]   So the two of them took a selfie together.
[03:38:13.400 --> 03:38:16.220]   And Josh writes me, he says,
[03:38:16.220 --> 03:38:18.020]   hanging out with my older brother in New York.
[03:38:18.020 --> 03:38:18.860]   (laughing)
[03:38:18.860 --> 03:38:20.020]   You know, I'm trying to explain to him
[03:38:20.020 --> 03:38:21.180]   what your voice sounds like.
[03:38:21.180 --> 03:38:22.760]   So it was good.
[03:38:22.760 --> 03:38:23.620]   So that was a funny one.
[03:38:23.620 --> 03:38:27.800]   But I think just being behind the scenes for me
[03:38:27.800 --> 03:38:29.340]   just gave me more maneuverability
[03:38:29.340 --> 03:38:31.220]   in the sense that, you know, again,
[03:38:31.220 --> 03:38:32.900]   it goes back to trust and people knowing
[03:38:32.900 --> 03:38:35.100]   that I wasn't gonna try to publicize
[03:38:35.100 --> 03:38:36.620]   the things they were telling me.
[03:38:36.620 --> 03:38:40.120]   I think it just gave me more ability to operate that way.
[03:38:40.120 --> 03:38:42.020]   And I also realized too, like,
[03:38:42.020 --> 03:38:44.620]   communicating is a very important skill.
[03:38:44.620 --> 03:38:45.740]   Luckily in Washington,
[03:38:45.740 --> 03:38:47.820]   there's no shortage of amazing communicators.
[03:38:47.820 --> 03:38:49.460]   I think there were a lot of people
[03:38:49.460 --> 03:38:51.660]   who are much better at me than being communicators.
[03:38:51.660 --> 03:38:54.640]   So I was very happy that they were willing to do it
[03:38:54.640 --> 03:38:55.580]   'cause it wasn't something
[03:38:55.580 --> 03:38:57.460]   that I had a lot of experience with
[03:38:57.460 --> 03:39:00.140]   or necessarily I thought I was very good at.
[03:39:00.140 --> 03:39:01.940]   And so I kind of just did my job
[03:39:01.940 --> 03:39:04.420]   and just focused on getting things done.
[03:39:04.420 --> 03:39:10.460]   - So let me ask you, you have a very interesting life.
[03:39:10.460 --> 03:39:13.860]   If you were to give advice to young folks
[03:39:13.860 --> 03:39:17.260]   on how to have such an impactful life,
[03:39:17.260 --> 03:39:18.220]   what would you say?
[03:39:18.220 --> 03:39:21.420]   Career and life.
[03:39:21.420 --> 03:39:25.280]   How to have a successful career and a successful life.
[03:39:25.280 --> 03:39:27.080]   - Number one is I would say,
[03:39:27.080 --> 03:39:30.900]   you just have to work hard at everything you do.
[03:39:30.900 --> 03:39:35.140]   Number two, I would say, never stop learning
[03:39:35.140 --> 03:39:38.300]   and always try to say yes more than you should.
[03:39:38.300 --> 03:39:39.740]   Go out of your comfort zone.
[03:39:39.740 --> 03:39:44.780]   And I think just you gotta work hard at everything you do.
[03:39:44.780 --> 03:39:47.020]   And if you're gonna take something on,
[03:39:47.020 --> 03:39:48.700]   do it the best you can.
[03:39:48.700 --> 03:39:50.980]   One of the lessons I write about in the book from my father
[03:39:50.980 --> 03:39:53.700]   was, I remember I was going for a job interview
[03:39:53.700 --> 03:39:56.080]   and he asked me, he says, "Well, what time
[03:39:56.080 --> 03:39:57.480]   "are you leaving to the job interview?"
[03:39:57.480 --> 03:39:58.320]   It was at nine o'clock.
[03:39:58.320 --> 03:39:59.240]   I said, "I'll leave at eight o'clock."
[03:39:59.240 --> 03:40:00.400]   He said, "Well, what if there's traffic?"
[03:40:00.400 --> 03:40:02.760]   I said, "Dad, I've done this drive a thousand times.
[03:40:02.760 --> 03:40:03.960]   "There's never traffic."
[03:40:03.960 --> 03:40:05.080]   He said, "What if there's an accident?"
[03:40:05.080 --> 03:40:06.680]   I said, "I can't control that."
[03:40:06.680 --> 03:40:08.460]   He said, "Jared, the only excuse you ever have
[03:40:08.460 --> 03:40:11.360]   "for being late is that you didn't leave early enough."
[03:40:11.360 --> 03:40:13.320]   And I just think it's something where
[03:40:13.320 --> 03:40:15.520]   if you wanna accomplish something,
[03:40:15.520 --> 03:40:17.080]   a lot of people I hear they complain
[03:40:17.080 --> 03:40:19.120]   about what other people do or why it's hard
[03:40:19.120 --> 03:40:20.480]   or why it's impossible.
[03:40:20.480 --> 03:40:22.960]   And again, I say this as somebody who's been so blessed
[03:40:22.960 --> 03:40:26.860]   with so many things in life, but when I've had challenges
[03:40:26.860 --> 03:40:28.980]   or things I've wanted to achieve,
[03:40:28.980 --> 03:40:31.700]   I just focus and say, "What can I do?"
[03:40:31.700 --> 03:40:34.720]   And I'll read everything I can get my hands on.
[03:40:34.720 --> 03:40:37.720]   If I fail at one, the door closes, I'll try the window.
[03:40:37.720 --> 03:40:39.160]   If the window closes, I'll try the chimney.
[03:40:39.160 --> 03:40:40.720]   If the chimney closes, I'll try to dig a tunnel.
[03:40:40.720 --> 03:40:42.760]   It's just, if you wanna accomplish something,
[03:40:42.760 --> 03:40:43.860]   you just have to go at it.
[03:40:43.860 --> 03:40:46.740]   And I think the most important thing I'll say,
[03:40:46.740 --> 03:40:49.420]   sorry, I'm kind of thinking my way into this answer,
[03:40:49.420 --> 03:40:51.820]   is just do the right thing.
[03:40:51.820 --> 03:40:53.140]   I think that's also right.
[03:40:53.140 --> 03:40:56.260]   And I saw that in my career, be good to people,
[03:40:56.260 --> 03:40:58.260]   be honest, do the right thing.
[03:40:58.260 --> 03:41:03.180]   And if you do that, I think long-term, it does pay off.
[03:41:03.180 --> 03:41:06.540]   Maybe not in politics, but in the world at large, it does.
[03:41:06.540 --> 03:41:08.860]   And my hope is in politics, it will as well.
[03:41:08.860 --> 03:41:11.660]   - I wonder if you can comment on your process of learning
[03:41:11.660 --> 03:41:13.460]   in general, 'cause you took on so many new,
[03:41:13.460 --> 03:41:17.100]   interesting problems and approached them
[03:41:17.100 --> 03:41:20.060]   with a first principles kind of approach.
[03:41:20.060 --> 03:41:22.980]   So what was your source of information?
[03:41:22.980 --> 03:41:24.740]   'Cause you didn't seem to be listening
[03:41:24.740 --> 03:41:29.060]   to the assumptions of the prior experts.
[03:41:29.060 --> 03:41:32.180]   You were just taking on the problem
[03:41:32.180 --> 03:41:35.260]   in a very pragmatic perspective.
[03:41:35.260 --> 03:41:38.700]   So what was, how'd you learn about the Middle East?
[03:41:38.700 --> 03:41:40.980]   How did you learn about China?
[03:41:40.980 --> 03:41:42.300]   How did you learn about Mexico?
[03:41:42.300 --> 03:41:45.380]   How did you, like all of these prison reform,
[03:41:45.380 --> 03:41:47.020]   all of this that you've taken on
[03:41:47.020 --> 03:41:48.860]   and were extremely effective at?
[03:41:48.860 --> 03:41:51.540]   - It really started with just talking to people.
[03:41:51.540 --> 03:41:53.660]   I would try to reach out to people
[03:41:53.660 --> 03:41:55.900]   who had been involved in different things
[03:41:55.900 --> 03:41:59.460]   and ask them what they did, what they thought of the problem,
[03:41:59.460 --> 03:42:00.980]   who they thought was smart on it,
[03:42:00.980 --> 03:42:04.300]   what they read that helped them get a better understanding,
[03:42:04.300 --> 03:42:06.740]   why they think something had failed.
[03:42:06.740 --> 03:42:11.020]   And then I would just read voraciously on every topic.
[03:42:11.020 --> 03:42:13.540]   Washington, it was harder to get advice from humans
[03:42:13.540 --> 03:42:16.300]   because I found humans had this weird tendency
[03:42:16.300 --> 03:42:17.300]   to talk to the media.
[03:42:17.300 --> 03:42:20.060]   And so I talked to somebody and I'd ask advice.
[03:42:20.060 --> 03:42:21.020]   And then the next thing I'd know
[03:42:21.020 --> 03:42:22.660]   is the Washington Post would call and say,
[03:42:22.660 --> 03:42:24.020]   "Jared's an idiot, doesn't know what he's doing,
[03:42:24.020 --> 03:42:25.540]   "and he's even going to this person to get advice."
[03:42:25.540 --> 03:42:26.940]   I'm like, "Yeah, I'm asking everyone."
[03:42:26.940 --> 03:42:31.940]   So books really became an amazing guide for me.
[03:42:31.940 --> 03:42:34.860]   Ivanka, she's an incredible researcher.
[03:42:34.860 --> 03:42:36.260]   She's just voracious.
[03:42:36.260 --> 03:42:38.420]   And so she gave me some of my best books
[03:42:38.420 --> 03:42:40.620]   and some incredible advice as well.
[03:42:40.620 --> 03:42:42.160]   But that was really the process.
[03:42:42.160 --> 03:42:44.780]   And then I think that was kind of the first stage.
[03:42:44.780 --> 03:42:47.340]   And then the second stage was just constant iteration
[03:42:47.340 --> 03:42:50.180]   and readjusting plan as you continue to get more learning.
[03:42:50.180 --> 03:42:52.240]   And one story I tell in the book as well
[03:42:52.240 --> 03:42:54.820]   is that on my first trip to the Middle East,
[03:42:54.820 --> 03:42:56.820]   where I met with Mohammed bin Zayed,
[03:42:56.820 --> 03:42:59.940]   who I spoke about earlier, the ruler of UAE,
[03:42:59.940 --> 03:43:02.740]   I spent two hours with him asking him questions
[03:43:02.740 --> 03:43:05.940]   and really going through the Israeli-Palestinian issue,
[03:43:05.940 --> 03:43:07.700]   the Israeli-Arab issue.
[03:43:07.700 --> 03:43:09.260]   And he said to me at the end of the meeting,
[03:43:09.260 --> 03:43:11.340]   he says, "Jared, I think you're gonna make peace
[03:43:11.340 --> 03:43:13.060]   "here in the Middle East."
[03:43:13.060 --> 03:43:14.900]   And I was shocked because, I mean, first of all,
[03:43:14.900 --> 03:43:16.700]   he was, at the time, I think,
[03:43:16.700 --> 03:43:19.540]   some of the most respected leaders in the region,
[03:43:19.540 --> 03:43:21.360]   somebody who I found to be very wise
[03:43:21.360 --> 03:43:23.740]   and super thoughtful and experienced.
[03:43:23.740 --> 03:43:26.020]   And I said to him, "Why do you say that?"
[03:43:26.020 --> 03:43:27.140]   I was flattered, obviously,
[03:43:27.140 --> 03:43:30.700]   but not certain why he was saying that
[03:43:30.700 --> 03:43:32.580]   based on the fact that I didn't know what my plan was.
[03:43:32.580 --> 03:43:33.420]   I didn't know what I was gonna do
[03:43:33.420 --> 03:43:35.280]   and I had no pathway to make peace.
[03:43:35.280 --> 03:43:38.380]   And he said, "Well, the US usually sends
[03:43:38.380 --> 03:43:41.220]   "one of three different kinds of people to come see me."
[03:43:41.220 --> 03:43:42.920]   He says, "The first are people who come
[03:43:42.920 --> 03:43:44.820]   "and they fall asleep in meetings."
[03:43:44.820 --> 03:43:46.900]   He said, "The second are people who come
[03:43:46.900 --> 03:43:48.500]   "and they basically read me notes
[03:43:48.500 --> 03:43:51.300]   "but have no ability to interact
[03:43:51.300 --> 03:43:53.280]   "on the message they're there to convey.
[03:43:53.280 --> 03:43:54.900]   "And then the third have been people
[03:43:54.900 --> 03:43:57.320]   "who have come to convince me to do things
[03:43:57.320 --> 03:43:59.300]   "that aren't in my interests."
[03:43:59.300 --> 03:44:01.820]   He says, "You're the first person who's ever come here
[03:44:01.820 --> 03:44:03.740]   "and has just asked questions."
[03:44:03.740 --> 03:44:05.900]   He says, "Why have you done that?"
[03:44:05.900 --> 03:44:08.420]   I said, "Because I figure this problem's
[03:44:08.420 --> 03:44:09.940]   "been going on for a long time.
[03:44:09.940 --> 03:44:12.000]   "You live here, I'll be gone at some point.
[03:44:12.000 --> 03:44:13.860]   "You're gonna have to live with the consequences
[03:44:13.860 --> 03:44:17.240]   "of whatever my work is and the US has a lot of power.
[03:44:17.240 --> 03:44:21.340]   "And my question is, what would you do if you were me?
[03:44:21.340 --> 03:44:22.920]   "And how would you approach this?
[03:44:22.920 --> 03:44:24.700]   "And help me think about it."
[03:44:24.700 --> 03:44:26.500]   And again, I wasn't gonna then take his plan
[03:44:26.500 --> 03:44:29.720]   and then execute it, but I thought it'd be very provocative
[03:44:29.720 --> 03:44:32.020]   to understand from the people in the region
[03:44:32.020 --> 03:44:35.420]   and instructive how they would use the resource
[03:44:35.420 --> 03:44:38.580]   and the power that the US had to solve the problems
[03:44:38.580 --> 03:44:42.540]   that were having significant impact on their lives.
[03:44:42.540 --> 03:44:45.880]   - Yeah, there's a lot of power to the simplicity
[03:44:45.880 --> 03:44:53.580]   of that human approach where you're just listening.
[03:44:53.580 --> 03:44:55.900]   - Yeah, and one of my wishes for society
[03:44:55.900 --> 03:44:57.500]   is I leave government.
[03:44:57.500 --> 03:45:00.400]   I was living on the Upper East Side
[03:45:00.400 --> 03:45:02.740]   in a very liberal echo chamber.
[03:45:02.740 --> 03:45:03.960]   I then traveled the country.
[03:45:03.960 --> 03:45:07.340]   I met so many people who I never would have met otherwise
[03:45:07.340 --> 03:45:09.480]   on the conservative side, on the independent side,
[03:45:09.480 --> 03:45:11.140]   on so many different issues.
[03:45:11.140 --> 03:45:12.580]   I think that people benefit
[03:45:12.580 --> 03:45:14.540]   if you have such a strong point of view.
[03:45:14.540 --> 03:45:18.020]   I would follow the John Stuart Mill marketplace of ideas
[03:45:18.020 --> 03:45:20.380]   and find people who disagree with you
[03:45:20.380 --> 03:45:23.000]   and don't call them names, don't say they're a bad person.
[03:45:23.000 --> 03:45:25.740]   Say, "I wanna understand why you feel the way you do.
[03:45:25.740 --> 03:45:28.100]   "Let's have conversations in this country."
[03:45:28.100 --> 03:45:30.900]   And I think that that's probably gonna be our best way
[03:45:30.900 --> 03:45:34.620]   to work through the issues that we have currently.
[03:45:34.620 --> 03:45:37.940]   - When you zoom out and look at the 21st century
[03:45:37.940 --> 03:45:39.900]   from a human history perspective,
[03:45:39.900 --> 03:45:43.460]   across the time scale of many decades, maybe centuries,
[03:45:43.460 --> 03:45:46.580]   what gives you hope about human civilization?
[03:45:46.580 --> 03:45:47.820]   Everything you've seen.
[03:45:47.820 --> 03:45:49.440]   You've traveled the world,
[03:45:49.440 --> 03:45:50.700]   you've talked to some of the most powerful
[03:45:50.700 --> 03:45:54.180]   and influential people, and you look at the future.
[03:45:54.180 --> 03:45:57.200]   What gives you hope about this little planet of ours?
[03:45:57.200 --> 03:45:59.940]   - What gives me the most hope is that anything's possible.
[03:45:59.940 --> 03:46:03.860]   If there's one lesson that I took from my time in government
[03:46:03.860 --> 03:46:06.300]   it's that people coming together
[03:46:06.300 --> 03:46:10.340]   to try to make tomorrow different than yesterday can succeed.
[03:46:10.340 --> 03:46:12.500]   And if the right people in the right places
[03:46:12.500 --> 03:46:13.980]   focus on the right ideas,
[03:46:13.980 --> 03:46:17.540]   I think the advancement that we can have for human history
[03:46:17.540 --> 03:46:19.340]   and for society can be tremendous.
[03:46:19.340 --> 03:46:22.800]   And I think that right now I see we're at a place in society
[03:46:22.800 --> 03:46:25.060]   where there's a lot of what I call squabbles
[03:46:25.060 --> 03:46:28.940]   between countries, which are really man versus man issues.
[03:46:28.940 --> 03:46:31.700]   And those are as old as time, right?
[03:46:31.700 --> 03:46:34.620]   We've been fighting about borders or religion
[03:46:34.620 --> 03:46:38.620]   or who wronged somebody 100 or a thousand years ago.
[03:46:38.620 --> 03:46:41.180]   And these are what I call more tribal battles.
[03:46:41.180 --> 03:46:43.320]   But I do think that as we advance
[03:46:43.320 --> 03:46:46.600]   with artificial intelligence, as energy becomes cheaper
[03:46:46.600 --> 03:46:48.940]   and it's more readily available,
[03:46:48.940 --> 03:46:50.980]   I think we're gonna have massive industrialization.
[03:46:50.980 --> 03:46:52.920]   I think we're gonna have massive advancement.
[03:46:52.920 --> 03:46:54.820]   I think in medical and science,
[03:46:54.820 --> 03:46:57.660]   we're gonna have cures for diseases.
[03:46:57.660 --> 03:47:00.140]   We have the potential in 10, 20 years from now
[03:47:00.140 --> 03:47:03.180]   to enter a dawn for humanity that could be incredible.
[03:47:03.180 --> 03:47:05.620]   We could become multi-planetary.
[03:47:05.620 --> 03:47:07.900]   We can explore the wonders of the world.
[03:47:07.900 --> 03:47:10.900]   We can find things we didn't know.
[03:47:10.900 --> 03:47:15.700]   So I think that if we put our energy
[03:47:15.700 --> 03:47:17.560]   towards finding these advancements
[03:47:17.560 --> 03:47:22.560]   that will improve the lives of everyone on this planet,
[03:47:22.560 --> 03:47:24.120]   instead of figuring out ways
[03:47:24.120 --> 03:47:26.300]   to have these tensions between us,
[03:47:26.300 --> 03:47:29.340]   that for me is the most optimistic case for what's possible.
[03:47:29.340 --> 03:47:30.980]   And the reason why I believe it's possible
[03:47:30.980 --> 03:47:34.460]   is because somebody with no experience,
[03:47:34.460 --> 03:47:39.460]   somebody who all I really had was the faith of a leader,
[03:47:39.460 --> 03:47:43.060]   and I had the courage to try,
[03:47:43.060 --> 03:47:44.540]   and I went out there with other people
[03:47:44.540 --> 03:47:46.560]   and we took on some of the most hopeless
[03:47:46.560 --> 03:47:49.220]   and possible problems and we succeeded.
[03:47:49.220 --> 03:47:50.780]   And if we were able to do that,
[03:47:50.780 --> 03:47:53.660]   then everyone else should be able to do that as well.
[03:47:53.660 --> 03:47:57.180]   - Well, Jared, thank you for having the courage to try.
[03:47:57.180 --> 03:47:59.740]   Thank you for your friendship, for your kindness,
[03:47:59.740 --> 03:48:02.660]   most importantly for your book recommendations.
[03:48:02.660 --> 03:48:04.420]   And thank you for talking today.
[03:48:04.420 --> 03:48:06.220]   This was fascinating, eye-opening.
[03:48:06.220 --> 03:48:08.260]   I hope to have many more conversations like this.
[03:48:08.260 --> 03:48:10.420]   - Thank you very much, Lex.
[03:48:10.420 --> 03:48:12.100]   - Thank you for listening to this conversation
[03:48:12.100 --> 03:48:13.520]   with Jared Kushner.

[03:48:19.300 --> 03:48:20.500]   from Mahatma Gandhi.
[03:48:20.500 --> 03:48:25.500]   An eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind.
[03:48:26.820 --> 03:48:28.020]   Thank you for listening.
[03:48:28.020 --> 03:48:29.940]   I hope to see you next time.
