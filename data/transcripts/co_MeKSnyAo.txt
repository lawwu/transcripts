[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:00.500]   trying to get these terrorists out of Israel trying to free innocent civilians and

[00:07:31.580 --> 00:08:01.020]   So I'm going to go ahead and get started. I'm going to start with a question from a viewer. This is from a viewer. It says, "I have been told that the Israeli government has been very strict with the Israeli government and the Israeli government has been very strict with the Israeli government, and all of the strong security that Israel has put in place over the last years, which in some instances was criticized, is now being validated that there was a real threat that they were looking to deter. So, the short answer is my heart is broken. Praying for peace, praying for strength, praying for Israel to do what it needs to do to avoid being in this situation again, which is even worse. I'm not sure if that's the right word for it, but I'm not sure if it's the right word for it. But I'm sure it's the right word for it. So, I'm going to go ahead and get started.

So seeing what's happening, I think it was completely avoidable. I think it's horrible to see that it's occurring. And I pray that those in power will make the right decisions to restore safety, but also to potentially create a better paradigm for the future.

And I see, I've watched cries throughout my time in government from people saying we want to see the Palestinian people live a better life. I agree with those people. I think that the Palestinian people in Gaza are essentially hostages. In Gaza, you have basically 2.2 million people that are being held hostage.

[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:50.000]  ¤
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   I think that's a really important thing to understand.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   It's a great business plan.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   It's a great business plan.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   It just shows, too, rebuilding Gaza could be easy.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   It just shows, too, rebuilding Gaza could be easy.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   But like I said, the problem that's held the Palestinian people back and that's made their lives terrible in Gaza has not been Israel.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   It's really been Hamas's leadership or lack of leadership and their desire to focus on trying to kill Israelis and start war with Israel over improving the lives of the Palestinian people.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   The current approach of Hamas, the more violence they perpetrate, the more they are able to do.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   The current approach of Hamas, the more violence they perpetrate, the more they are able to do.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   The current approach of Hamas, the more violence they perpetrate, the more they are able to do.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:29:20.020]   a lot of the time.
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:20.020]   The current approach of Hamas is that they can hold on to power versus improving the lives of people.
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:20.020]   The current approach of Hamas is that they can hold on to power versus improving the lives of people.
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:20.020]   As you said, maybe you can comment on, they do not propose an economics plan.
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:20.020]   The current approach of Hamas is that they can hold on to power versus improving the lives of people.
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:20.020]   Our posture with them was basically a very simple deal.
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:20.020]   If you think about what's the end state in Gaza, it's actually not that complicated. There's no territorial disputes. The border is the border. There's no religious issues.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:50.040]   If you think about what's the end state in Gaza, it's actually not that complicated. There's no territorial disputes.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:50.040]   You're not dealing with Jerusalem.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:50.040]   You're basically just dealing with the fact that Israel wants to make sure that there's no threat from Gaza.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:50.040]   You're not dealing with Jerusalem.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:50.040]   You're basically just dealing with the fact that Israel wants to make sure that there's no threat from Gaza.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:50.040]   It's a demilitarization or some kind of security guarantee from a credible source where Israel doesn't feel like Gaza can be used to stage attacks into Israel or to fire rockets into Israel.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:50.040]   By the way, these are things I was saying three, four years ago, that that was the objective.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:50.040]   That was really the fear.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:50.040]   Now that's been proven, unfortunately,
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:50.040]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful with Hamas, but I'm going to be a little more careful.
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:30:20.060]  , but I'm going to be a little bit more careful with Hamas, but I'm going to be a little bit more careful with Hamas,
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:20.060]   because Hamas is not shown desire for that or capability for that. I don't think there's enough trust to allow them to do that, which is why under the current circumstances, if you do want to have peace there, Hamas has to be either eliminated or severely degraded in terms of their military capabilities. I would love to ask you about leadership, especially on the side of the United States.
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:50.080]   What is the current administration, the Biden administration, done different than the Trump administration, as you understand, that may have contributed to the events we saw this week?
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:50.080]   We left them a place where they had tremendous momentum in the Middle East. I met with them during the transition and said, look, we even got the Qatar-Saudi conflict done, which was a big, no peace, no peace, no peace.

[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:48.360]   and that's why they've been working to disrupt. So I think the administration has, they took an incredibly stable situation with momentum. I think they underestimated the way that Iran would approach the region to undermine. I think they gave way too much rope to Iran and I think that they didn't cease when they had an opportunity of strength with the Palestinians to try to drive to a conclusion that I believe could have prevented a major conflict.

I think it's, it's one of Iran's worst nightmares to have Israel and Saudi interlinked together. I think it'd be great for the Saudi people from a security perspective, what they're discussing with America would be very strong, the ability to, you know, get different elements across would be incredible. So what I
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:38.480]   I think it's, it's a great opportunity for us to be able to have a conversation with the people of Israel and Saudi Arabia.

And then I hope at the right time that those talks will be able to resume and conclude in an appropriate way. And, you know, it's funny, Lex, when I was working on the U.S.-Mexico agreement for the trade, you know, we would have every day there'd be a, you know, a tweet that would go out or there would be an issue. I mean, people forget how, how intense it was between America and Mexico. And I speak to my counterpart in Mexico after a rough day and we're working on something, we're making progress.

[00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:33.940]   - Bibi is definitely a historic figure. I meet with a lot of different world leaders, and some of them, I would say, they're very, very special transformational figures, and some, I would say, "How the hell is this person running a country?" And Bibi is somebody who has done a lot for the state of Israel. He has a tremendous understanding of the security apparatus. He has tremendous global relations. So for a crisis like this, I think Bibi is the leader you should be looking for.

[00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:26.860]  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- and I do think that it'd be very wise for our leaders to find the areas where we do agree and find ways to secure our southern border, to make sure that we know who's in our country, what risks we all face. And I do think that division definitely creates risk for countries. Let me switch gears here and just zoom out and look at our society and our public discourse.
[00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:55.780]   What do you make of the scale and nature of the Palestinian support online in response to this situation?
[00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:56.380]   This is something I've observed over the years since I got involved with the Israeli-Palestinian issue with a lot of interest. I think a lot of the people who are pledging support for the Palestinian people. I think that they want to see the Palestinian people live a better life.
[00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:56.880]   I think that they want to see the Palestinian people live a better life.

[00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:58.980]   And I actually agree with them in that regard.
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:05.260]   Unfortunately, I think many of them are incredibly ill-informed as to the facts on the ground.
[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:26.640]   I think all of the people who are advocating online for the Palestinian people, who are going to these marches in support of them, I think they'd be best served if they really care about effectuating the outcome of joining with Israel right now and directing their anger towards the Hamas leadership.
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:26.900]   I think that they'd be best served if they really care about effectuating the outcome of joining with Israel right now and directing their anger towards the Hamas leadership.

[01:28:58.540 --> 01:29:05.540]   What I found was is you had incredibly committed, passionate, intelligent, capable people all throughout the government.
[01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:11.540]   And what they were waiting for, though, was direction and then cover in order to get there.
[01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:24.760]   And so there were a lot of tasks that I worked on, whether it was, you know, building the wall at the southern border where I was able to work with, you know, Customs Border Patrol, you know, Army Corps of Engineers, military, DHS professionals,
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:54.020]   and we basically all came together.
[01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:54.020]   And then once we had a good project management plan, we were able to kind of move very, very quickly. I think we built about 470 miles of border barrier in about two years, basically. And that was very, that worked very well because we basically brought private sector project management skill sets, which were quite often missing in government. The second one is just, you know, we spoke about negotiation earlier. I would say that most people in government did not have that kind of a problem.
[01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:54.020]   We were able to get a lot of people to come and work with us.

MBN is the guy who's been our partner for all these years.
[02:22:39.980 --> 02:22:39.980]   I said well if he's been a great partner then why do we have all these problems that you guys are complaining about with Saudi? I said I've been told that we have this proposal from MBS as the Deputy Crown Prince and that's who we should be dealing with on this and so phone call starts and President Trump listened to both of us and on the phone call with King Salman President Trump says okay we'll go through all these things these are the things we want to get done and he says well who should we deal with and King Salman says deal with my

[02:24:41.260 --> 02:24:46.460]   Just because things in the past haven't gotten the way you want them to, that doesn't mean they can't go that way in the future.
[02:24:46.460 --> 02:24:48.160]   So we fought the battle.
[02:24:48.160 --> 02:24:51.060]   You know, they basically deferred and, and let me go through with it.
[02:24:51.060 --> 02:24:56.260]   But when I do the planning meetings for the trip, nobody would show up because they all thought it was going to be an absolute disaster.
[02:24:56.260 --> 02:25:01.860]   And by the way, they probably weren't wrong to think that because I'd never planned a foreign trip before, and I'd never done any foreign policy before.
[02:25:01.860 --> 02:25:05.260]   So during the planning, I'd speak to MBS almost every day.
[02:25:05.260 --> 02:25:06.020]   And I'd go through all the different details and the things that I was going to do.
[02:25:06.020 --> 02:25:06.020]   So during the planning, I'd speak to MBS almost every day.

[02:25:35.060 --> 02:25:36.060]   And I said, look, I really need to get these things in writing.
[02:25:36.080 --> 02:25:42.640]   But the answer is, is really the people I was talking to on the other end were telling me that these things were possible.
[02:25:42.640 --> 02:25:49.040]   And so just because they hadn't been done before, and just because others around me didn't believe that they could be done.
[02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:51.720]   I wasn't willing to just say, well, let's not try.
[02:25:51.720 --> 02:25:57.260]   It just seems like that cynicism that takes over is paralyzing.
[02:25:57.260 --> 02:26:04.960]   And you sent me a great essay from, from Paul Graham, I'm a big fan of, that I think explains a lot of your success.

And then I put a tank for every time there was a war. There was always skirmishes between Hamas and Hezbollah and the Palestinians. And then I showed two lines. And they both went from the bottom of the page all the way up like this. One of the lines was Israeli settlements. So every time a negotiation failed, Israel was able to get more land. And

[02:45:09.020 --> 02:45:10.400]   I think it's important to think about what you can do to make it work today. We spent months and months drawing a map and we put something out. Probably change a couple lines here and there but by and large it was a very pragmatic solution that I think could work. And I think it could work for the safety and security of Israel which was number one. So first issue is drawing a map. Second issue is security.

And the debt to GDP that the Palestinians had was like 30, 40% compared to Egypt, which is at like 130%. And Jordan, which is at 110%. And Lebanon was at 200%. And so, you know, you're in a situation where a lot of this stuff didn't make sense. But if you draw lines, create institutions where Palestinian people can now feel like they have property rights and have ownership over their place and let the money flow, then you're going to be able to get a lot of the money.

[02:49:03.640 --> 02:49:07.460]   It's always just we give the money and there's no expectations.
[02:49:07.460 --> 02:49:18.460]   It's very simple. You make the aid conditions-based, you fight for transparency, you do it through institutions other than the PA, or you put reformers into the PA that will allow it to go down that way.
[02:49:18.460 --> 02:49:20.460]   PA being the Palestinian Authority.
[02:49:20.460 --> 02:49:24.660]   Yeah, it's not hard to do it just takes people who actually want to do it.
[02:49:24.660 --> 02:49:29.560]   But I think that the mindset of the international community has not been let's solve this problem.
[02:49:29.560 --> 02:49:31.360]   It's like, let's just throw a little bit of money.
[02:49:31.360 --> 02:49:32.600]   The money is Novacaine.
[02:49:32.600 --> 02:49:32.600]   Let's put a little Novacaine on the front.
[02:49:32.600 --> 02:49:32.600]   It's like, let's just throw a little bit of money.
[02:49:32.600 --> 02:49:32.600]   The money's Novacaine.
[02:49:32.600 --> 02:49:32.600]   Let's put a little Novacaine on the front.
[02:49:32.600 --> 02:49:32.600]   It's like, let's just throw a little bit of money.
[02:49:32.600 --> 02:50:01.580]  , and let's not have to deal with it.
[02:50:01.580 --> 02:50:01.600]   But nobody's ever said, oh, let's do an accounting of the $20 billion we've given them and see how many jobs it's done and where it's gone.
[02:50:01.600 --> 02:50:01.640]   That just hasn't happened.
[02:50:01.640 --> 02:50:01.740]   Again, it's an incredibly corrupt organization.
[02:50:01.740 --> 02:50:01.800]   Unruh, you think about the post-World War II dynamic.
[02:50:01.800 --> 02:50:01.800]   You had a lot of refugees. My grandparents were refugees post-World War II.
[02:50:01.800 --> 02:50:01.880]   Every other refugee class has been resettled and you only have one permanent refugee organization ever created.
[02:50:01.900 --> 02:50:13.020]   I think that's a really good point.
[02:50:13.020 --> 02:50:18.940]   I do think having a deal where we can say, how do the Jews and the Muslims, Christians come together?
[02:50:18.940 --> 02:50:22.740]   I think King Abdullah from Jordan's been an incredible custodian for the mosque.
[02:50:22.740 --> 02:50:29.720]   I think everyone in my travels recognize that he's the right guy for that, that the King of Jordan should be the custodian of the mosque.
[02:50:29.720 --> 02:50:30.860]   We should have some kind of framework.
[02:50:30.860 --> 02:50:30.860]   I think everyone in my travels recognize that he's the right guy for that, that the King of Jordan should be the custodian of the mosque.
[02:50:30.860 --> 02:50:30.860]   We should have some kind of framework.
[02:50:30.860 --> 02:50:30.860]   We should have some kind of framework.
[02:50:30.860 --> 02:50:30.860]   We should have some kind of framework.
[02:50:30.860 --> 02:50:30.860]   We should have some kind of framework.
[02:50:30.860 --> 02:50:30.860]   We should have some kind of framework.
[02:50:30.860 --> 02:50:31.000]   We should have some kind of framework.
[02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:31.240]   We should have some kind of framework.
[02:50:31.240 --> 02:50:31.280]   We should have some kind of framework.
[02:50:31.280 --> 02:51:00.680]   to make sure everyone has access.
[02:51:00.680 --> 02:51:00.720]   to make sure everyone has access.
[02:51:00.720 --> 02:51:00.720]   The more countries that have diplomatic relations with Israel, the more Muslims and Arabs that should be able to come and visit.
[02:51:00.720 --> 02:51:01.300]   The more countries that have diplomatic relations with Israel, the more Muslims and Arabs that should be able to come and visit. And by the way, the more you have these normalizations, think about what that will do to the economy of the West Bank where they'll have great hotels, hospitality, tremendous tourism industry because of all the Christian Muslim and Jewish holy sites that they have there. So there's a lot of potential there. We just have to get unstucked. I believe that it's so possible.
[02:51:01.320 --> 02:51:31.320]   It's so possible.
[02:51:31.320 --> 02:51:31.320]   If the leaders want to make tomorrow better that they can. And unfortunately, the people who suffer the most are really, are just the Palestinian people. And I think that, you know, in Gaza, they're hostages to Hamas and in the West Bank, they're just held back because their leadership just is afraid or too self-interested to give them the opportunity to change their paradigm and pursue the potential of their own country.
[02:51:31.320 --> 02:51:31.320]   The second thing is that we have to get unstucked.

[02:54:01.440 --> 02:54:31.440]   I was kind of at the middle of it,
[02:54:31.440 --> 02:54:31.440]   I was kind of at the middle of it,
[02:54:31.440 --> 02:54:31.440]   I was kind of at the middle of it,
[02:54:31.440 --> 02:54:31.440]   I couldn't even perfectly articulate why it happened,
[02:54:31.440 --> 02:54:31.440]   I couldn't even perfectly articulate why it happened,
[02:54:31.440 --> 02:54:31.440]   because it was an evolution of a lot of things.
[02:54:31.440 --> 02:54:31.440]   Because it was an evolution of a lot of things. And I joke that we made peace on Plan C,
[02:54:31.440 --> 02:54:31.440]   But only because we went through the alphabet three times, failing at every letter.
[02:54:31.440 --> 02:54:31.440]   And by the time that we didn't give up, we kept going and we got it done.
[02:54:31.440 --> 02:54:31.440]   Maybe this is a good place to also step back and say,
[02:54:31.440 --> 02:54:31.440]   What is Arab-Israeli normalization?
[02:54:31.440 --> 02:54:31.440]   Sure.
[02:54:31.440 --> 02:54:31.440]   What is the state of things for people who may not be aware
[02:54:31.440 --> 02:54:31.440]   Sure.
[02:54:31.440 --> 02:54:31.440]   What is the state of things for people who may not be aware
[02:54:31.440 --> 02:55:01.460]   a lot of things for people who may not be aware of?
[02:55:01.460 --> 02:55:01.460]   So what we did is we made a peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, and then Israel and Bahrain. Then we did a deal with Israel and Sudan, then Israel and Kosovo, Israel and Morocco, where basically countries that didn't recognize each other before ended up recognizing each other. All these were Muslim majority countries, and getting them to integrate with Israel was a very big thing. The traditional thinking had always been,

[02:55:01.480 --> 02:55:31.480]   Arab countries would not make peace with Israel until the Israeli-Palestinian issue was solved. And what we were able to do was separate the issues and then make these connections, which are leading to amazing interaction between Jews and Muslims. So when I think about kind of, obviously you have national security, you have emotional benefits from these things, but the single biggest benefit that I've seen from the accords is that if you were
[02:55:31.480 --> 02:55:31.480]   the United Arab Emirates,
[02:55:31.480 --> 02:55:31.480]   You're going to be able to do a lot of things.

[03:01:56.060 --> 03:01:59.940]   I think war and fighting is less likely.
[03:01:59.940 --> 03:02:03.460]   And then in addition to that, I wanted to figure out how do you bring

[03:02:06.340 --> 03:02:09.740]   So that was really the mission of what I set out to do so far.

[03:02:11.420 --> 03:02:12.860]   I've been learning a ton.

[03:32:02.900 --> 03:32:02.900]   The Real Question is if they actually did achieve this full objective of becoming the world dominant country what they would have done with it whether they would have been nefarious or not I think from my perspective even with some of the divisions and issues we have now in America I still would rather an American led world order than Chinese led world order but the notion was is that they were playing a very zero sum game and really going to be the dominant leader in this new world order so so that's a good question.
[03:32:02.900 --> 03:32:02.900]   So I think that's a good question.

[03:35:31.020 --> 03:35:36.860]   And, you know, it's funny, the thing I got made fun of the most for that was the wardrobe.
[03:35:36.860 --> 03:35:41.820]   And that came from after three months in the administration, we were having dinner with all
[03:35:41.820 --> 03:35:45.340]   the generals and they were saying, you know, updating us on the war with ISIS.
[03:35:45.340 --> 03:35:49.900]   And General Dunford said to me after, "Look, the president can't come to see how we're fighting this
[03:35:49.900 --> 03:35:54.080]   war, but I'd like to invite you to come with me to Iraq and come see. And
[03:35:54.080 --> 03:36:23.900]  , you know, I'm going to be there. And I said, "Would you come with me?" I said, "No, that's great. I always
[03:36:24.820 --> 03:36:53.380]  , you know, he's a great, great general. He's very, very well respected in the military. And we go in and we get on Blackhawk helicopter." I said, "You know, today's a nice day. Let's take the sides off." And so I get on the plane and there's a guy, you know, military service officer, who then takes a machine gun, locks it into a thing, takes the bullets, puts them into the gun, and is sitting there saying, "We're ready to go." And then I'm looking out and there's like three other helicopters with guys. One was an Osprey with a guy.

So anyway so that was the funny story behind that and then actually my brother was at some society event in New York and he ran into Jimmy Fallon so the two of them took a selfie together and Josh writes me says hanging out with my older brother in New York you know I'm trying to explain to him what your voice sounds like so so it was a great experience.

I then travelled the country. I met so many people who I never would have met otherwise on the conservative side on the independent side on so many different issues. I think that people benefit if you have such a strong point of view. I would follow the John Stuart Mill marketplace.
