[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   All right, Jesse, let's try some new technology.
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:08.420]   I want to do a CalReacts to the News segment.
[00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.620]   We actually have the article right here on screen.
[00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.820]   So for those of you who are watching this segment at youtube.com/calnewportmedia, you
[00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.380]   will be able to actually see what I'm doing.
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.220]   You'll also be able to see all the sparks and smoke when this goes terribly awry.
[00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.780]   All right, so here's the article.
[00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:32.340]   This was sent to me by a listener by Elizabeth Klein.
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:40.920]   It's from February of 2021, and it is titled A Catholic Response to Workism, Colon, How
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.860]   to Lose at Life.
[00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.900]   So this is a Catholic response to issues about work and overwork.
[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.260]   Because I wrote so much about this topic, especially in my New Yorker column last fall,
[00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.660]   I found it interesting.
[00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.460]   I'm not going to go through this whole article, but I'm going to point out a few points that
[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.300]   are made up front and then I'll give you my reactions to them.
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.180]   But let's start here in the beginning with a couple.
[00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.260]   A couple key notes are being made by the author.
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:16.900]   So the author says for everyone, for the vast majority of humans, life is not very glamorous,
[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.300]   involves doing a lot of boring and tedious things like paying taxes or cooking dinner
[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.180]   or sweeping the floor.
[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:31.260]   But she points out that these everyday tasks seem in particular to vex millennials.
[00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.860]   This generation, she goes on to say, has suffered from widespread ridicule for laziness and
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.820]   the inability to grow up.
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.220]   But somewhat paradoxically, millennials also seem exhausted.
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.660]   All right, so this is a common thing we hear, but I want to point it out as part of the
[00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.480]   setup for this article.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:01.260]   She goes on to say, when talking about us millennials problems is that we are already
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.700]   I'm learning this technology pretty quickly.
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.140]   Or for those who are just listening, you're seeing me highlight things left and right
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.340]   that I don't mean to highlight because I learned a technology.
[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.180]   Elizabeth also says millennials are frustrated at being unable to obtain the same level of
[00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.060]   material wealth enjoyed by their parents.
[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.740]   All right, so that's the setup.
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.300]   The article isn't going to go into saying why this is or what's wrong with millennials,
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.300]   but that is the setup.
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.060]   So let me just start with this before we get into the why.
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.500]   I will say in general, I have heard this a lot.
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.620]   I'm not super convinced.
[00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.380]   The issue here is I say almost everything being said here, I'm sure it could be said
[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.380]   about just about every generation.
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.420]   A lot of these claims are just made.
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.620]   Are millennials unusually exhausted?
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.540]   Are we unusually vexed by having to do small tasks like more so than other people in our
[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.540]   age?
[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.020]   I don't know that that's true.
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.540]   I know it's widely said.
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.300]   I don't know that that's true.
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.100]   What about this idea, which I hear all the time, that we're frustrated that our parents
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.100]   have more money and houses than we do?
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.400]   Again, I'm not super impressed by that claim.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.260]   What is the biggest predictor of how much money or wealth you're going to have?
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.500]   Well, one of the biggest predictors is how old are you?
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.100]   How long have you had to actually make money?
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.940]   How long have you had to actually trade up your house three or four times?
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.060]   How long have you had to be putting money into your retirement account?
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.740]   So I don't think it's some unusual thing that 70 year old baby boomers have nicer houses
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.180]   and more money than their 30 year old kids.
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.940]   And I'm sure that's true of every generation that, oh, my parents, we've been around a
[00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.260]   lot longer, have more stuff than I have than when I'm younger.
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.580]   So I just want to lay out that foundation that I'm not acceding the ground that is made
[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.900]   the beginning of this article, not acceding the ground to this argument that, of course,
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.060]   us millennials are all vexed and overwhelmed and upset at our parents and worried about
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.220]   our prospects.
[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.460]   I'm not sure that exactly matches a lot of my day to day interactions, but, you know,
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.460]   that could be true.
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.580]   It could be true for other people.
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.780]   But let me just start with that.
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:00.780]   All right.
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.460]   So why is this the case?
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.780]   There's a couple options given here.
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.220]   There's three points in particular that I want to point out.
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.220]   All right.
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:15.380]   So first, this article talks about Anne Helen Peterson's viral Buzzfeed article, How Millennials
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.260]   Became the Burnout Generation.
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.740]   She went on to publish a book about this as well.
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.700]   The book was called Can't Even.
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.900]   So this was an article that did a lot for promoting this idea that millennials have
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.300]   a hard time doing small tasks.
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.260]   Here is Helen's argument or Anne's argument rather.
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.260]   All right.
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.540]   So she puts forward the idea that millennials basically work all the time and that they
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.540]   are non-working.
[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.660]   They are busy trying to excel in other ways.
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.100]   So she goes on to say, drinking enough water, going to the gym or running a marathon, eating
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.780]   at trendy restaurants and then sharing all these experiences on social media for the
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.260]   perfect Instagram life.
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.020]   So I'll label this number one.
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.020]   This is point number one.
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.540]   We'll come back to that.
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.380]   All right.
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.220]   The argument is pointed out here about what's going on with millennials actually comes from
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.080]   the Ezra Klein show.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.100]   So there was a interview Ezra did with Anne Helen Peterson, but also with Derek Thompson,
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.580]   who wrote an article about workism for the Atlantic.
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.220]   And it reiterated some of these big ideas.
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:29.940]   But what was interesting is, according to this author, this conversation took a surprising
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.540]   turn.
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.540]   So here we go.
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.660]   Near the end of the podcast, the discussion takes a surprising turn.
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.420]   And that turn is towards religion.
[00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.540]   All right.
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.980]   So that takes a surprising turn towards religion.
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:53.780]   Derek Thompson goes on in that interview to talk about, and I'm going to highlight this,
[00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.780]   but he goes on to comment.
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.980]   This was unprompted by Ezra.
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.580]   When you are religious, you do not require the social feedback loop.
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.020]   You do not need a public performance of your life to make it valuable.
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.020]   All right.
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.820]   So let's make this our second point.
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.220]   It's interesting about trying to explain what's going on with millennials, this notion that
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.940]   maybe it is religion that is missing.
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.740]   Millennials that are religious have an outlet.
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:27.340]   This drive towards wanting to live a good life, they now have an outlet for that.
[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:35.020]   And they don't have to try to simulate it with performative action online, etc.
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.960]   There's one final point given in this article.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.500]   This comes from the author herself.
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.140]   And this is the focus on capitalism.
[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.120]   So we usually get back here.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:56.580]   She says, "As capitalism has become the religion of most Americans, so the measures of the
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:02.940]   worth in our lives has become our product."
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:08.020]   So capitalism is the focus here.
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:12.780]   She goes on to elaborate, "My life has become a brand.
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.820]   This is why millennials can both seem to be obsessed with work and not yet value hard
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:17.900]   work at all."
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.020]   So there's this notion of there's a capitalist impulse.
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.500]   We'll make this point number three.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.180]   There's a capitalist impulse that gets us to constantly want to somehow support our
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.500]   brand.
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.900]   And so we're not going to tolerate efforts that don't directly do that.
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:32.900]   And we have a hard time.
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.060]   All right, so we have three arguments here.
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:39.540]   We have three arguments for why supposedly millennials are exhausted and having a hard
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.420]   time doing even simple tasks.
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:48.320]   Number one is Anne Helen Peterson's argument that we're always trying to optimize performatively.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.800]   Number two is Derek Thompson's argument that we don't have religion.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.880]   We're trying to fill that hole.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.160]   We're not doing a very good job of it.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.720]   And number three is it's a capitalist impulse.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.520]   Okay, so what do I think about this?
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:07.760]   I think of these three options, the person who is probably most on to something is Derek
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.140]   Thompson.
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.860]   Point number two.
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.400]   So let me work through point one and three first.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.000]   I'll say why I have some concern about it.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.840]   My issue with Anne's argument that it's all about Instagram performance is that I believe
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.720]   that's a much that exists, but it's a much more narrow tranche of all of the millennials
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.600]   in this country that it might actually seem if you're someone who is, quote unquote, very
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.600]   online.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.940]   So, yes, there is this hustle culture on Instagram, which honestly, I didn't even really know
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.480]   about it till enough reporters asked me about it.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:43.560]   So there is a subset of Instagram users that are all about posting these inspirational
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.760]   quotes, these get after it style quotes, these bragging about how much they're working style
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.760]   quotes.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.600]   There's also a echo of the subculture on YouTube.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.440]   In the student space, for example, there's these YouTube videos of people who will study
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.720]   on camera, usually time lapse for eight, nine hours in a row.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:08.000]   So there is there is a sort of performative a celebration of hustle that does happen online.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.400]   But I think it's actually a pretty narrow audience.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:17.000]   Most millennials, especially as they get older, you know, millennials are now in their 30s,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.800]   millennials in their upper 20s.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.760]   I don't know that so many of them are so plugged into their social media presences as the main
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.760]   driving thing.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.080]   I think as they get older, there's other things going on in their lives.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.960]   They're getting married, they're having kids, the more important stuff is happening in their
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.960]   jobs.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:35.040]   And so I've never been as big of a believer that we can extrapolate the most eye catching
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:40.200]   things we see on Instagram to YouTube to an entire generation.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.720]   It just doesn't pass the test of matching all of the people I know who are millennials.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.480]   You would think if something is a very widespread trend, you would see it popping up at least
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.800]   at a relatively high background rate.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.800]   So I think that might be a little bit exaggerated.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:00.440]   Honestly, most millennials I know of a certain age are mainly just exhausted with social
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.440]   media.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.560]   Now, again, we might be mixing up generations.
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.960]   We have to be careful about that.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.100]   People still use the term millennial to mean everyone who's young.
[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.620]   That's no longer the case.
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.040]   I'm one of the older millennials born in 1982.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.800]   So I'm 40.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.840]   The youngest millennials that were in their upper 20s now.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.120]   So I mean, sometimes when people say millennials, they're actually talking about Gen Z years
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.160]   or talking about people who are in their young 20s or teen years.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.760]   Now, that's a whole other generation.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:32.920]   This is the generation that grew up with a native use of smartphones and social media.
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.400]   That's a whole different thing.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.040]   But millennials, honestly, I think there's also a strong thread of, you know, they're
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.800]   on some social media, but it's not a major player in their life.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.400]   All right, let's jump ahead to number three, the capitalism critique.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.800]   There's a lot of this going on right now.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:54.760]   It's like our entire cultural conversation is, you know, hanging out on campus when the
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:59.640]   freshmen are going home, like everyone is taking their first sort of Marxist influence,
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.200]   whatever critical course.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.000]   And now we're confidently explaining to their parents how it's all bourgeois capitalist
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   influence.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   There's a lot of this going on right now.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.560]   It's sort of Marxist critiques.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.560]   Here's the thing.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:16.440]   There's not like there's something new going on with capitalism, I would say, generationally.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:21.960]   So if capitalism was driving you to these issues, it's not that there's some big change
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:26.880]   necessarily that happened in capitalism, let's say, during the last 10 years that wasn't
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.600]   there 10 years before that or 20 years before that.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.440]   So there obviously are issues with capitalism, but I don't think it's the right explanation
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:40.920]   for what's different about this generation versus other generations that came before.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.760]   It is Derek who I think is on to something.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:47.000]   I think the gap here, the issue here is a meaning gap.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.920]   I think this is an issue with millennials.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.660]   It's an issue with every generation.
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:55.480]   How do you structure a good and meaningful life?
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:00.040]   I think most people are willing for a good and meaningful life to have hardships, to
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:04.060]   require effort, to require toil, to have ups and downs.
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:09.240]   People crave meaning much more strongly than almost anything else.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.900]   And there can be an absence of that.
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:14.960]   And in the absence of that, I do think people flounder.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.240]   I think when you flounder, lots of effects can happen.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.480]   Lots of effects can happen.
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.320]   So yes, you can get burnout on doing seeming trivial tasks.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.240]   Back in my student advice days, we used to call this deep procrastination.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:32.360]   If you get sufficiently mismatched between intrinsic motivation and the efforts you actually
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.640]   have to do, you can shut down your motivational centers and have a hard time doing even basic
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.640]   things.
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.000]   It's similar to depressive syndrome, but not quite the same.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.160]   There's probably a lot of that going on.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.600]   Clearly, I think there is exhaustion issues with work.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.600]   Where does that come from?
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.680]   Well, as I've argued, I think in the modern age of digital knowledge work, we get more
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.480]   and more ad hoc frequent communication, all the context switching as job roles get more
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.480]   ambiguous.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.480]   It's fundamentally exhausting.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:02.200]   So yeah, I think that really is an issue that's going on as well.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.840]   I think people are hungry.
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:10.680]   We see strong embraces of all sorts of theoretical frameworks.
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:17.120]   For an academic, for example, to see something as obscure and complex as postmodern influence
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.000]   critical theories, which is in academic circles, is like a very narrow thing.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.840]   It's not like most professors in the humanities are coming at their work from a perspective
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.600]   of a postmodern influence critical theories, but they have a huge impact right now in our
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:35.880]   culture at large that you have huge swaths of my generation that is quoting like relatively
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:41.360]   subtle, but 15 years ago would have been something you only would have heard in a pretty high
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.840]   level graduate seminar, pretty subtle theoretical frameworks.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:49.840]   I think it's because it's attached to social justice that seems meaningful.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.320]   We're looking for meaning.
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.320]   We see that.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.520]   We see it in a completely different context with the rise of conspiratorial thinking,
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.000]   the QAnon, et cetera.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.800]   Look, say what you will about QAnon, but you can't say you don't feel like your life has
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:08.200]   meaning when you are stopping pedophile rings that live in secret subterranean tunnels beneath
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.160]   the city.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.480]   You got something that you're locked into.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.960]   So I think Thompson is on to something that the meaning gap is probably what's important
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.680]   for millennials.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:24.240]   What millennials need and what Gen Z needs is some sort of coherent story about how to
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.720]   build a meaningful life in the face of inevitable suffering and hardship.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.520]   I think that is where the huge hunger is.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.520]   I see it in the Gen Z college students I teach.
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.960]   I see it in my millennial peers.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:38.240]   I see it in the generations in between.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.000]   This is what I believe people need.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.560]   I believe this is probably what the issue is.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.920]   I think we see that hunger out there.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.840]   I think it's what needs to be addressed.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:55.200]   Now I don't know if the answer is, you know, this particular article comes from a Catholic
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.560]   perspective and so it might say Catholicism.
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.920]   I don't think there's a specific answer like you need a religion to do this or this or
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:01.920]   that.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.480]   But I think that meaning gap, I think that's a big thing that's going on here.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.040]   Universities aren't addressing it.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.760]   The baby boomer generations aren't passing down this to their kids very well.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:15.200]   They got too distracted with just having a family and living life and trying to figure
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.440]   out life in their generation.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.000]   Everyone has their own things going on.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.480]   And but that hunger, I think that hunger is out there and there should be more people
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.280]   discussing concrete answers to that hunger.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.260]   Not one, there could be many, but people should be thinking, how am I structuring my life?
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:36.500]   How do I want to structure a deep existence in a world of both shallowness and hardship?
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.840]   So I think that's what's important.
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:43.080]   And the reason why I emphasize that is that otherwise, if we look at some of these other
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.960]   things being said here, which again, have some foundation in truth, I don't want to
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.080]   completely dismiss it.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.280]   It's easy just to see this through the point of view of like, look, there's nothing these
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.280]   kids can do.
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.000]   There's these other influences that are bad.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.720]   So you guys sit tight and we'll go write polemics and try to change the circumstances that are
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.160]   making your life hard.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.880]   That can be really disempowering.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.840]   And I think that's a thread that goes through a lot of this.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.280]   It's sort of, what can we even do?
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:15.880]   You know, it's just culture and capitalism and the way our exploitative bosses are trying
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.840]   to take advantage of us.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:21.520]   And so we need to leave it to like polemical writers to try to change the society and change
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.520]   the culture.
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:28.320]   And in the meantime, we should just, you know, go easy on ourselves, get back on Instagram.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.800]   I don't think that's what's going to help people.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.160]   We need people to come in and demonstrate in their life.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.560]   Here's my structure for a life of meaning amidst inevitable hardship, mental difficulty.
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:43.120]   You see these exemplars out there challenge people to stand up and introduce some structure
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:48.680]   into their life, to introduce some pursuit beyond the arbitrary or in the moment.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.520]   There is such a hunger for that.
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:56.320]   Anyways, I'm rambling, but that is where, that's where I land on that.
