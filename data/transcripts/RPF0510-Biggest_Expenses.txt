[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.580]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.320]   building a plan for financial freedom in ten years or less.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.880]   Today on the show we continue our theme of an analysis of expenses.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.680]   As we release this show in January, it's a convenient time to do an analysis of the
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.800]   2017 financial data that I hope you've accumulated over the past year.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.360]   And I want to focus on how expenses will relate to your plan for financial freedom.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.760]   On yesterday's show I talked about the value of grossing up expenses, things that are monthly,
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.680]   for example, looking at them in terms of their annual cost.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.420]   In previous episodes of Radical Personal Finance I've talked about the value of converting
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.800]   annual costs to decade costs and considering them in different frames of mind.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.960]   I also talked about the value of cutting those costs down and looking at them on a daily
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.720]   basis so you are clear on what your daily expenses are.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.480]   This can be very illuminating, either in a positive direction or a negative direction.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.760]   Sometimes you look at your expenses and you're very satisfied with them that, "Hey, wow,
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.760]   I'm able to live on that small amount a day," or "I only spend this small amount per day
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.760]   on this category.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.800]   That's great."
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.300]   Sometimes it goes the other way and it's a little bit sobering to recognize, "I spend
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.680]   how much per day?"
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.400]   Both of those can be valuable and give you insight.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.360]   But the next method of analysis that I want to encourage you to do is to order your expenses
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.500]   from most expensive to least expensive and look at them very carefully.
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.360]   When we come to financial savings, when we come to the area of spending less money, there
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.520]   are various ways that you can approach this.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.400]   And I think that different ways have different merit in different situations.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.760]   I'm sure you're shocked by a statement like that.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.000]   That's a very inclusive statement, but it really is true.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   There are times at which learning how to cut back in a specific category, perhaps let's
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.680]   talk about the well-known latte factor, cutting back on your favorite cup of coffee has a
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.560]   measurable impact on your wealth.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.240]   That can be very valuable.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.480]   Some people are quick to dismiss that and say, "Well, why would I put myself through
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.960]   the ringer and cut out my favorite cup of coffee?
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.960]   That just seems really bad.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.280]   I'll just focus on the big stuff."
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.580]   Well, there's a measure of truth to that.
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.220]   But for many of us, cutting back on a daily latte, a daily four or five dollar coffee
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.140]   habit can have a tremendous impact on our net worth and on our savings.
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:52.560]   If you calculate what you would need in terms of your overall wealth in order to fund a
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.840]   five dollar a day coffee habit, it's a huge number.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.360]   Let's assume that you buy a five dollar coffee and something to go with it each day, five
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.640]   days a week over the course of a year.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.960]   If you do that over time, you would need to accumulate about $25,000 in an investment
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.880]   portfolio in order for you to support that habit in financial independence.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.400]   So it's not insubstantial.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.000]   It's a substantial number.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.540]   But is that really the best place to start?
[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.120]   It might be for some people.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.340]   Sometimes focusing on one small area of expenditure and making a change can be the catalyst to
[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.160]   moving in a different direction, to changing your mindset and recognizing the value of
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.060]   thrift and frugality.
[00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.240]   But I don't necessarily recommend that you start with that.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.240]   I think it's best to always start with the big picture changes.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.160]   In any area of analysis, we always want to keep firmly in mind the value of the 80/20
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.240]   principle or the Pareto principle, whichever term you prefer.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.800]   The idea is there are a small number of things, about 20% of things, that are going to result
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.960]   in a huge number of outcomes or going to impact the most.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.640]   20% of your actions will account for 80% of your results.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.120]   And so one of the methods of improving is to focus in on what are those 20% of your
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.440]   actions that will result in 80% of your results.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.160]   And when things come to it and you have to make a decision, the more you can focus on
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.040]   the most impactful actions, the better your results will be.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.040]   So think about your budget.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:38.960]   What are those 20% of decisions that will have the most impact on your results?
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.220]   Well frankly it's not going to be your Starbucks habit.
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:53.840]   It's going to be the structural costs of your life.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.680]   I want to talk about the difference in expenses and I want to use the example from the world
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.440]   of business accounting.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:09.200]   In business accounting, we generally separate expenses into two categories, fixed costs
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.080]   and variable costs.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.080]   The names are illustrative of what they actually are.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:21.000]   Fixed costs are expenses that are set and that aren't going to change month from accounting
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.580]   period – sorry, aren't going to change much from accounting period to accounting
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.580]   period.
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.520]   On a monthly basis, they're going to be about the same.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.880]   So an example of fixed costs in a business would be something like the rent that you
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:39.680]   pay for your facilities or the salaries that you pay for your workers.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.360]   These are relatively fixed costs, especially if your workers are expected to work a standard
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.280]   work week and their payment is relatively flat.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.280]   These would be fixed costs.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.860]   They're not going to change much, your overhead.
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:59.960]   Variable costs are expenses that will change based upon the value of the output of your
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.240]   business.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.280]   So an example of variable costs would be the cost of raw materials.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:12.760]   If you make widgets in a factory, your bill for the supplies that you're purchasing
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:20.880]   from your suppliers will go up or down based upon the number of widgets that you produce.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.840]   In our analysis, it's important to keep in mind which aspect of the analysis we're
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.060]   looking at.
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.180]   Now if we were to apply that over to personal accounting, in your personal finances, you
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:39.240]   would quickly recognize that something like a Starbucks habit is a variable cost, and
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.440]   that's something that you can move up or move down.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.280]   That's good because it makes it easy to change, but it's probably not the variable
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:57.240]   expenses in your life that are making the biggest difference in your total monthly budgetary
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.240]   expenses.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.240]   It's probably those fixed costs.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.120]   Here's my recommendation to you.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:09.520]   Make a spreadsheet, either on a computer program or write it down on a piece of paper, and
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:16.400]   order the categories of your expenses from the last year in order of their largest to
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.240]   smallest total value.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:27.540]   What was your annual total of one of your biggest categories of expenses?
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.340]   If your budget is like most people's budget, your biggest categories of expenses would
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:40.680]   usually be taxes of various types, housing, transportation.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.160]   Housing of course would be a collection of different expenses that are all related to
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.040]   your house.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.480]   Here's my advice.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:56.360]   If you can get those things structurally right, the little stuff falls into place much more
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:04.000]   simply than if those big expenses are structurally flawed.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.800]   If your mortgage payment is a relatively small number as a component of your budget, the
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.920]   amount of lattes that you buy when you want to go out and have a coffee treat will have
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:22.600]   a very small impact on your wealth.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:28.720]   Focus on how you can get that number structurally right.
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.720]   Now what is right?
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.640]   Well, you'll have to decide that.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.120]   You'll have to look at your area where you live, you'll have to look at your lifestyle,
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.520]   and you'll have to try to figure out what is an appropriate and right way for me to
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.240]   get what I need to get.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.800]   You have to take into account your needs.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.640]   What are the needs of your family?
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.320]   What type of house do you need to live in?
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.480]   What type of house would you like to live in?
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.400]   What's the impact on the rest of your budget?
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.840]   What needs do you have with regard to transportation?
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.840]   What wants do you have with regard to transportation?
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:05.160]   But if you'll just focus in on getting those first few category expenses structurally sound,
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:14.160]   taxes, housing, transportation, perhaps things like insurance, education costs for some people,
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:22.000]   if you'll get those structurally right, the rest of your budget will be relatively simple.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.880]   If you're looking for the single category that will make the biggest difference on your
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.160]   budget, I would bet you.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:42.720]   I would basically guarantee you it's your choice of living arrangements because frankly
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.600]   that drives almost everything else in your budget.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:56.720]   Your choice of where to live and how to live will affect every other area of your budget.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.720]   Doubt me?
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.320]   Let me explain.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:10.680]   Taxes, your choice of where you live will dramatically affect your taxes.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.000]   Property taxes are perhaps the most obvious example.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.280]   If you own a home, you can own a house of the same value, let's just say a $300,000
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:27.040]   house, and in some cities, some states, your annual property expenses on a $300,000 house
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.680]   will be $500 per year.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:38.320]   In some states, your annual property taxes on a $300,000 house will be $10,000 per year.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.120]   Pure expense out of your pocket, driven by your house.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:48.840]   Where you live, your state of domicile will dramatically affect your income taxes, especially
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.560]   with regard to your state income taxes.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:56.500]   Some states that you live in will charge you no personal income taxes.
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:00.160]   Some states will charge you some personal income taxes and some will charge you very
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.160]   high.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:10.640]   That's a level of taxation that you are paying based upon where you live.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:15.840]   The house that you choose to live in will affect the taxes that you pay on personal
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.560]   property.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.960]   Some states have taxes on personal property, some states don't.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.280]   Some states are strict in their enforcement, some states aren't.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.640]   But the impact of the house that you live in goes far beyond that.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:34.280]   The type of neighborhood that you choose to live in will impact the type of house expenses
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.680]   that you have.
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:41.040]   If you live in a neighborhood where a backyard pool is normal and expected, that's going
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.920]   to add an additional expense to your budget.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.980]   You're going to pay more for the house.
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.200]   You're going to pay more for the care and maintenance of the pool.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.120]   You're going to pay more to hire the pool guy to do it for you or to go and buy the
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.120]   chemicals.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.120]   That will impact your cost.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.320]   It goes far beyond that though.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.920]   The type of neighborhood that you live in will impact the type of landscaping that you
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.040]   have.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:12.000]   What's acceptable, what's necessary, how much money should be spent on landscaping
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.040]   and improvement of your home.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.080]   The type of neighborhood that you live in will affect the type of car that you drive.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:24.000]   Generally, neighbors drive cars that look about like each other's cars.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.800]   And so if you move into a fancy, posh neighborhood, you're going to feel some pressure to drive
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:35.600]   a fancy and posh designer car.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:39.480]   Make that choice intentionally as is right for you, but you're going to feel the pressure.
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:46.080]   The type of neighborhood that you live in will impact your children's educational expenses.
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:52.680]   Some neighborhoods that you live in will have most of the children attending a private school
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:57.280]   and you may be putting yourself in a situation where you're stroking a check for private
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.880]   tuition.
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.920]   The type of neighborhood that you live in will impact the type of lifestyle that your
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.360]   children consider to be normal.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.000]   The types of clothes that their friends wear will impact the types of clothes that they
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.440]   want to wear and the pressure that they bring to bear on your budget for that.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:19.040]   The types of clothes that – sorry, the types of toys that your friends have, your neighbors
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:26.800]   have, will impact the types of toys that your children will want to have.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.480]   What about insurance, one of the biggest impacts on people's budgets?
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.920]   Well, of course, the type of house that you live in and the type will be driven by the
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.200]   – will drive the cost of insurance.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:42.840]   You can have the same four-bedroom, two or three-bath house and the insurance rates are
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:49.640]   very high in one place because a four-bedroom, three-bath house sells for $600,000 or $800,000
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:55.360]   versus the same exact house plopped on a different piece of property could only be worth $100,000
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.360]   in the local market.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.000]   That will affect your property insurance.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.960]   Your property insurance will be driven by simple things like how close you are to the
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.080]   ocean.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.760]   Where I live in southern Florida, it's a matter of which side of I-95 do you live on.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:08.760]   There's a line.
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:13.640]   If you live on the east side of I-95, there's a marked increase in property insurance rates
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:20.840]   because of a higher likelihood of windstorm damage because of the proximity to the ocean
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.920]   versus on the west side of I-95.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.760]   The elevation at which you live will make a difference.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.760]   Lower in a floodplain, now you're going to pay more.
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.720]   You're going to have a greater need for flood insurance.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.320]   You're going to pay for that.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.960]   Those rates will be reflected in your homeowner's insurance.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.680]   The house where you park your car every night will dramatically affect the cost of your
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.960]   car insurance.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:48.000]   In Miami-Dade County, it's my understanding that the cost of car insurance is almost double
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.560]   what it is in Palm Beach County where I live.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:59.480]   Palm Beach County is more expensive than north of me, farther up, farther into the state.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:04.440]   Where you choose to park your car every night will have a dramatic impact on your property
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.640]   insurance rates.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:12.760]   By the way, those rates are driven partly by drivers, the number of drivers, the congestion,
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.080]   things like that, accident rates.
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.000]   But it's also driven by things like theft and crime.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.600]   So where you choose to buy will have a big difference in the crime rates.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.720]   I think earlier – well, every county is different.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.120]   So you need to look at your county and understand.
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:32.680]   Where you choose to live will have a difference on your energy costs, the costs of heating
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.680]   or cooling.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.800]   In an extreme climate, you'll have higher costs for cooling your house or for warming
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.680]   your house.
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:43.240]   And you'll pay varying rates for that energy.
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.200]   Some states have very high energy costs.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.560]   Some states have very low energy costs.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:53.400]   The place that you choose to live will have a dramatic impact on your grocery budget.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.560]   What stores are available to you?
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.400]   How much do you pay for those stores?
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:01.880]   If you live in an inner city, downtown inner city, it's probably going to be a hassle
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:06.120]   for you to try to get out and go outside of the city.
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:10.800]   Probably would also be a big expense for you to purchase things in bulk at lower prices.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.760]   So you are more likely to be working with a local merchant who's selling things in
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.440]   small quantities at relatively high unit prices.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.840]   You'll pay a higher amount for groceries.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:25.560]   You'll pay, based upon where you live, a higher or lower amount for accessibility to
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.560]   stores.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:31.240]   If you live out in the country, 50 miles from the closest grocery store, there's going
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.720]   to be a significant expense for you in gasoline just to get to the grocery store.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:39.400]   That's a different choice than when you live a block or two away from the grocery store
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.720]   and you can walk down there and pick up your groceries with your wagon or what I used to
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:47.640]   do is take my bike trailer down to the local grocery store and load up my bike trailer
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.880]   with groceries.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.800]   All of those things matter.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.680]   Where you choose to live will drive your entertainment expenses.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:02.000]   What is normal and customary in your circles?
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.680]   Sometimes if you live in an urban, high activity lifestyle, it's very normal for you to say,
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.640]   "Well, tonight we're going to go down to the theater.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.960]   Tonight we're going to go down to the show.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.280]   Tonight we're going to go down to the concert.
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.780]   Tonight we're going to go down to the movies."
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.680]   And those things all have embedded costs.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.440]   Now, of course, there can be benefits.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:24.160]   I'm not painting everything as – I'm not trying to be one-sided in my analysis here.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.100]   For example, there are many cities if you live in an urban environment, there's a lot
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:29.160]   of free entertainment, a lot of discounted things.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:34.900]   Wherever you live, you can find ways to change circumstances.
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:39.400]   You might live – for example, if you live in downtown Miami, Florida and your car insurance
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:43.400]   rates are very, very high, it's much more in your interest to not own a car, not to
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:49.460]   drive and to use other forms of transportation in order to offset that cost.
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:55.420]   So please don't hear me being one-sided or hypercritical, but I'm trying to challenge
[00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.420]   your thinking.
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:01.100]   Back to entertainment, for example, if you live out in the country, perhaps your normal
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:05.820]   form of entertainment is put a bonfire in the backyard and invite your friends over.
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.040]   It's all a matter of lifestyle.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.540]   What are you going for?
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:16.220]   Where you live will have a dramatic impact on the cost of your medical insurance and
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:21.300]   possibly on the cost of your medical care.
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.540]   Consider and calculate carefully.
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:23.540]   It's funny.
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:29.940]   I'm just sitting here and looking at my own expenses for 2017 as I do this show.
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:37.700]   Where you live will have a dramatic impact even on small things like your dog expenses.
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:41.680]   I shared on yesterday's show that a frustration for me has been how expensive one of my dogs
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.180]   has been over the last couple of years.
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:49.580]   It's because he has allergies to something in – at least where I live in Florida.
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:53.140]   The only way to control it, it leads to a dermatological condition for him.
[00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:57.780]   The only way to control his allergies is with – at the moment, with a very expensive medication
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:02.300]   but an effective medication that he's on.
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.480]   And yet that's probably a regional thing.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:08.160]   In terms of talking with a dermatologist, it's probably throughout the southeast.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.820]   But there may be other places in the country that would have a dramatically cheaper place.
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:17.180]   If I lived in a different place with my dog, it would probably have saved me about $1,500
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:22.260]   last year from vet bills because of his allergies.
[00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.100]   So that's enough of the examples.
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.620]   I hope I've made my point.
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:33.460]   The place that you choose to live is probably the cornerstone choice that will affect every
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:38.060]   other area of your life.
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:42.800]   Now you'll notice thus far I haven't discussed income.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:50.700]   It would be negligent for me to not discuss income because there is a strong correlation
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:55.580]   between location and income levels.
[00:19:55.580 --> 00:20:00.180]   There has to be and this makes sense.
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:06.180]   If you live in a large urban environment, on average, the incomes will be higher than
[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.820]   if you live out in the country.
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:18.580]   It's much more normal to find somebody working and living on $15,000 per year out in a small
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:27.360]   rural town than it is to find somebody working and living on $15,000 per year in downtown
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:32.240]   San Francisco or downtown New York City, downtown Chicago, downtown Dallas, Texas, downtown
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.840]   Miami, Florida.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:38.320]   After all, that's one of the major reasons why people move to an urban environment is
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.260]   for economic opportunity.
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:45.400]   That would be one of the stronger reasons to choose to live somewhere where you're going
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:54.720]   to have a higher cost of living would be so that you can earn the higher rate of income.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:59.040]   But count the cost carefully in that decision.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:06.240]   I'm convinced that probably about 20% of the people who live in a high cost of living place
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.800]   for the purposes of earning a high income are actually earning a high income.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:14.480]   But about 80% of the people probably aren't.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:21.640]   What I mean is there are ways to build a high income in almost any place that you live.
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:27.440]   Years ago when I sold life insurance for a living, I did a lot of reading and I would
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:31.360]   spend a lot of time thinking about where I lived.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:37.720]   One of the values of living where I lived was – is the fact that it's an urban environment.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.920]   In an urban environment, you have more prospective customers.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.600]   Your prospective customers have higher incomes.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.280]   Higher incomes lead to potentially larger sales.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.880]   They have more income they need to protect.
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:54.800]   It's much easier to sell a $5 million life insurance policy to somebody who earns a couple
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:59.820]   of hundred thousand dollars a year than it is to somebody who earns $20,000 per year.
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:05.760]   So the idea is that if you live in an urban environment, there are lots of prospects for
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:06.760]   your products.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.360]   You'll frequently see this.
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:14.400]   There are large life insurance producers who often live and work in very affluent areas,
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:19.800]   whether that's Aventura, Florida or downtown New York City or downtown Los Angeles because
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:27.240]   the prospect pool of wealthy and high income earning clients is very, very concentrated.
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.300]   But that's not the only way to build a business.
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:35.120]   When I was first starting to study the business, I quickly came across the story and history
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:40.260]   of a man named Ben Feldman who for a time – and I'm sure many would still consider
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:44.280]   him the same today – was the greatest life insurance salesman in history.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:49.340]   He worked for New York Life and he just set sales record after sales record after sales
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:53.160]   record over the course of a 50-year career selling insurance.
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.040]   That was just huge, absolutely huge.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:01.140]   He took every ceiling for decades and basically broke through every ceiling of what people
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:06.940]   thought was possible in the life insurance sales business.
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:10.740]   One of the remarkable things to me though was that he made his career and built his
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:18.820]   career in a little rural town called East Liverpool in Ohio near the borders of Ohio,
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:22.620]   Pennsylvania and West Virginia with a tiny little population.
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:27.860]   Most of his career was spent within about a 50-mile geographic area in East Liverpool,
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:28.860]   Ohio.
[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:37.980]   He built one of the greatest, if not the greatest, life insurance sales businesses of all time.
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:44.900]   I would often think about that because it was a good example of challenging paradigms.
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:48.580]   Often you can take what you're doing in a high cost of living place and you can do
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:54.340]   it in a lower cost of living place.
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:58.180]   Don't be scared to challenge your own considerations.
[00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:02.540]   Don't be scared to challenge your own choices.
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:06.780]   Final part of today's show and by way of reminder, the first thing that we discussed
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:15.720]   was order your expenses from biggest to smallest and focus on changing the biggest ones first
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:21.540]   because that'll have a bigger impact on your overall lifestyle than all your little
[00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:23.920]   decisions.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:29.380]   So look at the big expenses and try to focus on the big structural changes.
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:35.880]   If you have a $500 a month car payment, that's a total of $6,000 per year.
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:42.100]   If you dump the car and dump the car payment and buy something for cash that's cheap,
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:47.420]   at the end of next year if you save that money, that'll be $6,000 in your pocket.
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:52.860]   $5 a day lattes will certainly dent that $6,000.
[00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:58.180]   If you do five bucks a day, 20 bucks a week, 50 weeks a year, that's $1,200 at the end
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:02.980]   of the year that you're spending on $5 lattes or again, latte is a metaphor.
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.900]   So that'll dent that $6,000.
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:09.900]   But better for you to just sell the truck, sell the car, get something cheap and then
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:14.380]   pocket the $4,800 difference if you want to keep on doing the latte.
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:17.060]   Your best course of action of course is to do both.
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:23.300]   Cut out the lattes and cut out the car payment and then you got $7,200 in your pocket at
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.340]   the end of the year.
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.100]   But that was point number one.
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:31.700]   Point number one, biggest to littlest, focus on the big ones first.
[00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:39.880]   Point number two was if there is a key factor in your budget, most likely it's your choice
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.440]   of housing.
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:46.060]   That's the cornerstone expense that drives just about everything else.
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:50.500]   So do a careful analysis of your situation.
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:55.140]   Now number three, back to that fixed versus variable expenses.
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:26:01.780]   To me, one of the most valuable things that can be done in a personal budget is to move
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:11.800]   things off of the fixed expense category and move them over to variable expenses.
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:20.080]   I have a pretty deep allergy towards fixed expenses and it's only getting deeper.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.800]   Now perhaps this is due to a little bit of my background and my history.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:28.260]   As a financial advisor, I've seen so many people make changes in their lives and I've
[00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:34.160]   watched them go from prosperity to disaster very quickly.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:39.920]   Just like a physician has the benefit of seeing people go from health to illness and from
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.380]   illness to health, just like a physician has that benefit, a financial advisor has the
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:48.540]   benefit of knowing the intimate details of people's lives and I've seen how quickly
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:55.760]   lives change due to no expectation – with no previous expectation of the person.
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:00.880]   I've seen people go from earning $300,000 a year to being unemployed for years and not
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.720]   being able to find a job.
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.840]   I've seen fortunes lost.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:09.600]   I've seen businesses turned upside down by changes in legislation or changes in – somebody
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.720]   lost a lawsuit or something like that.
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.720]   It happens.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:17.800]   When you see that again and again, it puts a deep defensive – it has put a deep defensiveness
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:21.880]   into me of just watching those patterns.
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:26.600]   I'm also allergic to it probably from my own experience.
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:32.720]   Having lived on a highly variable income for the last decade of my life, I've learned
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:37.600]   to be wary of committing myself in advance.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:42.000]   I've learned to be wary of having high structural expenses because there have been months where
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.960]   my income is huge and there have been months where my income has gone along and I've
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:51.360]   earned nothing or I've owed money.
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.440]   Those experiences change your outlook.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.440]   They have for me.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:28:00.520]   So I've developed a pretty deep allergy and aversion to fixed expenses.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:06.520]   I think that one of the most valuable things you can do is seek whenever possible to move
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:12.240]   fixed expenses and transform them into variable expenses.
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.240]   How do you do that?
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:18.220]   The first obvious way to do it is by paying things off.
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:24.120]   If you have a $400 a month or $500 a month car payment and you pay the car off, then
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.520]   you eliminate the $500 a month car payment.
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.320]   Now, do you eliminate the expense of the car?
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:30.820]   No, you don't.
[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:34.060]   You still have the steady decrease in value.
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:38.440]   You have the steady depreciation of the vehicle and you have that expense whether you have
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:41.000]   a car payment or whether you don't.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   But you eliminate the fixed expense to your budget.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.140]   Similar thing would occur if you own a home and you pay it off.
[00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:56.280]   If you have a paid off house, that brings you tremendous flexibility because now you
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.360]   don't have to make a payment every month.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:04.860]   So if your income goes down or if your circumstances change, you're not stuck having to come up
[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:07.740]   with payments.
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:11.340]   Method number one, pay things off.
[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:17.980]   Method number two, whenever possible, choose a non-contracted option.
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:24.940]   There's a bit of a mixture here between paying things off but here would be a simple example.
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:32.800]   For years, many of us purchased phones, cell phones from companies with the use of a contract.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:37.340]   The basic methodology of the past and it still exists today was that a large phone carrier
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:41.140]   would offer a phone to you and they would give you a discount on the phone, give you
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:45.420]   a free phone or give you a discount on it in exchange for your signing a contract with
[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:46.420]   that company.
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:52.300]   I did this several times over the years and one of the challenges though was that you
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.700]   were locked into a certain provider.
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:58.580]   You had to fulfill the terms of the contract.
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:03.500]   That's annoying from a value perspective because perhaps that provider is not providing the
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:08.540]   value that you want and it's also annoying from the perspective of having to make that
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:09.780]   payment every month.
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:11.900]   What happens if your income is low?
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.660]   What happens if you lose your job?
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:15.740]   How do you keep on going with that payment?
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:19.620]   And having your phone number locked in with them was even worse because for a long time,
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.080]   that phone number was a really valuable thing.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.380]   How do I make sure that I don't lose that phone number?
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:30.540]   Well, for a number of years, I've quit doing business with those companies and I was very
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:36.420]   glad to get rid of them after years of frustration with the fact that the companies always seem
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:40.700]   to treat the new customers better than the old customers just because they would just
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.980]   try to lock people into a contract to give them discounts.
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:45.420]   Finally, I said, "I'm done with you all."
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:49.100]   So for years, I've used various prepaid options for the phone.
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:54.940]   Now, I maintain service on the phone but I love the fact that I don't have to.
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.300]   I love the mental freedom from knowing, "You know what?
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:01.340]   If I'm not going to use my phone for a while, I could just skip it.
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:04.260]   I don't have to have a phone."
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:10.060]   And because I've moved my services around so that my cell phone number is no longer
[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:15.740]   a number that I care about, rather I have all of my points of contact in ways that don't
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:21.660]   require monthly expenses, it frees me up mentally to know that at any point in time, I could
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:25.820]   just dump the phone cost.
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:26.820]   That's powerful.
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:29.460]   You know, that wasn't possible a decade ago.
[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:32.940]   You always needed to have that continuity of that phone information, that phone line.
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:35.940]   But today, we live in a better world and today, you can do that.
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:38.780]   Now, I don't think it's possible to do that with all things.
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:40.620]   It's certainly not.
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:45.940]   But anywhere you have the choice to not sign a contract or you have the choice to take
[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:51.660]   things little by little, calculate that and consider going for it.
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:54.540]   It brings freedom and flexibility to your budget.
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:58.660]   And the third point I would give on this point of how do you make fixed expenses, variable
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:09.300]   expenses is with personal skill in spending and personal resilience in attitude.
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:18.700]   I spoke yesterday about my annoyance with our grocery budget over the last year.
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:22.380]   The good thing about that though is even though I've been annoyed with it, the reason that
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:29.300]   we spent the money that we spent on groceries throughout 2017 was because we were making
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:37.320]   many luxury choices, luxury choices such as choosing the higher quality of food versus
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:41.900]   the lower quality of food that would simply deliver calories and basic nutrients instead
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:50.940]   of what might be a little bit cleaner, luxury choices in choosing convenience foods over
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:55.220]   foods that require more manual preparation, luxury choices in terms of choosing foods
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:33:00.020]   that are richer and simply tastier and more fun to eat than things that are nutritious
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.300]   and satisfying.
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:12.220]   But the great thing is I know that if we had to, if we had to based upon skill, I could
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:17.260]   feed my family on $200 a month.
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:18.260]   Now would that be luxury?
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:19.660]   No, it wouldn't.
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:20.660]   Should I do that?
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.740]   Well, depends on how bad I need the money.
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:26.620]   I think there are important considerations with something as important as food, which
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:32.620]   fuels your life and contributes measurably to your lifestyle, that the ultimate cheapest
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:35.980]   is not always the best.
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:44.540]   But with skill, which I do have and I know how to acquire, I could do that if necessary.
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:49.720]   And there are many other areas in which this is also the case.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.300]   With skill, you can learn to repair your car.
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:55.020]   With skill, you can learn to groom your own dog.
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:59.360]   With skill, you can learn to have lots of fun entertainment for free.
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:02.060]   With skill, you can learn how to fix your clothes.
[00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.340]   With skill, you can learn how to cut your own hair.
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:08.340]   With skill, you can learn how to cut your own lawn.
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:11.420]   So skill acquisition is very important.
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:15.780]   And even if you don't actively practice the skills every day, at least being aware of
[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:18.580]   them is helpful.
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:22.640]   That's why I try so hard to share with you ideas on skills that you can develop.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:27.740]   You may not want to live on $200 a month even as I don't – of food, even as I don't
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:29.800]   particularly want to do that.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:35.340]   But knowing how to live on $200 a month, knowing how to have your children's stomachs full
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:39.740]   so they're not crying and to have enough nutritional value so that you're not going to stunt their
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:46.500]   growth or cause problems down the road, knowing how to do that is very valuable and it makes
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.740]   you resilient.
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:55.200]   Personal resiliency is the other aspect of the equation.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:00.380]   Are you willing and able to endure change with a good attitude?
[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:05.420]   Are you willing and able to endure discomfort with a good attitude?
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:12.900]   Are you willing and able to embrace adversity and gain from it rather than complain about
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.480]   it?
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:21.500]   Are your relationships with your husband, wife, children, family members, are they strong
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:28.540]   so that those relationships will carry through times of adversity?
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:36.840]   Is your sense of self-confidence and self-worth, are they strong and able to carry you through
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:41.260]   times of challenge, times of failure?
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:42.260]   Everybody fails.
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.040]   Everybody faces adversity.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:48.300]   All of us at some point are going to lose a job or have a business failure or fail on
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.300]   something.
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:51.580]   I've had my share and I'm even having my share right now.
[00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:56.060]   But your mindset is what carries you through and your personal resiliency, your personal
[00:35:56.060 --> 00:36:04.360]   strength will make a big impact in your interpretation of events.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:10.940]   Your attitude and your mindset will determine the results that you get.
[00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:15.220]   Two people with two different mindsets can walk through the same circumstances.
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:21.980]   One of them comes out frustrated at life, deeply depressed, angry at everything.
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:32.700]   The other person comes out of it scarred but with new skills and deeper scar tissue.
[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:37.500]   Personal resilience is something that can be cultivated and I recommend to you it's
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:40.060]   something that should be cultivated.
[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.700]   It should be cultivated in yourself.
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:45.580]   It should be cultivated in your children.
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:53.820]   And resilience will have an impact on your personal expenses.
[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:58.220]   Are you strong and resilient enough to turn off the air conditioning in your house for
[00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:04.920]   a month, to save $120 on your cooling bill so that you can meet an unexpected challenge
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.900]   in life?
[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.940]   Could your children be able to handle that without complaining all the time?
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:16.220]   I'm amazed when I see my own flabbiness with regard to personal resiliency and things like
[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:17.220]   air conditioning.
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:20.700]   I grew up in a house without air conditioning and it was hot, yeah, but that's what sweating
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.500]   is for and that's what fans are for.
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:26.180]   And the house was designed differently than a modern house as well.
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:30.540]   But I often challenge myself, "Joshua, are you committed and addicted to comfort or are
[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:34.660]   you able to be resilient?"
[00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:39.100]   Could you handle – could your family, the bonds and the ties of your family handle a
[00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:45.100]   disaster and needing to move from your large and comfortable house into a small and uncomfortable
[00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.100]   apartment?
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.820]   I was impressed three or four years ago.
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:53.740]   I forget the name of the boat, the writer or their blog, but three or four years ago
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:38:01.020]   there was a story about a sailboat which had been sunk – which sank out in the Pacific
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:02.020]   Ocean.
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:08.340]   And the story was of a young family, husband, wife, two younger children who had saved and
[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:14.180]   worked diligently for many years to save – to buy their sailboat.
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:18.220]   They purchased a sailboat and they had lived on the sailboat and they'd saved their money
[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:21.940]   in order to go on a multiyear round-the-world cruise.
[00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:27.220]   They were living in Mexico and Southern California docking there and they set out from there
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.180]   to cross the Pacific.
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:34.220]   While they were out there, unfortunately they ran into problems with the boat.
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:39.220]   The husband was an experienced captain and I don't believe that there was any major
[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:40.340]   negligence on their part.
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:44.220]   They just ran into problems with the boat and they wound up needing to be rescued very
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:49.540]   dramatically, thousands of miles from shore, rescued and the boat was sunk.
[00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:56.060]   And after years of working toward their dream, they were now without their boat, which was
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:39:03.060]   of course a huge financial catastrophe where they had a lot of money tied up in that boat.
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:07.020]   And so some of the interviews after the fact were focused on, "Well, what now?
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.860]   What's going to be the next area of impact?
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:10.860]   What are you going to do?"
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:14.060]   Well, the family wasn't giving up.
[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:17.180]   They were focused again on pursuing their dream.
[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:20.700]   They had moved into a small apartment and they said, "We're going to embrace for
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:24.980]   now this small apartment lifestyle and we're going to save and work towards that."
[00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:28.260]   I don't know if they've gotten their boat again today, but I bet they will if they
[00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:30.980]   haven't yet because they had a plan.
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:33.140]   And what I admired about them was their attitude.
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:35.860]   And I've seen this again and again with sailors.
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:42.500]   I admire sailors because sailors have to develop skills and resilience in their personal experience.
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:45.340]   When you're out on the ocean and it's just you and the boat, you've got to develop
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:47.740]   the skills to fix the thing.
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:51.340]   And that requires a knowledge of the wind and the weather, a knowledge of mechanics
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:54.780]   to get the engine going again, a knowledge of electrical systems to figure out why the
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:59.820]   inverter is not working and why the batteries aren't taking the charge, requires generalized
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:03.940]   knowledge and skills that most sailors learn little by little.
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:06.540]   But it also requires a sense of resilience.
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:12.660]   Sailboats are hot and yet frequently a sailor looks at that and says, "Yeah, but I get
[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:15.080]   to live on a boat.
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:19.500]   So during the hot heat of the day, I'm going to go in the water or go on shore where I
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.940]   can be cool or figure out a way to just deal with it."
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:25.500]   And that attitude, that sense of resilience carries over in other parts of life.
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:29.700]   So this particular couple, I remember them, they moved into a tiny studio or a one-bedroom
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:33.820]   apartment, and they had to persuade the landlord vigorously that it was okay.
[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:35.820]   They were used to living on a tiny sailboat.
[00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:38.980]   So even though they were a family of four, they could still move into this tiny little
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:39.980]   studio.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:44.900]   And then they had constructed some clever small beds in a way that would give the children
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:47.020]   a place to sleep but really wasn't that much room.
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:50.180]   And they had gone into it and figured out how can we frugally decorate it and make it
[00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:56.100]   a homey and happy and cheery place even though it's small and inexpensive.
[00:40:56.100 --> 00:41:01.820]   To me, it was a beautiful example of resiliency.
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:06.620]   Cultivate a sense of resilience in yourself and in your children.
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:12.060]   Fortunately, it's actually relatively easy to cultivate a sense of resiliency.
[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:15.220]   Unfortunately, it's not so fun.
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.260]   How do you do it?
[00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:21.020]   Set challenges for yourself.
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:28.220]   Either embrace them when they come along by circumstances or set them for yourself.
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:31.200]   Make your life uncomfortable and learn how to have a good attitude through it.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:35.020]   Make your children's lives uncomfortable and teach them how to have a good attitude through
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:36.020]   it.
[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:38.880]   It'll make all the difference in the world.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:48.980]   As I close today's show, I want to challenge you.
[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:54.980]   Do you have a clearly defined goal for your money?
[00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:59.180]   Do you have a vision of what you're working towards?
[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:01.480]   The family with the sailboat did.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.160]   They had worked for years and saved for their boat.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:09.000]   Then they were starting the process all over again, working and saving for the boat.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.120]   I need to go check to see if they've gotten their new one yet.
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:18.640]   There's no doubt that they will because they have a clear goal.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:24.280]   The clarity of your goals dramatically impacts the ease with which you will roll up your
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.640]   sleeves and get into the actual plans.
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:34.260]   The family who wants to live on a sailboat will embrace moving into a cheap studio apartment
[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:36.800]   because it's preparation for the sailboat.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:43.840]   Do you have a clear goal and are you aligning the things in your life with those goals?
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:47.120]   If not, just work on it.
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:48.120]   Don't expect perfection.
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:50.240]   Don't expect to figure it all out right away.
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:55.680]   Just work on it systematically over time.
