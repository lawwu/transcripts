[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.920]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.600]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:44.040]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.840]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.280]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to have you on my journey to find all the
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.760]   hacks.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.320]   Now, in a normal year, my experience with our healthcare system just includes a
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.760]   visit to the doctor, maybe some blood work, a couple dental cleanings.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.880]   But 2021 was a bit different.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.000]   Between fracturing my foot on a wedding dance floor and a random case of
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.400]   shingles, I've had three visits to the ER, which came with some interesting
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.120]   medical bills.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.240]   So I am really excited to be talking today with Marshall Allen.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.640]   For over a decade, he was a reporter at ProPublica investigating the cost and
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.440]   quality of our healthcare, and his work has been honored with several journalism
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.560]   awards, including the Harvard Kennedy School's Goldsmith Prize for
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.480]   Investigative Reporting, and he was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.240]   Local Reporting.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.080]   But most importantly for today, he is the author of a new book called Never Pay
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.440]   the First Bill and Other Creative Ways to Fight the Healthcare System and Win.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.480]   So we're going to get tactical and talk about how we can all push back about the
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.000]   high cost of healthcare, including negotiating with doctors and insurance
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.280]   companies, picking the right plan with our healthcare, preventing expensive
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.560]   bills before you get care, and the tactics you need to negotiate any bill
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.960]   you get.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.520]   So without further ado, I hope you enjoy my conversation with Marshall Allen.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.680]   Let's get started.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.000]   Marshall, thanks for being here.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.520]   Thank you, Chris.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.800]   I'm really excited to be here to talk about hacking the healthcare system.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.680]   This is going to be fun.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.360]   Yeah, I want to just start off asking what led you to dedicate so much of your
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.240]   career to researching and writing about healthcare?
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.200]   You know, it's actually an accident, Chris.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.480]   I had no intention of covering healthcare.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.800]   In fact, I thought writing about healthcare would be extremely boring.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.680]   And when my editor at the Las Vegas Sun newspaper asked me, took me out to lunch
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.800]   one day and asked me to cover healthcare, this was in 2006, I actually, my first
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.400]   words were, I cannot imagine anything more boring than writing about healthcare.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.680]   And I quickly realized how wrong I was because I started doing stories from the
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.320]   perspective of the patient who has to engage with the healthcare system.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.800]   And I definitely have an investigative bent to me.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.240]   And I also have a very people focused value to the journalism that I do.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.680]   So as soon as I started looking at our healthcare system from the point of view
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.160]   of the patient who has to navigate the system, which is completely fractured,
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.560]   overcomplicated and opaque, and they have to navigate the system.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.440]   They have to pay for the healthcare they received.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.560]   And it's completely overpriced, unjustifiably overpriced.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.800]   And they have to navigate the safety and the quality of the system, which
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.160]   is very difficult to tell.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.040]   And unfortunately, medical errors are a leading cause of
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.760]   injury and death in this country.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.560]   So as soon as I started writing about healthcare, looking at the quality,
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.880]   looking at the safety and looking at the cost, I found that I was able to do
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.120]   stories that immediately had a lot of traction with, with the audience.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.120]   They could really help people right where they're at.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.440]   I could stand up for people who are being taken advantage of.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.320]   And so it's been really satisfying these last now 15 years of digging
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.000]   deep on our healthcare system.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.520]   And was there a moment in this career that you said, now's
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.760]   the time I have to write a book?
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.400]   I started feeling after I'd been at ProPublica for about five or six years,
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.800]   you do enough of these stories about outrageous medical bills, and you dig
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.640]   into people's medical records, you share the records with experts,
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.480]   you share the bills with experts.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.640]   I started to learn more and more about how the system actually works instead
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.920]   of the ways that we're told that the system works or this facade that's
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.400]   been built up around the system.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.320]   So I began to get a deeper understanding of the system because I talked to thousands
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.680]   of experts and patients over the 15 years.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.400]   And then I dug into hundreds of cases of individual patients who had been just
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.160]   completely screwed by the system in one way or another, I saw there's a complete
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.520]   lack of accountability and I looked at it across a broad level of stakeholders.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.240]   You know, I was talking to doctors, insurance companies, patients, hospitals,
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.880]   but always looking at it from the point of view of the patient.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.280]   So I realized, okay, I have a lot, I have a lot to say here, I've learned a lot.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.320]   And I'm getting at the same time, emails and phone calls almost every day from
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.520]   patients who are having their lives utterly wrecked by our healthcare system.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.120]   And so let me just throw out some statistics because I think it's important
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.560]   to ground the conversation about what an urgent problem we have here.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.800]   First of all, we spend about twice as much per person on healthcare in the
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.880]   United States compared to the citizens of any other developed country.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.640]   In other words, the problem here isn't that we're not spending enough.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.800]   In fact, we are spending twice as much per person than citizens of other
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.320]   countries, and we still have about 30, 40 million Americans who
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.920]   don't have any insurance coverage.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.800]   We probably have about that many more who are what I would
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.400]   call functionally uninsured.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:57.000]   Which just means that the health benefits they have are so thin that maybe they
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.320]   have a deductible that's $5,000 or $3,000 a year, but they only make $60,000 a year.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.600]   So if you're making 60 grand, you're paying out a monthly premium for your
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:14.080]   health insurance, and you still have to pay the first $3,000, $5,000, some people
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.120]   are on a high deductible plan that makes them pay the first $10,000.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.240]   In that case, they are functionally uninsured.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.280]   They're only going to use those benefits if they have some catastrophic accident
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.080]   and they're paying everything out of pocket.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:32.480]   Now, when you have that problem, now you get these massive bills, which are
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.720]   unjustifiably high in many cases, full of errors, as I found through my
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.480]   reporting and talking to experts.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.160]   Now, people that have these high deductibles where they pay the first
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.600]   dollar and the bills are outrageously high, they cannot afford them.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.640]   And now we have a problem of medical debt.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.560]   So one out of every three Americans right now has medical debt.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.520]   And one out of every five Americans has medical debt in collections.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.800]   So these numbers are staggering.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:06.320]   It is a travesty what's happening to the American people and working
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.760]   Americans are hit the hardest.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.000]   And so that's why I decided, okay, I'm going to put all the tips I've learned
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.240]   into a book and where I haven't learned the tips, I'm going to go find the
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:21.840]   experts who have the knowledge that I can share with the audience and in each
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.880]   chapter, I'm going to show here's a common problem people have with the
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.920]   healthcare system, and here's how to tackle it and here's how to fight back
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:35.200]   and win the key words in my subtitle in my book and other ways to fight the
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.720]   healthcare system and when we're talking about winning here and the way I define
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:45.160]   winning is we should be paying much less for our healthcare and getting much
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.040]   better healthcare than we're getting right now.
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:52.640]   So I define a win as saving a lot of money while getting better care, not just
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.480]   mediocre care or denying yourself care, because that's typically what's
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.840]   happened to people. So it's been really satisfying to write the book and start
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.000]   getting feedback from people who are putting these tactics into place.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.840]   Yeah, I've witnessed some of the high costs in the last few months. It's
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:14.000]   crazy. I assume these hacks are not just for people who are in high deductible
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.560]   plans or who are underinsured. Are there are some of these beneficial to anyone?
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:23.520]   They're beneficial to everyone. In fact, with each of these tips, you could save
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.440]   hundreds or even thousands of dollars per healthcare encounter. The numbers
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.200]   here are so staggering and I'd love to hear about some of your experiences over
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:38.000]   the past year because the numbers are so staggering that if you can even get one
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   erroneous charge taken off of your medical bill, you might save hundreds or
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.880]   thousands of dollars. If you can go, a really common one is the high cost of
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:52.280]   imaging. So let's say you need a CT scan or an MRI. Your doctor might refer you to
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.480]   the MRI facility that's right down the hall in the hospital where they work.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:01.840]   Hospitals are the most expensive place to get these scans done. Same with lab
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.680]   tests. But if you can find an independent imaging center, it may be half a mile
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:11.840]   away from the hospital imaging center. They'll do the same CT scan, same MRI,
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.160]   same x-rays, whatever you need, and you will save hundreds or even thousands of
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:22.600]   dollars per scan, and MRIs and CTs being more expensive than the x-rays. But you
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.840]   can save huge amount of monies just by routing yourself away from the hospital
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.920]   for imaging tests.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.600]   Yeah, I'm fortunate that I have a healthcare plan that makes hospital ER
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.560]   visits fairly affordable. But you know, that doesn't mean that I didn't get to
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.200]   see the full prices that were getting charged. And it's wild. I think I saw a
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.000]   doctor for 10-15 minutes and the bill was like $7,000.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.600]   Unbelievable.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:53.320]   And one thing I'll ask is, is there, I'm on what's called an EPO, right? And so I
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:58.440]   have a $100 deductible for an ER visit. And so for me, I was like, okay, is there
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:03.680]   any benefit to me negotiating that $7,000 bill down knowing that I'm just
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.640]   paying 100 of it? And what impact would that have?
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.720]   That's a great question, because it gets at one of the fundamental
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:14.040]   misunderstandings I think we have about healthcare when we get healthcare
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.840]   through our employers. So we need to stop saying and thinking that someone else is
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.680]   paying for our healthcare. And it's really easy to do because they've taken
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:28.000]   the pain away from you of that immediate out-of-pocket cost. You're only paying
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.760]   that $100. But as our healthcare costs go up, so they're overcharging, and then
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.880]   the health plan is covering most of that cost, that is still coming out of your
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:43.200]   premiums. And so you are going to see a rise in premiums every year because of
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.800]   these overcharges to your health plan. And so you might not feel that immediate
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.400]   pain of it coming out of your wallet, or out of your bank account. But year after
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:56.320]   year, because of these high costs, we have seen health insurance premiums and
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:04.200]   deductibles rise by 5 to 10% a year for premiums. And then we have deductibles
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:08.200]   going up at outrageous amounts at the same time. And then the other trick that
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.680]   they play is they reduce the amount of coverage that you have. And so when you
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:17.960]   look at this rising cost of healthcare, this is eating into the compensation
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:22.920]   that our employers allocate toward our wages and our benefits. So think about
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:27.440]   it this way. When you get hired, you get a compensation package. That
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.960]   compensation package includes your wages, maybe a 401k or retirement
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:37.520]   contribution, paid time off, and hopefully health benefits. The thing is,
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.800]   our employer isn't actually paying for our benefits. What our employer is doing
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:47.560]   is funding our compensation, then that compensation belongs to you and me as
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:54.880]   working Americans, right? Now, if our compensation is being consumed by $7,000
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:59.160]   bills from the doctor in the emergency room, even though we don't feel it
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.160]   immediately, because maybe you just have that $100 deductible, you are going to
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.600]   feel it in the long term, because this is sucking all of the compensation out of
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:13.160]   your employers compensation pool, which leaves less money for your employer to
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:18.000]   give raises in the next year. And it also causes higher rises in premiums and
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.160]   deductibles, as I mentioned. And so when economists look at the reason wages are
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:28.520]   stagnant in the United States over the last 10 2030 years, the rising cost of
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:33.520]   healthcare is a huge cause of wage stagnation. And it's because our
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:39.080]   compensation is getting consumed by all of these outrageous and unjustified
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:44.000]   medical costs. And so I'm trying to help working Americans see it, see the big
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.200]   picture. It's not just that deductible or that amount that you pay out of
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:53.480]   pocket. It's also the monthly premiums that keep going up, and the wage
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:58.160]   stagnation that's caused by our compensation just disappearing because
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.360]   of high healthcare costs.
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.920]   Yeah, if anyone out there is listening and has an entrepreneurial itch, I would
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.680]   love to see you try to turn all of the tips and tricks that Marshall's worked
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.440]   on in this book and in his career into a product that could just scan my medical
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.800]   bills and tell me what I should be fighting back against.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.560]   Yeah, and this is a big thing now. And it's going to become a bigger and bigger
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:26.680]   thing in the coming years. And I predict real disruption is coming for our
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:31.880]   healthcare system. It's consuming about one out of every five dollars in our
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:37.840]   GDP is from healthcare. It's not sustainable. There's, to me, a lot of
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:43.720]   signs of a bubble that's not able to be maintained. And so once employers and
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:49.280]   working Americans team up with all of these vendors and entrepreneurs that are
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.640]   creating these really innovative products that are identifying the problem
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:57.200]   and what you can do about it, things I think are going to change pretty
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:57.720]   quickly.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.280]   Yeah, I don't want to go too deep because I feel like we could spend hours
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:07.200]   on this. But is there a succinct way to explain why our healthcare system is so
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.960]   broken and expensive and we spend twice as much as other countries?
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.880]   Yes, here's how I would answer that question. If I had to boil it down to
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:23.240]   one thing, we have allowed the profit motives that are not unethical or
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.720]   immoral in other contexts. Let's say you open a restaurant and you want to
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:32.080]   charge five hundred dollars for a steak. If you put the price on the menu and
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.040]   it's a five hundred dollar steak and people want to come in and buy it,
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:40.880]   there's nothing immoral or unethical about doing that. But if you overprice a
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:46.200]   health care procedure that somebody needs to survive and you don't show
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:51.120]   them the price up front, but you hit them with that outrageous price after
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.840]   they have gotten the procedure they needed to save their life, that's where
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:16:00.200]   the profiteering becomes to me a moral and an ethical issue. None of this is
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:06.000]   illegal or much of it is not illegal, but it's not right. I believe it's not
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.600]   right to charge someone more than you should when all they're trying to do is
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.520]   get the care that they need to save their life or to heal their body or to
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:21.240]   take care of their sick child. So this same profit motive that drives a lot of
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:26.040]   the American economy, when it's applied to health care, it becomes really
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.160]   unsavory and extremely harmful to the American public.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.360]   And in other countries, are there ways people solve this that don't involve
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.040]   the government getting into health care, which I know is a pretty hot topic
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:37.360]   here?
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:42.640]   I haven't done enough research to speak authoritatively about what's
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.800]   happening in other countries and how they do it. But what I can tell you is
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:50.160]   this, they're spending about half as much and they have much, much better
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.880]   outcomes in terms of the health of their people. They get the same high
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:58.320]   quality medical care, their disease burden is much lighter, their life
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:04.960]   expectancy is much longer. And so we are doing it in the most expensive and
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.320]   not, we're not getting our money's worth when it comes to health care. So I
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:13.440]   don't know exactly how they're all doing it enough to say the tactics
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.840]   they're using that we should employ. But what's clear is we're not doing it
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:17.480]   right here.
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:22.360]   Yep. So, you know, you mentioned imaging as a big way to save, what are some
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:27.840]   other kind of easy big wins for saving on health care before, you know,
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.680]   ultimately, I want to jump into what happens when you get that bill. But
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.440]   before you get a bill, what are some of the best ways to start to
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.360]   preventatively save on your health care?
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:40.200]   So there are some principles that listeners can keep in mind to hack the
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:44.600]   health care system. First of all, realize that there is extreme price
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:49.760]   variation in our health care system. So if you need a knee replacement, you
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:55.920]   could spend as low as say $20,000 at one facility, or as high as $80,000 at
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.960]   another facility. It's that extreme and the quality is not going to be that
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:05.960]   different. If you need a medication, you could get a branded medication, or
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:10.240]   you could get a generic medication in many cases, that's the exact same
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:14.760]   chemical composition as that branded medication, but at a much, much lower
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:19.240]   price. And so with each of these decisions, if you know in advance, okay,
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:23.200]   where's the best place to get this? Where's the most value based place to
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:28.200]   get this? Where's the highest quality place to get this? Then you can begin
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:33.360]   asking some questions to pursue the best value care, which by value, I would
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.880]   define that as the lowest cost and the highest quality.
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.600]   And how do you research those costs? So let's say I do need a knee
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:44.280]   replacement, and I haven't listened to this podcast knowing that $20,000 to
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:49.480]   $80,000 could be the range. How do you price kind of compare without the
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:50.000]   information?
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:55.400]   Hospitals are now required to post their prices on their websites. There's
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:00.880]   a federal government regulation called the Hospital Price Transparency Rule.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.680]   And they're required now to post their prices for all their different
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:08.040]   procedures. And that includes the cash prices. So in other words, if you have
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.680]   no health insurance, or don't want to use your health insurance, you just
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:16.240]   want to pay cash, they have to post the Medicare prices, they have to post all
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.560]   the negotiated prices for all the different insurance companies that do
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:24.400]   those procedures in those facilities. So if you know that in advance, let's say
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.720]   you need a colonoscopy, which is a very common preventive procedure that people
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:32.240]   in your audience are going to need to get at some point in their lives. You
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.960]   can look now in hospital websites, and if they're following the federal
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:40.760]   government's rules, they will have their prices posted. And so you can check the
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:45.880]   prices at local hospitals, you can call ambulatory surgical centers and talk to
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:50.760]   them and get the prices there. And that's a good way to identify prices.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:55.400]   Another place that we can look for prices, there's a lot of now technology
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:00.280]   companies that are producing prices and making these a lot easier to look up. So
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.920]   look for some of these startups that are producing prices. There's one called
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:09.880]   turquoise health, there's one called health cost labs, just Google health
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:14.120]   care prices. And a lot of these startups are popping up and they're providing
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:20.440]   prices up front. Another tactic, call and ask, call and ask for the cash prices,
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:24.760]   especially because often the cash prices are even less than what you would pay
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:29.800]   with your insurance plan. And so it does take some legwork up front, you might get
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:33.800]   some doors shut in your face as people tell you we can't give you the price or
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:38.440]   you can't get the price. But more and more, the prices are becoming available.
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:43.240]   And people are offering the prices. So you know, more progressively minded
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:48.400]   disruptive health care providers, hospitals and doctors are posting their
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.920]   prices. So check out something like Surgery Center of Oklahoma. Surgery
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:57.360]   Center of Oklahoma is a surgery center that has just posted their prices just
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.440]   up on their website. And so if you're wondering what you should pay, you might
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.080]   want to consider going there. Of course, that might require some travel, you
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.600]   might not want to do that. But you could at least check their prices and see how
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.440]   those prices compare to prices in your community.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.920]   And are these prices, let's say I go to the Surgery Center of Oklahoma, and I
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:20.200]   need a procedure and I see a price, are the prices in my local area, if I call
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.120]   my doctor or local hospital, are they negotiable such that I can say, well,
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.920]   it's so much cheaper here? Could you do it for less?
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.040]   Yes, this is another principle that applies to healthcare. So let's say
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:34.360]   principle one is, there's huge price variation, and you might be able to get
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:40.400]   a better deal somewhere else. Principle number two would be everything is
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:45.280]   negotiable. So when they there's a really crazy way they do healthcare
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.680]   pricing. I mean, it makes absolutely no sense. But when they charge you
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:54.720]   something, they make up the charges. It's an outrageously high amount because
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:59.360]   what they want to do is take those charges and then apply insurance company
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:05.280]   discounts. So usually UnitedHealthcare or Blue Cross or Aetna will apply a
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:09.280]   discount. And then that's how they get customers. They say, look, we get you
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:13.160]   the best discount at the hospitals in your community or with the doctors in
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:18.360]   your community. But those initial prices that the hospitals or doctors post are
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:23.800]   fantasy numbers, they are not grounded to anything in reality. And so the
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:29.800]   negotiated price that the insurance company pays, it might be 1/10, or 1/5,
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:34.680]   or 1/3 of those initial charges. And that's why even on your your particular
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:40.200]   bill, the $7,000 bill from your doctor, that might have been a $7,000 charge.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:44.600]   And then that charge got negotiated down by your insurance company and
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.400]   resulted in a lower payment.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:51.960]   Yeah, in fact, I the first bill I got from one emergency room is 9000. And
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:56.240]   then I refresh the page like two days later, and it was down to 5000. And I
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:01.080]   was like, Oh, how did that like, I just somehow that $4,000 disappeared. And
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:05.080]   it was because I guess the Cigna negotiated price that I had was much
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.520]   lower than the original price the hospital charged.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:12.680]   That's exactly how it works. And so you saw that in real time in real life with
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:18.760]   yourself. But it just goes to show the charges are not the charges. The price
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:23.920]   is not the price. And when you know that in advance, as a consumer, you can
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.880]   have confidence knowing I can ask for a better deal, I can ask for a price
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:33.520]   reduction. And by the way, if you ask them, why are the prices this high?
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:39.120]   They can't explain to you why the prices are high to begin with. So a
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:44.800]   third principle that could be applied to the overall kind of broad way we look
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:50.840]   at healthcare is stop assuming any of this makes sense. It doesn't make sense.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:55.840]   We assume there's a level of competence and rationale behind things like
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.120]   healthcare pricing in the United States. There's not that would be the wrong
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:05.640]   assumption. There are so many errors in medical bills. And by errors, I mean
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:10.960]   charges for things that did not occur. So you have to look at an itemized
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:15.800]   medical bill when you go to a hospital, you have to see what are all the
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:21.200]   individual items that they charged me for and how did those add up to my total
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:25.960]   bill. Often when you look at those itemized charges, you'll find things in
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:31.200]   those itemized charges that did not actually happen. So it's really easy in
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:36.920]   that case, to go to the facility and say, hey, billing manager or billing
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:41.900]   department, I'm looking at this itemized bill. And I'm seeing that these
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:45.600]   different things that you charged me for, I did not actually receive the
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:49.920]   services. So you need to remove these from my bill. It's incredible how
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:54.840]   common that is. In fact, if you talk to experts who review medical bills for a
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:58.880]   living, they will tell you that most of them contain some type of an error or
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.840]   an overcharge.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:03.000]   Yeah, I'm looking right now. I had a case of shingles, but I didn't know it
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:03.640]   at the time.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.720]   I'm so sorry to hear that. By the way, that is a pain.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:10.160]   Yeah, so I didn't know it at the time. I went to the emergency room one night
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:14.560]   because it was just the worst pain I could imagine. And they couldn't figure
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.760]   out what it was. They ran the blood tests, the urinalysis, couldn't figure
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:22.000]   it out, sent me home, said take some ibuprofen. And the next night, it was
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.120]   even worse. And so I was like, I don't know what to do. So I had gone to one
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:29.880]   Sutter Health Hospital the first night. I said, I don't know what to do. But so
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.600]   I drove to Stanford, a different hospital. So two things I noticed. So
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.200]   this was an interesting experiment for me, because I went for the exact same
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.960]   circumstance to a different hospital within two days, two days of each other
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:45.600]   one day of each other. And I got a bill and I they did most of the same work.
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.280]   And so a couple things that I noticed that I'm curious to get your take on
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:54.120]   because these could be a great examples for people. So one was, when I went to
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:58.600]   one hospital, it was labeled emergency room visit high severity. And in the
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:03.480]   next hospital, it was emergency room visit moderate severity. And based on
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.600]   what I could tell, they charge different amounts based on how severe the
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:11.200]   circumstances is that something I could call and say, this wasn't actually high
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:16.000]   severity, right? I you didn't see me for three hours. Clearly, this was not a
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.240]   gunshot wound. Can we get this drop to medium or low severity?
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:28.160]   I love this case study. I love that you have this a B comparison in real time.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:33.400]   Same patient, same ailment, two different facilities, you are
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:39.640]   perfectly illustrating all of the absurdity or some of the absurdity in
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:43.320]   our healthcare system. So let's dig into this a little bit. When you go to the
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:47.760]   emergency room, or when you go to a doctor visit, they have five different
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:54.080]   levels of severity that they code for the visit, one being the least complex
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:58.920]   and the simplest type of a case, five being the most complex type of a case,
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:05.560]   and then 12345 in between. So when they code it as a severe case, they are
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:10.800]   getting a much higher reimbursement for the service that they provide. But they
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.960]   aren't allowed to just put whatever number they want on the case. They can't
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:19.760]   just be like, well, it seemed serious to me. So I called it a level five. There
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:26.000]   are actual criteria that are used to assign these codes. And so this is why I
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.800]   encourage people when you get your itemized medical bill, get the billing
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:35.440]   codes. Make sure that you have, it's usually a five-digit CPT code. It's
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:39.880]   called Common Procedural Terminology. I know this is getting a little wonky
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:45.000]   here, but this is going to help you a lot, okay? So get the CPT codes. And if you
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.320]   don't get them from your hospital, your insurance plan will have that
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:52.040]   information. Just call the customer service number on your insurance plan
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:57.520]   and say, hey, I had a question about this particular visit. I went to Sutter Health.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:01.920]   I went to Stanford on this date. Can you please just tell me what the different
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:06.920]   billing codes are for each of the charges? Take that five-digit code, Google
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:13.040]   it, and read the description of what the code describes. And it'll tell you what
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:17.880]   it describes and what the requirements are for them to bill that level of a
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:24.440]   code. A level three, four, or five billing code requires medical decision-making of
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:29.160]   some level of complexity. So in other words, if you have a little slice on your
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:33.200]   finger, it's not a complicated thing to determine what do we need to do with
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:38.300]   this slice on the finger. The decision is to put in some stitches. So it requires
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:43.320]   medical decision-making of complexity, moderate or extreme complexity, depending
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:49.880]   on the code. It requires an examination. If you have a level three, level four,
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:55.080]   level five, that requires actually an extensive examination of the patient. It
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:59.200]   also requires an extensive problem-focused history to be taken of
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.760]   the patient. So if you went to the doctor and they didn't do a thorough
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:07.440]   examination on you, they didn't take a complete history on you, and there wasn't
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:11.960]   medical decision-making of any type of complexity, they should not be billing a
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:17.120]   level three, four, or five office visit or emergency room visit.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:21.560]   Yeah, yeah. And I'll say one thing I was actually really impressed by was I
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:26.280]   logged into the Cigna website, and I could get details and download the kind
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:30.480]   of EOB explanation of benefits. And then I separately logged into both Stanford
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:35.080]   and Sutter's kind of My Health portal and got similar data. As much as I found
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:39.560]   some of the data to be crazy, I was at least pleasantly surprised with how much
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:40.600]   access I had.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:44.520]   That's awesome. And the information is right there for us. But we do have to
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:50.080]   take that active, engaged step to look at it. And if they're not providing it to
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:54.040]   you transparently, then you need to ask them to provide it. But it's your right
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.840]   as a patient to have this information.
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:01.320]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and the cracks
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:05.680]   start to emerge. Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week, and you
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:10.360]   have too many manual processes, and there's no one source of truth. If this
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:17.680]   is you, you should know these three numbers. 37,000, 25, 1. 37,000. That's
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:21.120]   the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle, and I'm

[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:29.920]   So I am quite comfortable right now, which is actually true almost every day,
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.160]   and that's thanks to Viore, and I'm excited to be partnering with them for
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:37.240]   this episode. They make performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:41.080]   Everything is designed to work out in, but it doesn't look or feel like it at
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:45.120]   all. And it's so freaking comfortable, you will want to wear it all the time.
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:48.520]   Seriously, I am pretty sure it's more comfortable than whatever you're wearing
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:51.840]   right now, unless you're wearing Viore, in which case you already know what I
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:57.160]   mean. And it's not just for men. My wife is as obsessed with Viore as I am. My
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:01.240]   favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers. I think I have three pairs, and

[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:49.680]   more tip that I'll share that I just recently learned was, I have an iPhone
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:55.080]   and I logged into the health app. And I was able to go in and log into a handful
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:33:00.080]   of medical institutions I've been at. This includes Stanford, Sutter, LabCorp,
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:05.800]   and UCSF, and all of the visits I've had have all been imported. So now I can go
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:09.920]   in and say, "Gosh, how is my blood pressure tracked over the last X months?"
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:14.160]   And I see it from every single visit I've been to. So I don't know if Android
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.600]   has the same thing. But, you know, I'd encourage you if you're on an iPhone to
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:21.120]   see if your medical organizations support this, because it was a really
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.280]   fascinating way for me to get easy access to my own data.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:28.600]   That's really amazing. And we're going to see more and more of that as time
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:32.360]   goes on. Technology is getting more integrated with healthcare. And that's
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.600]   going to give us a lot more opportunity to be engaged.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:38.320]   One other thing I noticed looking at this, and I'm looking at right now. So
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:43.720]   one hospital did a comprehensive metabolic panel that was $145. And the
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:47.240]   other hospital did a comprehensive metabolic panel, same exact code for
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:53.760]   $995. Is that is that something normal? Is that kind of crazy discrepancy for
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:58.480]   the same codes? Something that people should expect to see? And is there any
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:01.960]   obligation for people to charge a fair price?
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:09.400]   There is no obligation for them to charge you a fair price. So you are
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:16.080]   identifying right here with an excellent case study, the absurd amount of price
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:22.280]   variation. Now, let's pretend that you were paying all this out of pocket. So
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:26.360]   if you went to the one facility that charged you $900, you would be
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:30.240]   obligated to pay that amount of money. And for many of our policymakers, many
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:34.560]   of our decision makers in healthcare, they have the money to just pay the
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:38.120]   overcharges, they have the money to pay the high premiums and the high
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:41.840]   deductibles. And so for them, their time is worth more than their money. And
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.600]   it's such a hassle to figure this stuff out. They just pay the bills. What they
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:51.120]   do is they ignore the massive amount of the American population, the majority
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:56.800]   actually, that cannot afford to pay a $900 bill. The Federal Reserve did a
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:00.360]   study of the amount of money people have in their savings accounts, and they
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:05.400]   found that 40% of Americans do not have more than $400 in their savings account
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:10.480]   at any given time, the median American family of four makes about $70,000 a
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:17.160]   year. So for those families, they are being put into debt and into bankruptcy
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:21.800]   by these medical bills. And so I always encourage people like maybe you or like
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:26.000]   myself who can afford to pay a higher medical bill, when you stand up for
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.280]   yourself, and when you push back against these absurd medical bills,
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:34.840]   unjustified medical bills, you are not just standing up for yourself, you are
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:39.520]   also standing up for this entire population of Americans who might not be
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:43.400]   able to stand up for themselves. They might not have the resources to push
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:48.240]   back, they might not have the education or the knowledge to push back. And so I
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:53.560]   believe that we who have more need to see this as a justice issue where we can
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:58.840]   stand up for the people who are getting hit with these outrageous charges, and
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:02.680]   they're unable to afford them. Think about it this way. It's a basic
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:08.480]   metabolic panel. This is an extremely common blood test. So you you just named
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:13.600]   two name brand facilities Sutter and Stanford. Okay. You're telling me that
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:17.520]   one of them is not able to do it at the same price as the other one?
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:22.600]   Yeah, it blows my mind. It blows my mind. So okay, so this is really
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:26.680]   interesting. And I'll caveat that I know myself, and I think I know a lot of our
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:29.880]   listeners pretty well, any one of us might be able to pay this bill, I can
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:34.720]   promise you, especially for myself, I have no interest in paying ones even one
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:38.680]   cent that I can afford if I don't have to love it. So you know, we talked a
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:43.080]   little bit about how to search for the prices in advance. A lot of times we
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.880]   make the mistake or we don't ask or you're in the emergency room, I probably
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.600]   could have paused and said, Hey, before you draw my blood, how much are you
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:52.800]   going to charge me for this metabolic panel. But a lot of times all this
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:57.520]   happens after so you get a bill in the mail. And even if you have an insurance
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:04.480]   plan that is good, oftentimes you might have 10 2030% coinsurance. So that $900
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:10.760]   metabolic panel might not cost me $900. But it might cost me $300. And maybe it
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:17.320]   could cost me $100 or a lot less. So I'm curious if or even $30 I guess it could
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:23.120]   be the difference between these two bills is probably $45 and $300. So what
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:26.840]   do we do when we get those bills and want to push back and I'll throw one
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:32.200]   other egregious example I got was when I broke my foot, they left me with a
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:36.400]   walking boot. And that walking boot I found to be not the best walking boot.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.880]   So I went on Amazon, I found what I thought was the best walking boot and it
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:44.720]   was like $52. And then I get the bill in the mail from Pacific Medical Inc.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:49.240]   Sorry, guys, I'm throwing you under the bus. They deserve a solar air walker.
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:56.240]   And the price was $335 a marginal product that, you know, was not good
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:01.160]   that I replaced with an excellent $50 product cost 335. But it's too late. I
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:04.880]   already have this boot, I'd washed it, I've worn it. What do we do when we get
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:09.920]   these egregious bills, even if we only have to pay 10 2030% of them? How do we
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.480]   what do we do after the fact?
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:16.040]   You're beginning to make my blood boil here, Chris. I love it. I love it.
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:21.160]   Because it gets me fired up because it's affecting all of us. It's affecting all
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:26.720]   of us. We are all afflicted in the United States by this ridiculous
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:31.080]   healthcare pricing. And you're just citing examples yourself from your real
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:36.240]   life in the past year. But this is happening to all of us all the time. And
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:41.960]   we have got to push back on it. So let's talk about how to push back. Okay. I
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:46.320]   have a whole chapter in my book about how to sue in small claims court, when
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:50.200]   you have been price gouged, or when you have been charged for something that's
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:56.720]   erroneous. And I believe that this is a game changing tactic that does work. I
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:01.000]   documented lots of cases where it's worked. And I am now helping a lot of
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.680]   patients with these problems right now. So our small claims court system exists
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:13.440]   to protect individual consumers from unfair transactions by big corporations
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:17.600]   or other more powerful individuals. And it's a it evens the playing field
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:21.840]   because right now what would happen is this, you call the hospital, the billing
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:26.080]   department and you say, hey, you guys just charge me or this company, the
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:31.360]   device company, you guys charged me $300 for a boot that was a piece of junk. I
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:37.400]   got a much better boot on Amazon for $50. That's no good. So I would first
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:41.680]   start with trying to negotiate a better price on that bill. Now they would
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:45.680]   probably tell you this is the price that your insurance plan has agreed to pay us
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:49.640]   for this. So you are contractually obligated to pay it. And if you called
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:54.360]   your insurance plan, they would review it. And they would say, yes, this bill
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:59.920]   was paid in accordance with your plan. In other words, we have an agreement to
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:05.000]   overpay them for this piece of crap medical boot. So you as the consumer,
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.640]   they'll just look at you and shrug. And they go, that's the price that your
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:12.200]   insurance plan agreed to pay. And that's the plan that your employer picked for
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:18.560]   you. And so therefore, you get sent the bill. I don't believe that is a fair
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:23.920]   way that working Americans have been treated. I believe that we have a
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:28.520]   three-party transaction here, or even a four-party transaction. We have the
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:33.160]   device company, we have the insurance plan, we have the employer, and we have
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:38.680]   the employee, you, in this case, who is the patient. How is it fair that the
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:44.240]   device maker and the insurance plan come up with a price, and then they just
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:49.320]   tell the employer and the employee to pay it? That makes no sense. That's not
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:54.000]   fair. It's something that we have tolerated for too long. And now we have
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.200]   got to push back and contest. So you start by saying, I just found this
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:04.080]   product on Amazon that's better than the product you gave me for $50. I will pay
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:09.600]   you $50. How do you feel about that? If you get stoned, well, does that work? I
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:14.560]   do. Yes, it does work. It often works. So it depends on how much noise you want
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:19.400]   to make. So you know how it is, the squeaky wheel gets the oil, gets the
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:24.560]   grease, right? So you may have to complain to higher-ups in the facility.
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:28.800]   You may have to complain to higher-ups at your employer. You may have to
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:32.840]   complain to higher-ups at the insurance division. You may need to file
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:37.880]   complaints to the insurance division or the health division that oversees the
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:42.520]   hospital or the facility. You might have to make some waves. And it depends on
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:46.960]   how much it matters to you. So for a $300 bill, you might be like, look, this
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:51.360]   is not worth it. I'm just going to pay the bill. You don't know me that well.
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:56.920]   Just the idea of paying six times, even if it was $5, I feel like the
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:01.560]   experience of fighting back might be worth it. I think it's very worth it.
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.320]   And this is what I would encourage you to do. And I'd be happy to help you do
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:09.600]   this. Start with just a polite call to the billing department and see how they
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:14.200]   respond. Start by calling your health insurance company and see how they
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:18.720]   respond. My prediction is that both of them are going to basically blow you
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:23.760]   off. They'll say this is what the plan has set as the price. And so therefore
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:29.520]   you have to pay. This was adjudicated according to the terms of the plan. So
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:33.960]   they'll basically say so the bill is the bill. So then your next step then is
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:38.880]   to escalate it and say, I want a reduction on this. You have overcharged
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:43.040]   me and it's not OK. And so you do need to become confrontational at that point.
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:46.040]   And this is where a lot of people don't want to do that. Right. A lot of people
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:50.120]   back away. But if you're the type, which I am, too, where I'm going to say no,
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:54.800]   not now you've got me more interested. Then the next step would be to contest
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:59.320]   it right to that billing department and ask for a supervisor. Always ask for a
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:05.560]   supervisor and go as high as you can up the chain to insist on a reduction in
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:10.480]   the price. Now, I'm continuing to assume that they're going to blow you off. The
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:14.440]   next step would be take the sample letter that I have in my book, which is a
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:19.960]   30 day warning to tell them if you don't correct this within 30 days, I'm going
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:26.800]   to sue you, as is my right in small claims court in my state for overbilling
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:31.200]   me and price gouging me. There is actually a legal precedent that we can
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:35.960]   stand on to undergird ourselves when we take on these legal fights. And it's
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:42.240]   called the open price term. This is part of the Uniform Commercial Code. The UCC
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:47.160]   is the law that governs commercial transactions in the United States. The
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:52.320]   open price term says that as a consumer, if you go for some type of a
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:57.680]   transaction and they don't give you the price upfront, then it is assumed that
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:03.360]   the price that they give you is going to be fair and set in good faith. Now, a
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:09.480]   $300 price for a crummy product is not a price that's fair and it's not a price
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:14.240]   that's set in good faith. So you actually have good legal grounds if your case
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:20.080]   ever goes to court to argue and win a case in small claims court. But think
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:23.960]   about what happens. So you're going to send that 30-day warning notice. And the
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:27.920]   reason you want to do that is because you want to show the judge, if you ever
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:32.160]   go to small claims court, that you did everything you could not to waste the
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:35.680]   time of the court. You don't want to show up in front of a judge having filed a
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:39.800]   frivolous case. So you want to show the judge, "I warned them I was going to sue
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:45.160]   them. I urged them to renegotiate and give me a fair price. They refused to do
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:52.320]   it." Often that 30-day warning letter will create enough waves that it will shake
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:56.280]   them up and get them to give you a negotiated price that's much lower and
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:45:01.160]   that's a fair price. But if they don't, then you follow it up by filing a claim
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:06.280]   in small claims court. And in most states, it's about $30 or $40 to file a
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:10.800]   case. It can be done easily online within minutes. You've already done your
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:14.080]   research because you've gathered all your medical records and your medical
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:18.160]   bills. So you have all the evidence you need. It's not like you have to do more
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:22.920]   work. So you file that case and now think about the problem you've created for
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:28.080]   them. And this is the part I have to admit I feel maybe a little
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:34.000]   devious and antagonistic here, but I love this. Because now you're
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.320]   going to sue them for the difference. You've been told to pay or you've
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:42.600]   paid $300 when it should be $50. So you're going to sue them for $250.
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:48.120]   Now imagine they're going to have to hire an attorney to argue the case
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:51.880]   against you. You don't have to hire an attorney in small claims court. They
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:55.080]   probably will or they're going to represent themselves, which will be a
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:59.760]   total pain for them. It's going to cost them hundreds of dollars an hour to
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:05.480]   defend a case that is only costing and only worth $250 to begin with. So when we
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:09.680]   sue them in small claims court, we give them the incentive they need to do the
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:16.160]   right thing. We give them incentive. Now they have an urgent incentive to call
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:20.160]   you up and say, "Okay, look, we'll take $50." Or, "Okay, well, look, we'll take
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:24.720]   $100." And you say, "Okay, I'm overpaying it $100, but I don't want to go. It's a
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:28.760]   hassle for me to go to small claims court, too. So I'll do it for $100." So
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:34.480]   small claims court is extremely effective. And I would be happy if that
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.960]   were something you decided to do, and I'd be happy to help you with it.
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:40.680]   Yeah. And I think you outlined how to do a lot of these steps in the book. So
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:44.720]   it's not, there's a framework for the flow to follow from what I remember.
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:49.480]   Yeah, it is. I call it the Never Pay Pathway. Again, I'm not saying, when I
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:53.120]   called the book Never Pay the First Bill, I'm certainly not saying don't pay your
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:57.640]   bills. I'm just saying never pay the first bill until you have analyzed it
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:02.120]   and made sure that it's fair, and that it's accurate. And if it's not fair, and
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:05.920]   it's not accurate, then we need to push back and demand a fair treatment.
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:10.240]   Yeah. And one thing that we haven't touched on, which I was just totally
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:14.520]   fascinated by, was I got a lot of bills from the hospital, from this medical
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:20.520]   device company. And I was surprised that at times they would send me a bill
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:25.960]   before the insurance company has even responded. And the bill I got, I looked
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:28.840]   online a couple days later, and I was like, "This bill has already been paid
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:29.800]   by the insurance company."
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:30.120]   Wow.
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:34.760]   And so I could see myself in an alternate world. And I'm thankful that
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.960]   we'd communicated and this was getting scheduled. So I had some ideas of what
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:43.800]   to do. But I got a bill at one point for $500 for some part of this visit. And
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:47.080]   bam, here's where I had to pay it online. Here's how to send in a check.
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:51.800]   But I logged on online, it was already paid. And so is it normal for people to
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:56.440]   get bills that their insurance company will ultimately actually pay, that they
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.640]   might get tricked into thinking they need to pay?
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:04.600]   Yes, I've had the exact same experience myself, where I was sent a bill with
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:11.000]   all the amount due, $250, person responsible, Marshall Allen, date it was
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.600]   due. Well, with that one, I realized they had not even submitted it to my
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:18.760]   insurance company. They had all the insurance information, for whatever
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:23.080]   reason, they did not submit the claim, they just sent me the bill. And so I was
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:27.600]   able to route that back to the insurance plan and get that paid in full. And so
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:33.360]   another principle, another tactic is make sure that your health plan has paid the
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:38.520]   bill and adjudicated it properly before you send in any money. And you check
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:42.200]   that by looking at your insurance companies, it's called an EOB, an
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:47.600]   explanation of benefits. That document will show you what the charges were,
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:51.960]   what the allowed amount was for your insurance plan, how that was all
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:56.080]   processed will be done by the insurance company, and then it'll tell you what
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:59.840]   your amount is that you owe. So it doesn't mean that you're not still going
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:03.680]   to get maybe price gouged. But at least you'll know how it was run through the
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:07.280]   insurance plan. And you can make sure that the insurance paid the amount it's
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.080]   supposed to pay.
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:13.360]   Yeah, my examples are interesting, because they're very relevant to me. But
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:18.000]   are there some examples you have of people who've managed to have huge wins?
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.440]   Yeah, I have a whole chapter in the book on how to fight your insurance company
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:26.800]   when they've denied you the care that you need. And these are often like life
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:31.680]   and death struggles. Certainly it can be your financial life and death. But I
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:37.560]   talked to a woman named Alexia. And I helped her and her husband, after she
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:42.680]   had an elective procedure done that her hospital told her they got cleared by
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:46.000]   the insurance company. So the insurance company would cover it, while the
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:51.640]   insurance company didn't cover it. And so she got stuck with a $78,000 hospital
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:55.960]   bill because of this procedure that didn't get covered. While I walked her
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:50:00.800]   through the tactics in terms of how to fight an insurance company denial, and
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:05.600]   in the end, it took about a year and a half. This was a big battle for her. But
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:09.400]   in the end, her insurance company agreed to cover most of the bill, and then the
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:15.160]   hospital waived the other charges. So her family went from owing $78,000 and
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:20.360]   consulting bankruptcy attorneys, to having owing nothing, having the entire
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:25.320]   bill forgiven. And so that's one tactic. Another, just even the youth pastor at my
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:30.280]   church that I went to in New Jersey, within weeks of reading my book, he
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:35.120]   started pushing back on medical bills and saved $815 just in the first few
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:39.560]   weeks. I've also helped people with small claims court. And one thing I love
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:45.960]   to do is read the reviews on my Amazon page, because I'm seeing people throw in
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:53.240]   examples of saving $1,500 here, getting hospital facility fees waived, all kinds
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:57.320]   of things, where people are pushing back and fighting back and saving tons of
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:57.720]   money.
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:02.560]   Yeah, I'm actually putting these things to use. There were a couple charges that
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:06.680]   they're like, Wow, this one x ray wasn't covered. And, and I planned to fight
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:11.000]   back and see what happened. One of those future reviews might include my outcome
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.800]   as well. One situation, I interviewed someone named Kevin Rose, and we were
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:21.760]   talking about the way people think about cardiovascular disease, and how some
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:25.960]   primary care physicians aren't as up to date on the latest research, which makes
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:29.480]   sense, because they're so busy seeing patients. And one of the things he
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:34.200]   pointed out that right now we look at your HDL and your LDL levels, but
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:37.480]   there's a lot of data out there to support that another marker, which is
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:42.280]   your APO B numbers, which I think it's like your APO lipoprotein B, it might be
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:47.120]   a better indicator of cardiovascular disease. But because the science hasn't
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:50.360]   caught up, oftentimes, those things aren't recommended by doctors are
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:54.560]   covered by insurance. And so in a circumstance where you're reading
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:58.920]   something scientific, that's that has journal data behind it, but insurance
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:03.620]   companies haven't caught up, is there anything you can do? For example, I went
[00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:08.000]   in and asked my doctor, could I get this test, doctor put in the order for it. And
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.120]   then the insurance company ended up denying it and saying actually, this one
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:15.080]   blood test we don't cover that was not a case of it was too expensive, right? The
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:19.240]   charge was it was only maybe 100 and something dollars for the blood test. But
[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:22.560]   there's data to support that it actually might be a better thing than the other
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:23.600]   things I know they cover.
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:27.360]   So in that case, they probably were denying it because they were classifying
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:33.120]   it as experimental. And experimental is a category they put things in that they
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:37.000]   just haven't decided to cover yet. That does not mean it's experimental. And it
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.680]   does not mean that it doesn't work. This goes back to that chapter in the book
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:45.160]   about how to appeal insurance company denials. And I actually have some
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:50.300]   examples. I have an example in the book, where I dig deep on the way to fight
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:56.260]   these appeals. And when is first of all argue with evidence, not emotion. A lot
[00:52:56.260 --> 00:53:00.460]   of times when you get denied some type of care, you try and argue, but I really
[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:03.740]   need this or the patient is going to get really sick without it. Or this
[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:07.060]   patient's a young mom with three kids. And if she doesn't get the care she
[00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:09.980]   needs, she's going to die and the children will be left without a mom.
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:13.980]   Those are all true. You want to have an emotional component to your argument if
[00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:18.380]   it's there. But you have to argue with evidence. And so in a case like yours, I
[00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:23.580]   have some memos on my website, my website is MarshallAllen.com. And you
[00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:26.860]   can follow a template. And I actually learned this template from a woman
[00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:31.100]   named Lori Todd, who calls herself the insurance warrior. This woman has fought
[00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:36.020]   hundreds of insurance cases, and won hundreds of them. And the I really take
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:41.420]   my tactics from Lori, but I have some memos on my website that will show you a
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:46.440]   well informed and well reasoned appeal to an insurance company. And one of the
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:52.780]   key things is use that evidence from your studies, you mentioned that there
[00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:56.580]   are studies that show that this particular test is valuable for
[00:53:56.580 --> 00:54:01.540]   identifying this type of heart disease. cite those, you'll see when you look at
[00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:06.180]   the memos on my website, they're pages long. And so you want to actually cite
[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:10.220]   the citations. The other thing you want to look at is your insurance plan. It's
[00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:14.780]   called the summary plan document. This is the document that's actually a legal
[00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:20.220]   contract between you as the member and the insurance company that lays out the
[00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:24.600]   insurance companies, companies contractual obligation to cover the care
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:29.140]   that you need. Now, a lot of times in that summary plan document, again, it's a
[00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:33.300]   contract. So you don't want to argue with emotion, think about it like you're
[00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:37.740]   negotiating a contract or fighting over the terms of a contract, they're going
[00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:41.740]   to have a thing in the contract that says that your doctor's medical
[00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:45.860]   decision making gets respected, not the insurance company's medical decision
[00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:50.900]   making. So if your doctor orders the test and recommends it for you, you might be
[00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:55.140]   able to argue from that summary plan document that your doctor has determined
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:58.900]   that you need this test, that it's medically necessary, that there are
[00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:03.860]   studies that show that this study that this test you want to do is credible. And
[00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:08.780]   so you need to then make that appeal and in an informed way, almost more like a
[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:11.900]   legal argument to that insurance company to get them to cover it.
[00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:16.420]   Yeah, this comes back to something that that Kevin mentioned, which was, when
[00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:19.900]   you're looking for that primary care physician that you're working with, it's
[00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:23.940]   important to find someone that aligns with what you're looking for. So instead
[00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:27.220]   of finding someone who's willing to put in the order for the test you want, find
[00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:31.020]   someone who actually believes in the research that you're interested in, and
[00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:35.460]   would back you up in that argument. And so I come back to what you said earlier,
[00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:38.820]   very earlier in this conversation, you said, it's really important to get the
[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:40.620]   best care and the lowest price.
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:45.680]   I wish I could say that I'm eating a fully balanced diet every day. But the
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:50.740]   reality is that I am definitely not. So I love having an easy way to get my daily
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:54.980]   nutritional insurance, which is why I kickstart my day with Athletic Greens,
[00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:59.020]   and I am excited to be partnering with them for this episode. I started taking
[00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:02.460]   it because I wanted to see what all the hype was about. And I've kept it in my
[00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:07.180]   daily routine for months. Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water, add a
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:11.460]   few ice cubes, it tastes so good when it's cold. And I head to my office
[00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:15.620]   feeling focused and energized for the day, which is a feeling I absolutely
[00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:20.420]   love. I also love that it's made from 75 high quality vitamins, minerals and
[00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:25.580]   superfoods, and contains less than one gram of sugar. It also has no GMOs,
[00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:30.500]   nasty chemicals or artificial anything. To make giving it a try easy, Athletic
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:34.820]   Greens is going to give you a free one year supply of immune supporting vitamin
[00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:39.980]   D and five free travel packs with your first purchase. All you have to do is
[00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:47.180]   visit all the hacks.com/athletic greens. Again, that's all the hacks.com/athletic
[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:51.540]   greens to take ownership over your health and pick up the ultimate daily
[00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:56.900]   nutritional insurance. There is nothing I love more than learning that something
[00:56:56.900 --> 00:57:01.580]   I enjoy is actually so good for you. And nothing showcases that better than Puerh
[00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:05.900]   tea. It has so many health benefits. And I think one of the best and easiest ways
[00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:11.020]   to consume it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea. Peak's Puerh teas are all cold
[00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:16.900]   extracted using only wild harvested leaves from 250 year old tea trees, rich
[00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:22.140]   in minerals, theraflavins and catechins. Then everything is triple toxin screened
[00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:27.340]   for pesticides, heavy minerals and toxic mold commonly found in plants. And Peak's
[00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:31.700]   products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in pre measured
[00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:36.540]   quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds and are so travel
[00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:40.900]   friendly. They have so many products but lately I've been alternating between the
[00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:45.460]   green Puerh for mental clarity and energy and the black Puerh which helps
[00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:50.500]   kickstart digestion and metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so good and
[00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:54.340]   probably one of my favorite things to drink. And if you need another reason
[00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:57.500]   search for all the amazing research-backed benefits of polyphenols
[00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:01.660]   for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar and more and then be happy that
[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:05.540]   Puerh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all other teas in the
[00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:09.460]   world. But you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak
[00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:14.140]   offers free US shipping, free returns and a money-backed guarantee. And for a

[00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:55.420]   have advice for people on how to find the best care? Whether that's finding the
[00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:59.700]   right facilities, picking where to go, finding the best doctors, are there
[00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:05.460]   criteria you use to try to identify where to get the best care? First of all
[00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:09.660]   the answer is it's very difficult and it depends. It depends on the type of care
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:13.780]   you need but let's just throw out some examples. One of the key indicators of
[00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:19.740]   quality is volume. You want to know how often has this particular doctor or
[00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:25.500]   other clinician done the exact thing that you need to have done. So let's go
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:30.980]   back to the colonoscopy example. If you want to find a doctor who does a really
[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:36.260]   good colonoscopy, you want a doctor who's done enough colonoscopies to be skilled
[00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:40.100]   at it. You don't want to go to a doctor and find out that you're the first one
[00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:44.660]   that they've done but that's exactly how they learn, right? They learn by doing
[00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:48.180]   these procedures on patients. I understand that they have to learn that
[00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:54.420]   way. I just don't want to be the first one doing the procedure on. So ask the
[00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:59.180]   doctor how many times they have done this exact thing that you need. Not
[00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:04.980]   something similar but the exact one. Then ask them what their outcomes are. By
[01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:09.900]   outcomes, how well do the patients fare after the procedure? Do they suffer
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:15.300]   infections? Do they suffer internal bleeding? Do they suffer injuries? It's
[01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:19.780]   going to depend. The complications and the recovery is going to depend a lot on
[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:23.340]   the type of care that you're needing. So that's going to vary a lot. Is there a
[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:27.620]   place to benchmark whatever results you get? No. This is the problem. There's not.
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:32.260]   And this is what's extremely frustrating. Extremely frustrating about our health
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:36.540]   care system. There is no publicly available data that I would say is
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:42.180]   reliable to tell you that one doctor or one hospital is better than another. In
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:46.660]   fact, we spent years digging into this at ProPublica and you can Google our
[01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:53.180]   Surgeon Scorecard Project and we did an analysis of Medicare data looking at
[01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:57.140]   common elective operations like knee replacements and hip replacements and
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:02.260]   other types of procedures. And we identified looking at this data common
[01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:06.940]   complications related to these procedures. And we published risk
[01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:12.140]   adjusted complication rates for about 15,000 surgeons all over the country in
[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:16.300]   a searchable format. Now the data is dated. It hasn't been updated. So I
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:21.300]   wouldn't recommend going there right now and looking for current information. But
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:26.180]   we did this at ProPublica as a team of journalists because no one else was
[01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:30.380]   doing this for the public. And what we found was really astounding for
[01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:35.340]   complications readmissions because of complications like bleeds or infections
[01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:41.020]   or other injuries related to the procedure. Some doctors had exponentially
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:45.740]   higher complication rates compared to others in the exact same hospital. So
[01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:51.060]   again, another principle I'd look at is hospital quality can't be judged by the
[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:56.700]   hospital. It really does come down to the individual clinician who's performing the
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:02:00.580]   procedure that you need. You need to make sure not that the hospital has done a
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:05.300]   lot of cases. Make sure that your particular doctor or surgeon or
[01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:10.660]   clinician has done a lot of those cases. And then when you ask about outcomes, if
[01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:16.020]   they are even tracking their outcomes and can give you an informed answer, that
[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:22.380]   is a plus. That's a mark in their favor because many doctors will not even be
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:26.180]   able to tell you what their outcomes are. They'll be vague. They'll say, "Oh no, my
[01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:30.500]   patients do great." Or, "Oh, the complication rates are actually quite low for these
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:33.780]   procedures." But they'll talk generally like the national or published
[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:39.780]   complication rates. I want to know what your complications are, doctor. And so you
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:44.020]   need to ask them specifically. And if they can answer that for you, that's a
[01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:48.460]   plus because most of the time, our healthcare system is like a giant
[01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:53.180]   assembly line with no quality control in place. So they're not checking the
[01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:57.780]   outcomes of patients six months down the road or a year down the road or two
[01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:01.900]   years down the road. So if your doctor can even give you an informed answer,
[01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:07.420]   that's really a positive. And I would recommend pursuing that doctor as
[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:12.100]   opposed to others. Yeah. One other thing I want to touch on is avoiding care. One
[01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:16.300]   of the things that I read in your book is that there are a lot of doctors that
[01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:20.620]   propose medical procedures or medical tests that you might not need. And I'd
[01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:24.220]   love you to touch a little bit on how you can save money just by asking the
[01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:28.420]   right questions. I'm glad you brought that up because sometimes we get the
[01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:32.700]   idea that fighting back is like a real confrontational thing. Or like, "I'm gonna
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:36.380]   contest this medical bill." Or, "I'm gonna sue them in small claims court if
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:40.300]   they're overcharging me." One of the easiest things we can do that can save
[01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:45.620]   us the most money and the most risk of harm, avoiding medical care you don't
[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:50.320]   need. They estimate when they study the health care that's provided that as much
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:55.660]   as 25% of the health care that gets provided is not actually necessary. And
[01:03:55.660 --> 01:04:00.540]   this is things like having you do some type of an imaging test that you don't
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:04.340]   actually need or putting you on a drug that you don't need. Or if you look at
[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:09.260]   the studies about back surgery, it's really common that back surgery gets
[01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:13.300]   done on patients who would have done a lot better with physical therapy or
[01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:18.740]   chiropractic instead of an invasive operation. So I think that the best
[01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:23.060]   question to ask your doctor to make sure you don't get care that you don't need
[01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:29.100]   is, "What happens if we wait?" So let's say your doctor is offering you some type of
[01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:36.140]   discretionary test or procedure or drug. If you ask, "Doctor, what happens if we
[01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:42.220]   don't do this right now and just wait and see or try something else?" it causes
[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:45.900]   the clinician to reframe the conversation. So all of a sudden they're
[01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:49.460]   not talking about the risk of doing the procedure, they're talking about the risk
[01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:54.300]   of not doing the procedure or the test or the blood work. Because every single
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:59.100]   one of these tests comes with a risk. Every procedure comes with a risk.
[01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:04.580]   There's no such thing as a low-risk elective operation, for example. I have
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:08.080]   talked to families who have had their children die because of low-risk
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:13.220]   elective operations that went wrong. And so I encourage people, ask what happens
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:17.540]   if we wait, see if waiting might be an option, see if there might be something
[01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:22.860]   less invasive that could be done or less expensive that could be done to see if
[01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:26.700]   these problems can resolve themselves in different ways. And I think that will
[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:29.460]   protect people from a lot of care that they don't need.
[01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:34.300]   Yeah, I've seen a couple doctors for something called a neuroma, which is like
[01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:41.020]   an enlarged nerve in my foot. And one doctor, their path was, "Let's try these
[01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:44.220]   cortisone injections and then surgery." And this other doctor was like, "Actually, I
[01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:48.060]   have a pharmacist that makes this compound that helps reduce the swelling
[01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:53.620]   of nerves." And it totally worked. And on my right foot, the result was, about five
[01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:57.540]   years ago, I had surgery because one thing didn't work. And on my left foot, it
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:03.060]   flared up recently. And a $70 - it wasn't covered by insurance - but a $70 compound
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:08.100]   that was effectively like a lotion. It had the same effect in terms of no pain
[01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:14.060]   as a surgery, which was wild. So I think sometimes it's searching online to read
[01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:18.060]   about these things. Sometimes it might be seeing a few doctors. But if ever the
[01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:22.540]   result is the only thing left is surgery, I would say maybe get a second opinion.
[01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:26.500]   Second opinions are also essential, right? Especially if it's something
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:31.540]   that's more invasive or expensive, make sure that you really need it. And most
[01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:36.220]   care that we get is actually not emergency care. And so usually, you do
[01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:40.580]   have the time to take to do a little more research, to get a second opinion,
[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:44.820]   just to make sure that what's being presented to you is absolutely necessary.
[01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:48.780]   Yeah, that makes sense. So one thing we didn't touch on that I want to jump into
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:53.180]   is for someone who works at an employer. We could start with employer, but also,
[01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:56.620]   you know, I have a podcast. Maybe one day it's a full-time business and I'm
[01:06:56.620 --> 01:07:02.300]   looking on the exchange. How do you save money but also pick the right health
[01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:06.220]   care plan? There's a lot of options nowadays. Many employers, mine included,
[01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:11.820]   offer, you know, PPOs, EPOs, HMOs, high deductible health plans. How do you help
[01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:13.420]   people think about those decisions?
[01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:19.020]   Well, it's really a hard answer to give in a general way because everyone's
[01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:25.220]   situation is so specific. So some people have kids. Some people have health
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:30.900]   problems or ongoing health concerns. Some people are very low risk and willing
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:35.860]   to take more risk themselves. So it's a hard question to answer generally. But
[01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:39.580]   let me just give you a few things since we're talking about hacking the health
[01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:45.340]   care system that people can try. If you are a healthy person and your family is
[01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:50.260]   relatively healthy, you might not need the complete amount of coverage that's
[01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:54.580]   going to come with the highest premium and lowest deductible. You might say,
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:08:00.380]   look, I can take more risk and it's a trade-off because you're going to save
[01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:05.060]   on your premium and you're going to maybe take the risk of paying more out
[01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:08.940]   of pocket down the road. But a high deductible plan might make a lot of
[01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:13.860]   sense for you. If you're on the individual market, you might benefit by
[01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:17.700]   going with something more like a health sharing plan. There's these different
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:22.300]   health sharing plans. Some of them are faith-based. Some of them are not where
[01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:26.700]   it's not actually insurance. So this is the risk you're taking. It's not an
[01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:31.060]   insurance product. It's an agreement that people have made to pay one another's
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:36.500]   medical bills. The premiums on those health sharing plans are much, much lower
[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:41.620]   for a family or for an individual than your premiums would be on the health
[01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:46.700]   insurance market. And you might want to pair that with a direct primary care
[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:51.180]   relationship. So direct primary care are doctors, and this is becoming more
[01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:56.020]   popular, who are taking payment directly from the patient, say it's a hundred
[01:08:56.020 --> 01:09:00.020]   dollars a month or two hundred dollars a month, for all the care that you need.
[01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:03.940]   It's much more specialized in terms of the care that you
[01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:08.780]   need. And they're catering to you more like they're paying customers so that
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:12.100]   you're going to get much more of their time and much more of their attention. So
[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:16.300]   you might find, if you're looking at the individual market, that going on a health
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:21.220]   sharing plan and a direct primary care relationship with a doctor is going to
[01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:25.980]   get you better care at a much lower price. It's just that there's more risk
[01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:30.900]   involved. So it's really hard to answer these questions in a way that's going to
[01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:35.740]   satisfy everybody because everybody has different needs and have different
[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:39.820]   tolerance for risk. Yeah, a couple of things that I found going through this
[01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:44.300]   search process. So I'm very intrigued by, not in the individual market, working
[01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:47.780]   with an employer plan, but these cost-sharing programs are super
[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:51.460]   interesting. And I assume that if it's individuals agreeing to pay bills, that
[01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:54.820]   you actually probably are eligible for whatever the cash price is and you're
[01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:58.980]   not dealing with insurance negotiated prices. Is that right? Right. Yeah. And
[01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:02.540]   it's going to have more friction when you go to the doctor. Your doctor might
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:06.380]   be like, "What? Health sharing plan? What are you talking about?" There might be
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:09.740]   more friction on that end. You might have to pay more of the money upfront and
[01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:14.700]   then get it reimbursed. So the hassle factor might be greater. But think about
[01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:19.740]   it this way. I mean, your premiums could easily be $2,000 a month for a family.
[01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:26.660]   And you might be saving $1,000 or more per month on your premiums. And so look
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:33.020]   at it as paying yourself a salary of $1,000 a month by saying, "I'm going to
[01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:37.500]   engage with the health care system in a different way." And actually there's a lot
[01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:42.460]   of growth in these plans, in these health sharing plans and with direct primary
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:46.900]   care, because actually people are quite satisfied with them. Some of them are
[01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:50.780]   scams. So again, you have to do your research. Make sure you're not getting
[01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:55.780]   ripped off. Check your reviews. Get references to actual patients who have
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:59.820]   used these plans and make sure you understand what you're getting into. But
[01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:02.980]   I have found I have several friends who are on these plans and they've had good
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:07.060]   experiences with them. Yeah, that's so fascinating. In years that I've considered
[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:11.540]   a high-deductible health plan, I think pairing it with an HSA is amazing
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:16.500]   because you can put pre-tax money in, you can take it out, it can grow. Oftentimes
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:19.620]   your employer will contribute to it. I think Google has one of the most
[01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:24.660]   interesting high-deductible health plans for employees because they give you
[01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:29.540]   enough money that you effectively meet your deductible for the high-deductible
[01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:33.020]   health plan. So you get the low premium, but the risk is taken away because
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:35.900]   they're giving you this money and they're giving it to you in an HSA, which
[01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:40.260]   you don't have to use this year. You can use it forever. Yeah, so I love the HSA
[01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:44.620]   compared to the FSA, the flexible spending account, where it's use it or
[01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:49.460]   lose it. I really get frustrated with the use it or lose it idea with health care
[01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:53.060]   dollars because what you end up having happen if you haven't spent your
[01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:57.540]   flexible spending account money is you're like trying to find, "Okay, what can
[01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:02.580]   I spend in the month of December to get rid of this money?" And it's just really, I
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:07.340]   don't like the FSAs, but I agree with you. Those HSAs are good. And my book has
[01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:11.220]   actually three chapters in it for employers, and I'm hoping that employers
[01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:16.260]   will get more engaged with this because if employers can work together with
[01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:22.220]   their employees to design better benefit plans, they could save hundreds or
[01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:26.140]   thousands of dollars for every health care encounter for their employees, and
[01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:30.500]   then the employer saves exponentially more than that. So the incentives really
[01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:34.980]   are aligned for employees and employers to work together to tackle this problem,
[01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:39.940]   and I actually have a much greater hope that they will be able to figure out our
[01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:44.500]   health care reform, and it can be consumer-driven, and it can be driven by
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:49.580]   the market instead of being driven by something like government regulation or
[01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:53.900]   politicians. We haven't seen our politicians on either side of the aisle
[01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:58.180]   put real solutions in place that are helping the public, and so I just don't
[01:12:58.180 --> 01:13:02.220]   trust that's going to happen. So I think the employers and the working Americans
[01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:04.140]   are really our greatest hope.
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:07.980]   Yeah, yeah. One quick fun thing on FSAs,
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:11.340]   something to consider at the end of the year if you're running up with some
[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:15.420]   balance that you can't carry over, I think you can carry over about $500 the next
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:18.500]   year, but if you have dollars you can't carry over, there might be things, maybe
[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:22.380]   call a local shelter, see if there are medical products they need, you
[01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:26.380]   might be able to buy them with your FSA dollars before they expire, and donate
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:26.880]   things.
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:28.180]   That's a great suggestion.
[01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:31.380]   Are there any hacks for saving money on prescription drugs?
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:35.380]   Yes, absolutely. I mean, one of the simplest ones is just look up GoodRx.
[01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:40.380]   Your listeners have probably heard of GoodRx.com. It's a coupon system where
[01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:45.680]   they will show you the GoodRx price at different pharmacies in your community.
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:50.180]   That's a great place to look. Also, see if there's a pharmacy that has a
[01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:53.880]   membership plan near you. One that I mentioned is called Good Shepherd
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:58.380]   Pharmacy. It's in Memphis, Tennessee. They have a mail order system where
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:04.180]   they charge $5 for a generic drug per month, which often if you're not on a
[01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:07.880]   plan, or let's say you're on a sharing plan, or uninsured, or self-pay, that
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:11.580]   could be a better deal for you. And then check the prices at different
[01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:17.080]   pharmacies. Consumer Reports has done this. Other studies have done this, where
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:22.080]   if you need a drug, it could be hundreds of dollars more or less just at a
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:25.580]   different pharmacy in your community. So check the prices at different
[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:28.080]   pharmacies, and you'll see that there could be huge variation.
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:31.980]   Is there one that does better? Walgreens, CVS, Costco, that kind of
[01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:33.080]   traditionally is the best?
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:37.580]   I think one study I saw showed that Costco overall had the lowest prices,
[01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:42.080]   but when they compared the GoodRx prices to all the prices, the GoodRx
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:47.080]   prices were usually better. The caveat with GoodRx is that it's great for
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:50.780]   getting an individual medication, but if you're getting that individual
[01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:55.080]   medication at multiple facilities from lots of different pharmacists, then
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:58.880]   you're not going to have one pharmacist that sees all of your medications
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:02.180]   that you're taking. That can be a little more risky because some of these
[01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:07.180]   medications can interact in negative ways with one another. And so GoodRx
[01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:10.880]   is good if you just want the one drug, but you really want to make sure that
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:15.880]   your primary care doctor or somebody knows all the prescriptions you're on,
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:19.180]   so they can make sure you don't have side effects from something that's
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:21.480]   interacting in a bad way with another.
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:24.380]   You've spent a lot of time researching this industry, and it really shows
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:27.680]   I love the book. What's next for you?
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:33.180]   I am actually on a campaign to boost the health care literacy of working
[01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:38.180]   Americans and employers throughout the entire country. And so I have started
[01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:42.880]   a side company that I'm calling Allen Health Academy. And this company
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:48.180]   exists to boost the health literacy so that people understand how to navigate
[01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:52.380]   these financial pitfalls of our health care system. And the first product
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:56.980]   I'm putting out is a series of videos, a video curriculum that I'm calling
[01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:01.480]   the Never Pay Pathway. It's just based on the book. It's taking all of the
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:06.680]   actionable how-to hacks in the book and translating them into a series of
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:10.580]   short three to five minute videos, so people can learn how to get their
[01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:13.780]   medical records, how to get an itemized medical bill, how to look up the
[01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:18.380]   billing codes, how to price it, how to sue in small claims court. Basically
[01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:22.780]   all the things that we've talked about in this podcast and more that will
[01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:27.080]   help people understand the health care system. It'll demystify a lot of the
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:30.980]   health care system. It'll show them how to protect themselves and how to
[01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:34.480]   save a lot of money. And this is something it's actually been supported
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:39.880]   by a really successful crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo. I had supporters
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:45.880]   and backers raise and contribute $55,000 to produce these videos so that
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:49.080]   they're really going to be engaging and interesting. And I'm hoping to
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:53.580]   launch those early next year. And so if people are interested in those, they
[01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:58.580]   can go to my website, MarshallAllen.com and sign up for my newsletter. And
[01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:02.580]   that way you'll be informed when those videos come out. And my goal,
[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:07.480]   honestly, Chris, is to, I want to roll these out to every employer-sponsored
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:12.780]   health plan in America. I want there to be an army of informed health care
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:17.680]   consumers so that they can contest these outrageous medical bills. They
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:24.680]   can push back. I mean, if we had even 1% of the Americans covered by
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:29.680]   employer-sponsored or individual plans or people who are self-pay, there's
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:35.380]   about 190 million Americans in that category. If 1% of those people were
[01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:40.080]   to push back and demand a fair deal, I think that it would no longer be
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:44.180]   profitable for our health care system to prey on us financially the way
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:48.680]   it's been done. If 1% of people demanded the prices up front and made
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:52.980]   sure they were fair prices, it would completely remove the ability of the
[01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:56.780]   health care system to hide the prices from us. And if we sued in small
[01:17:56.780 --> 01:18:00.780]   claims court, when we got one of these like surprise out-of-network bills
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:05.680]   or unjustifiably high medical bills, it would reduce the incentive to
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:09.280]   send us these outrageous medical bills. It would be so expensive for them
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:13.980]   to do it. And so I think that we do have the power to bring about real
[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:19.480]   change in health care, but we need to equip and educate the public and
[01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:24.580]   then show them how to use this leverage to really hack the system so
[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:27.380]   that it benefits them and so that it can benefit all of us.
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:31.380]   Yeah, I hope that the examples I've shared inspire a few people
[01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:35.580]   listening to go back and look at some of the bills you've paid and see
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:38.180]   if there's anything erroneous and see if there are any extreme
[01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:42.680]   overcharging and push back and see what happens. And so I appreciate
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:45.680]   all the feedback you've given, all the tips you've shared, all the
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:49.380]   hacks you've shared, and I hope it inspires people to save more.
[01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:53.580]   Yeah, thank you. And one more thing I want to add, I'm available.
[01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:58.380]   People can message me on my website. They can email me. I do enjoy
[01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:02.080]   helping people with their bills. So if anybody has any questions or
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:06.680]   they feel confused, feel free to reach out. And I talk to people
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:09.780]   almost every day about these issues. It's really become a hobby of
[01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:13.880]   mine, and I really do enjoy it and get a kick out of it. So I'd love
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:14.780]   to hear from anybody.
[01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:17.880]   Awesome. Hopefully people reach out if they need help. And thank you
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:18.780]   so much for being here.
[01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:21.780]   Thank you. I really appreciate the conversation.
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:26.580]   That was amazing. I can tell you that the first thing I'm doing next
[01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:29.880]   is negotiating down the price of that crappy medical booth. But in
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.780]   all seriousness, I wish that none of you ever have to deal with what
[01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:36.280]   Marshall and I discussed. But as I learned this year, it's unfortunately
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:39.780]   likely that you will. So I hope this episode was helpful. If you have
[01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:43.180]   any feedback or questions on this episode, another episode, or you
[01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:47.580]   just want to say hi, I'm chris@allthehacks.com or I'm @hutchins
[01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:51.180]   on Twitter. And to anyone celebrating this week, Merry Christmas
[01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:53.280]   from Mexico. See you all next week.
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:20:05.380]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on
[01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:08.880]   all things money. That means everything from money hacks to wealth
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:12.680]   building to early retirement. It's called the Personal Finance Podcast
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:16.280]   and it's much more about building generational wealth and spending
[01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:19.480]   your money on the things you value than it is about clipping coupons
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:23.280]   to save a dollar. It's hosted by my good friend Andrew who truly
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:26.780]   believes that everyone in this world can build wealth and his passion
[01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:30.780]   and excitement are what make this show so entertaining. I know because
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:35.180]   I was a guest on the show in December 2022, but recently I listened
[01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:38.880]   to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow your
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:43.080]   mind and it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of Millennials
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:46.580]   are not participating in their employer's retirement plan. And that's
[01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:50.380]   just one of the many fascinating stats he shared. The Personal
[01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:53.480]   Finance Podcast has something for everyone. It's filled with so
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:56.480]   many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with your
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:59.680]   money and grow your wealth. So I highly recommend you check it
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:03.580]   out. Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast on Apple Podcasts,
[01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:06.880]   Spotify, or wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
