[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:10.000]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.140]   about upgrading your life, money and travel all while spending
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.440]   less and saving more. I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.040]   have you on my journey to find all the hacks. Now, in a normal
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.840]   year, my experience with our healthcare system just includes
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.740]   a visit to the doctor, maybe some blood work, couple dental
[00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.920]   cleanings. But 2021 was a bit different. Between fracturing my
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.060]   foot on a wedding dance floor and a random case of shingles,
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.940]   I've had three visits to the ER, which came with some interesting
[00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.080]   medical bills. So I am really excited to be talking today with
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.420]   Marshall Allen. For over a decade, he was a reporter at
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.940]   ProPublica investigating the cost and quality of our
[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.460]   healthcare. And his work has been honored with several
[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.060]   journalism awards, including the Harvard Kennedy School's
[00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.980]   Goldsmith Prize for investigative reporting. And he
[00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.900]   was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for local reporting. But
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.800]   most importantly, for today, he is the author of a new book
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.800]   called Never Pay the First Bill, and other creative ways to fight
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.740]   the healthcare system and win. So we're going to get tactical
[00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.620]   and talk about how we can all push back about the high cost of
[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.160]   healthcare, including negotiating with doctors and
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.680]   insurance companies, picking the right plan with our healthcare,
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.000]   preventing expensive bills before you get care, and the
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.800]   tactics you need to negotiate any bill you get. So without
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.700]   further ado, I hope you enjoy my conversation with Marshall
[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.240]   Allen. Let's get started.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.600]   Marshall, thanks for being here.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.820]   Thank you, Chris. I'm really excited to be here to talk about
[00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.280]   hacking the healthcare system. This is going to be fun.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.180]   Yeah, I want to just start off asking what led you to dedicate
[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.320]   so much of your career to researching and writing about
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.840]   healthcare.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.240]   You know, it's actually an accident, Chris, I had no
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.960]   intention of covering healthcare. In fact, I thought
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.000]   writing about healthcare would be extremely boring. And when my
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.900]   editor at the Las Vegas Sun newspaper asked me took me out
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.960]   to lunch one day and asked me to cover healthcare. This was in
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.020]   2006. I actually my first words were I cannot imagine anything
[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.620]   more boring than writing about healthcare. And I quickly
[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.220]   realized how wrong I was because I started doing stories from the
[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.340]   perspective of the patient who has to engage with the healthcare
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.660]   system. And I definitely have an investigative bent to me. And I
[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.420]   also have a very people focused value to the journalism that I
[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.420]   do. So as soon as I started looking at our healthcare system
[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.500]   from the point of view of the patient, who has to navigate the
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.100]   system, which is completely fractured, over complicated, and
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.300]   opaque. And they have to navigate the system, they have
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.320]   to pay for the healthcare they received. And it's completely
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.740]   overpriced, unjustifiably overpriced. And they have to
[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.540]   navigate the safety and the quality of the system, which is
[00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.660]   very difficult to tell. And unfortunately, medical errors are
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.020]   a leading cause of injury and death in this country. So as
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.540]   soon as I started writing about healthcare, looking at the
[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.540]   quality, looking at the safety and looking at the cost, I found
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.500]   that I was able to do stories that immediately had a lot of
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.700]   traction with with the audience, they could really help people
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.740]   right where they're at, I could stand up for people who are
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.100]   being taken advantage of. And so it's been really satisfying
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.100]   these last now 15 years of digging deep on our healthcare
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.620]   system.
[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.100]   Yeah. And was there a moment in this career that you said, now's
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.420]   the time I have to write a book?
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.980]   I started feeling after I'd been a ProPublica for about five or
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.860]   six years, you do enough of these stories about outrageous
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.220]   medical bills. And you dig into people's medical records, you
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.380]   share the records with experts, you share the bills with
[00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.380]   experts, I started to learn more and more about how the system
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.700]   actually works, instead of the ways that we're told that the
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.460]   system works, or this facade that's been built up around the
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.580]   system. So I began to get a deeper understanding of the
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.820]   system, because I talked to 1000s of experts and patients
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.180]   over the 15 years. And then I dug into hundreds of cases of
[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.940]   individual patients who had been just completely screwed by the
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.140]   system in one way or another, I saw there's a complete lack of
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.380]   accountability. And I looked at it across a broad level of
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.020]   stakeholders, you know, I was talking to doctors, insurance
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.460]   companies, patients, hospitals, but always looking at it from
[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.700]   the point of view of the patient. So I realized, okay, I
[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.660]   have a lot, I have a lot to say here, I've learned a lot. And
[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.140]   I'm getting at the same time emails and phone calls almost
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.340]   every day from patients who are having their lives utterly
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.100]   wrecked by our healthcare system. And so let me just
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.740]   throw out some statistics, because I think it's important
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.900]   to ground the conversation about what an urgent problem we have
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.380]   here. First of all, we spend about twice as much per person
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.900]   on healthcare in the United States, compared to the citizens
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.660]   of any other developed country. In other words, the problem
[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.100]   here isn't that we're not spending enough. In fact, we are
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.460]   spending twice as much per person than citizens of other
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.940]   countries. And we still have about 3040 million Americans who
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.620]   don't have any insurance coverage, we probably have
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.260]   about that many more who are what I would call functionally
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.980]   uninsured, which just means that the health benefits they have
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:25.740]   are so thin, that maybe they have a deductible that's $5,000
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.420]   or $3,000 a year, but they only make $60,000 a year. So if
[00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.100]   you're making 60 grand, you're paying out a monthly premium for
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.060]   your health insurance, and you still have to pay the first
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.300]   $3,000 $5,000. Some people are on a high deductible plan that
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.220]   makes them pay the first $10,000. In that case, they are
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.820]   functionally uninsured, they're only going to use those benefits
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.420]   if they have some catastrophic accident, and they're paying
[00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.860]   everything out of pocket. Now, when you have that problem, now
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.900]   you get these massive bills, which are unjustifiably high, in
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.940]   many cases, full of errors, as I found through my reporting and
[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.780]   talking to experts. Now, people will have these high deductibles
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.460]   where they pay the first dollar, and the bills are outrageously
[00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.420]   high, they cannot afford them. And now we have a problem of
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.060]   medical debt. So one out of every three Americans right now
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.860]   has medical debt. And one out of every five Americans has medical
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.060]   debt in collections. So these numbers are staggering. It is a
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.900]   travesty what's happening to the American people. And working
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.860]   Americans are hit the hardest. And so that's why I decided,
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.140]   okay, I'm going to put all the tips I've learned into a book
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.820]   and where I haven't learned the tips, I'm going to go find the
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.380]   experts who have the knowledge that I can share with the
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.540]   audience. And in each chapter, I'm going to show here's a
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.860]   common problem people have with the healthcare system. And
[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.780]   here's how to tackle it. And here's how to fight back and
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.500]   win the key words in my subtitle in my book, and other ways to
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.700]   fight the healthcare system and when we're talking about winning
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.180]   here. And the way I define winning is we should be paying
[00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.340]   much less for our health care and getting much better health
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.260]   care than we're getting right now. So I define a win as saving
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.900]   a lot of money while getting better care, not just mediocre
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.100]   care or denying yourself care, because that's typically what's
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.660]   happened to people. So it's been really satisfying to write the
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.140]   book and start getting feedback from people who are putting
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.660]   these tactics into place.
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.620]   Yeah, I've witnessed some of the high costs in the last few
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.860]   months. It's crazy. I assume these hacks are not just for
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.860]   people who are in high deductible plans or who are
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.220]   underinsured. Are there are some of these beneficial to anyone?
[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:49.100]   They're beneficial to everyone. In fact, with each of these tips,
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.660]   you could save hundreds or even 1000s of dollars per health care
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.740]   encounter. The numbers here are so staggering. And I'd love to
[00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.740]   hear about some of your experiences over the past year.
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.780]   Because the numbers are so staggering, that if you can even
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:07.820]   get one erroneous charge taken off of your medical bill, you
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.660]   might save hundreds or 1000s of dollars. If you can go a really
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.340]   common one is the high cost of imaging. So let's say you need a
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.980]   CT scan or an MRI, your doctor might refer you to the MRI
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.620]   facility that's right down the hall in the hospital where they
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.740]   work. Hospitals are the most expensive place to get these
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.380]   scans done. Same with lab tests. But if you can find an
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:34.300]   independent imaging center, it may be half a mile away from the
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:38.420]   hospital imaging center, they'll do the same CT scan, same MRI,
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.900]   same x rays, whatever you need. And you will save hundreds or
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.540]   even 1000s of dollars per scan, and MRIs and CT is being more
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:50.380]   expensive than the next race. But you can save huge amount of
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.580]   monies just by routing yourself away from the hospital for
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.500]   imaging tests.
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.540]   Yeah, my I'm fortunate that I have a health care plan that
[00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:02.020]   makes hospital er visits fairly affordable. But you know, that
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.460]   doesn't mean that I didn't get to see the full prices that
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.420]   were getting charged. And it's wild. I think I saw a doctor for
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:14.780]   1015 minutes and the bill was like $7,000. Unbelievable. And
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.700]   one thing I'll ask is, is there I'm on what's called an EPO,
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:23.060]   right? And so I have $100 deductible for an ER visit. And
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.060]   so for me, I was like, Okay, is there any benefit to me
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:30.260]   negotiating that $7,000 bill down knowing that I'm just
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.220]   paying 100 of it? And what what impact would that have?
[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.780]   That's a great question, because it gets at one of the
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:39.500]   fundamental misunderstandings I think we have about health care
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.460]   when we get health care through our employers. So we need to
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.220]   stop saying and thinking that someone else is paying for our
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.660]   health care. And it's really easy to do because they've
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:53.500]   taken the pain away from you of that immediate out of pocket
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.340]   costs. So you're only paying that $100. But as our health
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.420]   care costs go up, so they're overcharging, and then the
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.060]   health plan is covering most of that cost, that is still coming
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.940]   out of your premiums. And so you are going to see a rise in
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.300]   premiums every year because of these overcharges to your health
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.060]   plan. And so you might not feel that immediate pain of it coming
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.660]   out of your wallet, or out of your bank account. But year
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:21.460]   after year, because of these high costs, we have seen health
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:26.460]   insurance premiums and deductibles rise by five to 10%
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:31.580]   a year for premiums. And then we have deductibles going up at
[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.580]   outrageous amounts at the same time. And then the other trick
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.340]   that they play is they reduce the amount of coverage that you
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:41.700]   have. And so when you look at this rising cost of health care,
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:45.580]   this is eating into the compensation that our employers
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.540]   allocate toward our wages, and our benefits. So think about it
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:53.660]   this way, when you get hired, you get a compensation package,
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.860]   that compensation package includes your wages, maybe a
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:01.340]   401k or retirement contribution paid time off, and hopefully
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.740]   health benefits. The thing is, our employer isn't actually
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:09.100]   paying for our benefits, what our employer is doing is funding
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:13.220]   our compensation, then that compensation belongs to you and
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:18.260]   me as working Americans, right? Now, if our compensation is
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:23.460]   being consumed by $7,000 bills from the doctor in the emergency
[00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:27.740]   room, even though we don't feel it immediately, because maybe
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.700]   you just have that $100 deductible, you are going to
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.860]   feel it in the long term, because this is sucking all of
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.100]   the compensation out of your employers compensation pool,
[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:41.020]   which leaves less money for your employer to give raises in the
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.540]   next year. And it also causes higher rises in premiums and
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:48.580]   deductibles, as I mentioned. And so when economists look at the
[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:52.820]   reason wages are stagnant in the United States over the last 1020
[00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:57.540]   30 years, the rising cost of healthcare is a huge cause of
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:01.580]   wage stagnation. And it's because our compensation is
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:05.660]   getting consumed by all of these outrageous and unjustified
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:09.500]   medical costs. And so I'm trying to help working Americans see
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.940]   it, see the big picture. It's not just that deductible or that
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.940]   amount that you pay out of pocket. It's also the monthly
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:21.060]   premiums that keep going up and the wage stagnation that's
[00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.980]   caused by our compensation just disappearing because of high
[00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:25.900]   healthcare costs.
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.820]   Yeah, if anyone out there is listening and has an
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:32.260]   entrepreneurial itch, I would love to see you try to turn all
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.660]   of the tips and tricks that Marshall's worked on in this
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.580]   book and in his career into a product that could just scan my
[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:41.340]   medical bills and tell me what I should be fighting back against.
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:45.180]   Yeah, and this is a big thing now. And it's going to become a
[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:50.260]   bigger and bigger thing in the coming years. And I predict real
[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:54.380]   disruption is coming for our healthcare system. It's
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:13:01.140]   consuming about one out of every $5 in our GDP is country is from
[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.340]   healthcare. It's not sustainable. There's to me a lot
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:08.660]   of signs of a bubble that's not able to be maintained. And so
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:13.420]   once employers and working Americans team up with all of
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:16.940]   these vendors and entrepreneurs are creating these really
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.500]   innovative products that are identifying the problem and what
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.780]   you can do about it. Things I think are going to change pretty
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:24.300]   quickly.
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.260]   Yeah, I don't want to go too deep because I feel like we could
[00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:31.700]   spend hours on this. But is there a succinct way to explain
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.460]   why our healthcare system is so broken and expensive and we
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.540]   spend twice as much as other countries?
[00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:41.940]   Yes, here's how I would answer that question. If I had to boil
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:48.060]   it down to one thing, we have allowed the profit motives that
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:52.140]   are not unethical or immoral in other contexts. Let's say you
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:57.300]   open a restaurant and you want to charge $500 for a steak. If
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.540]   you put the price on the menu, and it's a $500 steak and people
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.380]   want to come in and buy it. There's nothing immoral or
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:08.020]   unethical about doing that. But if you overprice a healthcare
[00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:12.820]   procedure, that somebody needs to survive, and you don't show
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.740]   them the price up front, but you hit them with that outrageous
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.780]   price after they have gotten the procedure they needed to save
[00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:24.580]   their life. That's where the profiteering becomes to me a
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:28.900]   moral and an ethical issue. None of this is illegal, or much of
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:33.100]   it is not illegal. But it's not right. I believe it's not right
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:37.460]   to charge someone more than you should, when all they're trying
[00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.860]   to do is get the care that they need to save their life or to
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:44.700]   heal their body or to take care of their sick child. So this
[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:49.220]   same profit motive that drives a lot of the American economy,
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:53.620]   when it's applied to healthcare, it becomes really unsavory and
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.780]   extremely harmful to the American public.
[00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.740]   And in other countries, are there ways people solve this
[00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.900]   that don't involve the government getting into
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.980]   healthcare, which I know is a pretty hot topic here.
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:08.980]   I haven't done enough research to speak authoritatively about
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.100]   what's happening in other countries and how they do it.
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:14.220]   But what I can tell you is this, they're spending about half as
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:18.060]   much, and they have much, much better outcomes in terms of the
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.260]   health of their people. They get the same high quality medical
[00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.940]   care, their disease burden is much lighter, their life
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:30.180]   expectancy is much longer. And so we are doing it in the most
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:34.260]   expensive and we're not getting our money's worth when it comes
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.540]   to healthcare. So I don't know exactly how they're all doing
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:41.060]   it enough to say the tactics they're using that we should
[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.100]   employ. But what's clear is we're not doing it right here.
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:48.340]   Yep. So you know, you mentioned imaging as a big way to save
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:53.140]   what are some other kind of easy big wins for saving on healthcare
[00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:56.340]   before, you know, ultimately, I want to jump into what happens
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.820]   when you get that bill. But before you get a bill, what are
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.500]   some of the best ways to start to preventatively save on your
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.740]   healthcare? So there are some principles that listeners can
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:08.540]   keep in mind to hack the healthcare system. First of all,
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:12.780]   realize that there is extreme price variation in our healthcare
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:17.460]   system. So if you need a knee replacement, you could spend as
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:22.420]   low as say $20,000 at one facility, or as high as $80,000
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.940]   at another facility, it's that extreme, and the quality is not
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:29.580]   going to be that different. If you need a medication, you could
[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:34.380]   get a branded medication, or you could get a generic medication
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:38.500]   in many cases, that's the exact same chemical composition as
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:42.580]   that branded medication, but at a much, much lower price. And so
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.860]   with each of these decisions, if you know in advance, okay,
[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:49.140]   where's the best place to get this? Where's the most value
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:52.780]   based place to get this? Where's the highest quality place to get
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:57.580]   this, then you can begin asking some questions to pursue the
[00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:01.580]   best value care, which by value, I would define that as the
[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.500]   lowest cost and the highest quality.
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.780]   And, and how do you research those costs? So let's say I do
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:09.460]   need a knee replacement. And I haven't listened to this
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:13.180]   podcast, knowing that 20 to $80,000 could be the range. How
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.660]   do you price kind of compare without the information?
[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:20.860]   Hospitals are now required to post their prices on their
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:24.900]   websites. There's a federal government regulation called the
[00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.780]   hospital price transparency rule. And they're required now
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:32.100]   to post their prices for all their different procedures. And
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.660]   that includes the cash prices. So in other words, if you have
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.060]   no, no health insurance, or don't want to use your health
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.500]   insurance, you just want to pay cash, they have to post the
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.180]   Medicare prices, they have to post all the negotiated prices
[00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.420]   for all the different insurance companies that do those
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:50.700]   procedures in those facilities. So if you know that in advance,
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.780]   let's say you need a colonoscopy, which is a very
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:56.060]   common preventive procedure that people in your audience are
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:59.060]   going to need to get at some point in their lives. You can
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:02.260]   look now in hospital websites, and if they're following the
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:06.140]   federal government's rules, they will have their prices posted.
[00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:10.220]   And so you can check the prices at local hospitals, you can call
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:13.780]   ambulatory surgical centers and talk to them and get the prices
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:18.420]   there. And that's a good way to identify prices. Another place
[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:22.020]   that we can look for prices, there's a lot of now technology
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.180]   companies that are producing prices and making these a lot
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:28.700]   easier to look up. So look for some of these startups that are
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.740]   producing prices. There's one called turquoise health, there's
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:37.460]   one called health cost labs, just Google, healthcare prices,
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.740]   and a lot of these startups are popping up and they're providing
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:46.020]   prices up front. Another tactic, call and ask, call and ask for
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.340]   the cash prices, especially because often the cash prices
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.260]   are even less than what you would pay with your insurance
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:56.380]   plan. And so it does take some legwork up front, you might get
[00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.620]   some doors shut in your face as people tell you we can't give
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:03.180]   you the price or you can't get the price. But more and more the
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.820]   prices are becoming available. And people are offering the
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:10.740]   prices. So you know, more progressively minded disruptive
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:15.020]   healthcare providers, hospitals and doctors are posting their
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:18.940]   prices. So check out something like Surgery Center of Oklahoma,
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.540]   Surgery Center of Oklahoma is a surgery center that has just
[00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.900]   posted their prices just up on their website. And so if you're
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.980]   wondering what you should pay, you might want to consider going
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.860]   there. Of course, that might require some travel, you might
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.180]   not want to do that. But you could at least check their
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:37.380]   prices and see how those prices compare to prices in your
[00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.020]   community.
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.500]   And are these prices, let's say I go to the Surgery Center of
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.900]   Oklahoma, and I need a procedure and I see a price, are the
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.900]   prices in my local area, if I call my doctor or local
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:50.020]   hospital, are they negotiable such like say, well, it's so
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.540]   much cheaper here? Could you do it for less?
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:56.340]   Yes, this is another principle that applies to healthcare. So
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.980]   let's say principle one is, there's huge price variation,
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.380]   and you might be able to get a better deal somewhere else.
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:08.620]   Principle number two would be everything is negotiable. So
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:12.500]   when they there's a really crazy way they do healthcare pricing.
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:16.300]   I mean, it makes absolutely no sense. But when they charge you
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:20.180]   something, they make up the charges, it's an outrageously
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:24.020]   high amount, because what they want to do is take those charges
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:28.300]   and then apply insurance company discounts. So usually United
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:32.660]   Healthcare or Blue Cross or Aetna will apply a discount. And
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.380]   then that's how they get customers. They say, look, we
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.900]   get you the best discount at the hospitals in your community or
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.660]   with the doctors in your community. But those initial
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:45.580]   prices that the hospitals or doctors post are fantasy
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:50.220]   numbers, they are not grounded to anything in reality. And so
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:54.380]   the negotiated price that the insurance company pays, it might
[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:58.900]   be one 10th or one fifth or one third of those initial charges.
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.780]   And that's why even on your your particular bill, the $7,000 bill
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:07.060]   from your doctor, that might have been a $7,000 charge. And
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:10.900]   then that charge got negotiated down by your insurance company
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.940]   and resulted in a lower payment.
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:17.540]   Yeah, in fact, I the first bill I got from one emergency room is
[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:21.100]   9000. And then I refresh the page like two days later, and it
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.060]   was down to 5000. And I was like, Oh, how did that like, I
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:28.180]   just somehow that $4,000 disappeared. And it was because I
[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:32.260]   guess the Cigna negotiated price that I had was much lower than
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.060]   the original price the hospital charged.
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:38.460]   That's exactly how it works. And so you saw that in real time in
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:42.700]   real life with yourself. But it just goes to show the charges
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:47.260]   are not the charges. The price is not the price. And when you
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.620]   know that in advance, as a consumer, you can have
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:55.060]   confidence knowing I can ask for a better deal, I can ask for a
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:58.860]   price reduction. And by the way, if you ask them, why are the
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:03.020]   prices this high? They can't explain to you why the prices
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:08.020]   are high to begin with. So a third principle that could be
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:12.140]   applied to the overall kind of broad way we look at healthcare
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:16.780]   is stop assuming any of this makes sense. It doesn't make
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:21.340]   sense. We assume there's a level of competence and rationale
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:24.180]   behind things like healthcare pricing in the United States.
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:27.820]   There's not that would be the wrong assumption that there are
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:32.820]   so many errors in medical bills. And by errors, I mean charges
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:36.860]   for things that did not occur. So you have to look at an
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:40.660]   itemized medical bill when you go to a hospital, you have to
[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:45.540]   see what are all the individual items that they charged me for
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:49.540]   and how did those add up to my total bill. Often when you look
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.700]   at those itemized charges, you'll find things in those
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:57.300]   itemized charges that did not actually happen. So it's really
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:02.340]   easy in that case, to go to the facility and say, hey, billing
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:05.380]   manager or billing department, I'm looking at this itemized
[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:09.540]   bill. And I'm seeing that these different things that you charge
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:13.180]   me for, I did not actually receive these services. So you
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.860]   need to remove these from my bill. It's incredible how common
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:21.180]   that is. In fact, if you talk to experts who review medical bills
[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.340]   for a living, they will tell you that most of them contain some
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.340]   type of an error or an overcharge.
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.100]   Yeah, I'm looking right now. I had a case of shingles, but I
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.180]   didn't know it at the time.
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.260]   I'm so sorry to hear that. By the way, that is a pain.
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.620]   Yeah. So I didn't know it at the time. I went to the emergency
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:38.820]   room one night because it was just the worst pain I could
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:42.100]   imagine. And they couldn't figure out what it was. They ran
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.900]   the blood tests, the urinalysis, couldn't figure it out, sent me
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:48.900]   home, said take some ibuprofen. And the next night, it was even
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.180]   worse. And so I was like, I don't know what to do. So I'd
[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:54.380]   gone to one Sutter Health Hospital the first night. And I
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:57.860]   said, I don't know what to do. But so I drove to Stanford, a
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.540]   different hospital. So two things I noticed. So this was an
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:03.740]   interesting experiment for me, because I went for the exact same
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:06.900]   circumstance to a different hospital within two days, two
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:10.660]   days of each other, one day of each other. And I got a bill and
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.740]   I they did most of the same work. And so a couple things
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.980]   that I noticed that I'm curious to get your take on because
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:19.780]   these could be a great examples for people. So one was, when I
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:23.580]   went to one hospital, it was labeled emergency room visit
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:26.660]   high severity. And in the next hospital, it was emergency room
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:30.620]   visit moderate severity. And based on what I can tell, they
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.180]   charge different amounts based on how severe the the
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:36.940]   circumstances, is that something I could call and say, this
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.780]   wasn't actually high severity, right? I you didn't see me for
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:44.140]   three hours. Clearly, this was not a gunshot wound. Can we get
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.780]   this drop to medium or low severity?
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:52.620]   I love this case study. I love that you have this a B
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:57.940]   comparison in real time. Same patient, same ailment, two
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:02.580]   different facilities, you are perfectly illustrating all of
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:06.740]   the absurdity or some of the absurdity in our healthcare
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.900]   system. So let's dig into this a little bit. When you go to the
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:13.580]   emergency room, or when you go to a doctor visit, they have
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:17.300]   five different levels of severity that they code for the
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:21.700]   visit, one being the least complex and the simplest type of
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.660]   a case, five being the most complex type of a case, and
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:31.820]   then 12345 in between. So when they code it as a severe case,
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:35.780]   they are getting a much higher reimbursement for the service
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:39.100]   that they provide. But they aren't allowed to just put
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:42.220]   whatever number they want on the case, they can't just be like,
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:45.740]   well, it seemed serious to me. So I called it a level five,
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:51.220]   there are actual criteria that are used to assign these codes.
[00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:54.620]   And so this is why I encourage people when you get your itemized
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:58.620]   medical bill, get the billing codes, make sure that you have
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:02.820]   it's usually a five digit CPT code, it's called common
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:06.460]   procedural terminology. I know this is getting a little wonky
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:10.740]   here, but this is going to help you a lot. Okay. So get the CPT
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.300]   codes. And if you don't get them from your hospital, your
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.380]   insurance plan will have that information. Just call the
[00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.860]   customer service number on your insurance plan and say, hey, I
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:23.580]   had a question about this particular visit. I went to
[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:26.860]   Sutter Health, I went to Stanford on this date, can you
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.300]   please just tell me what the different billing codes are for
[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:34.900]   each of the charges, take that five digit code, Google it, and
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:38.620]   read the description of what the code describes. And it'll tell
[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:43.300]   you what it describes, and what the requirements are for them to
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:47.100]   build that level of a code, a level three, four or five
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:51.900]   billing code requires medical decision making of some level of
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:55.540]   complexity. So in other words, if you have a little slice on
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:58.820]   your finger, it's not a complicated thing to determine
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:01.260]   what do we need to do with this slice on the finger, the
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:05.500]   decision is to put in some stitches. So it requires medical
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:09.460]   decision making of complexity, moderate or extreme complexity,
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:14.700]   depending on the code, it requires an examination. If you
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:18.380]   have a level three, level four, level five, that requires
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:21.660]   actually an extensive examination of the patient. It
[00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:25.340]   also requires an extensive problem focused history to be
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:28.580]   taken of the patient. So if you went to the doctor, and they
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.620]   didn't do a thorough examination on you, they didn't take a
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:34.860]   complete history on you. And there wasn't medical decision
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:37.980]   making of any type of complexity, they should not be
[00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:43.100]   billing a level three, four or five office visit, or emergency
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:43.700]   room visit.
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.460]   Yeah, yeah. And I'll say one thing I was actually really
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:50.660]   impressed by was, I logged into the Cigna website, and I could
[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:53.940]   get details and download the kind of EOB explanation of
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.140]   benefits. And then I separately logged into both Stanford and
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:00.940]   Sutter's kind of my health portal, and got similar data. As
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:04.540]   much as I found some of the data to be crazy, I was at least
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:07.180]   pleasantly surprised with how much access I had.
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:09.780]   That's awesome. And the information is right there for
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:14.540]   us. But we do have to take that active engaged step to look at
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:18.340]   it. And if they're not providing it to you transparently, then
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.780]   you need to ask them to provide it. But it's your right as a
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:22.380]   patient to have this information.
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:26.580]   So I am quite comfortable right now, which is actually true
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:29.940]   almost every day. And that's thanks to Viori. And I'm excited
[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.460]   to be partnering with them for this episode. They make
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:35.860]   performance apparel that's incredibly versatile. Everything
[00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:38.740]   is designed to work out in but it doesn't look or feel like it
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:41.820]   at all. And it's so freaking comfortable, you will want to
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.820]   wear it all the time. Seriously, I am pretty sure it's more
[00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:47.540]   comfortable than whatever you're wearing right now. Unless
[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.740]   you're wearing Viori, in which case you already know what I
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:53.620]   mean. And it's not just for men. My wife is as obsessed with
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:57.300]   Viori as I am. My favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.220]   I think I have three pairs and they are probably the most
[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.820]   comfortable pants I've ever owned. Their products can be
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.820]   used for just about any activity, whether it's running,
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:08.940]   training or yoga. They're also great for lounging, running
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:12.380]   around town or their meta pants can even work for a night out.
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:15.740]   Honestly, I think Viori is an investment in your happiness.
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:19.060]   And for all the Hacks listeners, they are offering 20% off your

[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:47.420]   could say that I'm eating a fully balanced diet every day.
[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:51.260]   But the reality is that I am definitely not. So I love having
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:54.540]   an easy way to get my daily nutritional insurance, which is
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:57.980]   why I kickstart my day with Athletic Greens and I am excited
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:01.100]   to be partnering with them for this episode. I started taking
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.820]   it because I wanted to see what all the hype was about. And I've
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:07.900]   kept it in my daily routine for months. Every morning, I mix it
[00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:11.340]   up with some cold water, add a few ice cubes, it tastes so good
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:14.500]   when it's cold, and I head to my office feeling focused and
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:18.620]   energized for the day, which is a feeling I absolutely love. I
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:22.380]   also love that it's made from 75 high quality vitamins, minerals
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:26.540]   and superfoods and contains less than one gram of sugar. It also
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:30.700]   has no GMOs, nasty chemicals or artificial anything. To make
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:33.780]   giving it a try easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you a
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:38.180]   free one year supply of immune supporting vitamin D and five
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:41.540]   free travel packs with your first purchase. All you have to
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:46.580]   do is visit all thehacks.com/athleticgreens. Again,
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:50.500]   that's all thehacks.com/athleticgreens to take
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.660]   ownership over your health and pick up the ultimate daily
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:57.260]   nutritional insurance. One more tip that I'll share that I just
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:00.500]   recently learned was, I have an iPhone and I logged into the
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:05.140]   health app. And I was able to go in and log into a handful of
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:08.100]   medical institutions I've been at. This includes Stanford,
[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:14.100]   Sutter, LabCorp, and UCSF. And all of the visits I've had have
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:17.180]   all been imported. So now I can go in and say, "Gosh, how is my
[00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:20.820]   blood pressure tracked over the last X months?" And I see it
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.780]   from every single visit I've been to. So I don't know if
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:26.780]   Android has the same thing. But, you know, I'd encourage you if
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:29.580]   you're on an iPhone to see if your medical organizations
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.180]   support this because it was a really fascinating way for me to
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.300]   get easy access to my own data.
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:37.620]   That's really amazing. And we're going to see more and more of
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:41.220]   that as time goes on. Technology is getting more integrated with
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:43.980]   healthcare. And that's going to give us a lot more opportunity
[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:44.620]   to be engaged.
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:47.580]   One other thing I noticed looking at this, and I'm looking
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:50.940]   at right now. So one hospital did a comprehensive metabolic
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:54.460]   panel that was $145. And the other hospital did a
[00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:59.540]   comprehensive metabolic panel, same exact code for $995. Is
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:02.780]   that is that something normal? Is that kind of crazy
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:06.260]   discrepancy for the same codes, something that people should
[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:10.900]   expect to see? And is there any obligation for people to charge
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:11.980]   a fair price?
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:18.380]   There is no obligation for them to charge you a fair price. So
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:23.900]   you are identifying right here with an excellent case study,
[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:28.740]   the absurd amount of price variation. Now, let's pretend
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:32.860]   that you were paying all this out of pocket. So if you went to
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:37.020]   the one facility that charged you $900, you would be obligated
[00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:40.020]   to pay that amount of money. And for many of our policymakers,
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:43.700]   many of our decision makers in healthcare, they have the money
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:47.060]   to just pay the overcharges, they have the money to pay the
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:49.660]   high premiums and the high deductibles. And so for them,
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:52.220]   their time is worth more than their money. And it's such a
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:55.420]   hassle to figure this stuff out. They just pay the bills. What
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:59.540]   they do is they ignore the massive amount of the American
[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:03.420]   population, the majority, actually, that cannot afford to
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:07.820]   pay a $900 bill. The Federal Reserve did a study of the
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.380]   amount of money people have in their savings accounts, and they
[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:14.620]   found that 40% of Americans do not have more than $400 in their
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:17.820]   savings account at any given time, the median American family
[00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:23.180]   of four makes about $70,000 a year. So for those families,
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:27.940]   they are being put into debt and into bankruptcy by these medical
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:31.780]   bills. And so I always encourage people like maybe you or like
[00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:35.180]   myself, who can afford to pay a higher medical bill, when you
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:38.700]   stand up for yourself, and when you push back against these
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:42.980]   absurd medical bills, unjustified medical bills, you
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.700]   are not just standing up for yourself, you are also standing
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:49.700]   up for this entire population of Americans who might not be able
[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:53.100]   to stand up for themselves. They might not have the resources to
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:56.580]   push back, they might not have the education or the knowledge
[00:33:56.580 --> 00:34:01.180]   to push back. And so I believe that we who have more need to
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:04.940]   see this as a justice issue where we can stand up for the
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.820]   people who are getting hit with these outrageous charges, and
[00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:12.220]   they're unable to afford them. Think about it this way. It's a
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:16.140]   basic metabolic panel. This is an extremely common blood test.
[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:20.660]   So you you just named two name brand facilities Sutter and
[00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:25.220]   Stanford. Okay. You're telling me that one of them is not able
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:27.500]   to do it at the same price as the other one?
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.500]   Yeah, it blows my mind.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:30.780]   It blows my mind.
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:34.220]   So okay, so this is really interesting. And I'll caveat
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:37.100]   that I know myself. And I think I know a lot of our listeners
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:39.900]   pretty well, any one of us might be able to pay this bill, I can
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:43.380]   promise you, especially for myself, I have no interest in
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:46.980]   paying ones, even one cent that I can afford if I don't have to
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:50.020]   love it. So you know, we talked a little bit about how to search
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:54.060]   for the prices in advance. A lot of times we make the mistake or
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.980]   we don't ask or you're in the emergency room, I probably could
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:59.260]   have paused and said, Hey, before you draw my blood, how
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:02.060]   much are you going to charge me for this metabolic panel. But a
[00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.960]   lot of times all this happens after so you get a bill in the
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:09.180]   mail. And even if you have an insurance plan that is good,
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:13.580]   oftentimes, you might have 10 2030% co insurance. So that
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:18.180]   $900 metabolic panel might not cost me $900. But it might cost
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:24.460]   me $300. And maybe it could cost me $100 or a lot less. So I'm
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:28.140]   curious if or even $30 I guess it could be the difference
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:33.100]   between these two bills is probably $45 and $300. So what
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:36.380]   do we do when we get those bills and want to push back and I'll
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:39.940]   throw one other egregious example I got was when I broke
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:43.980]   my foot, they left me with a walking boot. And that walking
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:47.140]   boot I found to be not the best walking boot. So I went on
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:49.860]   Amazon, I found what I thought was the best walking boot and it
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:53.940]   was like $52. And then I get the bill in the mail from Pacific
[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:57.340]   Medical, Inc. Sorry, guys, I'm throwing you under the bus. They
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:02.940]   deserve it says solar air Walker, and the price was $335 a
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:06.980]   marginal product that, you know, was not good that I replaced
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:11.100]   with an excellent $50 product costs 335. But it's too late. I
[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:14.180]   already have this boot, I'd washed it, I've worn it. What do
[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:16.740]   we do when we get these egregious bills, even if we only
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:20.900]   have to pay 10 2030% of them? How do we what do we do after
[00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:21.460]   the fact?
[00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:24.540]   You're beginning to make my blood boil here, Chris. I love
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:28.220]   it. I love it. Because it gets me fired up because it's
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:32.260]   affecting all of us. It's affecting all of us. We are all
[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:37.220]   afflicted in the United States by this ridiculous healthcare
[00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:41.020]   pricing. And you're just citing examples yourself from your real
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:45.140]   life in the past year. But this is happening to all of us all
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:49.500]   the time. And we have got to push back on it. So let's talk
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:53.340]   about how to push back. Okay. I have a whole chapter in my book
[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:57.260]   about how to sue in small claims court, when you have been price
[00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:00.140]   gouged, or when you have been charged for something that's
[00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:05.100]   erroneous. And I believe that this is a game changing tactic
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:09.140]   that does work. I documented lots of cases where it's worked.
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:12.540]   And I am now helping a lot of patients with these problems
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:17.700]   right now. So our small claims court system exists to protect
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:23.420]   individual consumers from unfair transactions by big corporations
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:26.700]   or other more powerful individuals. And it's a it evens
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:29.540]   the playing field because right now what would happen is this,
[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:33.060]   you call the hospital, the billing department and you say,
[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:36.460]   hey, you guys just charge me or this company, the device
[00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:40.340]   company, you guys charged me $300 for a boot that was a piece
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:45.620]   of junk, I got a much better boot on Amazon for $50. That's
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:49.620]   no good. So I would first start with trying to negotiate a
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:52.620]   better price on that bill. Now, they would probably tell you,
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:55.460]   this is the price that your insurance plan has agreed to pay
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:58.540]   us for this. So you are contractually obligated to pay
[00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:01.380]   it. And if you called your insurance plan, they would
[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:05.220]   review it. And they would say, yes, this bill was paid in
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:09.220]   accordance with your plan. In other words, we have an
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:12.860]   agreement to overpay them for this piece of crap, medical
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:15.940]   boot. So you as the consumer, they'll just look at you and
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:19.300]   shrug. And they go, that's the price that your insurance plan
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:22.020]   agreed to pay. And that's the plan that your employer picked
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:26.860]   for you. And so therefore, you get sent the bill. I don't
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:30.580]   believe that is a fair way that working Americans have been
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:35.900]   treated, I believe that we have a three party transaction here,
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:38.900]   or even a four party transaction. We have the device
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:42.740]   company, we have the insurance plan, we have the employer, and
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:46.220]   we have the employee, you in this case, who is the patient?
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:52.060]   How is it fair that the device maker and the insurance plan
[00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:55.860]   come up with a price, and then they just tell the employer and
[00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:59.820]   the employee to pay it? That makes no sense. That's not fair.
[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:03.460]   It's something that we have tolerated for too long. And now
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:07.220]   we have got to push back and contest. So you start by
[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:11.020]   saying, I just found this product on Amazon that's better
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:15.740]   than the product you gave me for $50. I will pay you $50. How do
[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:19.580]   you feel about that? If you get stoned? Well, does that work? I
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:23.860]   do? Yes, it does work. It often works. So it depends on how much
[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:27.540]   noise you want to make. So you know how it is, the squeaky
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:31.700]   wheel gets the oil gets the grease, right? So you may have
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:35.100]   to complain to higher ups in the facility, you may have to
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:38.780]   complain to higher ups at your employer, you may have to
[00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:42.380]   complain to higher ups at the insurance division, you may need
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:46.500]   to file complaints to the insurance division or the health
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:50.140]   division that oversees the hospital or the facility, you
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.900]   might have to make some waves and it depends on how much it
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:56.740]   matters to you. So for a $300 bill, you might be like, look,
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:59.260]   this is not worth it. I'm just gonna pay the bill.
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:02.740]   You don't know, you don't know me that well, just the idea of
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:07.620]   paying six times, even if it was $5, I feel like the experience
[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:09.260]   of fighting back might be worth it.
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:12.260]   And I think it's very worth it. And this is what I would
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:15.380]   encourage you to do. And I'd be happy to help you do this. Start
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:19.420]   with just a polite call to the billing department and see how
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:23.540]   they respond. Start by calling your health insurance company
[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:26.980]   and see how they respond. My prediction is that both of them
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:29.780]   are going to basically blow you off. They'll say this is what
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:34.460]   the plan has set as the price. And so therefore, you have to
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:37.780]   pay this was adjudicated according to the terms of the
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:42.540]   plan. So they'll basically say so the bill is the bill. So then
[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:46.700]   your next step then is to escalate it and say, I want a
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:49.740]   reduction on this, you have overcharged me, and it's not
[00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:52.620]   okay. And so you do need to become confrontational at that
[00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:55.140]   point. This is where a lot of people don't want to do that,
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:57.660]   right? A lot of people back away. But if you're the type,
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:01.180]   which I am too, where I'm going to say no, now you've got me
[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:04.980]   more interested, then the next step would be to contest it
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:08.780]   right to that billing department and ask for a supervisor, always
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:12.780]   ask for a supervisor, and go as high as you can up the chain to
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:18.380]   insist on a reduction in the price. Now I'm continuing to
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:21.020]   assume that they're going to blow you off. The next step
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:24.340]   would be take the sample letter that I have in my book, which is
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:28.660]   a 30 day warning, to tell them, if you don't correct this within
[00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:33.380]   30 days, I'm going to sue you, as is my right in small claims
[00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:37.980]   court in my state for overbilling me and price gouging
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:41.980]   me. There is actually a legal precedent that we can stand on
[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:45.740]   to undergird ourselves when we take on these legal fights. And
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:49.860]   it's called the open price term. This is part of the uniform
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:54.540]   commercial code. The UCC is the law that governs commercial
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:58.700]   transactions in the United States. The open price term says
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:03.100]   that as a consumer, if you go for some type of a transaction,
[00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:06.220]   and they don't give you the price upfront, then it is
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:10.660]   assumed that the price that they give you is going to be fair and
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:17.140]   set in good faith. Now a $300 price for a crummy product is
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:19.860]   not a price that's fair, and it's not a price that's set in
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:24.140]   good faith. So you actually have good legal grounds if your case
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:28.740]   ever goes to court to argue and win a case in small claims
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:31.580]   court. But think about what happens. Okay, so you're going
[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:34.460]   to send that 30 day warning notice. And the reason you want
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:37.980]   to do that is because you want to show the judge if you ever go
[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:41.620]   to small claims court that you did everything you could not to
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:44.380]   waste the time of the court. You don't want to show up in front
[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:47.260]   of a judge having filed a frivolous case. So you want to
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:51.060]   show the judge I warned them I was going to sue them. I urged
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:55.140]   them to renegotiate and give me a fair price. They refuse to do
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:43:00.740]   it. Often that 30 day warning letter will create enough waves
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:04.180]   that it will shake them up and get them to give you a
[00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:07.300]   negotiated price that's much lower and that's a fair price.
[00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:11.180]   But if they don't, then you follow it up by filing a claim
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:15.020]   in small claims court. And in a state most states it's about 30
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:19.260]   or $40 to file a case. It's it can be done easily online within
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.780]   minutes. You've already done your research because you've
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:24.620]   gathered all your medical records and your medical bills.
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:27.860]   So you have all the evidence you need. It's not like you have to
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:31.500]   do more work. So you file that case and now think about the
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:35.940]   problem you've created for them. Okay. And this is the part I
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:39.460]   have to admit this I feel maybe a little devious and
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:43.660]   antagonistic here but I love this okay because now you're
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:46.260]   you're going to sue them for the difference right you've been
[00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:50.780]   told to pay or you've paid $300 when it should be $50. So you're
[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:55.300]   going to sue them for $250. Now imagine they're going to have to
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:59.740]   hire an attorney to argue the case against you. You don't have
[00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:02.900]   to hire an attorney in small claims court. They probably will
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:05.420]   or they're going to represent themselves which will be a total
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:09.260]   pain for them. It's going to cost them hundreds of dollars an
[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:13.700]   hour to defend a case that is only costing and only worth $250
[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:17.740]   to begin with. So when we sue them in small claims court, we
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:20.860]   give them the incentive they need to do the right thing. We
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:26.180]   give them incentive now they have an urgent incentive to call
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:29.580]   you up and say okay, look, we'll take 50 bucks or okay, we'll
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:32.340]   look we'll take 100 bucks and you say okay, I'm overpaying it
[00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:35.780]   100 but I don't want to go it's a hassle for me to go to small
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:39.660]   claims court too. So I'll do it for $100. So small claims court
[00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:44.540]   is extremely effective. And I would be happy if that were
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:46.740]   something you decide to do and I'd be happy to help you with
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:46.940]   it.
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:50.180]   Yeah, and I think you outlined how to do a lot of these steps in
[00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:53.860]   the book. So it's not there's a framework for the flow to follow
[00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:55.100]   from what I remember. So
[00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:58.660]   yeah, it is I call it the never pay pathway. Again, I'm not
[00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:01.540]   saying when I called the book never pay the first bill. I'm
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:04.740]   certainly not saying don't pay your bills. I'm just saying
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:08.020]   never pay the first bill until you have analyzed it and made
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:11.740]   sure that it's fair, and that it's accurate. And if it's not
[00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:14.700]   fair, and it's not accurate, then we need to push back and
[00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:15.940]   demand a fair treatment.
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:19.380]   Yeah, and one thing that we haven't touched on, which I was
[00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:22.980]   just totally fascinated by was I got a lot of bills from the
[00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:27.500]   hospital from this medical device company. And I was
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:31.580]   surprised that at times they would send me a bill before the
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:35.740]   insurance company has even responded. And the bill I got, I
[00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:38.020]   looked online a couple days later, and I was like, this
[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:40.420]   bill has already been paid by the insurance company. Wow. And
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:44.180]   so I could see myself in an alternate world. And I'm
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:46.900]   thankful that we've communicated and this was getting scheduled.
[00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:49.980]   So I had some ideas of what to do. But I got a bill at one
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:54.900]   point for $500 for some part of this visit. And they had here's
[00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:57.100]   where how to pay it online, here's how to send in a check.
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:00.620]   But I logged on online, it was already paid. And so is it is
[00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:03.980]   it normal for people to get bills that their insurance
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:07.260]   company will ultimately actually pay that they might get tricked
[00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:08.700]   into thinking they need to pay?
[00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:13.100]   Yes, I've had the exact same experience myself where I was
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:18.820]   sent a bill with all the amount due $250 person responsible
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:23.980]   Marshall Allen date it was due. Well, I with that one, I realized
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:26.860]   they had not even submitted it to my insurance company, they
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:29.140]   had all the insurance information, for whatever reason,
[00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:32.500]   they did not submit the claim, they just sent me the bill. And
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:36.060]   so I was able to route that back to the insurance plan and get
[00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:39.100]   that paid in full. And so another principle, another
[00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:43.900]   tactic is make sure that your health plan has paid the bill
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:47.660]   and adjudicated it properly before you send in any money.
[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:51.060]   And you check that by looking at your insurance companies, it's
[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:55.460]   called an EOB, an explanation of benefits, that document will
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:59.580]   show you what the charges were, what the allowed amount was for
[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:03.860]   your insurance plan, how that was all processed will be done by
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:06.940]   the insurance company, and then it'll tell you what your amount
[00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:09.900]   is that you owe. So it doesn't mean that you're not still going
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:13.140]   to get maybe price gouged, but at least you'll know how it was
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:15.900]   run through the insurance plan. And you can make sure that the
[00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:18.140]   insurance paid the amount it's supposed to pay.
[00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:21.980]   Yeah, my examples are interesting, because they're
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:25.460]   very relevant to me. But are there some examples you have of
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:28.020]   people who've managed to have huge wins?
[00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:31.540]   Yeah, I have a whole chapter in the book on how to fight your
[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:34.060]   insurance company when they've denied you the care that you
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:38.140]   need. And these are often like life and death struggles.
[00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:41.660]   Certainly it can be your financial life and death. But I
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:46.100]   talked to a woman named Alexia, and I helped her and her
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:50.700]   husband after she had an elective procedure done that her
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:53.220]   hospital told her they got cleared by the insurance
[00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:55.940]   company. So the insurance company would cover it. Well,
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:58.940]   the insurance company didn't cover it. And so she got stuck
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:03.900]   with a $78,000 hospital bill because of this procedure that
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:07.500]   didn't get covered. Well, I walked her through the tactics
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:11.020]   in terms of how to fight an insurance company denial. And in
[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:14.100]   the end, it took about a year and a half. And this was a big
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:17.660]   battle for her. But in the end, her insurance company agreed to
[00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:20.460]   cover most of the bill, and then the hospital waived the other
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:25.820]   charges. So her family went from owing $78,000 and consulting
[00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:30.420]   bankruptcy attorneys to having owing nothing having the entire
[00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:34.540]   bill forgiven. And so that's one tactic. Another just even the
[00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:38.660]   youth pastor at my church that I went to in New Jersey, within
[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:41.900]   weeks of reading my book, he started pushing back on medical
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:46.540]   bills and saved $815. Just in the first few weeks. I've also
[00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:50.100]   helped people with small claims court. And one thing I love to
[00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:54.860]   do is read the reviews on my Amazon page, because I'm seeing
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:59.900]   people throw in examples of saving $1,500 here, saving
[00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:04.260]   getting hospital facility fees waived all kinds of things where
[00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:07.300]   people are pushing back and fighting back and saving tons of
[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:07.700]   money.
[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:11.700]   Yeah, I'm actually putting these things to use. There were a
[00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:14.260]   couple charges that they're like, wow, this one x ray wasn't
[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:17.700]   covered. And, and I planned to fight back and see what
[00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:20.500]   happened. One of those future reviews might include my my
[00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:25.140]   outcome as well. One situation I interviewed someone named Kevin
[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:29.100]   Rose, and we were talking about the way people think about
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:32.820]   cardiovascular disease and how some primary care physicians
[00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:35.900]   aren't as up to date on the latest research, which makes
[00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:39.140]   sense because they're so busy seeing patients. And one of the
[00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:42.700]   things he pointed out that right now we look at your HDL and your
[00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:46.100]   LDL levels. But there's a lot of data out there to support that
[00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:49.420]   another marker, which is your Apo B numbers, which I think is
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:53.420]   like your Apo lipo protein B, it might be a better indicator of
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:57.300]   cardiovascular disease. But because the science hasn't caught
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:00.300]   up, oftentimes those things aren't recommended by doctors or
[00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:04.220]   covered by insurance. And so in a circumstance where you're
[00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:07.420]   reading something scientific, that's that has journal data
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:10.900]   behind it, but insurance companies haven't caught up. Is
[00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:14.420]   there anything you can do? For example, I went in and asked my
[00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:17.620]   doctor, could I get this test, doctor put in the order for it.
[00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:20.180]   And then the insurance company ended up denying it and saying
[00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:23.620]   actually this one blood test we don't cover that was not a case
[00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:26.380]   of it was too expensive, right? The charge was it was only maybe
[00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:29.740]   100 and something dollars for the blood test. But there's data
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:32.260]   to support that it actually might be a better thing than the
[00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:33.540]   other things I know they cover.
[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:36.460]   So in that case, they probably were denying it because they
[00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:40.420]   were classifying it as experimental. And experimental
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:43.620]   is the category they put things in that they just haven't
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:46.860]   decided to cover yet. That does not mean it's experimental. And
[00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:49.740]   it does not mean that it doesn't work. This goes back to that
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:53.700]   chapter in the book about how to appeal insurance company denials.
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:56.940]   And I actually have some examples. I have an example in
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:51:01.340]   the book, where I dig deep on the way to fight these appeals.
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:06.020]   And when is first of all argue with evidence, not emotion. A
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:09.500]   lot of times when you get denied some type of care, you try and
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:11.980]   argue, but I really need this or the patient is going to get
[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:15.380]   really sick without it, or this patient's a young mom with three
[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:17.820]   kids, and if she doesn't get the care she needs, she's going to
[00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:20.820]   die and the children will be left without a mom. Those are
[00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:23.340]   all true, you want to have an emotional component to your
[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:26.740]   argument if it's there, but you have to argue with evidence. And
[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:30.420]   so in a case like yours, I have some memos on my website, my
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:34.780]   website is MarshallAllen.com. And you can follow a template.
[00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:37.020]   And I actually learned this template from a woman named
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:40.580]   Lori Todd, who calls herself the insurance warrior. This woman
[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:44.420]   has fought hundreds of insurance cases, and won hundreds of them
[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:48.980]   and the I really take my tactics from Lori. But I have some memos
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:52.780]   on my website that will show you a well informed and well
[00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:56.660]   reasoned appeal to an insurance company. And one of the key
[00:51:56.660 --> 00:52:02.620]   things is use that evidence from your studies, you mentioned that
[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:06.380]   there are studies that show that this particular test is valuable
[00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:10.780]   for identifying this type of heart disease. Cite those you'll
[00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:14.340]   see when you look at the memos on my website, they're pages
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:17.580]   long. And so you want to actually cite the citations. The
[00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:20.180]   other thing you want to look at is your insurance plan. It's
[00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:23.340]   called the summary plan document. This is the document
[00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:28.020]   that's actually a legal contract between you as the member and
[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:31.300]   the insurance company that lays out the insurance companies
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:35.780]   contractual obligation to cover the care that you need. Now, a
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:38.460]   lot of times in that summary plan document, again, it's a
[00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:42.020]   contract. So you don't want to argue with emotion, think about
[00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:44.900]   it like you're negotiating a contract or fighting over the
[00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:48.340]   terms of a contract, they're going to have a thing in the
[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:51.820]   contract that says that your doctor's medical decision making
[00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:54.700]   gets respected, not the insurance company's medical
[00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:57.940]   decision making. So if your doctor orders the test and
[00:52:57.940 --> 00:53:01.340]   recommends it for you, you might be able to argue from that
[00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:04.620]   summary plan document that your doctor has determined that you
[00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:07.980]   need this test, that it's medically necessary, that there
[00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:11.820]   are studies that show that this study that this test you want to
[00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:15.900]   do is credible. And so you need to then make that appeal and in
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:19.260]   an informed way, almost more like a legal argument to that
[00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:21.100]   insurance company to get them to cover it.
[00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:24.540]   Yeah, this comes back to something that Kevin mentioned,
[00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:27.260]   which was when you're looking for that primary care for
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:29.900]   primary care physician that you're working with, it's
[00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:32.780]   important to find someone that aligns with what you're looking
[00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:35.660]   for. So instead of finding someone who's willing to put in
[00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:37.860]   the order for the test you want, find someone who actually
[00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:41.180]   believes in the research that you're interested in and would
[00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:44.860]   back you up in that argument. And so I come back to what you
[00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:47.420]   said earlier, very earlier in this conversation, you said,
[00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:50.620]   it's really important to get the best care and the lowest price.
[00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:55.740]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be. I get
[00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:59.580]   it. Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are
[00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:04.100]   probably desperate for a good hang. So kick 2024 off right by
[00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:07.460]   finally hosting that event. Just make sure you do it the easy
[00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:11.220]   way and let our sponsor Drizly, the go-to app for drink
[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:14.220]   delivery, take care of the supplies. All you need to come
[00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:17.100]   up with is the excuse to get together. It doesn't even have
[00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:19.820]   to be a good one. It could be your dog's birthday, that the
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:23.100]   sun finally came out, or maybe you just want to celebrate that
[00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:26.260]   you got through another week. With Drizly, you can make
[00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:29.900]   hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list, which
[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:32.500]   means you can entice your friends to leave their houses
[00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:35.860]   without ever leaving yours. And since I know you like a good
[00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:39.180]   deal, Drizly compares prices on their massive selection of beer,
[00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:42.180]   wine, and spirits across multiple stores. So when I
[00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:44.500]   really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting
[00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:47.700]   family last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:51.460]   delivered in less than an hour, but I found it for $15 less than
[00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:55.060]   my local liquor store. So whatever the occasion, download
[00:54:55.060 --> 00:55:00.860]   the Drizly app or go to drizly.com. That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com
[00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:04.900]   today. Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:09.980]   When your projects get more complex, finding what you're
[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:13.340]   looking for across your entire workspace gets so much harder.
[00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:16.900]   That's where Notion Q&A comes in. It answers any question you
[00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:20.060]   have, making use of your entire database of knowledge to make
[00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:23.180]   sure the answers are actually helpful. If you're not familiar,
[00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:26.380]   Notion is an amazing product that combines your notes, docs,
[00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:30.220]   and projects all together in one beautiful space. And with Q&A,

[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:38.900]   docs, and meeting notes. I've used it to find information from
[00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:41.860]   old notes, answer questions about a marketing plan, or even
[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:46.340]   find my upcoming travel details, all in seconds. You can also

[00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:48.020]   find the best care? Whether that's finding the right
[00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:51.740]   facilities, picking where to go, finding the best doctors, are
[00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:55.340]   there criteria you use to try to identify where to get the best
[00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:55.700]   care?
[00:56:55.700 --> 00:57:00.140]   It, first of all, the answer is, it's very difficult. And it
[00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:02.660]   depends. It depends on the type of care you need. But let's
[00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:05.980]   just throw out some examples. One of the key indicators of
[00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:10.580]   quality is volume. You want to know how often has this
[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:15.540]   particular doctor or other clinician done the exact thing
[00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:18.140]   that you need to have done. So let's go back to the
[00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:22.620]   colonoscopy example. If you want to find a doctor who does a
[00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:26.900]   really good colonoscopy, you want a doctor who's done enough
[00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:29.980]   colonoscopies to be skilled at it. You don't want to go to a
[00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:33.060]   doctor and find out that you're the first one that they've done.
[00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:36.540]   But that's exactly how they learn, right? They learn by
[00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:39.700]   doing these procedures on patients. I understand that they
[00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:42.740]   have to learn that way. I just don't want to be the first one
[00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:48.260]   doing the procedure on. So ask the doctor how many times they
[00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:52.340]   have done this exact thing that you need. Not something similar,
[00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:56.980]   but the exact one. Then ask them what their outcomes are. Okay,
[00:57:56.980 --> 00:58:00.340]   and by outcomes, how well do the patients fare after the
[00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:04.100]   procedure? Do they suffer infections? Do they suffer
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:07.820]   internal bleeding? Do they suffer injuries? It's going to
[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:11.500]   depend, the complications and the recovery is going to depend
[00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:14.340]   a lot on the type of care that you're needing. So that's going
[00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:15.220]   to vary a lot.
[00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:17.660]   Is there a place to benchmark whatever results you get?
[00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:20.820]   No, this is the problem. There's not. And this is what's
[00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:24.500]   extremely frustrating, extremely frustrating about our health
[00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:28.300]   care system. There is no publicly available data that I
[00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:32.500]   would say is reliable to tell you that one doctor or one
[00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:35.980]   hospital is better than another. In fact, we spent years digging
[00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:40.020]   into this at ProPublica. And you can Google our surgeon scorecard
[00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:45.380]   project. And we did an analysis of Medicare data, looking at
[00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:48.420]   common elective operations like knee replacements and hip
[00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:52.500]   replacements and other types of procedures. And we identified
[00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:56.660]   looking at this data, common complications related to these
[00:58:56.660 --> 00:59:01.260]   procedures. And we published risk adjusted complication rates
[00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:04.980]   for about 15,000 surgeons all over the country in a searchable
[00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:08.620]   format. Now the data is dated, it hasn't been updated. So I
[00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:11.980]   wouldn't recommend going there right now and looking for
[00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:16.580]   current information. But we did this at ProPublica as a team of
[00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:20.220]   journalists because no one else was doing this for the public.
[00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:23.420]   And what we found was really astounding for complications,
[00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:26.940]   readmissions, because of complications like bleeds or
[00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:31.060]   infections or other injuries related to the procedure. Some
[00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:35.220]   doctors had exponentially higher complication rates compared to
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:38.860]   others in the exact same hospital. So again, another
[00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:42.500]   principle I'd look at is hospital quality can't be
[00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:45.980]   judged by the hospital, it really does come down to the
[00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:49.700]   individual clinician who's performing the procedure that
[00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:52.820]   you need, you need to make sure not that the hospital has done a
[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:56.740]   lot of cases, make sure that your particular doctor or
[00:59:56.740 --> 01:00:00.660]   surgeon or clinician has done a lot of those cases. And then
[01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:05.100]   when you ask about outcomes, if they are even tracking their
[01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:09.900]   outcomes and can give you an informed answer, that is a plus,
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:14.220]   that's a mark in their favor. Because many doctors will not
[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:17.140]   even be able to tell you what their outcomes are. They'll be
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:20.540]   vague, they'll say, Oh, no, my patients do great. Or Oh, the
[01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:23.380]   complication rates are actually quite low for these procedures.
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:26.020]   But they'll talk generally like the national or published
[01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:30.500]   complication rates. I want to know what your complications are
[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:34.340]   doctor. And so you need to ask them specifically. And if they
[01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:38.180]   can answer that for you, that's a plus because most of the time,
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:42.100]   our health care system is like a giant assembly line with no
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:45.420]   quality control in place. So they're not checking the
[01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:49.220]   outcomes of patients six months down the road or a year down the
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:52.820]   road or two years down the road. So if your doctor can even give
[01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:56.860]   you an informed answer, that's really a positive and I would I
[01:00:56.860 --> 01:01:00.140]   would recommend pursuing that doctor opposed as opposed to
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:00.700]   others.
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:04.340]   Yeah. One other thing I want to touch on is avoiding care. One
[01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:07.220]   of the things that I read in your book is that there are a
[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:11.140]   lot of doctors that propose medical procedures or medical
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:13.500]   tests that you might not need. And I'd love you to touch a
[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:16.620]   little bit on how you can save money just by asking the right
[01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:17.300]   questions.
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:20.660]   I'm glad you brought that up. Because sometimes we get the
[01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:24.460]   idea that fighting back is like a real confrontational thing or
[01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:27.260]   like I'm going to contest this medical bill or I'm going to sue
[01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:30.540]   them in small claims court if they're overcharging me. One of
[01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:33.580]   the easiest things we can do that can save us the most money
[01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:37.940]   and the most risk of harm, avoiding medical care you don't
[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:41.420]   need. They estimate when they study the health care that's
[01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:45.300]   provided that as much as 25% of the health care that gets
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:48.460]   provided is not actually necessary. And this is things
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:52.740]   like having you do some type of an imaging test that you don't
[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:55.980]   actually need or putting you on a drug that you don't need. Or
[01:01:55.980 --> 01:02:00.340]   if you look at the studies about back surgery, it's really common
[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:03.140]   that back surgery gets done on patients who would have done a
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:07.300]   lot better with physical therapy or chiropractic instead of a
[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:12.220]   invasive operation. So I think that the best question to ask
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:15.100]   your doctor to make sure you don't get care that you don't
[01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:19.540]   need is what happens if we wait. So let's say your doctor is
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:24.380]   offering you some type of discretionary test or procedure
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:29.260]   or drug. If you ask doctor, what happens if we don't do this
[01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:34.500]   right now, and just wait and see or try something else. It causes
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:37.500]   the clinician to reframe the conversation. So all of a
[01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:39.740]   sudden, they're not talking about the risk of doing the
[01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:42.620]   procedure. They're talking about the risk of not doing the
[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:46.500]   procedure or the test or the blood work. Because every single
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:51.020]   one of these tests comes with a risk. Every procedure comes with
[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:55.420]   a risk. There's no such thing as a low risk elective operation.
[01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:58.420]   For example, I have talked to families who have had their
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:01.860]   children die because of low risk elective operations that went
[01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:06.860]   wrong. And so I encourage people ask what happens if we wait, see
[01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:09.900]   if waiting might be an option. See if there might be something
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:13.660]   less invasive that could be done or less expensive that could be
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:17.380]   done to see if these problems can resolve themselves in
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:20.300]   different ways. And I think that will protect people from a lot
[01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:21.620]   of care that they don't need.
[01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:25.940]   Yeah, I've seen a couple doctors for something called a neuroma,
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:30.660]   which is like a enlarged nerve, and in my foot, and I read one
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:34.260]   doctor, their path was let's try these cortisone injections and
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:36.420]   then surgery. And this other doctor was like, actually, I
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:39.780]   have a pharmacist that makes this compound that helps reduce
[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:43.660]   the swelling of nerves. And it totally worked. And on my right
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:47.660]   foot, the result was about five years ago, I had surgery because
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:50.220]   one thing didn't work. And on my left foot, it flared up
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:54.700]   recently, and a $70 it wasn't covered by insurance, but a $70
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:58.260]   compound that was effectively like a lotion had the same
[01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:04.020]   effect in terms of no pain as a surgery, which was wild. So I
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:06.540]   think sometimes it's searching online to read about these
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:09.780]   things. Sometimes it might be seen a few doctors. But yeah, if
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:13.460]   ever the result is the only thing left is surgery, I would
[01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:14.780]   say maybe get a second opinion.
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:18.340]   Because second opinions are also essential, right? Especially if
[01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:22.220]   it's something that's more invasive or expensive, make sure
[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:24.740]   that you really need it. And most care that we get is
[01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:29.500]   actually not emergency care. And so usually you do have the time
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:32.380]   to take to do a little more research to get a second
[01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:35.780]   opinion, just to make sure that what's being presented to you is
[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:37.180]   absolutely necessary.
[01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:40.300]   Yeah, that makes sense. So one thing we didn't touch on that I
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:43.940]   want to jump into is for someone who works at an employer, we
[01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:46.500]   could start with employer, but also, you know, you have a
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:48.820]   podcast, maybe one day, it's a full time business, and I'm
[01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:53.900]   looking on the exchange. How do you save money by but also pick
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:55.980]   the right health care plan. There's a lot of options
[01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:59.420]   nowadays. It's many employers mine included offer, you know,
[01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:04.020]   PPS, EPOs, HMOs, high deductible health plans. How do you help
[01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:05.660]   people think about those decisions?
[01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:10.540]   Well, it's really a hard answer to give in a general way,
[01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:14.460]   because everyone's situation is so specific. So some people have
[01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:19.060]   kids. Some people have health problems or ongoing health
[01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:23.460]   concerns. Some people are very low risk and willing to take
[01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:27.220]   more risk themselves. So it's a hard question to answer
[01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:30.460]   generally. But let me just give you a few things since we're
[01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:33.860]   talking about hacking the healthcare system that people
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:37.540]   can try. If you are a healthy person and your family is
[01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:41.860]   relatively healthy, you might not need the complete amount of
[01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:44.780]   coverage that's going to come with the highest premium and
[01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:49.300]   lowest deductible, you might say, look, I can take more risk
[01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:52.860]   and it's a trade off because you're going to save on your
[01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:56.820]   premium. And you're going to maybe take the risk of paying
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:06:00.060]   more out of pocket down the road, but a high deductible
[01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:03.060]   plan might make a lot of sense for you. If you're on the
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:07.180]   individual market, you might benefit by going with something
[01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:10.140]   more like a health sharing plan. There's these different health
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:12.980]   sharing plans, some of them are faith based, some of them are
[01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:17.220]   not, where it's not actually insurance. So this is the risk
[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:20.540]   you're taking. It's not an insurance product. It's an
[01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:23.700]   agreement that people have made to pay one another's medical
[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:28.220]   bills. The premiums on those health sharing plans are much,
[01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:32.180]   much lower for a family or for an individual than your premiums
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:36.900]   would be on the health insurance market. And you might want to
[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:40.740]   pair that with a direct primary care relationship. So direct
[01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:44.100]   primary care are doctors, and this is becoming more popular,
[01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:48.620]   who are taking payment directly from the patient, say it's $100
[01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:52.700]   a month or $200 a month for all the care that you need. It's
[01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:57.380]   much more specialized in terms of the care that you need. And
[01:06:57.420 --> 01:07:00.820]   they're catering to you more like they're paying customers so
[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:02.980]   that you're going to get much more of their time and much more
[01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:06.260]   of their attention. So you might find if you're looking at the
[01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:10.140]   individual market, that going on a health sharing plan, and a
[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:13.660]   direct primary care relationship with a doctor is going to get
[01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:17.740]   you better care at a much lower price. It's just that there's
[01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:21.380]   more risk involved. So it's really hard to answer these
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:25.300]   questions in a way that's going to satisfy everybody. Because
[01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:27.980]   everybody has different needs, and they have different
[01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:29.460]   tolerance for risk.
[01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:32.180]   Yeah, what a couple of things that I found going through this
[01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:35.380]   search process. So I'm very intrigued by not in the
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:38.340]   individual market working with an employer plan, but these cost
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:41.140]   sharing programs are super interesting. And I assume that
[01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:44.180]   if it's individuals agreeing to pay bills, that you actually
[01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:46.900]   probably are eligible for whatever the cash price is, and
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:49.420]   you're not dealing with insurance negotiated prices. Is
[01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:49.860]   that right?
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:52.980]   Right? Yeah. And it's going to have more friction when you go
[01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:56.060]   to the doctor, your doctor might be like, what health sharing
[01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:58.780]   plan, what are you talking about, there might be more
[01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:01.260]   friction on that end, you might have to pay more of the money
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:04.900]   up front and then get it reimbursed. So the hassle factor
[01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:09.020]   might be greater. But think about it this way. I mean, your
[01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:13.340]   premiums could easily be 2000 a month for a family. And you
[01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:18.500]   might be saving $1,000 or more per month on your premiums. And
[01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:22.860]   so look at it as paying yourself a salary of $1,000 a
[01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:26.500]   month, by saying I'm going to engage with the healthcare
[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:29.820]   system in a different way. And actually, there's a lot of
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:33.900]   growth in these plans in these health sharing plans and with
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:37.420]   direct primary care, because actually people are quite
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:40.340]   satisfied with them. Some of them are scams. So again, you
[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:43.340]   have to do your research, make sure you're not getting ripped
[01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:47.740]   off, check your reviews, get references to actual patients
[01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:50.620]   who have used these plans and make sure you understand what
[01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:53.700]   you're getting into. But I have found I have several friends
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:55.820]   who are on these plans, and they've had good experiences
[01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:56.260]   with them.
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:59.340]   Yeah, that's so fascinating. In years that I've considered a
[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:03.140]   high deductible health plan, I think pairing it with an HSA is
[01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:06.260]   amazing, because you can put pre tax money in, you can take it
[01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:10.140]   out, it can grow. Oftentimes, your employer will contribute to
[01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:12.700]   it. I think Google has one of the most interesting high
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:16.900]   deductible health plans for employees because they give you
[01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:20.740]   enough money that you effectively meet your deductible
[01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:22.740]   for the high deductible health plan. So you get the low
[01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:25.700]   premium, but the risk is taken away because they're giving you
[01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:28.220]   this money and they're giving it to you in an HSA, which you
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:30.020]   don't have to use this year you can use forever.
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:34.860]   Yeah, so I love the HSA compared to the FSA, the flexible
[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:38.580]   spending account where it's use it or lose it. I really get
[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:41.620]   frustrated with the use it or lose it idea with healthcare
[01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:44.660]   dollars because what you end up having happen if you haven't
[01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:48.100]   spent your flexible spending account money is you're like
[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:51.340]   trying to find Okay, what can I spend in the month of December
[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:55.260]   to get rid of this money. And it's just really I don't like
[01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:59.340]   the FSAs. But I agree with you, those HSAs are good. And my book
[01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:02.780]   has actually three chapters in it for employers. And I'm hoping
[01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:06.740]   that employers will get more engaged with this because if
[01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:11.180]   employers can work together with their employees to design better
[01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:15.780]   benefit plans, they could save hundreds or 1000s of dollars for
[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:18.860]   every healthcare encounter for their employees. And then the
[01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:21.940]   employer saves exponentially more than that. So the
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:25.260]   incentives really are aligned for employees and employers to
[01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:28.540]   work together to tackle this problem. And I actually have a
[01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:32.140]   much greater hope that they will be able to figure out our
[01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:35.940]   healthcare reform. And it can be consumer driven, and it can be
[01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:39.980]   driven by the market, instead of being driven by something like
[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:43.980]   government regulation or politicians. We haven't seen our
[01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:47.980]   politicians on either side of the aisle, put real solutions in
[01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:50.420]   place that are helping the public. And so I just don't
[01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:53.620]   trust that's going to happen. So I think the employers and the
[01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:55.980]   working Americans are really our greatest hope.
[01:10:55.980 --> 01:11:00.380]   Yeah, yeah, when it comes one, one quick fun thing on FSAs,
[01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:02.900]   something to consider at the end of the year, if you're running
[01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:05.740]   up with some balance that you can't carry over, I think you
[01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:08.180]   can carry over about $500 the next year. But if you have
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:11.060]   dollars you can't carry over, there might be things maybe call
[01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:13.900]   local shelter, see if their product medical products they
[01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:16.580]   need, you might be able to buy them with your FSA dollars
[01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:19.020]   before they expire and donate things.
[01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:20.340]   That's a great suggestion.
[01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:23.580]   Are there any hacks for saving money on prescription drugs?
[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:26.660]   Yes, absolutely. I mean, one of the simplest ones is just look
[01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:30.460]   up good rx. Your listeners have probably heard of good rx.com.
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:34.900]   It's a coupon system, where they will show you the good rx price
[01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:38.740]   at different pharmacies in your community. That's a great place
[01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:42.900]   to look. Also see if there's a pharmacy that has a membership
[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:45.580]   plan near you. One that I mentioned is called Good
[01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:48.260]   Shepherd Pharmacy. It's in Memphis, Tennessee, they have a
[01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:53.340]   mail order system where they you charge they charge $5 for a
[01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:56.700]   generic drug per month, which often if you're not on a plan,
[01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:59.900]   or let's say you're on a sharing plan or uninsured or self pay,
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:03.300]   that could be a better deal for you. And then check the prices
[01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:07.140]   at different pharmacies. Consumer Reports has done this.
[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:10.860]   Other studies have done this, where if you need a drug, it
[01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:14.620]   could be hundreds of dollars more or less just at a different
[01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:17.740]   pharmacy in your community. So check the prices at different
[01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:20.420]   pharmacies, and you'll see that there could be huge variation.
[01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:23.940]   Is there one that does better Walgreens, CVS, Costco, that
[01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:25.460]   kind of traditionally is the best?
[01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:28.940]   I think one study I saw showed that Costco overall had the
[01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:32.940]   lowest prices. But when they compared the good rx prices to
[01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:36.500]   all the prices, the good rx prices were usually better. The
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:40.340]   caveat with good rx is that it's great for getting an individual
[01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:42.980]   medication. But if you're getting that individual
[01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:45.660]   medication at multiple facilities from lots of
[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:48.420]   different pharmacists, then you're not going to have one
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:52.020]   pharmacist that sees all of your medications that you're taking.
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:54.420]   That can be a little more risky because some of these
[01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:57.500]   medications can interact in negative ways with one another.
[01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:01.780]   And so good rx is good if you just want the one drug, but you
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:04.860]   really want to make sure that your primary care doctor or
[01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:08.860]   somebody knows all the prescriptions you're on, so they
[01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:11.140]   can make sure you don't have side effects from something
[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:13.740]   that's interacting in a bad way with another.
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:15.940]   You've spent a lot of time researching this industry and it
[01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:19.020]   really shows I love the book. What's next for you?
[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:24.900]   I am actually on a campaign to boost the healthcare literacy of
[01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:28.580]   working Americans and employers throughout the entire country.
[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:32.700]   And so I have started a side company that I'm calling Allen
[01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:36.980]   Health Academy. And this company exists to boost the health
[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:40.580]   literacy so that people understand how to navigate these
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:44.060]   financial pitfalls of our healthcare system. And the first
[01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:48.100]   product I'm putting out is a series of videos, a video
[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:50.900]   curriculum that I'm calling the Never Pay Pathway. It's just
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:55.220]   based on the book. It's taking all of the actionable how to
[01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:58.780]   hacks in the book and translating them into a series
[01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:02.420]   of short three to five minute videos so people can learn how
[01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:05.100]   to get their medical records, how to get an itemized medical
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:08.420]   bill, how to look up the billing codes, how to price it, how to
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:11.180]   sue in small claims court, basically all the things that
[01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:15.220]   we've talked about in this podcast and more that will help
[01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:19.220]   people understand the healthcare system. It'll demystify a lot of
[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:22.220]   the healthcare system. It'll show them how to protect
[01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:25.460]   themselves and how to save a lot of money. And this is something
[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:28.940]   it's actually been supported by a really successful crowdfunding
[01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:33.740]   campaign on Indiegogo. I had supporters and backers raise and
[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:38.140]   contribute $55,000 to produce these videos so that they're
[01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:41.220]   really going to be engaging and interesting. And I'm hoping to
[01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:44.740]   launch those early next year. And so if people are interested
[01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:48.980]   in those, they can go to my website, MarshallAllen.com and
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:52.060]   sign up for my newsletter. And that way, you'll be informed
[01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:56.900]   when those videos come out. And my goal, honestly, Chris is to,
[01:14:56.900 --> 01:14:59.940]   I want to roll these out to every employer sponsored health
[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:04.940]   plan in America. I want there to be an army of informed healthcare
[01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:09.300]   consumers, so that they can contest these outrageous medical
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:15.260]   bills, they can push back. I mean, if we had even 1% of the
[01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:19.540]   Americans covered by employer sponsored or individual plans,
[01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:23.180]   or people who are self pay, there's about 190 million
[01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:27.980]   Americans in that category. If 1% of those people were to push
[01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:32.220]   back and demand a fair deal, I think that it would no longer be
[01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:36.100]   profitable for our healthcare system to prey on us financially
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:39.820]   the way it's been done. If 1% of people demanded the prices up
[01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:43.660]   front, and made sure they were fair prices, it would completely
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:46.380]   remove the ability of the healthcare system to hide the
[01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:49.940]   prices from us. And if we sued in small claims court, when we
[01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:53.180]   got one of these like surprise out of network bills, or
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:56.780]   unjustifiably high medical bills, it would reduce the
[01:15:56.780 --> 01:16:00.220]   incentive to send us these outrageous medical bills, it
[01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:03.540]   would be so expensive for them to do it. And so I think that we
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:08.060]   do have the power to bring about real change in healthcare, but
[01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:13.180]   we need to equip and educate the public, and then show them how
[01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:16.980]   to use this leverage to really hack the system, so that it
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:19.660]   benefits them and so that it can benefit all of us.
[01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:23.540]   Yeah, I hope that the examples I've shared inspire a few people
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:26.660]   listening to go back and look at some of the bills you've paid,
[01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:29.580]   and see if there's anything erroneous and see if there are
[01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:33.540]   any extreme overcharging, and push back and see what happens.
[01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:36.940]   And so I appreciate all the feedback you've given all the
[01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:39.860]   tips you've shared all the hacks you've shared. And you know, I
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:41.620]   hope it inspires people to save more.
[01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:44.860]   Yeah, thank you. And one more thing I want to add, I'm
[01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:48.340]   available, like people can message me on my website, they
[01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:52.260]   can email me, I do enjoy helping people with their bills. So if
[01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:56.380]   anybody has any questions, or they feel confused, feel free to
[01:16:56.380 --> 01:17:00.420]   reach out. And I talk to people almost every day about these
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:03.300]   issues. It's really become a hobby of mine. And I really do
[01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:06.460]   enjoy it and get a kick out of it. So I'd love to hear from
[01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:06.980]   anybody.
[01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:09.940]   Awesome. Hopefully people reach out if they need help. And thank
[01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:11.020]   you so much for being here.
[01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:13.940]   Thank you. I really appreciate the conversation.
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:18.340]   That was amazing. I can tell you that the first thing I'm doing
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:21.020]   next is negotiating down the price of that crappy medical
[01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:24.260]   booth. But in all seriousness, I wish that none of you ever have
[01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:27.420]   to deal with what Marshall and I discussed. But as I learned this
[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:30.300]   year, it's unfortunately likely that you will. So I hope this
[01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:33.340]   episode was helpful. If you have any feedback or questions on
[01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:36.780]   this episode, another episode, or you just want to say hi, I'm
[01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:41.060]   Chris at all the hacks calm or I'm at Hutchins on Twitter. And
[01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:44.180]   to anyone celebrating this week. Merry Christmas from Mexico.
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:45.340]   See you all next week.
