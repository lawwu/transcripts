[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:32.700]   But one of the things that was valuable for him was he bought the safety of his family as he was leaving with an old handgun that he had, which the local rebel leader wanted.
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:41.220]   And so he was able to trade and barter his handgun for the protection and the safety of his family in exchange for
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:14:10.900]   a life sentence.
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:10.900]   The local rebel leaders guarantee that no, he wouldn't actually come after him and he wouldn't kill and persecute his family.
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:10.900]   So that's a scenario that's impossible to predict.
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:10.900]   Specifically, it's easy to predict if you just look around the world. You see this happen every day all day all around the world, but it's hard to predict specifically that that would happen to you. But the point was they were in an economy very heavily gun-controlled economy and lots of laws and whatnot in the Philippines.

[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.140]   So just one story and I'll share more stories in today's show.
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.180]   Let's talk about what are the purposes for guns.
[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:28.220]   I see three basic purposes: self-defense, offensive uses and personal enjoyment.
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:38.740]   In terms of self-defense, the first one, which will be either important or unimportant, depending on where you are, is self-defense against animals, against non-human animals.
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.580]   This is something that many people who live in the Philippines are not aware of.
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:40.580]   This is something that many people who live in the Philippines are not aware of.

[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:10.260]   It's just not a part of their daily life.
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:10.260]   The only thing they know of in terms of animal danger is the neighbor's dog that comes out and barks with them from the front yard on their morning run.
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:10.260]   This is something that many in the rural environment certainly think about frequently.
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:10.260]   There are many people throughout the United States and throughout the world who would never venture away from their house, property or vehicle without a significantly sized handset.

[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:38.320]   Then of course they would have the smallest, the compact version, which is a Glock 26.
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:45:08.340]   And so it's just a wonderful, ubiquitous commodity gun.
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:08.340]   You can buy cheaper, and there are many brands that are cheaper that are very effective.
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:08.340]   However, from an investment perspective, I think you're well served by buying something that,
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:08.340]   if you ever needed to sell it, if you ever needed to trade it,
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:08.340]   you're buying something that has a broad appeal.
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:08.340]   If you buy another brand, for example, something like the CZP-10,
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:08.340]   a lot of the gun people really love the CZP-10,
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:08.340]   the CZP-10,
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:08.340]   but if you buy another brand, for example, something like the CZP-10,
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:08.340]   you, a lot of the gun people really love the CZP-10,
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:08.340]   a lot of the gun people really love the CZP-10,
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:08.340]   but if you buy another brand, for example, something like the CZP-10,
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:38.360]   the CZP-10,
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:38.360]   if you buy another brand, for example, something like the CZP-10,
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:38.360]   if you buy another brand, for example, something like the CZP-10,
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:38.360]   if you buy another brand, for example, something like the CZP-10,
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:38.360]   if you buy another brand, for example, something like the CZP-10,
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:38.360]   if you buy another brand, for example, something like the CZP-10,
[00:45:38.380 --> 00:46:08.380]   I don't think you'd be wrong to have a revolver and a Glock 19.
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:08.380]   Start with a revolver,
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:08.380]   and then you can train with it.
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:08.380]   If you have a gun,
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:08.380]   and you're going to train with it,
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:08.380]   and you're going to train with it,
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:08.380]   and you're going to train with it,
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:08.380]   and you're going to train with it,
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:08.380]   and you're going to train with it,
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:08.380]   and you're going to train with it,
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:08.380]   and you're going to train with it,
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:08.380]   and you're going to train with it,
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:08.380]   and you're going to train with it,
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:08.380]   and you're going to train with it,
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:08.380]   and you're going to train with it,
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:08.380]   and you're going to train with it,
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:08.380]   and you're going to train with it, and that's probably the most important thing is to have a gun that you're going to train with it.
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:38.400]   and you're going to train with it, and that's probably the most important thing is to have a gun that you're going to train with it.

[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:57.980]   Same thing with violence. I'm not scared of violence, but I want to make sure that violence is always horrible and awful and presented as repulsive, not as attractive. And I think we need to do the same thing with our children. We need to expose our children to violence.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:26.960]   I'm not opposed to martial arts. I'm not opposed to somebody learning how to fight effectively. I think that's important. But that fighting cannot be disconnected. The violence cannot be disconnected with the moral foundation of right and wrong. People like to make fun about it after a shooting when someone talks about violent video games. I don't see how you can make fun of it. When you feed the violent tendencies and make it a sport, that has a corrosive effect on the child.
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:55.200]   In exactly the same way that pornography does. If you feed the sexual lust and objectification of women and sex the way that pornography does, it has a corrosive effect on your soul. And you stop viewing people the same way. You start viewing people as animals and not as people. And so you have to accompany physical instruction with moral instruction. Those two have to be there.
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:11:24.440]  , and I think that especially for children, we have to do a good job of making sure that our children live in a morally clear universe. When is force appropriate and when is not? When is violence appropriate and when is not? I ask you those questions. Here are some challenging questions for you to consider. I ask you this question. When is it okay for you to hit a man? When is it okay for you to hit a woman?
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:25.040]   When is it okay for you to hit a woman?

[01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:48.880]   You might say, well, if somebody has a, a, uh, uh, uh, an incurable disease and they're living in great pain and suffering, then I'm going to support their right to take their own life with the help of the physician.
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:55.400]   Well, if you support that, then it's hard for you not to, to, to, it's hard for you to ever say anything bad about suicide.
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:56.000]   It really is.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:03.580]   And be consistent because, and this is what's happened in Europe with, with physician assisted suicide is the definition of what is pain and suffering.
[01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:03.940]   It's a definition of what is pain and suffering.
[01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:03.940]   It's a definition of what is pain and suffering.

[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:33.640]   But yet to that person, it may feel like unbearable pain and suffering.
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:33.640]   Now in a sense, if you're supportive of suicide, suicide by gun is probably one of the best ways to go.
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:33.640]   If I think through all the different ways that I could commit suicide if I wanted to, I would choose suicide by gun.
[01:17:33.660 --> 01:18:03.340]   I would choose suicide by gun.
[01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:03.340]   I would choose suicide by gun.
