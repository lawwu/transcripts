[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.200]   study other related topics. And today we're going to do that with the subject of guns.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.560]   Quite frankly, a gun can be a wonderful, wonderful investment. In fact, it's actually very hard
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.480]   to lose money with the purchase of a gun, unless you do it the wrong way. I'm going
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.480]   to tell you today some ideas on how you can do it in an intelligent and practical way.
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.520]   In the world of investing, people frequently talk about things that have intrinsic value.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.360]   This often comes up when talking about monetary theory. Many people get frustrated with fiat
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.680]   currencies like the US dollar and like the euro, like basically every modern currency
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.500]   around the world and say, "Well, it doesn't have any intrinsic value." And so they like
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.520]   to compare that to something like a gold or silver coin and say, "Well, at least the
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.700]   gold and silver coin has an intrinsic value, a value of the metal." And although I will
[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.320]   concede that a gold or silver coin has a little bit more intrinsic value than something like
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:52.120]   a $20 bill, I don't actually buy that argument because I can't do a lot with a gold or silver
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:58.160]   coin. I don't know what intrinsic value means, but I can say it doesn't have much
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:07.160]   practical value. That gold or silver coin serves no purpose other than to sit there.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.320]   Now of course, my friends in the hard money camp will quickly say, "Well, Joshua, you
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.040]   can make a beautiful piece of jewelry with gold." That's true. Or, "You can use
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.320]   silver in industrial purposes." That's true, but it can't do that for me. I don't
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.320]   take coins and turn them into jewelry. I don't take silver coins and turn them into electric
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.340]   doodads or electronic doodads. I can't do anything with it. It doesn't help me in
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:37.120]   any way. So really, it doesn't have that much intrinsic value to me. If I'm starving
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.920]   and I've got a gold coin, well, guess what? I'll get rid of the gold coin and buy some
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.400]   food. If I'm thirsty and I have no water, I'll get rid of the gold coin and I'll
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.320]   trade it for water to save my life. It doesn't have that much intrinsic value. On the other
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:59.560]   hand, a functional firearm actually does have intrinsic value because it does something
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:07.400]   really, really important and really, really valuable. And this is the case with many tools
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.240]   that we face in our life. A tool that can be used, a shovel has intrinsic value. It
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.840]   can perform the function of digging a hole. A hammer has an intrinsic value. It can perform
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.280]   the function of banging in a nail. A chainsaw has intrinsic value. It can perform the function
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.560]   of cutting down wood. A car has intrinsic value. It can perform the function of transporting
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.460]   you and your goods from one place to another. But most of those things are not quite regulated
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:42.080]   the way that a gun is. And most of those things are not quite so portable as a gun is. And
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:50.340]   most of those things don't quite perform the same functional value that a gun does.
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.920]   So a gun is something that has true intrinsic value. Now you better think ahead and recognize
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.000]   that if you don't have any ammunition to load into that gun, it doesn't have that
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.800]   much value. But still, ammunition is much easier to come by than guns. And so they're
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:13.360]   a really, really good and interesting investment. Now there are downsides to guns, of course.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.300]   They are, in many countries of the world, heavily regulated. It's hard to get them
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:26.360]   across a national border. There are other assets that have many benefits that are superior
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.120]   to guns in that regard. You can load up some Bitcoin in a digital wallet, memorize all
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.720]   of your security keys, and that Bitcoin can be carried across any border in the world
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.400]   for you to use. That's what's so valuable about something like a cryptocurrency. So
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.240]   a gun is hard to get across a national border, but it's actually maybe not that hard. The
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.320]   US government and the Mexicans seem to have a good deal of sending some back and forth
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.340]   from one party to the other across our southern Mexican border. So you should be able to figure
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.240]   that out if you ever had to figure that out. One of the benefits of a gun in terms of its
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.920]   monetary value, it's durable, relatively small, it can be stored without any significant
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:12.400]   trouble. You can tuck it aside and stick it away for a long time. As long as it's stored
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.760]   properly, it doesn't fall apart, it doesn't stop working, it doesn't pose any danger
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.360]   to anybody if it's stored away. So that's a benefit. A disadvantage is, of course, that
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:31.360]   a gun is very subject to political risk. And in this case, it shares the stage in terms
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.540]   of political risk with most other assets. The president of your country can start talking
[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:44.480]   about new tariffs and all of a sudden your investments can plummet in value. It's called
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.580]   political risk. The president of your country or the prime minister or the great leader
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:58.420]   of your country can declare gold coins illegal, like the US government did about 70 something
[00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:04.180]   years ago or so, and say that they are forbidden for you to have. Because after all, one day
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.240]   they're fine, but another day they're not fine. You just can't have them. That's what
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.340]   happens with gold coins. And of course, there are other things that can happen. Bitcoin
[00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.540]   or other cryptocurrencies face similar political risk. And guns face that exact same
[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.540]   political risk. Because after all, the government of your country or your state might wake up
[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.580]   someday and decide, "You know what? A standard capacity magazine for your firearm that you
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:33.300]   have plenty of that's very useful to you and sits locked in your safe, well, it's built
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.820]   from the factory to take 30 cartridges within it. But we've decided that 30 cartridges is
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.980]   too many and nobody needs 30 cartridges. So we're going to outlaw that 30 cartridge magazine
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:50.860]   and make you a criminal because you own such a device, as has happened in various US American
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:57.980]   states in the past few years." Or as the state of California recently came out with, "We've
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:05.740]   decided that the functional way that your firearm operates is not satisfactory. We're
[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.500]   going to require you to completely change the design to minimize its function, and if
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:16.500]   not, you're a criminal." So of course, you are subject to political risk. It's a major
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:23.020]   problem with guns, but that also can be a major benefit. If you want to see the value
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:28.140]   of your investments go up, just hope that the government starts making noise about outlawing
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:34.980]   your investments. They go up quickly. You can sell a gun more in the inner city of a
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:40.620]   big... Sell a gun for substantially more in the inner city of any major city in the United
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:46.620]   States of America than you can going out in the countryside because of the change of laws.
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:50.860]   A disadvantage of guns is an investment. They, of course, don't create dividends. This is
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:56.140]   a major problem, same problem that we face with an asset class like raw land or gold
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:03.700]   coins. They're not really productive. They're not creating an income. So that's a problem.
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:08.460]   Guns aren't really fungible the way that other things are, but gun components, of course,
[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:16.820]   could be. Fungibility is the property whereby one part or quantity of something can be replaced
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:23.660]   by another part or quantity of something else. If you have a $20 bill and you give that $20
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:31.220]   bill to person A, and then person B gives you a $20 bill, those $20 bills are fungible.
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.860]   They're fully interchangeable. And of course, guns lack that a little bit. They're not fully
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:40.940]   fungible. But many of the parts and components actually can be. So it's an interesting thought
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:49.020]   market to apply to it. Guns do have a broad marketability. In fact, much broader than
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:55.940]   something like a gold or silver coin, in my opinion. But that marketability is not unlimited.
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:02.120]   You always face the challenge of who will buy this asset from me if I want to sell it.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:06.820]   You can sell that gold coin and you know right where to go. Many more people would be interested
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:12.020]   in buying a gun, but it's hard to know how to start that conversation with them. And
[00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:16.220]   guns have the benefit of they can be sold quickly, but not necessarily immediately,
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:21.100]   at least not for the highest of prices. And so they don't have quite the same marketability
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:26.420]   as currency does. You can take a $20 bill and you can sell it to anybody, anywhere in
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:33.680]   the world for $20. Currency is the most marketable commodity that exists. Everything else has
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:43.220]   certain disadvantages. And so there's a very valuable case to be made for guns as a quality
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:49.420]   investment item. But of course, the value of guns goes far beyond that. Both the personal
[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:57.380]   benefit and also the personal risk. A gun is one of those things where if you need it,
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:02.780]   you really need it. And if you have it in your hand when you really need it, you probably
[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:07.900]   wouldn't part with it for any amount of money. On the other hand, it is something that you
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:15.540]   have to take great care with because it poses certain inherent dangers, certain inherent
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:20.940]   characteristics that can cause you great harm, cause your family great harm, cause others
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:27.580]   great harm. So I want to give you some thoughtful analysis and advice. And my hope is that this
[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:34.300]   show will be helpful to you if you are not a gun owner to give you basically a track
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:40.300]   to run on. I hope that this show will be helpful to you if you are a gun owner that you can
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:44.340]   pass along as some practical advice to other people. I'm just going to give it to you from
[00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:49.760]   my own perspective and my own analysis of the market. It's important that you know first
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:54.380]   off that I don't really consider myself much of a gun guy or a gun nut. That's just not
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:11:01.940]   really me. I enjoy, it's always fun to shoot guns, but I'm not one who obsesses about all
[00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:06.060]   of the details and characteristics. I have a broad generalized knowledge, but it's not
[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:12.580]   that big of an interest for me nor is it that big a part of my life. So I probably approach
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:19.780]   the subject in a more practical way than a lot of other people do. And I am however firmly
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:28.860]   convinced of the value of guns for you, for you to own. And let me give you just a few
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:37.660]   pieces of our way to articulate that. The time at which you have to think about getting
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:43.900]   a gun is not when you need it, because when you need it, it'll be too late. And the value
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:49.460]   is hard to say exactly when. In just a moment I'm going to go into the purposes for guns,
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.820]   what are the actual purposes for them, because once you understand your purpose for the gun,
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:58.100]   you'll understand what to get, how to get it, etc. But sometimes those things are hard
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:05.100]   to predict. I'll give you just one story by way of example. I know a guy who lived in
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:09.540]   the southern Philippines. And one of the interesting things about the Philippines, it's a very
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:15.740]   fractured nation geographically, made up of I think thousands, at least hundreds of individual
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:19.860]   islands, only some of which are occupied and some are not. But my friend was down in the
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:24.900]   south. And in the Philippines, there is a strong Muslim population in the south and
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:30.980]   many hardcore Muslims who are very focused on building a Muslim culture and a Muslim
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:37.440]   society. And they are in a war of sorts with the central government. They're the rebels
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:45.060]   in the local area. Well, my friend had a business on one of these Philippine islands and there
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:50.620]   was a terrorist attack in the local area and it wound up destroying his business. Several
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:56.380]   dozen people were massacred in the town. The town then quickly cleared out and my friend's
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:01.580]   business collapsed. He ran out of money, his business collapsed, and he was in a very difficult
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:08.740]   place. Well, what wound up happening was as he was trying to put his life back together,
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:13.740]   he was in a situation where he was leaving to go to another place to try to earn money,
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:19.060]   but he wasn't able to take his entire family with him. But one of the things that was valuable
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:29.020]   for him was he bought the safety of his family as he was leaving with an old handgun that
[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:35.940]   he had, which the local rebel leader wanted. And so he was able to trade and barter his
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:42.060]   handgun for the protection and the safety of his family in exchange for the local rebel
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:47.940]   leader's guarantee that no, he wouldn't actually come after him and he wouldn't kill and persecute
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:55.460]   his family. So that's a scenario that's impossible to predict specifically. It's easy to predict
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:59.180]   if you just look around the world. You see this happen every day, all day, all around
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:04.700]   the world, but it's hard to predict specifically that that would happen to you. But the point
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:10.380]   was they were in an economy, a very heavily gun-controlled economy and lots of laws and
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:15.940]   whatnot in the Philippines, but they were in an economy where the money had less value
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:20.140]   than the tools. So just one story and I'll share more stories in today's show. Let's
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:26.060]   talk about what are the purposes for guns. I see three basic purposes, self-defense,
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:30.940]   offensive uses, and personal enjoyment. In terms of self-defense, the first one, which
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:35.900]   will be either important or unimportant depending on where you are, is self-defense against
[00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:41.020]   animals, against non-human animals. This is something that many people who live in an
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:47.380]   urban environment don't think about. It's just not a part of their daily life. The only
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:52.980]   thing they know of in terms of animal danger is the neighbor's dog that comes out and barks
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:57.140]   at them from the front yard on their morning run. This is, of course, something that many
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:01.780]   in the rural environment certainly think about frequently. And there are many people throughout
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:06.260]   the United States and throughout the world who would never venture away from their house,
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:13.300]   property, or vehicle without a significantly sized handgun on their hip for protection
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:19.980]   against bears or wolves or similar types of animals. So animal self-defense. Animal self-defense
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:25.220]   is very hard to – it's very specific to what you're concerned about. If you're
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:29.860]   concerned about snakes, then you'll carry one certain type of gun. My family grew up
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:33.740]   in the ranching family. So, of course, if you're out on your horse and you're riding
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.860]   across the mountains and you need a gun that's going to kill a rattlesnake, you don't need
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:41.300]   a hand cannon. You need a small – a very small gun to shoot a rattlesnake with. But
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.280]   that's very different than if you're in bear country and you need to protect yourself
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:51.820]   against a bear. I am incompetent to give advice on that subject. And so that's not a significant
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:56.740]   factor for me and for this show. If you are worried about that, you'll, of course, make
[00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:02.540]   your own decisions. Self-defense. The second category is against individual criminals,
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:07.980]   either random or specific threats to your life. Now, if you have specific threats to
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:12.780]   your life, if at all possible, I'd encourage you to eliminate the cause of those threats.
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:18.700]   I've never been threatened by a local gang warlord who wants to say, "Well, Joshua,
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.340]   I'm going to come and get you because I'm messing with his business." I'm not involved
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:26.340]   in that and I hope that you're not involved in that either. I want to steer clear of anything
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:33.380]   like that and just simply eliminate the risk. If you're under threat by your criminal competitors,
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:38.580]   the best way to minimize a threat is stop being their criminal competitors. Stop breaking
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:42.660]   the law. Stop being a criminal competitor and then the threat may go away. The way to
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:48.420]   handle that threat is not to arm up and get ready for war. So please, just avoid that
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:52.860]   threat. It's a lot easier to always avoid that threat whenever possible. The individual
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:59.340]   criminals that would be more appropriate to consider are either random acts where you're
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:06.340]   riding the train to work and some guy comes out and starts attacking people. You are teaching
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:10.980]   in a school and some guy comes in and starts shooting people. You are accosted on a dark
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:15.820]   alley, similar types of things. Somebody is angry at you on the highway and runs you down
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:22.020]   and starts to attack you. Or if perhaps you're being targeted due to your opinion, you've
[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:27.420]   been exercising your rights to free speech and now you're being targeted by the racists
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:33.260]   or the fascists or the whomever you are going to be targeted by. Those are legitimate threats
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:38.780]   and they need to be taken carefully. So self-defense against individual criminals is probably one
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:43.060]   of the major reasons that people purchase a gun, probably the major reason.
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:48.700]   I think you should also consider the importance of self-defense against government agents.
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:55.620]   Your most deadly force in the world, the force that will always kill the most people is always
[00:17:55.620 --> 00:18:01.220]   the government. If we were to go back and do an accounting of the last century from
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:09.260]   1900 to 1999, you would find that the government killed far more people than individual non-government
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:17.340]   sanctioned criminals did. The estimate that I use by Professor Rudolph Rummel from the
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:23.620]   University of Hawaii, he estimated after dedicating his entire career to studying the subject,
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:30.220]   he estimated that the governments of the world were responsible for 262 million murders during
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:38.960]   the 20th century. So 262 million people were murdered by government. That number does not
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:45.900]   include the number killed during war. So that doesn't include officially declared war, that
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.940]   doesn't include World War I, it doesn't include World War II, that doesn't include the Civil
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:54.400]   War in the United States. That number is flat out government murder against their people.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:00.820]   He coined the term "democide" to refer to this and the word "democide" includes, it's
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:06.620]   defined as the murder of any person or people by a government, including genocide, politicide,
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:12.180]   and mass murder. And he specifically uses the term murder in that estimate. Now you
[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:17.340]   can go and research those statistics, but when I look at people who are concerned, rightly
[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:23.420]   as they should be, about the murder of a dozen or a couple dozen people or a hundred people
[00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:32.820]   here and there, I mourn for those. But I always keep in the back of my head the fact of 262
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:41.620]   million murders. That's the death toll that we can lay squarely at the feet of government.
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:49.620]   Now various governments, of course, are better or are worse at this. I think many of us,
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:54.060]   and of course the bulk of the listening audience of Radical Personal Finance is US American,
[00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:58.140]   many of us who are US Americans would like to think that we are without guilt in this
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:02.420]   regard, but we are certainly not without guilt. We have the blood of many hundreds of thousands
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:09.260]   of people on our hands. But I must concede and confess that I was a little bit taken
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:13.620]   aback at the gall over the last few weeks as the United States of America is embroiled
[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:20.780]   in an argument over gun control. I was a little bit taken aback to read the output from the
[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:26.380]   Chinese news agencies, the government news agencies, recommending that the United States
[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:30.900]   of America should just simply remove all the guns from their people. After all, mass shootings
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:37.580]   don't happen in China. Well, as one who has a particular interest in the tens of millions
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:44.260]   of people murdered by the Chinese government, I would have to say that there have been plenty
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:53.740]   of mass shootings in China. A similar thing, the leader of Iran, a similar thing. As someone
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:58.240]   who takes a bit of an interest in the tens of thousands of people, I don't know if it's
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.820]   hundreds of thousands or millions, but the very conservative tens of thousands of people
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:06.500]   murdered by the Iranian government, I would have to take a little bit of an issue with
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:13.500]   the fact of the... I'd have to take a bit of an issue with that. And I trust my fellow
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:24.700]   US American citizens very much. I trust the US government very, very little. So self-defense
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:29.140]   against animals, individual criminals, and government agents. Those are the purposes
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:34.900]   for guns in terms of a self-defense scenario. On terms of offensive uses, you have, of course,
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:39.940]   the hunting of animals, the intentional going out and hunting and harvesting of animals,
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:45.260]   or prosecuting a crime or war. My hope would be that you would never be involved in prosecuting
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:49.900]   a crime. And my hope would be that you and I would never be involved in prosecuting a
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:55.220]   war. However, I have to concede that it is a possibility. And especially, I think it
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:22:04.580]   is important to maintain the authority and the sheer strength in the people so that the
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:09.140]   government doesn't go to war. Because you may have to go someday and keep your national
[00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:14.900]   government from going to war. Governments find it exceedingly easy to go to war because
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:18.420]   they don't send their own children. They use other people's money and send other people's
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:25.740]   children to go and be killed. People find it very difficult to go to war. And I always
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:31.100]   want to keep the hands in the people. I want to keep the power in the hands of the people.
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:35.140]   That's one of the reasons why it's so fundamentally in the United States of America. It's so fundamentally
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:39.940]   important that the Second Amendment is so clearly codified and is so clearly defended
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:47.620]   at every turn legally. And most importantly, that the Second Amendment is defended in practice
[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:54.980]   by you. Not just, "Oh, I support it in theory," in practice. It's one thing to support free
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:23:01.160]   speech in theory. That's great. I'll do that. It's another thing to support it in practice.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:06.100]   When somebody says something that you don't like, that's when free speech matters, is
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:10.180]   when you support their ability and their authority and their right to say something that you
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:15.540]   don't like. It's one thing to support free speech in theory. It's another thing to make
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:21.480]   sure that whatever method of free speech is used is being used. You should be using it.
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:26.940]   You should be using modern methods of speech. You should be being a pamphleteer if you have
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:30.960]   something to say. You should be on Twitter if you have something to say there. Use and
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:35.500]   exercise that free speech because the more people use and exercise their right of free
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:41.340]   speech, the more peace we have, because when people can't talk, that's one of the times
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:46.860]   they go to fight, they go to war. The more peace we have, which is important, the more
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:51.220]   truth we can attain, which is important, and the more we maintain that right to free speech.
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:54.900]   That's why free speech is so important. Second Amendment is obviously the same thing, but
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:59.100]   every other right is actually the same thing in terms of, for example, your Fourth Amendment
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:05.180]   rights or your Fifth Amendment rights. You should make a habit and a practice of never
[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:10.020]   letting government agents into your home, not because you have anything to hide or not
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:14.780]   hide, because it's your right and you should exercise it. When somebody is working as a
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:20.020]   government agent, they should have an intense respect for you and your rights, and that's
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:25.540]   only going to be maintained if you maintain it. So don't allow a government agent into
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:30.800]   your home without a warrant, period, for any reason, any time, no government agent from
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:35.740]   any agency. There has to be that culture of respect for rights. When you start to lose
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:40.260]   that culture of respect for rights because people stop standing up for rights, you wind
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:46.740]   up with a culture of jackbooted thuggery and people who come together and disrespect rights.
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:52.660]   Same thing, when your rights of privacy are invaded by the government censors or by the
[00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:57.980]   National Security Agency scooping up all of your data, you should stop, you should stand
[00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:05.300]   up, and you should encrypt and privatize your data, not because you have anything to hide,
[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:09.700]   because you've got to push back and exercise a right. If you don't exercise it, the people
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:16.980]   who lust for power will always go after it, and the people who lust for power are the
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:21.860]   ones who are going to go after it in government. And if that government is not restrained by
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:26.140]   the people, which is what's so special about the United States of America, if the government
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:29.800]   is not restrained by the people, that the power is in the people, the sovereignty is
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:33.420]   in the people, you're not a subject of the king, I'm not a subject of the queen, I'm
[00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:38.340]   not a loyal subject of anybody, the sovereignty is in the people, and the people temporarily
[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:43.700]   grant to a government entity for specific limited purposes some of their sovereignty
[00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:50.140]   and authority. But it's an ongoing battle, and in the thousands of years of recorded
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:56.020]   history that we have to look back at, you should never slow down, should never stop
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:01.700]   fighting for liberty. And I use fighting there metaphorically. I don't want to fight with
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:10.420]   violence, I want to fight with ideas, because the advance of liberty is never certain.
[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:15.100]   The final category of the purpose for guns is, of course, personal enjoyment. Sport shooting,
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:20.220]   it's a hobby. You enjoy going and shooting three-gun matches or skeet shooting, whatever
[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:25.460]   you do. You enjoy collecting them, or you enjoy investing in them. There are certainly
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:29.900]   some interesting collections that can be put together, and there are certainly some interesting
[00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:34.780]   guns that could be invested in. But I'm not going to be going into those esoteric areas
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:38.740]   here today. I'm talking about normal people. I'm going to lay out for you an approach that
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:43.740]   I consider to be very practical, that will help to fulfill some of these goals, but to
[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:49.300]   do it in the way that is the most practical, not to go to the extreme scenario. We're not
[00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.920]   going to go immediately to the fact, "Well, my government's going to come and kill me,
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:56.860]   so I need to go ahead and be prepared to fight a war against them." No, that would be silly,
[00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:59.860]   especially if you're in the United States. That would be relatively silly. It doesn't
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:03.820]   mean you shouldn't be prepared for that, but that shouldn't be thing number one. It's a
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:08.700]   lower level of threat right now. Now, if you were living in South Africa, or if you were
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:13.660]   living in the Philippines, or if you were living in Iran, this threat is different,
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:19.580]   and you, of course, would have to, or Syria, you would have to, of course, go through it
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:23.900]   yourself and perform your own analysis. So I'm going to give you a budget. I'm going
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:29.900]   to start with very, very inexpensive and talk about just the functional, practical thing.
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:36.200]   The most likely reason for you to need and use a gun would be to protect yourself and
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:42.180]   defend yourself against a random criminal attack or a random animal attack. That would
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:47.320]   be the most likely reason in which most people need a gun. And that's one of the most important
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:55.860]   ones to prepare for because guns are a phenomenal equalizer, especially for the weak, especially
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:28:05.940]   for the old, especially for the young, and especially for women. Guns are the great equalizer,
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:12.740]   and that's why it's what's so powerful about them. Without a gun, size and strength and
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:21.460]   physical vigor will generally win. I'm a large man. Most people, if we got into a physical
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:25.800]   confrontation and they didn't have superior skills, most people would lose just simply
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:32.580]   due to the virtue of my size and my strength would lose in a physical confrontation. If
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:40.340]   you're young or you're old or you're a woman or you're physically frail, you would lose.
[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:47.280]   And that's how it was for a very long time throughout history until the gun was created.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:56.780]   And the gun gives a 75-year-old grandmother the ability to not be a victim to three young
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:03.420]   strong thugs who want to attack her and steal her purse or break into her house. A gun gives
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:13.180]   a weak 18-year-old girl the ability to defend herself against a large, aggressive man. And
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:18.700]   so no matter how young you are, how old you are, how frail you are, you have the ability
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:26.300]   to bring slightly more equal odds, which is why it's so fundamentally important that the
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:32.100]   weak and the young and the old and the frail have the means of self-defense in order to
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:36.100]   minimize the aggression by those who want to go out and commit crime.
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:41.860]   Now, of course, you couldn't guarantee anything. Somebody who was trained or somebody who worked
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:46.140]   at it could certainly take a gun away from somebody or could certainly press through
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:52.100]   it regardless. You have no guarantee in anything in life and a superior army can defeat an
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:56.820]   inferior army even though that inferior army is well-prepared. It happens all the time.
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:04.900]   But in the most normal common circumstances of life, the gun is the equalizer. And so
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:10.300]   on the lowest budget, I think the most sensible thing here, the cheapest, most reliable, sensible
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:17.140]   gun that would give 80% of the effect and the usefulness of guns for most scenarios
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:25.980]   is a simple snub-nosed revolver, either in a caliber called .38 Special or .357 Magnum
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:31.420]   Revolver. If you're on a budget, if you're young, if you're broke, if you're old, if
[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:36.760]   you don't have a lot of money and you just need a simple gun to protect yourself against
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:43.120]   a random criminal attack or I guess a random animal attack as well, a snub-nosed revolver
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:51.500]   is probably your ideal solution. You can purchase one new for $300, $350, $400. You can purchase
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:56.740]   one on the used market for $200 to $300. And the revolver is really special because it
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:02.380]   gives you good, decent firepower. Usually it'll be either five or six shots. It gives
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:10.120]   you good, decent firepower without being too heavy or too hard to deal with. The operation
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:14.460]   of a revolver is very simple for anybody to learn and there's very few things that could
[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:21.100]   possibly go wrong with it. Just about any time you want to make a gun go bang, if you
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:26.340]   have a revolver, you squeeze the trigger and the gun goes bang. If the gun doesn't go bang,
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:30.060]   you just squeeze the trigger again and the problem gets rotated out of your way and the
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:34.900]   next cartridge goes bang. Sometimes with semi-automatic handguns, which are wonderful, I'll get to
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:39.660]   that in a moment, sometimes with semi-automatic handguns, they don't go bang for various reasons.
[00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:43.400]   And when you're learning how to use one, you have to learn a drill of how to clear a malfunction,
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:48.420]   how to seat the magazine, how to fix the problem, but that requires extra training. But anybody
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:54.480]   in the world, a frail 75-year-old grandmother who's never held a gun in her life, can pick
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:32:00.980]   up a revolver, squeeze the trigger and make it go bang. They're fundamentally simple and
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:08.000]   they're fundamentally reliable. As a handgun, one of the great benefits of a revolver is
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:15.100]   its versatility. It can go with you into places where you're really not going to take a rifle.
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:22.280]   The AR-15 is a wonderful platform for a carbine, which is a small rifle, but you're not going
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:27.840]   to take it with you most places. But a small handgun, a small revolver will go with you
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:34.580]   to most places. It has enough firepower to be useful and effective. A .38 Special or
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:42.220]   a .357 Magnum size of cartridge is very effective. For years, that was the exact cartridge that
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:47.740]   the local police officer would carry, the exact gun and cartridge. Carry a Smith & Wesson
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:51.540]   revolver, usually not a snub-nose, and I'll explain that in just a moment, but a Smith
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:56.460]   & Wesson revolver. The FBI for years would carry .38 caliber revolvers. They're very
[00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:02.260]   effective, very, very useful. Now what I'd recommend for the first one is to start with
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:08.040]   something small that can be concealed. And so a snub-nose is just a slang term that would
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:13.040]   refer to something with a small barrel, about a two-inch barrel. You can get a revolver
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:16.060]   in a two-inch barrel, a four-inch barrel, a six-inch barrel. You can get one with an
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:22.740]   11-inch barrel. But you're going to have a challenge of what's easier to shoot and what's
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:26.620]   less easy to shoot. If there's any chance that you're going to carry it with you concealed
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:31.620]   on your person, your most comfortable and easiest to conceal option will be to have
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:37.540]   a snub-nose revolver to get something with a two-inch barrel. The problem with a small
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:44.660]   barrel like that and a small gun is that it's very uncomfortable to shoot. Now if you have
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:48.960]   to use it, you can use it. And if you need to train with it, to put a box of shells through
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:54.680]   it to use it, yes, it's good you can do it. But it's not going to be very fun. The smaller
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:59.220]   the gun, the harder it is to shoot. The bigger the gun, usually, the easier it is to shoot.
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:02.220]   So if you were just never, you said, "I'm never going to carry this with me," go ahead
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:06.060]   and get one with a slightly longer barrel. Get one with a four-inch barrel or even a
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:08.820]   six-inch barrel if you're just going to keep it at home or keep it in your car and it's
[00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:13.340]   not going to go on your person. You can still effectively conceal it on your person with
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:18.300]   a four-inch barrel, and it'd be much more comfortable for you to shoot. The best thing
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:25.780]   here is, the best advantage to a revolver is to get maximum bang for the buck. Yes,
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:31.420]   unintended, maximum bang for the buck. With a couple hundred dollars, you can get a good
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:37.220]   quality serviceable revolver that will protect you and protect your life in a circumstance
[00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:43.860]   where you're being attacked by a person or if you face the risk by an animal. Animals
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:47.980]   do attack. There was a woman last year that was killed by a couple of pit bulls that her
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:54.180]   neighbor owned. So I think you should be prepared for that as well. But for a few hundred bucks,
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:58.980]   you are going to be well squared away. Another great thing about a revolver is it doesn't
[00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:05.140]   require a lot of extra accessories. Generally, of course, with a revolver, you don't need
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:10.860]   to buy a whole bunch of extra magazines. There are ways that you could learn to load it more
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:16.180]   quickly than individually putting shells in one at a time. But you can pick up a speed
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.260]   loader. If that's what you want to have, you can pick those up inexpensively. You don't
[00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:26.220]   need too many of them. So a couple of boxes of cartridges, a revolver, a good holster,
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:32.860]   and maybe a speed loader or two is about all you need. And so total, you're in it for 250
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:40.500]   bucks, 250 to $300. If you're looking for the most sensible way to purchase your first
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:45.540]   gun, I think that's the best way to go. If you have the opportunity, purchase, I think
[00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:51.660]   it's in your best interest to purchase a .357 Magnum size instead of a .38. If you're new
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:57.820]   to guns, all these different numbers refer to the size of the actual cartridge that you
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:08.020]   insert into the gun. And a .357 Magnum cartridge has the same diameter as a .38 special, but
[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:12.940]   it's a little bit bigger. So you can shoot, if you have a .357 Magnum revolver, you can
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:19.620]   shoot .357 Magnum cartridges. You can also shoot .38 special cartridges in that same
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:27.340]   gun. If you have a .38 special revolver, you can only shoot .38 special size cartridges.
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:33.460]   You can't shoot the larger .357 Magnum. The .357 Magnum is slightly more powerful. It
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:38.260]   has more powder, and so the guns are built a little bit stronger, which might be a disadvantage
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:42.700]   because it would be a little bit heavier, but it would be built stronger, and that can
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:47.780]   be of help. So what most many people do is they'll buy the .357 Magnum. They'll shoot
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:52.420]   .38 special cartridges out of it while training because it's a little bit easier to shoot,
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:57.540]   and then they'll keep their .357 Magnum cartridges in it for self-defense if they ever needed
[00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:02.340]   to. While you're at it, make sure that you buy some quality self-defense ammunition.
[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:05.780]   Don't just buy the cheapest stuff that you can get down at Walmart. Buy some quality
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:10.380]   self-defense ammunition. Usually this will be what's called a hollow point bullet, which
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:15.460]   is a bullet that's designed to come apart when it goes into your attacker and to cause
[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:21.860]   maximum damage to them without going through them. If you're just shooting ball ammo, which
[00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:25.380]   cheap stuff that you usually would use when you're training, there's a big risk that if
[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:29.540]   you shoot somebody that you will not just go into their body, but you'll go through
[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:33.940]   their body, the bullet, and it won't cause maximum damage and may not stop them. So purchase
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:38.580]   some quality self-defense ammo. But if you're looking for just the simplest way to own a
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:48.020]   gun that is simple, reliable, start with a revolver. That's my first recommendation for
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:53.820]   you. Financially, it is very hard for you to go wrong. You'll always be able to sell
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:57.280]   that for what you have in it. You probably won't be able to sell it for a profit because
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.860]   these are essentially a commodity, but you'll always be able to sell it for what you have
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:08.060]   in it, which is really helpful. One final tip that I think is at least, I guess, worth
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:13.700]   considering. If you're shopping, I wouldn't make this a do or die, but if you're shopping,
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:17.340]   if you have the choice, if you're actually shopping for a new one, you'll have a choice
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:22.220]   of different kinds of metal. You can buy a titanium revolver, which is very, very light.
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:25.580]   That's really nice if you're going to carry it every day. It makes it a little bit harder
[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:30.300]   to shoot because it's lighter and a heavier gun is easier to shoot because the weight
[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:38.620]   of the gun will compensate a little bit for the power of the cartridge when it explodes.
[00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:42.260]   You would have a choice for that, but you'll also have a choice between buying something
[00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:48.740]   that's silver or chrome or black. If you're choosing, I think there's a very small argument
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:57.900]   that is, in my mind, persuasive about buying a black one. When I read last year, I read
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:03.020]   the book that I profiled on the show called Arrest Proof Yourself. One of the comments
[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:08.540]   that that particular author made in his book as a criminal defense attorney, he said that
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:13.660]   he thought that the ideal gun for anybody to carry for self-defense was a black snub-nosed
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:19.580]   revolver. The great thing about a black snub-nosed revolver is it's not a threatening gun if
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:23.300]   you're ever in court. If you ever shoot somebody in self-defense, you're standing in front
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:30.180]   of a jury. If you're in there with some giant tricked out hand cannon, perhaps the prosecuting
[00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:35.180]   attorney would try to paint you as some kind of lunatic nut that goes around wanting to
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:41.780]   kill people. It's hard to make that claim about somebody who just carries a simple revolver.
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:46.260]   One of the other benefits that he said about having a black one is many times these kinds
[00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:53.180]   of events would happen at night in the dark. A black revolver is very hard to see at night.
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:58.420]   If you wind up pulling it because you feel threatened, but you don't wind up pulling
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:02.180]   the trigger because you realize, "No, it's actually not a threat," and you choose not
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:08.060]   to shoot, then you run a lower risk of other people seeing it, which means maybe your actual
[00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:11.940]   draw would be never come to the attention of law enforcement, never come attention to
[00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:18.240]   the prosecuting attorney. But it would also help you to run a lower risk of being accused
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:23.420]   or charged with brandishing the weapon because fewer people would have been able to see it
[00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:27.180]   just simply because it was black. I thought that was a good argument. Not a good enough
[00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:31.380]   argument necessarily to go and sell a silver colored gun to get a black one, but if you're
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:36.340]   buying another one, a black one sounds good. So something like, if you're looking for a
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:40.420]   particular one to look at, something like Ruger's LCR, which stands for Light Compact
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:48.580]   Revolver in .357 Magnum, probably around $300 to $350. You can get cheaper ones. Great gun
[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:54.140]   for you to get. You won't lose your money. Next, if you have a little bit of money and/or
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:58.540]   want to spend a little bit more money or you'd like to have a gun with more capabilities
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:03.740]   and you're willing to put in a little extra time for training, or if you'd like to have
[00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:09.180]   a gun that's just more comfortable to shoot, then I think your either next purchase or
[00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:17.900]   ideal first purchase would be a semi-automatic compact or mid-size pistol. In my mind, you
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:23.580]   can't go wrong with a Glock 19. There are many gun people who want to constantly argue
[00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:29.140]   about these things, but for non-gun people, let me explain essentially how it works. There
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:34.140]   are so many high quality handguns today. There are many inexpensive high quality handguns
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:40.860]   today, but the one that has come out on top with decades of history is the handgun designed
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:47.660]   by a manufacturer called Glock. They have proven again and again and again that their
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:53.380]   handguns are extremely reliable, are extremely effective. Some people don't like them because
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:58.180]   they're partly made out of plastic polymers, but they are effective, and there is a giant
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:05.980]   marketplace available for them specifically. The way that the Glock platform works, some
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:11.860]   of the gun parts are slightly interchangeable. Generally, you're going to choose a caliber,
[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:19.740]   and a caliber could be 9mm as a caliber, or what's called 40 Smith & Wesson, or 45 ACP,
[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:26.300]   and they have different guns of different sizes that will work in these different calibers.
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:32.500]   If you buy a large one, the large one will of course be the most fun and easy to shoot.
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:36.060]   You'll shoot it the best because it has a longer barrel, and it'll be very comfortable
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:42.860]   to shoot. So in 9mm, which I think is probably the best one to go with, in a 9mm, that's
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:49.820]   a gun called the Glock 17. It's a wonderful semi-automatic handgun. It's very capable.
[00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:54.620]   Right out of the box, it is an extremely capable gun. Brand new, you can pick it up for about
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:59.980]   $550. Comes with a couple of extra magazines. Brand new out of the box, you could take it,
[00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:06.220]   and you could take it to many situations, and it would be extremely effective. The standard
[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:13.340]   magazine capacity of the Glock 17 is 17 rounds. It has what in gun nomenclature is called
[00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:18.660]   a double stack magazine, which means it's a little bit thicker, and it has the bullets
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:24.500]   are, the cartridges are side by side in the actual magazine, and it's a wonderful, wonderful
[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:29.780]   gun. It's very simple. You just point the trigger and shoot. It's effective. It's reliable.
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:34.260]   But it's a little bit big to conceal, and so you can get a slightly smaller one that
[00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:39.180]   has, it's called a Glock 19. That's their model. It's 9mm, and it's a little bit, the
[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:43.100]   barrel's a little bit shorter, and the grip is a little bit shorter. So it's smaller,
[00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:47.020]   and it's a little easier to conceal. Then of course, they would have the smallest, the
[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:52.780]   compact version, which is a Glock 19, sorry, a Glock 26, and then if you needed to get
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:59.060]   smaller than that, you would go to one of their single stack thinner versions, which
[00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:05.860]   in 9mm, I think is the Glock 43. Glock 19 is basically the perfect all-around, will
[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:11.540]   do just about everything you need to do gun without too many compromises. It's hard to
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:17.220]   go wrong with a Glock 19. The great thing about it from a financial perspective is there
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:24.220]   are tons of them on the market. You can buy them new for 550 bucks. You can sell them
[00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:28.660]   just about any time you want to anybody who wants to own a Glock, and as long as it's
[00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:33.900]   not obviously been destroyed, it's going to be great. It's going to work, because with
[00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:38.340]   it being a Glock, anybody even who has problems with it can swap out all the pieces without
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:45.540]   much trouble. And so it's just a wonderful, ubiquitous commodity gun. You can buy cheaper,
[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:50.540]   and there are many brands that are cheaper that are very effective. However, from an
[00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:53.980]   investment perspective, I think you're well served by buying something that if you ever
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:57.900]   needed to sell it, if you ever needed to trade it, you're buying something that has a broad
[00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:07.260]   appeal. If you buy another brand, for example, something like the CZP-10, a lot of the gun
[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:11.980]   people really love this particular gun that I'm referencing. Something called a CZP-10
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:17.740]   is a 9mm striker fired pistol. It's fantastic, but you're going to find a lot fewer people
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:23.460]   outside of the gun world that know what it is and how it works. So I think a Glock 19,
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:27.820]   you can't go wrong. The great thing about the Glock 19 is it's a good balance. You can
[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:32.940]   conceal it. You can also shoot it well. It's comfortable for you to train with, unlike
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:39.180]   that snub-nosed revolver, which is very uncomfortable to shoot. The Glock 19 is a dream to shoot,
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:43.300]   and you can train with it. And that's probably the most important thing, is to actually have
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:49.380]   a gun that you're going to train with. So consider that being your next option. What
[00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:53.780]   I'm essentially trying to do for you is create what gun people like to refer to as just the
[00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:58.020]   five gun challenge. If you only had five guns, what would you do? And then from there, it's
[00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:02.580]   up to you. But each of these, if you had each of these, they fulfill a unique function.
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:08.540]   I don't think you'd be wrong to have a revolver and a Glock 19. Start with a revolver, and
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:12.380]   then move up, get a Glock 19 as well. After that, I think your next gun should either
[00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:21.180]   be a Ruger 10/22 or an AR-15. Let me explain the differences. A Ruger 10/22 is a .22 caliber
[00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:27.800]   rifle. It's a very small, very lightweight rifle. There are other good brands of rifle.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:32.620]   I'm just telling you what is ubiquitous. And I like to have stuff that has an easy resale
[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:37.060]   value. I like to have stuff that there are tons of parts for. Some people, that's why
[00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:41.220]   I'm not a gun guy, I don't want to have something that's weird and interesting. I want to have
[00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:44.620]   the standard thing. If I'm going to drive a pickup truck, I want an F-150. If I'm going
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:49.580]   to drive a car, I want a Toyota Corolla. Just give me what everybody else has, and let me
[00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:56.260]   go about my business. The Ruger 10/22 is a wonderful .22 caliber rifle. It is semi-automatic,
[00:46:56.260 --> 00:47:00.940]   it's effective, and it can be made to be all kinds of different things. There have been,
[00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:04.780]   I don't want to say millions, I would guess without looking up numbers, I would say there
[00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:10.980]   are millions of them out there in the marketplace. But a Ruger 10/22 is very inexpensive. And
[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:17.580]   with it being a .22 caliber rifle, it's inexpensive to buy and it's inexpensive to shoot. It's
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:23.260]   also easy to use to train people, to train yourself and to train other people to use
[00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:29.200]   a rifle. You can go out in your backyard with a box of .22 cartridges and you can shoot
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:35.020]   all afternoon and you're out of pocket a dollar or two. It's so inexpensive to shoot a .22
[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:41.100]   caliber rifle. It's much more painful to shoot a larger rifle in terms of the cost of ammunition.
[00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:47.220]   And a .22 caliber rifle is one of the most versatile, useful weapons that you can own.
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:52.500]   You can use it, of course, to kill small game. You could use it in self-defense. You could
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:57.740]   certainly kill somebody with a .22 caliber rifle. But you'll use it and learn the skills
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:48:05.460]   of effective rifle, the effective ability to use a rifle. It's two to three hundred
[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:10.980]   bucks to buy a new one, depending on whether you buy a black one or a wooden color, wooden
[00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:15.420]   one or whatever version you buy, whether you buy a stainless steel barrel or not. There's
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:20.300]   a little bit of range, but they're ubiquitous and they're wonderful weapons. You can adjust
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:24.540]   them and build them to be however you want it to look. If you want to build it to look
[00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:28.500]   like a scary black rifle, you can do that. If you want to build it to look like just
[00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:34.240]   a standard rifle that every rancher would just carry around in his truck with a woodstock,
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:40.060]   you can do that. You can buy large magazines for them, 30 round magazines for them. You
[00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:43.900]   can use standard box magazines. You can put a scope on it. You cannot put a scope. It's
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:50.780]   just a wonderful rifle. I don't think you go wrong with buying a .22 caliber Ruger 10/22.
[00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:54.620]   The next option, and these are not necessarily in order, but the next option that could also
[00:48:54.620 --> 00:49:01.780]   work well is to go ahead at this point and buy an AR-15. An AR-15 is a wonderful rifle
[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:06.500]   platform. I'm intending to release to you an entire show on the AR-15 platform because
[00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:10.340]   I get so annoyed with hearing people yell about it without actually understanding what
[00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:18.580]   it is. The AR-15 is a wonderful, wonderfully effective rifle. In short, it is frequently
[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:26.460]   referred to as a modern sporting rifle because that was how it was originally designed. The
[00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:33.580]   AR-15 rifle was designed in about 1945 by a man named Eugene Stoner, and he designed
[00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:39.540]   it for the civilian marketplace to be a versatile rifle, a versatile sporting rifle. And it
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:52.980]   was designed around a caliber called either 5.56 millimeter NATO or 2.223 Remington caliber,
[00:49:52.980 --> 00:50:00.620]   which is a relatively small bullet size. It was later adapted and taken on by the US military
[00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:05.860]   where it became the famous M16 rifle that has been used by the US military for many
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:13.380]   decades, but it was first designed for the civilian marketplace. When the rifle, Stoner
[00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:20.540]   went on, he left ArmaLite, they sold the patents to Colt who continued to produce it. But what's
[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:27.620]   happened is in the last couple of decades, especially the last decade, the AR-15 marketplace
[00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:34.460]   has been completely open to competition. And there are so many people that have been creating
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:40.260]   AR-15s. And so the range of accessories and the range of parts and the range of quality
[00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:45.540]   of all the different parts of the rifle have been, it's just been phenomenal. It's incredible.
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:52.420]   And so you can take an AR-15 and you can transform it for many tasks, for just about any task
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:59.100]   that you need. Now, it has some disadvantages. For example, the AR-15 platform shooting the
[00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:07.340]   standard 5.56 millimeter NATO bullet or the .223 Remington bullet is too small to be effective
[00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:15.020]   as a large game rifle. It would be too small to be effective at shooting a deer, for example.
[00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:19.460]   You generally want a larger rifle round for that. It's a relatively small round, but it's
[00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:24.120]   very effective for hunting. Many people use it for hunting. It's also very effective and
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:30.740]   can be adjusted for many different approaches to effective self-defense. And the AR-15,
[00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:34.020]   because it has so many different ways that it can be adjusted, you can do something like
[00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:38.340]   add in a .22 caliber conversion kit. And so if you want to train with the rifle, if you
[00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:42.540]   didn't want to buy both a Ruger 10/22 and an AR-15, you can go ahead and purchase an
[00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:47.420]   AR-15 and then convert it with a .22 caliber conversion kit so it can shoot less expensive
[00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:54.340]   ammo. Because the actual size, the diameter of the bullet of the standard rifle is the
[00:51:54.340 --> 00:52:01.740]   same as the .22. It just has more, the large, the normal AR-15 cartridge simply has more
[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:07.420]   powder which makes it come out as more velocity, but it's a lot more expensive to shoot. So
[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:12.420]   an AR-15 is a wonderful first rifle. I think you should have one. I really do. I think
[00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:17.220]   you should have probably a couple. AR-15 has certain limitations. It's not going to be
[00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:22.660]   a tremendous long-range rifle. It's not going to punch through cover if you ever needed
[00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:28.300]   it in war. There's a reason why the older battle rifles from the military were always
[00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:32.820]   built on a larger caliber bullet. But it's just a great gun. And today, there's never
[00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:37.580]   been a better time to buy one because it's so inexpensive. You can get a new AR-15 for
[00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:44.140]   about $550 to $700. Now you can spend a couple thousand bucks on one depending on how fancy
[00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:49.540]   of a one that you buy. But you can get a great rifle at a great price and it's just a wonderful
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:52.860]   rifle. So I encourage you, if you don't own an AR-15, go ahead and get one. And if you
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:57.940]   don't own one, get one today so that you can practice shooting with it and that way if
[00:52:57.940 --> 00:53:03.540]   the legislatures do change any laws that you already have one. And most importantly, get
[00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:08.100]   one so that you can go ahead and teach other people how to shoot with it and dispense with
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:14.020]   some of the mystique of the AR-15 rifle. I'm appalled at so much of the commentary that
[00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:18.320]   I see about the AR-15 rifle specifically. It's just apparent that people have never
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:21.220]   shot one. They don't know how it works. They don't know what makes it good. They don't
[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:26.340]   know what its disadvantages are. It's appalling. And you see it all the time on the news, etc.
[00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:31.540]   So go get yourself one, use it, and then take your friends out and teach them to shoot.
[00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:36.260]   It's a whole lot more effective for you to take a friend of yours who doesn't like guns
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:40.180]   or is scared of guns, take them out with an AR-15 and teach them how to shoot it. That's
[00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:45.580]   a whole lot more effective than arguing about gun control legislation online. Next and finally,
[00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:52.980]   or sorry, next two weapons would be get yourself a shotgun. It's hard to go wrong with a Remington
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:58.220]   870 shotgun, basically the standard pump-action shotgun. The wonderful thing again about the
[00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:03.260]   Remington 870 is it's the ubiquitous gun of shotguns. There are tons of them out there.
[00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:07.420]   You can buy a good one in the used marketplace. You can buy a good new one. They're relatively
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:11.860]   inexpensive. But while you're shopping, pick up a couple of barrels. Pick up a short barrel
[00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:16.020]   and a long barrel. Pick up a short barrel to use if you needed to use it as a home defense
[00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:21.300]   gun or around your house. And pick up a long barrel so you can take it and use it to shoot
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:25.140]   skeet or to shoot birds or to shoot animals or whatever you're hunting for. The great
[00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:30.540]   thing about a shotgun is the variety of ammunition that you can use for it. Everything from deer
[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:38.980]   hunting with a slug to buckshot to birdshot. You've got so many different choices. You
[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:45.740]   can even shoot all kinds of interesting novelty rounds out of your Remington. So get yourself
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:50.040]   a shotgun and get a couple of barrels for it that are interchangeable and learn how
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:56.980]   to use them. A shotgun is one of the most useful imposing weapons. If you're dealing
[00:54:56.980 --> 00:55:03.140]   in a situation, it's funny, a few years ago there were a bunch of riots in London and
[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:10.220]   the number one selling thing in London at the time was baseball bats. People were buying
[00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:14.500]   baseball bats to try to protect themselves from rioters. Well, sorry, but I don't want
[00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:18.200]   to stand with a baseball bat and try to protect myself from rioters. I'm going to turn tail
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:24.340]   and run the other direction. But I'd be happy to stand outside of my car or my house or
[00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:29.380]   my store and people are marching through lighting stuff on fire. I'd be happy to stand there
[00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:35.180]   with a shotgun and most people will make a tour around it. And I think it's a very effective
[00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:41.020]   persuader. So get yourself a good shotgun. And then last couple is at that point, if
[00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:48.020]   you can expand your home armory a little bit more, look into getting a long distance rifle,
[00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:51.780]   a scoped long distance rifle, which would be useful for hunting large game. And then
[00:55:51.780 --> 00:56:00.100]   consider purchasing a larger caliber, semi-automatic military style weapon, a good proper heavy
[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:07.540]   duty rifle, a battle rifle. So there'd be variants, maybe an AR-10 or some of the various
[00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:12.300]   variants that you can look into. There are some really good ones, but that is important.
[00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:17.460]   Now when you're doing this, those basically, what do they do, five or six guns? Those five
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:25.500]   or six guns put together constitute a very effective home armory. If you're looking for
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:29.660]   a good collection to put together for each of your children so that when they graduate
[00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:34.580]   from high school or graduate from college or at their, you're giving a wedding present
[00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:40.420]   to them or whatever, if you could put together over the course of years, put together that
[00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:44.380]   five or six gun armory, you're going to put them in a situation where they're very well
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:48.940]   equipped for the future. And they're very well equipped for all of those strategies.
[00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:54.740]   In that home armory that I outlined, you have very effective guns to protect yourself from
[00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:59.580]   animals, to protect yourself from criminals and to protect yourself from government agents.
[00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:04.660]   You have very effective guns for the offensive use of hunting animals and for prosecuting
[00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:09.300]   a war if you ever have to be involved in one. And you have very effective guns for personal
[00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:15.020]   enjoyment that you can use for sport shooting. And in terms of collecting, those aren't really
[00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:19.380]   going to be collector pieces, but at least you're going to have a decent investment in
[00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:23.940]   the value of those guns. It's hard, unless you destroy them, it's hard for their value
[00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:30.820]   to go down. Because if you can sell them into the secondary market, you're always going
[00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:35.900]   to find someone that's more willing to pay a little bit more to be able to buy them from
[00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:43.220]   a private party versus buying them from a dealer. If you buy firearms from a dealer,
[00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:48.540]   then you have to do all of the required federal paperwork, which means you wind up filling
[00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:54.160]   out forms, you wind up having background checks done on you, et cetera. Now, there are a bunch
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:58:01.500]   of laws restricting the power of the federal government to use that data, to store that
[00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:07.340]   data and to use it to build lists and registries of gun owners. But I think you should always
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:12.660]   be skeptical and always be a little bit paranoid about that. There's simply too much strong
[00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:24.820]   history to look at throughout history of registration that is used to then later as a disarmament
[00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:31.940]   technique. Many people are rightly paranoid about that. I don't know how to say what you
[00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:35.260]   should be paranoid about all of it, but I would say that you should not purchase all
[00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:42.260]   of your firearms through a federal firearms dealer. I think it's good to buy some of them
[00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:47.260]   in the private party and you should be willing to pay a little bit more in the private party.
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:52.100]   Now, let's talk briefly about accessories and then let's talk about risks because it's
[00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:57.980]   important to recognize that guns fundamentally can be very dangerous. So we have to manage
[00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:03.660]   and mitigate those risks. And it's important that your investment not wind up killing you.
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:08.940]   That is one thing that a gun is very effective at that a gold coin or a stock certificate
[00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:14.780]   may not be so effective at. With regard to accessories, once you have a basic home armory
[00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:20.900]   put together, the power is in the accessories and the power is in your personal skill. So
[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:25.580]   if you have set aside for yourself, let's say you have a budget of $500, I think you're
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:33.260]   better served to buy a snub-nosed revolver for $250 and to go and buy a class on how
[00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:39.740]   to use it than you are to go and buy a $500 Glock 19. Budget for training and budget for
[00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:45.060]   ammunition to use in training because the actual gun is not the key thing. It's your
[00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:51.540]   training. So whatever your budget is that you set out for yourself, focus on making
[00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:58.220]   sure that you don't spend it all on the actual firearms platform. Make sure that you're saving
[00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:04.380]   and setting aside money for training and for ammunition. And that is the fatal flaw of
[01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:11.740]   guns, that the actual cost of the firearm is not all that much. But all of the other
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:18.100]   stuff to be proficient with it is. And you can't really sell that. If you buy a class
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:22.640]   for a few hundred dollars to go and take a weekend class on how to effectively use your
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:27.540]   handgun or how to effectively shoot your AR-15, you're never going to be able to sell that
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:32.900]   knowledge and experience to somebody else. You can't sell the expended ammunition. So
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:37.980]   there are straight up costs with guns that make them not a great investment. Now, you
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:42.900]   could stack your safe full as many gun people do with guns that you never shoot. And in
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:47.820]   that case, maybe you do get a good investment. But we have to acknowledge that if you're
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:52.620]   going to actually use, the point of a gun is not financial necessarily. The point is
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:57.860]   to be able to use it. And in so doing, you're going to be burning money in ammunition and
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:03.780]   training. But it's hard for me to imagine anyone ever regretting that. I've never heard
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:08.700]   of somebody who has had to defend their life and lives of their loved ones or their property
[01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:14.540]   with a firearm, who ever regretted time spent at training or money spent in training or
[01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:19.260]   money spent on ammunition down at the range to practice with it. I can't imagine somebody
[01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:25.420]   regretting it. Let's talk about safety. With safety, it's important that you recognize
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:33.340]   that there are risks to gun ownership. The risk of getting shot in a school shooting
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:39.740]   is infinitesimally small. The risk of getting killed by your government is not so infinitesimally
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:46.220]   small. Again, 262 million, I think we'd be hard pressed to find. If we were to go over
[01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:50.020]   the last 30 years, we'd be hard pressed to put together, I think, what are the numbers?
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:54.700]   900 people killed in mass shootings and in school shootings, something like that. It's
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:02:00.300]   a very statistically small number. The government number is harder to parse because it's very
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:07.020]   big but it's very much a big difference as far as where you are in the world. We need
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:14.020]   to account for those things. You have to recognize that guns are fundamentally, inherently dangerous.
[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:21.540]   Let's talk about how they're dangerous. I often hear gun people relate things to, they
[01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:26.500]   relate guns to something like a hammer, for example. They say, "Well, a gun is a tool
[01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:29.980]   and a hammer is a tool. You can use a hammer to build a house or you can use a hammer to
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:36.100]   bash somebody's skull in." I think that's an accurate comparison. It really is. It's
[01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:44.540]   true. But I don't think it's quite honest for us to compare a gun to a hammer. A hammer
[01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:49.900]   can be used to bash somebody's head in but it's not nearly so destructive as a well-placed
[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:55.220]   gunshot. I think it's better to compare a gun to something else that's inherently dangerous
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:03:01.180]   like a chainsaw and to recognize that it's not so simple. You could pick up a hammer
[01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:04.980]   and if you're learning how to use a hammer to build something, then the worst you might
[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:09.420]   do is bash your finger a few times. But most people don't kill someone while they learn
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:14.540]   to use a hammer. But you can kill somebody while you learn to use a gun just like you
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:19.020]   can kill somebody while you learn to use a chainsaw. You need to be very careful and
[01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:26.900]   respect the actual tool and its destructive capabilities. So take training and learn how
[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:31.060]   to use it and be very, very careful. One of the most important things to do is from the
[01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:39.180]   very beginning to train yourself properly with good safety practices that will eliminate
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:44.640]   the potential of a negligent discharge, an accidental discharge, and/or mitigate the
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:51.380]   risk of a negligent discharge. So in talking about the dangers of guns, because many people
[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:55.540]   say, "Well, I don't want to have a gun because I'm statistically dangerous." With that, you
[01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:59.220]   need to recognize that there are basically two categories that comes down into the danger
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:05.220]   of a gun. One is a negligent discharge and the other is suicide. But the great thing
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:11.300]   about these risks is these risks can be mitigated. So the great fear that of course any of us
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:15.340]   would have would be somebody accidentally getting their hands on a firearm, one of our
[01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:21.660]   children. You buy a snub-nosed .38 because it's supposed to protect your life, but then
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:26.020]   you just stick it in the dresser drawer and then your seven-year-old child goes in and
[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:30.180]   starts playing with it and it goes bang and kills your other child. That is not a scenario
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:35.340]   that any of us want to wind up in. And sadly, that's a scenario that many people have ended
[01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:43.860]   up in and it's a great danger. It is your responsibility to make sure that doesn't happen.
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:53.260]   It's your responsibility to make sure that doesn't happen. Rights come with responsibilities.
[01:04:53.260 --> 01:05:00.300]   I believe it is your absolute right to keep and bear arms and that that right must not
[01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:08.660]   be infringed upon by the government in any way, shape, or form. But it's your responsibility
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:19.460]   to exercise that right carefully. So plan ahead and make sure that you're proactive
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:25.380]   in mitigating the risk. There are certain risks with young children who are too young
[01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:30.780]   to be trained in the proper handling of firearms. It's your responsibility to make sure that
[01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:38.300]   one of your guns never winds up in the hands of a young child. Do not take this lightly.
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:43.180]   Buy proper receptacles to keep them in. If you're going to keep it by your bed, buy a
[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:50.660]   proper locking case for it. Buy a proper safe that won't tumble open when it gets knocked
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:55.060]   to the ground. Buy a proper safe and install it and make sure that the gun is either on
[01:05:55.060 --> 01:06:02.380]   you or in the safe. In addition to that, you have to teach your children. I think this
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:10.020]   is so fundamentally important. You have to teach your children how proper gun safety.
[01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:13.820]   I'm a young father, so I'll just tell you what I'm doing without any claim to saying
[01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:18.660]   this is the best thing to do, but I'll tell you what I'm doing and why. Number one, I
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:26.340]   never allow my children to play with my guns, period. I actually seek to entrap them to
[01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:32.980]   make sure that they won't. A few times as a test, I give them careful instruction. I
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:37.940]   show them, "Listen, this is what a gun is. You may not touch it." Then I'll unload it,
[01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:40.980]   make sure that it's rendered safe, and I'll leave it in a way that we might be tempted
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:46.260]   to touch it. I'll set a trap and wait and see how effective is this going to be. I also
[01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:52.380]   am a nut about teaching gun safety. You need to practice, back to other risks as far as
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:57.780]   how to protect yourself against the risk of accident, you need to be a nut about gun safety,
[01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:02.020]   which means you never play with guns. You always practice safe unloading. You're very,
[01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:05.700]   very careful with where you're pointing it. You keep your finger off the trigger. Just
[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:16.020]   like a chainsaw is entirely safe, a gun is entirely safe until you touch it, until you
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:22.660]   turn it on. You can have an AR-15 with a 30-round magazine loaded up, locked, cocked, and ready
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:27.540]   to go. You can put it in a safe and it'll sit there for hundreds or thousands of years
[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:35.160]   and nothing will change to it. It will never become unsafe until you touch it and start
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:39.540]   waving it around. Just like a chainsaw can be loaded with gasoline, it can be sharpened
[01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:44.420]   and ready to go. You can have that thing ready to go with a pull of the cord and it'll fire
[01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:48.460]   up, and it's nothing unsafe at all about it. It'll sit there for thousands of years and
[01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:53.620]   never turn itself on. But the instant you turn it on, you've got a deadly weapon. So
[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:58.260]   you've got to deal with guns in exactly the same way. Take them seriously. Practice the
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:04.060]   fundamentals of gun safety. Practice the rules of gun safety. And don't ever allow an exception
[01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:11.220]   of any kind for any reason. That's got to be your attitude. And if you'll do that, you'll,
[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:16.620]   number one, remove the risk of a negligent discharge just in gun handling, and you'll
[01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:22.240]   lower the risk of a negligent discharge if it did happen, actually harming somebody.
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:26.960]   Back to children. Keep your guns locked up away from your children, but not forever.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:31.580]   Teach your children how to use guns and ensure with them that they practice good rules of
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:36.020]   gun safety, that they learn how to shoot and they learn how to shoot effectively, and then
[01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:41.620]   instill them a moral calculation of when you shoot and when you don't shoot. One of my
[01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:47.940]   biggest concerns for me is that I want to make sure that I never lose my sensitivity
[01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:55.960]   to the horror of violence, to the horror of war. I don't ever want to feed the animal
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:09:03.620]   side of my soul to say I'm going to glory in violence. And so for me personally, I don't
[01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:10.360]   watch violent sports. I don't watch boxing. I don't watch MMA. I don't want to feed my
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:15.860]   bloodlust of combat. I don't watch violent movies. I don't want to, especially not if
[01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:19.700]   the violence is glorified. It's kind of like nudity, for example. There's a way that you
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:26.380]   can watch a movie that contains nudity in which the story wouldn't be told the right
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:34.100]   way without nudity. I'm not scared of nudity, but I want nudity to be presented the way
[01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:40.500]   that it is in Schindler's List, not in a way that glorifies and sexualizes the nudity in
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:44.380]   and of itself. Same thing with violence. I'm not scared of violence, but I want to make
[01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:53.580]   sure that violence is always horrible and awful and presented as repulsive, not as attractive.
[01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:57.140]   And I think we need to do the same thing with our children. We need to expose our children
[01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:02.780]   to violence. I'm not opposed to martial arts in this meaning not specific. I'm not opposed
[01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:07.860]   to somebody learning how to fight, fight effectively. I think that's important. But that fighting
[01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:12.020]   cannot be disconnected. The violence cannot be disconnected with the moral foundation
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:16.860]   of right and wrong. People like to make fun about, after a shooting, when someone talks
[01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:24.260]   about violent video games. I don't see how you can make fun of it. When you feed the
[01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:31.940]   violent tendencies and make it a sport, that has a corrosive effect on your soul in exactly
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:37.380]   the same way that pornography does. If you feed the sexual lust and objectification of
[01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:42.540]   women and sex the way that pornography does, it has a corrosive effect on your soul. And
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:47.020]   you stop viewing people the same way. You start viewing people as animals and not as
[01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:55.700]   people. And so you have to accompany physical instruction with moral instruction. Those
[01:10:55.700 --> 01:11:00.340]   two have to be there. And I think that, especially for children, we have to do a good job of
[01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:07.220]   making sure that our children live in a morally clear universe. When is force appropriate
[01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:12.740]   and when is not? When is violence appropriate and when is not? I ask you those questions.
[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:18.580]   Here are some challenging questions for you to consider. I ask you this question. When
[01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:28.820]   is it okay for you to hit a man? When is it okay for you to hit a woman? When is it okay
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:37.420]   for you to shoot a woman? When is it okay for you to shoot a child? When is it okay
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:44.820]   for you to shoot a cop? That last one's probably the most explosive. I ask it again. When is
[01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:50.060]   it okay for you to shoot a cop? Now, grapple with those questions. And we've got to be
[01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:58.060]   the kind of society who deals with those questions seriously, that doesn't pretend that horror
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:05.180]   doesn't exist, but that doesn't glorify it and worship it. Rather, we need to be a society
[01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:12.100]   that puts it in its proper moral context. I think I understand school shooters a little
[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:18.860]   bit. I get it. It makes sense to me sometimes why they do the things they do. I'm not psychoanalyzing,
[01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:25.300]   but when I look at all of the factors, it makes sense to me and it's pretty awful. Now,
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:29.460]   there's many factors, of course. We all have a tendency and a bias to go to what we're
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:33.260]   comfortable with. So when people who like guns look at a school shooting, they immediately
[01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:37.620]   notice the fact that if you had a gun, you could protect yourself and you could save
[01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:40.500]   innocent life. Whereas people who don't like guns look at that and say, "Well, of course
[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:44.980]   the shooter had a gun. How did he get the gun?" And everyone sees the same facts and
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:50.060]   they all look at it and draw different conclusions. A teacher may look at it and say, "If only
[01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:57.820]   I had noticed that this child was being bullied." And that's true. A parent may look at it
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:13:02.300]   and say, "Oh, if only the parents had been able to pierce that through." Somebody who's
[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:07.740]   adopted children would look at it and say, "Adoption. We've got the emotional issues
[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:12.300]   with adoption and how do we deal with these things?" And there are dozens and dozens
[01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:18.460]   of accurate points of analysis. We've got to be careful about applying only our own
[01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:22.460]   thing and say, "This is the way it always is." I'm getting a little bit of feel. Let
[01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:27.300]   me go back to suicide. The major risk with guns is suicide. More people are killed with
[01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:32.500]   suicide with guns in the United States than any other factor with guns. Negligent discharges
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:43.860]   are usually result of bad gun handling. And I encourage you, be the one to stand up and
[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:49.540]   walk away. When I see people doing bad gun handling, I hate to always be the bad guy,
[01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:52.820]   but I'm not willing to take a risk with my life or with the lives of someone else because
[01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:59.140]   somebody being lazy and sloppy, passing loaded guns around that haven't been cleared or engaging
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:04.140]   in unsafe practices. Be the person who stands up and raises the level, especially if you're
[01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:07.900]   a gun person, if you're involved in the gun community. Make sure that you're the person
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:15.500]   that raises it because negligent discharges are unnecessary. Nobody needs to be hurt by
[01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:20.220]   a gun and it shouldn't happen. Thankfully, people are generally very safe, especially
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:24.260]   in the United States of America, and very few, statistically speaking, actually happen.
[01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:27.220]   Most people killed with guns deserve to be killed with guns except for suicide. So let's
[01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:34.940]   talk about suicide. Major risk with guns is suicide. Now, I don't know how you connect
[01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:41.420]   this causal factor of what makes people commit suicide versus not. I don't know how you do
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:49.140]   this. And we live in a very weird time with regard to suicide as well, speaking culturally.
[01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:55.740]   Many people glorify suicide, and I'm concerned about this being glorified more and more.
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:15:01.220]   You'll often hear people, when somebody commits suicide, you'll often hear people use phraseology
[01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:07.660]   such as, "Well, at least they're at peace now." Well, you don't know if they're at peace.
[01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:13.940]   For all you know, they're burning in hell. Now, of course, we use these euphemisms because
[01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:19.060]   we're trying to make sense out of an insane situation, but I think this is very damaging
[01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:23.900]   for us to use these euphemisms. "Well, so and so, at least they finally found peace,"
[01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:30.580]   or "They're in a better place." I hate the lies that are told at funerals. I really do.
[01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:36.620]   And what happens is suicide has this multiplying effect where when somebody who is psychologically
[01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:42.260]   unstable and is in a very painful place hears that, well, they want peace, wouldn't you?
[01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:47.340]   Now, let's say that you supported suicide. And I use that word advisedly because many
[01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:51.980]   people do. One of the biggest concerning political issues to me that is encroaching in the United
[01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:58.060]   States of America faster, and very few people are talking about it, is assisted euthanasia,
[01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:04.860]   physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia. This has a horrendous history, especially
[01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:09.340]   worrying if you look in Europe and you study what's happening in Europe where physician-assisted
[01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:14.060]   suicide is legal. And it's happening in the United States and many of our states. And
[01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:21.300]   what's more worrying is that the moral argument is not being had. It's worrying to me. And
[01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:28.100]   so suicide is seen by many people as a good way out. Now, let's pretend for a moment that
[01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:33.260]   you believe this. Let's pretend that you support the concept of suicide. And now, you might
[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:41.200]   put your own restrictions on it. You might say, "Well, if somebody has an incurable disease
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:46.860]   and they're living in great pain and suffering, then I'm going to support their right to take
[01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:51.580]   their own life with the help of a physician." Well, if you support that, then it's hard
[01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:57.620]   for you to ever say anything bad about suicide. It really is. And be consistent. Because,
[01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:01.580]   and this is what's happened in Europe with physician-assisted suicide, is the definition
[01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:10.020]   of what is pain and suffering has transitioned from what we would all agree is pain and suffering
[01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:16.060]   to what some of us might say is normal life. But yet, to that person, it may feel like
[01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:22.700]   unbearable pain and suffering. Now, in a sense, if you're supportive of suicide, suicide
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:28.020]   by gun is probably one of the best ways to go. If I think through all the different ways
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:34.560]   that I could commit suicide if I wanted to, I would choose suicide by gun. I've never
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:39.660]   understood why people hang themselves. To me, that sounds very painful and stressful.
[01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:43.980]   I've never understood why people ground themselves. That sounds very painful and stressful to
[01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:47.700]   me. I've never understood why people throw themselves off of buildings. That sounds very
[01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:53.940]   painful and stressful to me. I understand why people take medications to commit suicide,
[01:17:53.940 --> 01:18:00.200]   but that sounds not so guaranteed to me. If I wanted to commit suicide, it's hard to imagine
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:08.540]   a better solution than a gun. And so I understand why people do it. And I think that if you're
[01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:13.020]   promoting suicide in your ideology, and if you ever say things like, "Oh, they're at
[01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:17.020]   peace now," or "I'm so glad that finally these things happened," or "So-and-so was
[01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:20.900]   in such pain and I'm glad that they were able to escape from it," then I think you better
[01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:24.900]   be careful and not say, "Oh, it's against guns," because I could make the counterargument
[01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:30.820]   that guns are a great way to commit suicide. They're sure, they're quick, they're pain-free,
[01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:35.820]   they're accessible. You don't have to be rich to get a prescription from a doctor. Any poor
[01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:40.620]   person that wants out can commit suicide. But I do think you better pay attention to
[01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:47.140]   the fact that a lot of people die by suicide. I don't think you solve the suicide problem
[01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:53.500]   or make any dent in it by guns. I think they almost have to be separate. But I do think
[01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:58.740]   that if you find yourself with suicidal thoughts, you better get rid of your guns and talk to
[01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:04.620]   somebody. Or if you know somebody with suicidal thoughts, you better get involved and you
[01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:11.620]   better take their guns away. We have a responsibility to one another to get involved in one another's
[01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:19.580]   lives. You have a responsibility to get involved in my life if you're my neighbor, and I have
[01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:27.620]   a responsibility to get involved in your life if you're my neighbor. And that involves guns.
[01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:31.900]   Number of years ago, I had a neighbor who was starting to fail mentally. This neighbor
[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:38.420]   was starting to exhibit some worrying symptoms of dementia. Their behavior was starting to
[01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:44.860]   be a little bit strange. We got involved, especially with regard to guns. Of course,
[01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:50.460]   I knew this neighbor had guns. Many people do. And so I immediately went and talked to
[01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:54.020]   the family, talked to the son, and said, "Listen, hold on a second. Does this person have access
[01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:58.020]   to any guns?" Now, thankfully, in that case, they'd already done the right thing. The son
[01:19:58.020 --> 01:20:01.420]   had taken all the guns away. The house was completely free of guns. All the guns were
[01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:06.740]   locked up and the older person did not have any access to guns. That's how it should be.
[01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:11.860]   You have a responsibility exactly the same if you're concerned about anything. If your
[01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:16.500]   neighbor is suicidal and they're talking to you, you have a responsibility to get involved.
[01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:22.300]   Now, I don't know how to cut this politically, and this is the great challenge. It's because
[01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:26.460]   I'm very uncomfortable with the federal government designating what is mental illness and what's
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:32.620]   not. I don't have much confidence these days in the practice of psychiatry and psychology.
[01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:36.860]   I used to have a high opinion of these practices, no disrespect intended to those of you who
[01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:42.620]   are engaged in this, but I go to zero now. In my mind, you're at zero and you've got
[01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:50.100]   a lot of work to do because I've seen the damage that's happening in people's lives
[01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:56.220]   because of psychiatry and... I always get messed up. Saying, "Oh, well, yes, in fact..."
[01:20:56.220 --> 01:21:00.500]   I have a family member. "Well, yes, in fact, sir, you should take a knife and slice your
[01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:06.220]   penis off and mutilate your body. And yes, we're all going to love you and support you.
[01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:10.700]   I'm sorry, but you're at zero in my book and you got to build it up." I know I have a few
[01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:14.940]   good psychiatrists in the audience, just like I've got to deal with the financial planning
[01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:22.980]   industry. But the point is I'm not real comfortable with a giant bureaucracy stating what is and
[01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:27.460]   isn't mental illness. I'm not real comfortable with the same people that believe that the
[01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:30.820]   President of the United States or the Vice President of the United States is mentally
[01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:40.120]   ill and who've lobbied that allegation again and again and again, saying that somebody
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:44.540]   can't have access to a gun. I'm not real comfortable with that. I'm not real comfortable in a
[01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:50.060]   society that says that when you think that Jesus talks to you, then you're mentally ill.
[01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:55.940]   Well, we can have that debate. It's a worthwhile debate. We can have it in a formal setting
[01:21:55.940 --> 01:22:00.740]   and we could talk about it, but it's a worthy debate. And I'm not so comfortable with people
[01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:08.140]   saying what for millions of people is an integral part of their life over thousands of years,
[01:22:08.140 --> 01:22:13.820]   well-documented, saying, "Well, this is a mental illness." It doesn't inspire a lot
[01:22:13.820 --> 01:22:20.860]   of confidence. Governments are very bad at most things. They're very good at killing
[01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:27.380]   people. What else do they do this good? I don't know. It's hard to say. But they're
[01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:32.140]   very bad at most things and adjudicating mental illness is not one of those things. But you
[01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:38.620]   and I can observe what's going on. And I do think that if there is a role for government,
[01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:43.300]   it should support individuals who are going to get involved. You know what's happening
[01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:47.380]   in your life. You know what's happening in your wife's life. You know what's happening
[01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:51.620]   in your brother's life. You know what's happening in your neighbor's life. And it's your responsibility
[01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:56.440]   to get involved. Now, I think one of my hopes that comes out of this Parkland shooting is
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:23:00.380]   hopefully people will even go to another level. There were a lot of people that got involved
[01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:05.540]   and did the right thing. And it just shows you cannot trust government agents, period.
[01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:09.940]   It's not that they're unnecessarily untrustworthy. Thank you to the... I know many of you who
[01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:18.860]   listen are government agents, but the systems don't work. They work very rarely. Just like
[01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:25.780]   self-protection. The police have no legal duty to protect you. Did you know that? In
[01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:29.580]   many court cases, there was one that brought this out a few years ago with a guy who was
[01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:35.460]   slashed in the New York subway while the police officer stood by because they weren't sure...
[01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:41.220]   The story... What was the guy's name? The story was that they were looking for a guy
[01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:48.380]   who had killed three people, four people with a knife. And this guy got up in the morning
[01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:53.580]   in New York City, he was on the subway. And while he was on the subway, there was what
[01:23:53.580 --> 01:24:02.580]   he thought was a crazy person, which was banging on the door of the cabinet or the compartment
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:10.020]   where the engineer was. And so he thought, "Okay, well, we'll stop him." But he said,
[01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:14.980]   "Hey, listen, man, leave it alone." And the guy turns around with a knife and attacks
[01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:19.620]   him. He winds up fighting him, finally gets the knife away. And then at that point, the
[01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:24.500]   two cops who had been in that very next car watching the guy that they knew had murdered
[01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:33.580]   either three or four people in the last 24, 48 hours, watching that guy, they didn't intervene
[01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:39.860]   and help save him until after the Good Samaritan had already disarmed the guy. So they also
[01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:44.300]   didn't offer him medical aid. One of his fellow subway passengers offered him medical aid.
[01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:50.560]   And then he wound up suing them. He sued the police, the NYPD for, I forget what the exact
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:55.320]   charge was that he gave, but the court order indicated the police have no special legal
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:25:02.260]   duty to protect you. And there are many other cases that have affirmed this as well. But
[01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:11.620]   the police do not have a legal constitutional duty to protect somebody from harm. That's
[01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:17.660]   the legal scenario. Now, thankfully, there are many men and women who get up every day
[01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:22.820]   and put on a badge and a gun and go to work. And their reason for doing that is to protect
[01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:32.500]   others. But there's not a legal duty. So, in summary, it's your responsibility to protect
[01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:40.400]   your life and the lives of those around you. Nobody will care about them more than you.
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:46.400]   As we saw with the recent Parkland shooting, thankfully there were many police officers
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:51.580]   who eventually did come in and try to put a stop to the situation. But there were also
[01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:56.300]   police officers that didn't. Now let me ask you a question. Let's say that you're in that
[01:25:56.300 --> 01:26:05.220]   situation. If you have the means of defense, and this is your student, or your classmate,
[01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:11.020]   or your children, are you going to care enough to get involved and stop the carnage? I think
[01:26:11.020 --> 01:26:18.880]   you are. So you have the responsibility to protect yourself. You have the responsibility
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:29.780]   to protect others. You have the responsibility to exercise your rights and means of self-defense.
[01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:34.300]   And thankfully you can do it. And although I don't know exactly how the money will work
[01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:42.300]   out in the long run, there's a pretty good investment case that those guns will be useful.
[01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:48.820]   Guns are one of those investments, however, that you kind of hope doesn't work out. I
[01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:52.420]   really hope that a mutual fund goes up in value and I'm not real happy when it goes
[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:59.840]   down. But man, I hope I never have to use a gun. And I'm sure you do too. But if you
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:08.860]   ever do, or if you ever need it for the worst case, your national government is coming after
[01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:14.620]   you and 40 million of your fellow citizens, or 10 million of your fellow citizens, or
[01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:20.540]   5 million of your fellow citizens, or 50,000 of your fellow citizens, even those unlikely
[01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:26.300]   cases we have abundant historical evidence to demonstrate that there's a good reason
[01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:33.100]   to prepare for those. So act and arm yourself accordingly. I hope that the show has been
[01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:37.840]   useful for you. Hope it's been practical. I try to do keep things that are practical
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:46.100]   and interesting. So my hope is that practical to you and don't get distracted by other things
[01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:50.900]   I didn't talk about. I was going to talk about force multipliers and anyway, I'll skip it
[01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:55.140]   for now. I was trying to make this about investments, but I should have done more on magazines and
[01:27:55.140 --> 01:27:58.420]   scopes and night vision and all the rest of the stuff, but we'll save that for some other
[01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:05.000]   discussion. Snubnose 38, Glock 19, Ruger 10/22, AR-15, Remington 870, scoped long distance
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:11.620]   rifle and a .308 battle rifle. That is a start of a good home armory. And that is a start
[01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:16.780]   of a good collection that you'll be proud to have, hopefully you'll never use, and you'll
[01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:22.020]   pass it down to your great, great grandchildren, who all talk to each other about how wise
[01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:28.980]   you were and how overly paranoid you were and are thankful that you were.
[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:33.300]   Thank you for listening to today's show, you radical you. Before you go, I have one question
[01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:38.460]   for you. Was there an idea in today's show that helped you? Were you inspired? Were you
[01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:43.640]   motivated? Did you get an idea on how you can earn more or spend less money or invest
[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:49.400]   more wisely or perhaps protect yourself from catastrophe and insulate yourself from financial
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:54.020]   disaster or just improve your life and your lifestyle? Well, if so, I have three requests
[01:28:54.020 --> 01:29:02.020]   for you. Number one, take action. Listening doesn't improve your life. Doing, however,
[01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:07.640]   can revolutionize your life. Number two, take the idea or concept that you learned from
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:13.520]   me and go and teach somebody else. If you want to really learn something, go and teach
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:19.500]   it to others. That ripple effect of you to someone else will systematically transform
[01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:23.620]   your life and the lives of all those around you. Number three, if you thought there was
[01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:31.180]   financial value in what you just heard, I'd ask you to come by and pay for it at radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:34.920]   Now however much you want to pay, that's up to you. But if the show is worth a dollar
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:39.480]   a month, come by radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron and sign up to support the show at a dollar
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:44.360]   a month. If the show is worth $20 a month to you, I'd be happy to have your $20. Hey,
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:49.320]   if it's $1,000 a month, write me a check. Don't send it to me on Patreon, but I'd
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:56.560]   be happy to have that as well. radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron is where you can do that. Thank you.
