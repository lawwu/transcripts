[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.600]   Each of our lives are shaped by multiple forces, by the friends that we choose, by the parents
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.200]   we didn't choose, and by the socioeconomic class background that we had little or no
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.860]   control over.
[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.320]   So can we say that we are mainly the product of our background?
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.760]   It's a question to us from an anonymous young man, a college student, who writes this.
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.280]   "Hello Pastor John, I'm majoring in psychology right now and one of my professors is a 'radical
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.560]   behaviorist' and I have recently taken a course in learning and behavior.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.620]   In this course, my instructor teaches that according to B.F. Skinner's ideas, man is
[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.440]   basically a product of his environment and his reinforcements.
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.440]   In other words, Skinner argued that we are mechanical and do not have free will because
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.260]   we only act according to our reinforcements."
[00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.800]   Is there objective information that refutes Skinner's ideas from a biblical perspective
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.180]   and is there evidence outside of the Bible that suggests that we do have free will?
[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:16.880]   We have to start with the definition of free will in terms of the behaviorists like Skinner
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.220]   because the behaviorists, he's saying, are the ones denying that we have it.
[00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.040]   So we have to ask what are they denying?
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.320]   Just dump our definition in there and expect their statement to make any sense.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.920]   We have to know what they mean.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.080]   So what do they mean?
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:43.280]   What does Skinner mean or the behaviorists mean when they deny that we have free will?
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:55.640]   Well, he means human beings are unable in their natural capacities to choose contrary
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.640]   to the strongest natural influences on them.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.760]   That's what they mean, namely the environment that he referred to and the particular kinds
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.400]   of reinforcements that the environment gives up in the natural world.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.760]   In other words, since behaviorists are naturalists, this is so important to grasp, they're naturalists,
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.520]   that is, they don't believe in the supernatural.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.720]   They define free will without reference to the supernatural, without any reference to
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:36.760]   God or the human soul or the work of the Holy Spirit or the blinding effects of sin and
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.120]   Satan, so they operate totally within a box called the natural world.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:53.640]   And when they deny the existence of free will inside that box, they have to define it in
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.460]   those natural terms.
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.400]   So the free will that they are defining doesn't have anything to do in their minds with the
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.120]   supernatural.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.000]   It's simply naturalistic, mechanistic, that kind of description.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.160]   And what the term free will then affirms in this naturalistic world is that human choices
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:23.880]   always have natural causes, not supernatural ones, and the strongest natural cause in the
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.080]   environment will decisively control our choices.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:35.260]   So human beings do not have this kind of free will, that is, they are not able in their
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.720]   natural capacities to choose contrary to the strongest natural influence.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:49.880]   Now, if the person who wrote us this question is asking me to give evidence from inside
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:59.200]   the Bible or outside the Bible that such a free will does exist, I can't do it because
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.200]   it doesn't.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:09.000]   I agree with the behaviorist that human beings are not able in their natural capacities to
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.260]   choose contrary to their strongest natural influences.
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:23.220]   Of course, the behaviorist and I agree about the non-existence of this kind of naturalistic
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:31.260]   free will, or we do believe in this kind of naturalistic bondage for very different reasons.
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.900]   He believes in it because he rejects the supernatural.
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.600]   I believe in it because the supernatural tells me that it exists, that is, human beings apart
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.540]   from the supernatural are in fact in bondage to their strongest natural impulses.
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:53.960]   The Bible teaches that human beings are not able in their natural capacities to choose
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:01.140]   contrary to their strongest natural influences, not because there's no supernatural, but because
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:10.180]   sin and Satan work together to imprison man inside his love for this world in very naturalistic
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.180]   terms.
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:17.060]   That's why Paul calls the unbeliever a natural man.
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.620]   First Corinthians 2.14, he's dead to spiritual perceptions that could set him free to be
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.140]   influenced by God's truth and beauty.
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:34.380]   So if there's no supernatural reality, no God, no divine truth, no divine beauty, no
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.420]   divine saving action in this world, then the behaviorists are right.
[00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:45.820]   Man is a slave of the strongest natural influence in his environment.
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:51.340]   That's what the Bible teaches the natural man is bondage to.
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:59.860]   So if the behaviorist is to be shown wrong, he has to be shown wrong not just about the
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:06.340]   human will, but about God and about the deeper reality of human nature when that nature is
[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.260]   born again by the Spirit of God.
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.900]   So I'm taking the question now in that direction.
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:20.940]   Is there evidence outside the Bible that God exists and that human beings have a residue
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.860]   in their very souls of God's imprint on them?
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.700]   And the answer is yes, yes, yes.
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:33.420]   And the answer is given in Romans 1.18-21 and verse 32.
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:39.820]   So Paul says, "What can be known about God is plain to them," that is, to all humans,
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.960]   "because God has shown it to them."
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.960]   And here's what he means.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.220]   He doesn't mean in the Bible, he means in nature.
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:51.100]   "For His invisible attributes, namely His eternal power and divine nature, have been
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:57.420]   clearly perceived in the things that have been made.
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:04.420]   So they are without excuse, for although they knew God"—wow, what a powerful statement.
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.180]   All human beings know God.
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.460]   "Although they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give Him thanks, but they became
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.580]   futile in their thinking and their foolish hearts were darkened."
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.700]   That's Romans 1.18 following.
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:26.900]   So Paul believes God is not dependent on the Bible to show that He exists or that He is
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.020]   powerful and is worthy of thanks and honor.
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.900]   Behaviorists are responsible to know these things.
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:41.380]   The fact that they rule them out is because they are, as Paul says in verse 18, "suppressing
[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:42.540]   the truth."
[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.340]   They are guilty for this.
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:53.700]   And then in verse 32, Paul completes a long list of sins and says this, "They"—that
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:08:02.180]   is, all humans who do these kinds of sins—"they know God's righteous decree that those who
[00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.940]   practice such things deserve to die."
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.500]   Wow.
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.500]   Everybody knows.
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:15.900]   In other words, not only are the truth and beauty of God written in the natural world
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:23.980]   for all to see and be responsible to, but the truth and beauty of God's will, His moral
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:33.380]   will, is written on the human heart, and people really know that many immoral acts are wrong,
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:40.300]   but they suppress that knowledge in order to justify their own behavior.
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:48.540]   So the answer to the question is that if there is only a natural world, the behaviorists
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:56.260]   are right about the non-existence of free will understood as the natural capacity to
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:00.500]   choose contrary to the strongest natural influence.
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:07.780]   So to prove them wrong, one needs to show them that they are already wrong about God
[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.340]   and man.
[00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.380]   There's more than the natural world.
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:19.580]   Then—this should take us to a new APJ, maybe, because I'm done here—then they would have
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.900]   to pose the question of free will in a different way.
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:33.980]   They would have to ask what human freedom means if God ultimately governs all things,
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.380]   including the human will.
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:40.780]   But that we will have to wait for for another APJ.
[00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.700]   I will only leave a tantalizing clue.
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:53.580]   My definition of the highest, most lasting human freedom, namely Christian freedom, is
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:10:05.540]   the capacity of the human will to be swayed by truth so that choices are made which glorify
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:11.620]   God and leave no regret in a thousand years.
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:19.580]   And that capacity is only granted when we are set free by the Holy Spirit in new birth.
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:24.420]   Amen, and this episode ends where other episodes take up.
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:30.140]   And I'm thinking of APJ 774, "Is God Sovereign Over My Free Will?"
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.500]   That one comes to mind.
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:36.020]   Episode 774, "Is God Sovereign Over My Free Will?"
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.300]   You can find it online.
