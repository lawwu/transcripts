[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.120]   Okay, today I have the pleasure of speaking with Brian Potter, who is an engineer and
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.640]   the author of the excellent construction physics blog, where he writes about how the construction
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.740]   industry works and why it has been slow to industrialize and innovate.
[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.760]   And it's one of my favorite blogs on the internet, I highly, highly recommend that people check
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.760]   it out.
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.480]   Brian, my first question is about the line project in Saudi Arabia.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.200]   What are your opinions?
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.060]   Okay, yeah, just this will be a, just in no particular order.
[00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:40.280]   One that it's just, you know, interesting that this country Saudi Arabia is in the Middle
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:48.880]   East just kind of in general is just so willing to just do these big, crazy, ambitious building
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.880]   projects and just pour just huge amounts of money in constructing this infrastructure
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.100]   in a way that you don't see a huge amount in like the modern world, you know, they do
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.560]   it China, obviously does it huge amounts.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.080]   Some other minor places, but in general, you don't see a whole lot of countries doing just
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.640]   these big, massive, incredibly ambitious projects.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.440]   So like, on that level, it's like, interesting, like, yes, glad to see that you're doing this.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.240]   But like, the actual project is clearly insane and makes no sense.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.320]   I mean, just from like, this, the physical arrangement layout, right, like, there's a
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.160]   reason that cities, like grow in like, two dimensions, right, like, one dimensional city
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.560]   is like the worst possible arrangement for just like transportation, right?
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.800]   It's like your maximum, maximum amount of distance between any two points.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.040]   And so, you know, so just from that perspective, it's like, clearly crazy.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.760]   And there's, there's no real benefit to it, other than, you know, perhaps in some like
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.120]   weird hypothetical transportation situation where you had like really fast point to point
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.720]   transportation, some sort of weird bullet train setup, maybe it would make sense, but
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.760]   there's no reason to build there in general, there's no reason to build like a city like
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.760]   that, right?
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.960]   Even if you wanted to build like an entirely enclosed thing, which again, doesn't make
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.440]   a huge amount of sense, you would save so much material and effort if you just, you
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.800]   know, just make it a cube, make it, I would be more interested in the cube than the line.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.040]   But yeah, those are sort of my initial thoughts on it.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.760]   I will be surprised if it ever gets built.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.080]   The cube like from the meme about like, you can fill all the humans in a cube the size
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.080]   of Manhattan.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.080]   Yeah, yeah, something like that.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.000]   Or I mean, yeah, if you're just gonna build this big, giant megastructure, at least take
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.840]   advantage of what that gives you, which is like, you know, minimum surface area to volume
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.520]   ratio, stuff like that.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.520]   And why is that important?
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.520]   Is that for temperature and stuff?
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.440]   This is actually interesting, because I'm actually not sure how sure it would work with
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.080]   a giant, single city.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.240]   In general, a lot of economies of scale come from like geometric effects, where if something
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.360]   gets bigger, your volume increases a lot faster than your surface area does.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.400]   So first, like an enclosed thing, like a tank or a pipe or something like that, the cost
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.160]   goes down per thing of unit you're transporting, because you can carry a larger amount or less
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.560]   for a smaller amount of material, it applies to some extent with like buildings and construction,
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.320]   because the exterior wall assembly is like a really burdensome, and complicated and expensive
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.320]   assembly.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.560]   So for like a building with like a really big floor plate, for instance, that can get
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:46.960]   like more area per unit, per amount of like exterior wall, like all else being equal,
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.960]   be more efficient.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.040]   I'm not sure how actually that works with like a single giant enclosed structure, because
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.080]   theoretically, on a small level, it would apply the same way, like because your climate
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.360]   control is kind of a function of your exterior surface, like at some level, you get more
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.400]   efficient climate control, if you have a larger volume, you know, larger volume and less area
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.400]   that can escape from.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.400]   But for a giant city, I actually don't know if that works.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.240]   And it may be worse because you're generating so much heat that it's now harder to pump
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.240]   out.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.400]   Like, you know, the urban heat island effect and stuff like that, where these cities generate
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.400]   these massive amounts of like, just waste heat, I actually don't know if that would
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.760]   work, if it applies the way I might, you know, I'm trying to reach back to like my physics
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.760]   classes in college.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.120]   And so I'm not sure the actual mechanics of that.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.080]   But in general, that's why you know, why you'd want to perhaps build something of this size
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.080]   and shape.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.040]   What was the thought process behind designing this thing?
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.680]   Because like Scott Alexander did a good blog post about the line where he said, you know,
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.800]   presumably the line is designed to take up less space and to use less fuel because you
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.360]   can just use the same transportation across the line.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.120]   But like the only thing that Saudi Arabia has is space and fuel.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.480]   So like, what is the thought process behind this construction project?
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.080]   So I get the sense that a lot of cities, they're just, they're really, they've had some amount
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.880]   of success in building like big, impressive, physical construction projects that are just
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.280]   like an attraction just by virtue of like their size and impressiveness, like a huge
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.680]   amount of stuff like in Dubai, right, is something in this category.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.000]   And they have that giant clock tower in Jeddah that is like similar, like, oh, biggest giant
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.400]   clock, you know, building one of the biggest buildings in the world or like that.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.480]   So like, I think on some level, they're expecting that you can just see a return just from building
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:49.560]   something that's like really impressive, and the biggest thing on some particular axis
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.560]   or whatever.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.320]   So it could be, you know, there's some extent where I think they're just optimizing for
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:00.040]   like big and impressive, and maybe not diving into it more than that.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.000]   There's this, there's this theory that I think about every so often, it's called like the
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.720]   garbage can theory of organizational decision making, which is that, basically, the choices
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:17.600]   that organizations make are not the result of any particular recent process, they are
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.480]   the result of whenever a problem comes up, they reach into the garbage can of like, potential
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.480]   solutions.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.000]   And then whatever they pull out of the garbage can, that's what they the decision that they
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.680]   end up going with, regardless of how much sense that it makes.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.240]   It was invented, it was a theory that was invented by academics to describe decision
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.920]   making in academia.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.880]   But I think about that, especially with like big bureaucracies, governments, I think about
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.520]   that a lot, we can just imagine the horse trading process and like how these decisions
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.440]   just evolve, you can just imagine that any random decision, especially when there's such
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.000]   a disconnect between like decision makers and like technical knowledge and stuff like
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   that.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.360]   Tell me about your eBay arbitrage with designer clothes.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.040]   Oh, man, you really did dive deep.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:12.280]   Yeah, so this was a business, a small business that I ran for a few years, seven or eight
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.480]   years ago at this point.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:20.240]   Basically, a hobby of mine was just high end men's fashion for a while, which is a very
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.200]   strange hobby for an engineer to have, but there you go.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:30.520]   And basically, that hobby centers around, for the enthusiasts of it, it kind of centers
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:35.080]   around like finding stuff for cheap, because buying new can just be like overwhelmingly
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.760]   expensive.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.400]   But a lot of times you can get it for very cheap if you're even a little bit motivated,
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.040]   either it shows up at eBay or shows up in thrift stores if you know what to look for.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.960]   Especially because a lot of these clothes and things like that, they can last because
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.400]   they're well-made, they can last like a super, super, super long time.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.240]   And so even if somebody who has worn it for 10 years or something, it might be fine.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:01.200]   So a lot of this hobby centers on finding like ways to get this like really nice stuff
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.200]   for cheap.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:08.160]   And a lot of it is based around eBay, but it was really tedious to find really nice
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:13.600]   stuff on eBay, you kind of had to like manually search like a bunch of different brands, and
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:18.560]   then filter out obvious bad ones and search for like typos in brands that were like pretty
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.800]   reliably put in titles and stuff like that.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.520]   And so I was in the process of doing this, like, ah, this is really annoying, I should
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.320]   figure out a way to sort of automate this process.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:34.840]   And so I made a very simple web app that basically you would search for like, you know, shoes
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.880]   or something, and it would automatically search like the very nice brands of shoes, all the
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:43.360]   typos in the brand name, stuff like that, and it would just filter out all the junk,
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.200]   and let you search through like the good stuff.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:52.040]   And then I put a, you know, I set up an affiliate system, basically, so anybody else that used
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.640]   it, they would, I would get like a kick of the sales.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:03.480]   And yeah, so while I was interested in that hobby, I ran this website for a few years.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.920]   And it was, it was like reasonably successful, it was one of the first things I did that
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.700]   like got any real traction on the internet, but like, it was never successful in proportion
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:18.320]   to how much effort that it takes to like, maintain it and update it and stuff like that.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:24.080]   So kind of as I moved away from the hobby, I eventually stopped putting time and effort
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.080]   into maintaining website.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.600]   I'm curious as to how you even dug that up.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:35.760]   I have a friend who was with you at the Oxford Refugees Conference, Connor Tabarrok, I don't
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.200]   know if you remember.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.200]   Oh, nice.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.440]   No, finding other information about you on the internet actually was quite difficult.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.960]   You somehow managed to maintain your anonymity.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.680]   So and then if you're willing to reveal what was like the P&L of this project?
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:57.520]   Oh, it made maybe a few hundred dollars a month for a few years, but I only ever ran
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.920]   it like as a side hobby business, basically.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.840]   So in terms of like time, effort, you know, for my effort or whatever, I'm sure it was
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:10.080]   like very low, you know, pennies an hour or something like that.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:15.120]   So a broad theme that I've gotten from your post is that the construction industry is
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:23.360]   plagued with these lossy feedback loops, you know, a lack of strong economies of scale,
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.080]   regulation, and then, you know, mistakes being very costly.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:33.360]   Do you think that this is a general characteristic of many industries in our world today?
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.480]   Or is there something unique about construction?
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.480]   Interesting question.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.320]   I mean, that's kind of one thing you think of is there's a lot of like individual factors
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.520]   that are not unique at all, right?
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:48.560]   There's like, you know, construction is highly regulated, but it's not necessarily more regulated
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:55.080]   than like medical devices, or like jet travel, or even probably cars to some extent, which
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:00.840]   are very, you know, have a full battery of performance criteria that they need to hit.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.920]   So and like, you know, similar with like coupled to like land use or something like that, people
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:10.840]   say like, oh, it's, you know, the land requirements and have to build it on site, make it difficult.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:16.000]   But there's a lot of things that fall into that category that, again, don't really share
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.440]   the same, you know, structure of how the industry works than construction does.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.920]   So kind of, it's the, I think it's just kind of the interaction of all those effects.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:32.000]   One thing that I think is perhaps underappreciated is that a building is like, really, and then
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.860]   again, this is not unique either, but a building is really highly coupled in a way that the
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.600]   systems of the building are really highly coupled in a way that a lot of other things
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.920]   are, if you, you know, if you're manufacturing like a computer or something like that, right,
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.600]   the hard drive is somewhat independent from the display, somewhat independent from the
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.600]   power supply.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.680]   I mean, these things have coupled, but they can be built by independent people who don't
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:59.760]   really necessarily even talk to each other and assembled into one structured thing.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.880]   A building is not really like that at all.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:08.120]   Every single part affects every single other part for the most, in some ways, you know,
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.120]   it's like biology.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.880]   So it's very hard to change something that doesn't end up disrupting something else.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:18.840]   And part of that is because the job that a building does, which is to create a controlled
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:24.640]   interior environment, you know, basically every single system has to run through and
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:29.200]   around this, the sort of surfaces that are creating that controlled interior.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.680]   So everything is like kind of touching each other.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:36.240]   And again, that's not unique, you know, a plane or anything really highly engineered,
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:42.920]   an iPhone kind of shares that to some extent, but in terms of like the size of it and the
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:49.360]   relative small amount that you're paying in terms of like unit size or unit mass or something,
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.360]   it's quite low.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:54.640]   Is the fundamental reason you can't like have as much specialization and modularity?
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.640]   Is that basically a transportation cost?
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.320]   Yeah, I think it's really more just the way a building is, right?
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.760]   Like you can't, you know, for the, for example, for the electrical system of your house, you
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.320]   can't have like a separate box that is your electrical system that you would just install.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.280]   And if you needed to replace the electrical system, you could take the whole box out and
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.280]   put the new box in.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.680]   The electrical system runs through the entire house.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:22.080]   Same with plumbing, same with like the insulation, same with, you know, the interior finishes
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.080]   and stuff like that.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.720]   There's not like, there's not a lot of like modularity in like a physical sense.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.720]   Gotcha.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.720]   Okay.
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:35.600]   Now, Ben Kuhn had this interesting comment on your article about why it's hard to innovate
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:40.080]   in construction, where he pointed out that many of the reasons you give for why it's
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:46.760]   hard to innovate in construction, like the sequential dependencies and the highly variable
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:52.560]   like delivery timelines, that that's also common in software where Ben Kuhn works.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:59.480]   So why do you think that the same sort of stagnation has not hit other industries that
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.800]   have superficially similar characteristics like software?
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.240]   You know, what I kind of think about that is that you set, you kind of see a similar
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:11.800]   structure in anything that's kind of like project based or anything where you're kind
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:16.240]   of having to like, there's an element of figuring out what you're doing while you're doing it.
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:20.840]   You know, compared to like a large scale manufacturing option, right, you spend a lot of time figuring
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:25.000]   out what exactly it is that you're building, and then you spend a lot of time designing
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   it to be built.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.240]   And then, you know, your first number of runs through it, right, you tweak your process
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.240]   to make it more efficient.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:35.920]   But at some point you and there's always an element of like tweaking it to make it better.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:42.440]   But to some extent, the process of like figuring out what you're doing is largely separate
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.520]   from like the actual doing of it yourself.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.280]   For a large, for a project based industry, it's not quite like that you're kind of having
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.680]   to build your process on the fly while you do it.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.000]   And of course, there's best practices that shape it, right, like for somebody writing
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.360]   a new software project or anything other project based, right, like making a movie or something
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.360]   like that.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.320]   They know roughly how it's going to go together.
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.080]   But, you know, there's going to be a lot of unforeseen things that kind of come up like
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.080]   that.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:17.220]   I think the biggest difference is that either those things can often scale in a way that
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:18.320]   you can't with a building.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.760]   Like once, if you, once you're done with the software project, you can deploy it to a thousand
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.560]   or a hundred thousand or a million people, right?
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:30.960]   Once you're, once you, once you finish making a movie, again, you can, a hundred million
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.440]   people can, can do it or whatever.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:38.280]   It doesn't quite look the, uh, the same with, uh, with a building.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:44.920]   You don't really have the ability to like spend a lot of time upfront figuring out how
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:45.920]   this thing needs to go.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.000]   You kind of need to figure out a way to get this thing to go together without spending
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.480]   a huge amount of time that maybe would be justified by the size of it.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.920]   And yeah, he, he's definitely right.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:01.520]   I mean, I, I, I was able to dig up a few references for yeah, software projects and how often
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.920]   they just have these big, long tails of sometimes they just go massively, massively over budget.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:10.240]   A lot of times they just, you know, don't get completed at all or, you know, but if,
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:16.120]   which is shocking, but yeah, because of how, how many people it can then be deployed to
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.640]   after it's done, the economics of it are slightly different.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.640]   I see.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.360]   There's a famine, a famous law in software, I forget the name of it, which is that a project
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.680]   will take longer than you expect, even after your account for the fact that it will take
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:29.680]   longer than you expect.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.680]   Yeah.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:31.680]   Hofstetter's law or something like that.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.680]   I think it is.
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.680]   Yeah.
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:39.320]   But so I'm curious what's the, what the lack of skill in construction implies for startups,
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:44.160]   like famously in software, the fact that there's zero marginal cost to scaling to the next
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.160]   customer.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.320]   That's like a huge boon to a startup.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.320]   Right.
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:51.360]   A startup of which is just scaling with like a hockey exponentially.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:56.880]   Does that like fundamentally constrain with like the size and quantity of startups you
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.680]   can have in construction if this game scaling is not available?
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.080]   Yeah, that's a really good question.
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:07.040]   I mean, I, the obvious first part of the answer is that for software, obviously, if you have
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:12.520]   a construction software company, you can scale it just like any other software business.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.520]   Right.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.640]   But for like physical things, it is a lot more difficult.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:22.360]   And yeah, this like lack of like zero marginal costs tended to fight a lot of startups, right?
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.000]   Not just construction ones, but yeah, it's definitely a thing.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:31.440]   Construction is, I think, particularly brutal because the just margins are so low.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:37.400]   And then just the empirical fact that trying what seems like it would be a more efficient
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:43.080]   method of building doesn't actually let you do it cheaper and like get better margins.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:48.440]   Like a startup that I used to work at, Katerra, their whole business model was basically predicated
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:52.640]   on that, you know, oh, we'll just build all our buildings in these big factories and get
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:58.080]   huge economies of scale and reduce our costs and then make the billions of dollars that
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.520]   we're pumping into this industry or into this business, we'll be able to recoup it.
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.480]   And it, you know, the math just does not work out.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:11.040]   You can't build, in general, you can't build cheap enough to kind of recoup those giant
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.040]   upfront costs.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.680]   And a lot of businesses have kind of been burned that way.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:20.680]   And the most success you see in like prefab type stuff is like on the higher end of things
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.360]   where you can get higher margins.
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.960]   And so a lot of these companies, these like prefab companies and stuff like that, they
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:31.160]   tend to target the higher end of the market where there is, and you kind of see a few
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.480]   different premiums for that.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.120]   You know, the obvious one is that if you're targeting the higher end, you maybe have higher
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.120]   margins.
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:45.680]   If you're building to a higher level of quality, that's easier to do in a factory environment.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:51.600]   And so you're, you end up being like cheaper than, or at least a lot, the Delta is a lot
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:56.480]   different, less enormous than it would be, you know, you can build it a little bit, building
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:01.200]   a high level of quality, it's easier to do in a factory than it is in a, in the field.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:06.560]   So a lot of buildings that are like, or houses that are like built to a really high level
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:10.880]   of like energy performance, for instance, like need a really, really high level of air
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:15.320]   sealing to minimize like how much energy this house uses.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:20.840]   You tend to see a lot more houses like that built out of prefab construction and other
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:25.680]   like factory built methods, because it's just physically more difficult to achieve that
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.680]   onsite.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:32.880]   Can you say more about why you can't use prefabrication in a factory to get economies of scale?
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.280]   Is it just the transportation costs will eat away any gains you get?
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.520]   Or is there like, what, what is, what is going on?
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.760]   Yeah, there's a, there's a combination of effects.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:40.760]   I haven't worked through all this.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.480]   This is going to be the next block that's basically solved.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.360]   I figured it out more by then.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:52.640]   But the very basic high at a high level is that, yeah, basically your savings are not
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:57.840]   that you get from like using less labor or whatever like that are not quite enough to
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.520]   offset your, your increased transportation costs.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:04.880]   One thing about construction, especially like, like single family home construction, is that
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:10.160]   a huge percentage of your costs are just the materials that you're using, right?
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:16.160]   Like a single family home is roughly 50% labor, 50% materials for the construction costs.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:21.200]   And then you have development costs and stuff like that, land costs, things like that.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.800]   And so a big chunk of that, you just can't move to the factory at all, right?
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:29.320]   Like the foundation, you can't, it's, you can't really do that in a factory.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.480]   You could prefab the foundation, but it doesn't gain you anything.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.800]   Your excavation still has to be done on site, obviously.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.040]   So a big chunk of that can't move to the factory at all.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:43.700]   And for ones that can, you still basically have to pay the same amount for materials.
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:47.280]   If you were doing it, like, theoretically, that wouldn't be true.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:52.520]   If you're doing like huge, truly huge volume where you can get material volume discounts,
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.280]   but even then it's probably not looking at like an asset saving.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:58.120]   So you can cut out like a big chunk of your labor.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:02.660]   And you do see that in these, in like factory built construction, right?
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:06.240]   Like these prefab companies or like mobile home companies, they have like a really small
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:12.240]   fraction of labor as their costs, which is pretty typical from a factory in general.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:15.240]   But then they take out all that labor costs, they still have their high material costs,
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:19.320]   and then they have this overhead cost of like whatever the factory has cost to them, right?
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:23.560]   And then you have your additional overhead costs of just yet transporting it to site,
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:31.920]   which is pretty limited and just the math does not really work out in favor of prefab
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:35.560]   in terms of like being able to build like dramatically cheaper, right?
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:43.320]   You can obviously build a building using prefab methods and build a successful construction
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.920]   business like that, like many people do.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.560]   But in terms of like dramatically lowering your costs, you don't really see that.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.680]   Austin Vernon has an interesting blog post about this, why there's not more prefabricated
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.680]   homes.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.040]   And then the two things he points out were like transportation costs.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:03.840]   And the other one was that people prefer to have homes that have like unique designs or
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:04.840]   unique features.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.120]   When I was reading it, it actually occurred to me that maybe they're actually both the
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.360]   result of the same phenomenon.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:14.040]   So like, have you heard of like, I don't know if I'm pronouncing it correctly, but the Alkion
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.040]   Allen theorem in economics?
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.040]   Maybe.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.960]   I don't think so.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:25.480]   Basically it's the idea that if you increase the cost of some like category of goods in
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:29.720]   a fixed way, like let's say you tax oranges, right?
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:34.720]   Like added $1 tax to all oranges or I don't know if transportation for oranges gets $1
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:39.120]   more expensive for all oranges, that people will shift consumption towards the higher
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:45.080]   grade variety because now the ratio of the cost between like the higher, the more expensive
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:48.720]   orange and the less expensive orange, that ratio has decreased because of the increase
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.360]   in fixed costs.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:56.120]   And it seems like you could use that argument to also explain why people have like strong
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:01.080]   preferences for uniqueness and all kinds of design stuff in manufactured houses, which
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:05.400]   is that since transportation costs are so high, that's like basically a fixed cost.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.720]   And that fixed cost has the effect of making people shift consumption towards like higher
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.720]   grade options.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:15.040]   I definitely think that, sir, I basically, I would maybe phrase this as the construction
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:20.560]   industry makes it relatively, comparatively cheap to like deliver a highly customized
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.560]   option compared to like a really repetitive option, right?
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:29.800]   And so people, yeah, it's the ratio between a highly customized one and just a commodity
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.080]   one is relatively small.
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:37.160]   And so you see kind of the industry built around delivering somewhat more customized
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.160]   options.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:48.080]   I do think that this is a pretty broad intuition that people just desire too much customization
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:53.000]   from their homes and that really prevents you having a mass produced offering.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.480]   I do think that that is true to some extent.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:24:00.000]   I mean, to one, I think one example is this like the Levittown houses, which were originally
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.120]   built just in huge numbers of like exactly the same model over and over again.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.800]   And eventually they kind of had to change their business model to be able to deliver
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.560]   more customized options because the market shifted.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:18.240]   I do think that the effect of that is basically pretty overstated.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:24.360]   Just empirically, you see that in practice, home builders and developers will deliver
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.000]   fairly repetitive housing.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.880]   They don't seem to have a really hard time doing that.
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:34.240]   As an example, I'm living in a new developed housing development that is just like three
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:38.600]   or four different houses copy pasted over and over again in Group of 50.
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:43.360]   The developer is building a whole bunch of other developments that are very similar in
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.360]   this area.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:48.080]   My in-laws live in a very similar development in a whole different state.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:53.040]   And if you just look like multifamily or apartment housing, right, it's like identical apartments,
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:57.480]   you know, copy pasted over and over again in the same building or a bunch of different
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.760]   buildings in the same development, right?
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.960]   It's not, you're not seeing like huge amounts of uniqueness in these things.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:09.800]   People are clearly willing to just live in these like basically copy pasted apartments.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:16.720]   And it's also quite possible to get a pretty high amount of product variety using a relatively
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.280]   small number of factors that you vary, right?
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:24.920]   I mean, the car industry is like this, right, where you can, there's enough customization
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:30.520]   options where I was reading this book a while ago that was basically pushing back against
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:37.560]   the idea that the car industry didn't, you know, the pre, you know, in the 50s and 60s,
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.400]   we're just offering a very uniform product.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:43.800]   And they did basically the math and the number of customization options on their car were
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.320]   like more than the atoms in the universe, basically, just there's so many different
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:48.320]   options.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:52.560]   So like all the computations, you know, leather seats, and you know, this type of stereo and
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:56.640]   this type of engine, if you add it all up, there's just like just a huge massive number
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.800]   of different combinations.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:03.520]   And yeah, and just, you can obviously customize a house just a huge amount, just by like the
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.480]   appliances that you have, and the finishes that are in there, and the paint colors that
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:11.440]   you choose, and the fixtures, and stuff like that, it would not really change, theoretically,
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.320]   the underlying way that the building goes together.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:20.800]   So I do think that that idea that the sort of fundamental demand for variety is a major
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:21.800]   obstruction.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:26.480]   I feel like I do not think there's a whole lot of evidence for that in the construction
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.480]   industry.
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.480]   Interesting.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.240]   So I'm going to ask you on Twitter what I should ask you.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:37.600]   And usually I don't get interesting responses from this, but the quality of the people in
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.600]   the audience that knows who you are was so high, that actually all the questions I got
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.600]   were really interesting.
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.240]   So I'm just going to ask you some questions from Twitter.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.240]   Okay.
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.240]   Okay.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:50.840]   So Connor Tavarock asks, "What is the most unique thing that would or should get built
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.280]   in the absence of construction regulation?"
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.280]   Yeah.
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.280]   Interesting.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.280]   Unique thing.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.280]   Yeah.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.280]   Unique is an interesting qualifier.
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.000]   So there's a lot of things that just like should get built, right?
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:06.440]   Just like huge more, huge amounts of additional housing or just like creating more land where
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:10.080]   in these sort of really dense urban environments where we need it, like, you know, places like
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.920]   San Francisco just fill in a big chunk of that bay.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.760]   It's basically just mud flat and put more housing on it.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:19.240]   I saw a proposal like that earlier.
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:23.040]   Unique thing is, or tricky.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:28.880]   One idea that I really like, I read this in the book, "Where's My Flying Car?"
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:34.520]   But that it's basically crazy that our cities are designed with roads that like all intersect
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.520]   with each other.
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.440]   It just meant, you know, that's just a crazy way to like structure a material flow problem
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.440]   basically.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:46.160]   And like any sane city would be built with like multiple layers of like transportation
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.680]   where each one went in like a different direction.
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.960]   So your flows would just be massively, massively improved.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.920]   And that just seems like a very obvious one that if you're building your cities, that's
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.720]   not, that's slightly off topic of the question, but if you're building your cities from scratch,
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.720]   right?
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:04.720]   And had your druthers, you would clearly want to build them in like, and knew how big it
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.720]   was going to get, right?
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:10.400]   So you could plan law very long-term in a way that, you know, again, almost no cities
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:16.480]   did, but be able to plan so these transportation systems don't intersect with each other and
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:20.920]   you have the space to scale them or run as much throughput through them as you need without
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:24.040]   like bringing the whole system to, to a halt.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:29.200]   There's a lot of evidence that basically says that cities, you know, tend to scale based
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.640]   on how much you can move from point A to point B through them.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:36.960]   And I do wonder if you like, you changed the way that they went together, you could unlock
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:42.120]   like massively different cities or, or, or, or even if you didn't unlock massive, didn't
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:45.960]   want to change like the agglomeration effects that you see in, in cities, if people could
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.400]   move from point A to point B much quicker than they can.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:56.800]   So I did an episode about the book, where's my flying car with, with Rohith Krishnan.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.440]   And I don't know if we discussed this, but yeah, that was an interesting part of the
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:02.720]   book where he talks about like transistor design.
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:06.920]   Like if you design transistors this way, like, can you imagine how slow they would be?
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.080]   Okay.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:13.160]   So Simon Grimm asks, what countries are the best at building things?
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:17.000]   Yeah, this is a good question.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:24.280]   I'm going to, again, sort of cheat a little bit and do it in space and in, and in time.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:27.960]   Cause I think a lot of the most countries that are most interesting in doing a good
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:32.080]   job at building vast amounts of stuff are not ones that are basically doing it correctly.
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:35.000]   I mean, the current answer is, is, is like China, right.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.240]   Where they're just building, you know, you know, more, more concrete use in the last
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:44.200]   20 years or whatever, than the entire world use in, in the time before that, right.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:49.680]   Just like big, massive amounts of, of urbanization, a lot of like really interesting buildings
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.680]   and into construction.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:54.520]   I mean, just in terms of like raw output, right, you got to get to that.
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:30:01.000]   I would also put like Japan in like the late 20th century on, on there basically at the
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.080]   peak of like concern, like wonder, like, is Japan going to, going to take over the world?
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:11.760]   And they, you know, they were really interested in building their, their stuff quite quickly.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:16.720]   They spent a lot of time and effort trying to use their like robotics expertise to try
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:22.000]   to figure out how to build buildings a lot more quickly.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.040]   So they had these like really interesting factories that were designed to basically
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:33.000]   extrude a tire skyscraper, just going up vertically and all these like big, giant companies developed.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.520]   So they had like these many, many different factories that were kind of trying to do this
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:41.160]   with all these robotics, really interesting system that did not end up ever making economic
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:44.800]   sense, but it is, it is very cool.
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:52.680]   The I think they're sort of big industrial policy organs of the government basically
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:57.920]   encouraged a lot of these industrial companies and stuff to like basically develop prefabricated
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:59.080]   housing systems.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:05.900]   And so you see a lot of really interesting systems developed from these, from these sort
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:10.680]   of industrial companies in a way that you don't see in a lot of other places.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:19.520]   The U S basically just from 1850 to maybe 1970, so for like a hundred years or something,
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:24.160]   just building like just huge, massive amounts of stuff and in a way that like lifted up
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.560]   like huge parts of the economy, right?
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:31.360]   Like, you know, they, we spent all this, you know, I don't know how many thousands of miles
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:36.840]   of railroad track that the U S built between like 1850 and 1900, but it was many, many,
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:41.880]   many thousands of miles of it, and of course needing to lay all this track and build all
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:45.640]   these locomotives really sort of forced the development of the machine tool industry,
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:50.560]   which then led to the development of like better manufacturing methods and interchangeable
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:54.560]   parts, which of course then led to the development of the auto industry.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:32:00.080]   And of course that explosion just led to even more big giant construction projects.
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:04.280]   So you really see that these just sort of being able to build just big, massive amounts
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:09.480]   of stuff really in this virtuous cycle with the U S really advanced a lot of technology
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:14.680]   and really sort of raised the standard of development just for a super long period of
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.680]   time.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:16.680]   Yeah.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.640]   So those are kind of my, my three answers.
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.640]   Yeah.
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.600]   Those three bring up three additional questions.
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.600]   One for each of them.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.600]   That's really interesting.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:29.560]   Have you read the power broker, the book about Robert Moses?
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:33.560]   I think I got like a, like a 10th of the way through it.
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:34.560]   Yeah.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:35.560]   That's basically a whole book in itself.
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:36.560]   A 10th of the way.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:41.520]   No, but I'm like a half of the way through.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:45.680]   And so far it's like basically the story of how this one guy built a startup within the
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:52.120]   New York state government that was just so much more effective at building things.
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:56.520]   Didn't have the same corruption and clientelism and incompetence of the Tammany Hall political
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.280]   machine at the time.
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.760]   And you know, maybe, maybe it like turns into tragedy in the second half, but so far it's
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.240]   like, we need this guy.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.920]   Like where do we get a second Robert Moses?
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:09.440]   Do you think that if you had more people like that in government or in the construction
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:17.080]   industries, public works would be more effectively built or is that just, is the stagnation there
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:20.080]   just a result of like other bigger factors?
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.080]   Yeah.
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.480]   That's, it's an interesting question.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:27.040]   I remember reading this, this article a while ago that was complaining about like how horrible
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.760]   Penn Station is in New York.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:36.040]   And they're basically saying, yeah, we basically, it would be nice to return to the era of like
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:42.400]   the sort of unbound technocrat or like these people, these technical experts in like these
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:47.000]   high positions of power in government could essentially do kind of whatever they wanted
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   to some extent.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   Right.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   And if they thought something should be built somewhere, they basically had the power to
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   do it.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.980]   You know, it's just kind of a facet of this problem of just how it's really, really hard
[00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:00.240]   to get stuff built in the U.S. currently.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:05.680]   And I'm sure part of it is just that you don't see like these really talented technocrats
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:12.680]   or whatever occupy in these high positions of government where they can get stuff done.
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:18.480]   But it's not super obvious to me whether that's like the limiting factor.
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.480]   Right.
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:23.960]   I kind of get the sense that they would end up being bottlenecked by some other part of
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:24.960]   the process.
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:33.480]   I mean, the whole sort of interlocking set of institutions has just become so risk averse
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:37.960]   that they would end up just being blocked by, you know, in a way that they wouldn't
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:42.920]   if, you know, when they were operating in the 1950s and 60s or whatever.
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:43.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:45.920]   That's interesting.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:46.920]   All right.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:51.480]   So speaking of Japan, I just recently learned that they have like a lot of the construction
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:55.880]   there is that they just keep tearing stuff down every 30 to 40 years and rebuilding it.
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:35:00.160]   So you have this interesting series of posts on how you would go about building a house
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:03.160]   or a building that lasts for a thousand years.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:07.240]   But I'm curious, how would you build a house or building that only lasts for 30 or 40 years
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.600]   if you're building in Japan and you know they're going to tear it down soon?
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.840]   What changes about the construction process?
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.840]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:19.680]   I mean, I'm not an expert on Japanese construction, but I think like a lot of their interior walls
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:23.040]   are basically just, you know, paper and stuff like that.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:28.480]   I actually think it's kind of surprising they use a somewhat for their, a lot of their homes,
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:34.120]   last time I looked, they used like a sort of surprising post and beam construction method,
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:37.000]   which is actually somewhat labor intensive to do.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.360]   The U.S. in like the early 1800s used a pretty similar method and then once we started mass
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:47.560]   producing dimensional lumber, we kind of stopped doing that because it was much cheaper to
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:52.360]   build out of two by fours than it was like big, heavy posts that would be mortise and
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.840]   tenon connections, stuff like that.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:59.400]   I mean, I think the boring answer to that question is that you would just build like
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:06.720]   we build mobile homes essentially, which is just using pretty, you know, pretty thin walls,
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:13.160]   pretty low-end materials that are just gotten together pretty, you know, in a pretty sort
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:21.120]   of, you know, minimal way, which ends up being not that different than the actual construction
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:27.120]   method that single-family homes use, but just even further economizes and tightens the use
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:32.600]   of materials, you know, where a single-family home might use a half-inch plywood or whatever,
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:37.120]   they might try to use, you know, three-sixteenths or even an eighth-inch plywood or something
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.120]   like that.
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:43.600]   So, probably a pretty similar way to the way most single-family homes and multi-family
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:51.920]   homes are built currently, just like with an even tighter use of materials, yeah, which
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:57.960]   perhaps isn't something that's super nice about the way that you guys build their homes.
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:02.680]   Okay, so China is the third one here.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:07.320]   There's been a lot of talk about a potential real estate bubble in China that they're building
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.120]   housing in places that people don't really need it.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:15.160]   And of course, maybe the demographics aren't there to support the demand.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.160]   What do you think of all this talk?
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:20.920]   I don't know if you're familiar with it, but is there a real estate bubble that's created
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.800]   by all this competence in building?
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.240]   Oh, gosh, yeah.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.840]   I have no idea.
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:31.600]   Like you, I've definitely heard talk of it and I've seen like, you know, the little YouTube
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:35.880]   clips of like them knocking down all these towers that it turns out they didn't need
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:40.720]   or like the developer couldn't, can't finish or whatever.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:45.240]   I, yeah, I don't know a huge amount about that in general.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:50.560]   I wish I knew a lot more about how things are built in China, but the information, it's
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:56.600]   in general so opaque and I generally kind of assume that any sort of particular piece
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:01.240]   of data that comes out of China has like giant error bars on it as to whether it's true or
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:03.800]   not or like what the context surrounding it is.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:09.260]   So in general, I do not have a far opinion about that.
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:11.680]   And then this is the second part of Simon's question.
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:16.320]   Does greater competence in being able to build stuff, does that translate into other good
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:22.400]   outcomes for these countries like higher GDP or lower rents or other kinds of more outcomes?
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.240]   That's a good question.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:29.480]   Japan is interesting example where basically people point to it as a sort of example of,
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:33.800]   you know, here's a country that builds like huge amounts of housing and they don't have
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.800]   housing cost increases.
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:39.960]   And in general, we should expect that dynamic to be true, right?
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:45.840]   We should, there's no reason to not think that housing cost is essentially a supply
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:50.080]   and demand problem that you built as much as people wanted the cost to drop.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.600]   Like I have no reason to not think that's true.
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:57.640]   There is a little bit of evidence that sort of suggests that the cost of housing will
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:03.320]   kind of, it's just impossible to build housing enough to overcome this sort of mechanic where
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:10.240]   the cost of it tend to match, to tend to rise to whatever people's income level are.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:18.000]   Like the peak and the sort of flattening of housing costs in Japan also parallel with
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.840]   people basically stopped getting raises and income stopped rising in Japan.
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:32.480]   So I don't have a good sense of, again, if it ends up being just more driven by some
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.480]   sort of other factors.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:39.560]   But in general, I expect the very basic answer of if you build a lot more houses, the housing
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:40.560]   will become cheaper.
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:41.560]   Right.
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:46.240]   Speaking of how the land keeps gaining value as people's income go up, what is your opinion
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.240]   of Georgism?
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:51.160]   Like does that kind of trend make you think that housing is a special asset that needs
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:54.040]   to be more heavily taxed because it's not, you're not inherently like doing something
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:57.600]   productive just by owning land that the way you would be if you like built a company or
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:58.600]   something?
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:04.200]   I don't have any special deep knowledge of Georgians and it's one on my list of topics
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:06.160]   to read more deeply.
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:10.960]   I mean, yeah, I do think in general, yeah, you know, taxing encourages to produce less
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.680]   stuff for something that you can't produce less of.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:20.120]   It's a good avenue for something to tax more heavily and then yeah, obviously if you sort
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:25.520]   of had a really high land value tax in these places that have like a lot of single family
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:30.000]   homes in like dense urban areas like Seattle or San Francisco or something like that, yeah,
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:36.080]   that would probably encourage the land to be used a lot more efficiently.
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:41.920]   So it does make sense, yeah, it makes sense to me, but I don't have any special knowledge
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:42.920]   about it.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.920]   All right.
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:48.080]   Ben Kunask on Twitter, what construction related advice would you give to somebody building
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.080]   a new charter city?
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:50.080]   That is interesting.
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:55.400]   I mean, I think I would just off the top of my head, I would be interested in if you could
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:41:01.240]   really figure out a way to build that would like using a method that have like really
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:02.560]   high upfront costs.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:07.880]   I don't think it could otherwise be justified, but if you're going to build, you know, 10,000
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:12.360]   buildings or whatever all at once, you could really take advantage of that.
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:18.520]   One kind of thing that you see is that a lot of in the sort of post-World War II era is
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:24.520]   that we're building such as huge massive amounts of housing and a lot of times building them
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:25.920]   all in one place, right?
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:29.880]   Like the Levittown builders were building like thousands and thousands of houses like
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:33.920]   in one big development all at once, like in California it was the same thing, just building
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:38.640]   like five or 10 or 15,000 houses in one just big massive development.
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:44.200]   And there you end up seeing something like that where they basically build like this
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:49.960]   like little factory on their construction site and then use that to like fabricate all
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:50.960]   these things.
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.840]   And then you have like, you have almost like a reverse assembly line where people like
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:58.760]   go to one house and install like the walls or whatever, and then go to the next house
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:41:59.760]   and do the same thing.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:03.040]   Following right behind them would be the guys doing the electrical, you know, the plumbing
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.040]   and stuff like that.
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:08.520]   So like this reverse assembly line system that allowed you to sort of get these things
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:11.600]   up like really, really fast, like in 30 days or something like that.
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:15.480]   A house, just thousands and thousands of houses at once.
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:19.720]   So I think you could, you know, you would want to be able to do something similar where
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:24.200]   you could, you know, don't just do it the way that, don't just do the construction the
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:28.240]   way that the normal construction is done.
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:29.720]   I mean, but that's hard, right?
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:35.840]   Because a lot of the, the sort of centrally planned city never seemed, or like the top
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:39.400]   down planned city never seems to do particularly well, right?
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:43.960]   Like what's the city, Brasilia or whatever, the one that they built and it was supposed
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:47.280]   to be a planned city in like the age of like, again, with the, you know, it goes back to
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:51.680]   like the unfettered technocrat who can sort of build whatever he wants, right?
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:56.800]   A lot of times what you want is something that sort of responds at a low level and organically
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:00.880]   to sort of the factories as they develop, and you don't want something that's planned
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:05.800]   totally top down, that's disconnected from all the sort of jays on the ground and a lot
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:10.120]   of, you know, what the opposition to Robert Moses and something like that ended up being
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:11.480]   that in a certain form, right?
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:15.600]   Like he's bulldozing through these cities that are these buildings and neighborhoods
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:19.640]   that he doesn't, is not paying attention to at all.
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:24.200]   And so I think, you know, just to go back to the question, trying to sort of plan your
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:28.920]   city from, from the top down, I don't think that doesn't have like a super, super great
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:29.920]   track record, right?
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:34.520]   In general, you want your sort of city to sort of develop a little bit more organically.
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:38.880]   I guess I would think just really, you know, really good sort of land use rules that are
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:42.680]   really thought through well and encourage the things that you want to encourage and
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:47.200]   not discourage the things that you don't want to discourage, you know, don't have
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:52.280]   equity and zoning or whatever, allow a lot of mixed use construction and stuff like that.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:58.760]   So yeah, I guess that's, that's a somewhat foreign answer, but probably something like
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:43:59.760]   that.
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:00.760]   Interesting.
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:01.760]   Interesting.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:05.080]   So do you realize that there would be like high upfront costs to building a city?
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:09.800]   Because if you need to like build 10,000 homes at once to achieve these economies of scale,
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:13.560]   then you would need to raise like tens of billions of dollars before you could build
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:14.560]   a charter city.
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:15.560]   Yeah.
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:21.600]   If you were trying to lower your costs of construction, but again, you know, that if,
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.720]   if you have the setup to do that, you wouldn't necessarily need to raise it, right?
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:29.720]   Like these, these other big developments were built by developers that essentially saw an
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:30.720]   opportunity, right?
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:35.040]   So it didn't require, it didn't require public funding necessarily to do, I mean, it did
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:41.200]   in the form of like loans, you know, loan guarantees for veterans and things like that,
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:45.360]   but they didn't have to, the government to go and buy the land.
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:46.360]   Right.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:47.360]   Okay.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:48.360]   So the next question is from Austin Vernon.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:53.360]   And to be honest, I don't understand the question, but I'm, you two are too smart for me, but
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:56.720]   hopefully you'll be able to explain the question and then also answer it.
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:00.640]   Hey guys, I hope you're enjoying the conversation so far.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:05.400]   If you are, I would really, really appreciate it.
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:10.560]   If you could share the episode with other people who you think might like it, this is
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:17.240]   still a pretty small podcast, so it's basically impossible for me to exaggerate how much it
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:22.600]   helps out when one of you shares the podcast, you know, put the episode in the group chat
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:26.680]   you have with your friends, post it on Twitter, send it to somebody who you think might like
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:27.680]   it.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:30.160]   All of those things helps out a ton.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:32.840]   Anyways, back to the conversation.
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:37.360]   What are your power rankings for technologies that can tighten construction tolerances?
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:42.120]   And he gives examples like AR/VR, CNC cutting, and synthetic wood products.
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:43.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:45.160]   So this is a, this is a very interesting question.
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:51.040]   So basically because buildings are built, you know, manually on site by hand, there's
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:54.840]   just a lot of variation in what ends up being built, right?
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:58.920]   There's that, you know, things aren't, there's, there's only so accurate, so accurately that
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:04.880]   a person can put something in place if they don't have any sort of age or stuff like that.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:07.840]   So just the placement of materials tends to be, have a lot of variation in it.
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:12.400]   And then the materials themselves kind of have a lot of variation in them.
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:15.760]   You know, the obvious example is like wood, right?
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:21.040]   Where a one two by four is not going to be exactly the same as the adjacent two by four.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:25.600]   It may be warped, it may have knots in it, it may be split or something like that.
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:30.920]   And then also because these materials are sitting just outside in the elements, they
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:36.120]   sort of end up getting a lot of distortion, they either absorb moisture and sort of expand
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:40.720]   and contract, or they grow and shrink because of the heat.
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:46.080]   So there's, yeah, there's just a lot of variation that goes into putting a, putting a building
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:53.120]   up into some, you know, it's to some extent, it probably constrains what you are, what
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:56.240]   you are able to build and how effectively you're able to build it.
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:01.640]   I kind of gave an example before of, you know, really energy efficient buildings and they're
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:07.560]   really hard to build in, on site using sort of conventional methods because just the air
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.240]   sealing is quite difficult to do.
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:15.280]   You have to build it in a much more precise way than like is typically done and is really
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:18.520]   easily achieved on site.
[00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:24.040]   So I guess in terms of examples of things that I, that would, would make that easier.
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:28.560]   I mean, he gives some, he gives some good ones like, you know, engineered lumber, which
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:32.720]   is like, you take lumber and you grind it up into like strands or chips or whatever
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:37.120]   and you basically glue it back together, which does a couple of things.
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:42.120]   It basically spreads all the knots and the defects out so they aren't concentrated.
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:46.760]   And then it lets you get like a lot, everything tends to be a lot more uniform when it's made
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:47.760]   like that.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.360]   So I guess that's a, that's a very obvious one.
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.720]   I mean, that's already widespread use.
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:56.580]   I don't really see that making a substantial change.
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:48:02.320]   I guess the one exception to that would be that there's this engineered lumber product
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:07.600]   called, or like mass timber elements, CLT is a big one, which is like a super plywood
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:13.920]   where plywood is made from like tiny little sheet thin strips of wood, right?
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:20.640]   And then CLT is made from like two by fours, dimensional lumber, glued, like cross laminated
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:21.640]   layers or whatever.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:26.840]   So it's like, instead of a four by eight sheet of plywood, you have like a 12 by 40 sheet
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:30.200]   of like dimensional lumber glued together.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:33.760]   And you end up with a lot of the properties of, you know, engineered material where it's
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:39.320]   only dimensionally stable, it can produce, be produced very, very accurately.
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:43.840]   It's actually funny is that a lot of times the CLT is the most accurate part of the building.
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:49.560]   And so if you're building a building with it, you tend to run into problems where the
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.720]   rest of the building is not accurate enough for it.
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.040]   So even something like steel, right?
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:57.360]   If you're building like a steel building, the steel is not going to be quite, it's not
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.360]   going to be like dead on.
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:03.000]   There's going to be like an inch or so off in just terms of where any given component
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   is.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.200]   And so the CLT, which is built much more accurately, actually tends to like show all these, where
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:10.800]   these errors are that have to be corrected.
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:15.200]   So in some sense, accuracy is like a, is a little bit of a, or precision is, is a little
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:21.160]   bit of like a, of a tricky thing because you can't just make one part of the process more
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:22.160]   precise.
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:25.840]   All that does is, you know, in some ways that actually makes things more difficult because
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:30.400]   then it forced instead of, if one part is really precise, that a lot of times means
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:33.840]   that you can't make adjustments to it easily.
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:38.200]   And so if you have this one really precise thing, it usually means you have to go make,
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:42.200]   you know, make compensation for something else that is not built quite as precise.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:47.760]   So it actually makes construction quite, you know, of advancing like precision quite a
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:48.760]   bit more complicated.
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:55.400]   AR/VR I think is, I'm very bullish on that, assuming, you know, with the big caveat of
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:50:00.400]   that assuming they can sort of just get the basic technology working.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:07.200]   The basic intuition there is that, you know, right now the way that pieces are, a building
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:11.320]   is put together on site is that somebody is looking at a set of plans, paper plans, or
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:15.120]   like an iPad or something that tells them where everything needs to go.
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:18.560]   And then so they, they, they figure that out and they take a tape measure or something
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:24.840]   like that, or like, you know, some other, some other method and go figure out where
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:29.280]   that is marked on the ground and then try to sort of get it all put in there for site.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:34.360]   So there's all this like setup time that takes and, and manual location that is really quite
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:39.800]   time consuming and error prone, again, there's only so accurate that a guy dragging a tape
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:45.000]   40 feet across site being held by another guy, there's only so accurate that that process
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.680]   can be right.
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:52.160]   And so, yeah, you can, it's, it's very easy for me to imagine just AR stuff like that
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:58.160]   just projects exactly where the components of your building need to go.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:03.520]   That would just, A, allow you a much higher level of accuracy that you can easily get
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:04.520]   using manual methods.
[00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:09.080]   And then B, just reduce all that time it takes to like manually measure things.
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:11.720]   So I can imagine it'd be like much, much, much faster as well.
[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:16.720]   So I'm quite bullish on that at a high level and a slightly lower level.
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:22.640]   I'm not, it's not obvious to me if they actually, they'll be able to sort of get that level
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:27.240]   or just like projects it with perfect accuracy right in front of you.
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:32.840]   It may be the case that like a person moving their head around and constantly changing
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:36.680]   and changing their point of view, you're never going to be like, locate these, never going
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:39.680]   to like project these things with like millimeter precision or whatever.
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:43.080]   It's always going to be like a little bit choppy or it's, you're going to end up with
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:48.360]   some sort of hard limit in terms of like how precise you can project it.
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.360]   I wouldn't bet on that.
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:54.200]   I just, my sense is that locator technology will get good enough, but I don't have any
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:55.200]   principles.
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:56.840]   I don't have any principle reason believing that.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:01.520]   And then, and then the other thing is that being able to sort of take advantage of that
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:08.600]   technology would, would require you to have like a really, really accurate model of your
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:13.520]   building that like locates where every single element is precisely and exactly what its
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:14.780]   tolerances are.
[00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:18.200]   Right now, buildings aren't designed like that.
[00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:25.520]   They are built using a sort of comparatively sparse set of drawings that leaves a lot to
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:32.520]   sort of be interpreted by the people on site doing the work and efforts that have tried
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:38.680]   to make these models like a really, really, really precise, a lot of times have not really
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:39.680]   paid off.
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:42.840]   You can get, you can get returns on it if you're building something like really, really
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:47.320]   complex, where there's a lot of, where there's a much higher premium to being able to make
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:52.280]   sure you don't make any errors or whatever, but for like a simple building, like a house,
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:55.560]   the, the, the returns to it just, just aren't there.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:59.080]   And so you see really comparatively sparse drawings.
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:03.880]   And so, you know, whether the, whether it's going to be able to work worth this upfront
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:11.120]   cost of developing this like a really, really complex, very precise model where exactly
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:14.720]   every component is, is kind of to be determined.
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:18.440]   There's some interesting companies that are like trying to, I think, move in this direction
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:23.200]   where they're basically making it a lot easier to like draw these things really, really precisely
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:29.040]   that would just be, you know, have every single component of exactly where it is.
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:32.880]   So I'm optimistic about that as well, but it's a little bit TBD.
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:33.880]   Okay.
[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:37.180]   This raises a question that I actually wanted to ask you, which is in your post about why
[00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:42.280]   there aren't automatic brick layers, it was really interesting post and somebody left
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:48.320]   in an interesting comment, which was that bricks were designed to be handled and assembled
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:50.040]   by humans.
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:53.160]   And and then I think you, let me just pull this up.
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:55.800]   You, you left a response to that, which I thought was really interesting.
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:54:01.480]   You said the example I always reach for is with steam power and electricity, where replacing
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:05.640]   a steam engine with an electric motor in your factory didn't do much for productivity, improving
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:12.040]   factory output required totally redesigning the factory around the capabilities of electric
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:13.040]   motors.
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:17.000]   And so I was kind of curious if you apply that analogy to construction, then what does
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.440]   that look like for construction?
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:23.160]   Like what, what is a, a, what is a house building process or building building process that
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:27.880]   it takes like automation and these other kinds of tools into account?
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:31.760]   How would that change how buildings are built and like how they end up looking in the end?
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:33.240]   I think that's a good question.
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:37.920]   And yeah, I think that's one big part of, you know, one big component of like the lack
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:42.600]   of construction productivity is everything is designed and has evolved over a hundred
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:49.760]   years, 200 years or whatever, to be easy for a guy or, you know, person on the site to
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:52.200]   manipulate by hand.
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:56.960]   So like bricks are roughly the size and shape and weight that a person can move it easily
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:57.960]   around.
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:59.720]   Dimensional lumber is the same.
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:03.520]   It's the size and shape and weight that a person can, can, can move around easily.
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:08.320]   Kind of all construction materials are like this and the way that they attach together
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:09.320]   and stuff is the same.
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:15.680]   It's all designed so that a person on site can sort of put it all together with as comparatively
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:17.440]   little effort as possible.
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:23.560]   And then, but yeah, what is, what is easy for a person to do is usually not what is
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:27.200]   easy for a machine or a robot to do, right.
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:34.400]   You typically need to sort of redesign what, you know, think about what your end goal is
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:40.440]   and then redesign the mechanism for accomplishing that in terms of like what is easy for it
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:42.560]   to get to make a machine to, to do.
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:48.480]   I mean, the obvious example here is like, it's way easier to build a like wagon or a
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:54.680]   cart that like pulls than it is to build like a mechanical set of legs that mimics a human's
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:55.680]   movement.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:56.680]   Right.
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:57.680]   So it's way, way, way easier.
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:02.680]   So yeah, I do think a big part of advancing construction productivity is to basically
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:08.560]   figure out how to redesign these building elements in a way that is really easy for
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:12.840]   a machine to produce and a machine to put together.
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:17.640]   And, and, and one, I think reason that we haven't, yeah, haven't seen it is that a lot
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:23.440]   of, a lot of the mechanization that you see is people trying to mechanize exactly what
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.440]   a person does.
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:27.880]   So if a person moves like these two high floors, you know, in the place, they're trying to
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:31.360]   make a machine that will move them before and then nail them together.
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:35.000]   And to do that, it's like a really, really expensive, you need a lot of like really expensive
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:40.160]   industrial robots that can move exactly the way that a human moves more or less.
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:41.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:45.360]   And so I think, yeah, a lot of like what, what that kind of might look like is basically
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:51.040]   something that can be like really easily extruded by machine in something like a continuous
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:56.600]   process that wouldn't require a lot of like finicky mechanical movements.
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:57:00.560]   And yes, I feel like a good example of like, I think this technology is technology that's
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:05.560]   called like insulated metal panels, which is perhaps one of the cheapest and easiest
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:08.400]   ways to build an exterior wall.
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:13.800]   And what it is, it's just like a, it's just like a thin layer of steel.
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:19.520]   And then on top of that is a layer of insulation, and then on top of that is another layer of
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:20.520]   steel.
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:23.640]   And then at the end, there's sort of the steel it's like extruded in such a way that it can
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:26.760]   like these inner panels can like lock together as they go.
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:32.720]   And it's basically the simplest possible method of constructing a wall that you can imagine
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:34.280]   almost.
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:38.120]   But then that has like the structural system and the water barrier and the air barrier
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:42.720]   and the insulation all just in this like one really simple assembly.
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:47.520]   And then when you go, when you put it together on site, it just locks together.
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:50.680]   And of course, it doesn't, you know, there are a lot of limitations to this, like you
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:54.320]   want to do anything that's complicated, like add windows or something like that, all of
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:57.000]   a sudden, it starts to look quite a bit less good.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:02.280]   But yeah, I think things like that, that I think are like really easy for a machine to
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:07.320]   do can be put together with like, a lot of like really, you know, don't need a lot of
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:10.720]   like precision measurement or stuff like that in the field, they can just kind of like snap
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.400]   together and actually want to put together.
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:15.400]   I think that's kind of what it looks like.
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:19.640]   And then what would the houses or the buildings that are built, like using this, what would
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:20.640]   they physically look like?
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:24.560]   I mean, maybe in like 50 to 100 years, we'll look back on the houses we have today and
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:28.760]   we'll be like, "Oh, look at that artisanal creation made by humans."
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:33.880]   But then what is a machine that is like designed for robots first or for automation first?
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:37.000]   Like in what interesting ways would it differ from today's buildings?
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.880]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:44.440]   I'm not especially bullish on like 3D building printing in general, but this is another example
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:48.440]   of like a building, you know, building a building, you know, a building using like an extrusion
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:52.160]   process that is relatively easy to mechanize, right?
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:56.880]   And sort of what's interesting there is that when you start doing that, a lot of these
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:59:01.160]   other like bottlenecks become unlocked a little bit.
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:07.240]   Like it's very difficult to build a building using like a lot of like curved exterior surfaces,
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:08.680]   like for using conventional methods, right?
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:11.480]   Like you can do it, but it's quite expensive to do.
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:16.200]   But it's, there's relatively straightforward for like a 3D printed building for that to
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:17.200]   do, right?
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:20.520]   Like it's, they can build that just as easily like it's a straight wall.
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:25.240]   And so you see a lot of interesting curved architecture on these things.
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:27.440]   And you're kind of seeing that in a few other areas.
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:32.640]   There's companies, a company that can like build like this cool undulating facade or
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:38.720]   whatever that people kind of like, and yeah, so it kind of unlocks a lot of options.
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:43.240]   So kind of machines, you know, they have, they're more constrained in some things that
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:48.000]   they can do, but they don't have a lot of the other constraints that you would otherwise
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   see.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   So I think you'll kind of see a larger variety of sort of aesthetic things like that.
[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.720]   That said, at the end of the day, I think a lot of the ways that like a house goes together
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:07.400]   or whatever is pretty well shaped to just the way that, you know, a person living inside
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:08.960]   it would like to use.
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:13.160]   I think Stuart Brand makes this point in, oh, how building is learned.
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:14.160]   There we go.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:18.920]   But he basically makes the point that a lot of people try to use, you know, like dome
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:24.760]   shaped houses or octagon shaped houses, which are good because again, going back to surface
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:29.200]   area volume, they enclose the space using the least amount of material possible.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:34.200]   So like in some theoretical sense are quite efficient, but it's actually quite inconvenient
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:37.200]   to live inside a building with like really curved wall, right?
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:41.360]   Like furniture doesn't fit up against it nicely and stuff like that.
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:45.640]   Like pictures are hard to hang on a really curved wall.
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:50.680]   And so I think you would see less variation than maybe you might expect.
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.680]   Interesting.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:55.080]   And why are you pessimistic about 3D printers or for construction, I mean?
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.080]   Yeah, for construction.
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:01.880]   I've got so many reasons, not pessimistic, but just there's a lot of other answer questions.
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:09.660]   I mean, so the big obvious one is like right now a 3D printer can basically print the walls
[01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:10.660]   of a building.
[01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:15.400]   That is a pretty small amount of like the value in a building, right?
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:19.520]   It's maybe the 8%, 7 or 8%, something like that.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:24.080]   Probably not more than 10% of like the value in a building, because you're not printing
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:29.360]   the foundation, you're not printing like the overhead vertical, you know, overhead spanning
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:30.640]   structure of the building.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:35.120]   You're basically just printing the walls and you're not even really printing the second
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.160]   story walls that you have in multiple stories.
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:40.240]   I don't think they've quite figured that out yet.
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:44.040]   So it's a pretty small amount of value add to the building.
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:49.360]   And it's like, it's frankly a task that is relatively easy to do by like manual labor,
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:50.360]   right?
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:57.560]   It's really pretty easy for a crew to basically put up the structure of a house.
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:02.560]   It's kind of a recurring theme in like mechanization, or it goes back to what I was talking about
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:07.160]   previously, where it takes like a lot of mechanization and a lot of expensive equipment to replace
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:12.740]   what basically like two or three guys can do in, you know, a day or something like that.
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:15.160]   It's the economics of it are pretty brutal.
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:18.560]   But anyway, so right now it produces a pretty small value of that.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:27.600]   So I think that the value of 3d printing is basically entirely predicated on how successful
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:33.240]   they are at figuring out how to like deliver more components of the building using their
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.240]   system.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.240]   And there's companies that are trying to do this.
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:39.400]   There's there's one that got funded not too long ago called black diamond, where they
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:43.960]   have they have this crazy system, which is like a series of 3d printers that would act
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:47.400]   simultaneously like each one building a separate house.
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:53.160]   And then as you progress, you like switch out the printhead for like a robot arm, because
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:57.520]   3d printer is basically like a robot arm with just a particular manipulator at the end,
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:58.520]   right?
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:01.840]   And so they switch out their printhead for like a robot arm and the robot arm goes and
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:06.880]   installs like different other systems like the windows or the mechanical systems or something
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:07.880]   like that.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:12.080]   So you can figure out how to do that reliably where your printhead or your printing system
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:19.600]   is like installing a large fraction of the value of the building it it's not it's not
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:23.800]   clear to me that it's going to be economic or right but that's that's it obviously needs
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.320]   to reach that point.
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:29.680]   And it's not obvious to me that they have like that they have gotten there yet it's
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:34.600]   really quite hard to sort of get a robot to do a lot of these these tasks will kind of
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.880]   kind of depend on how successful they are at doing that.
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:42.080]   A lot of for a lot of these players, it seems like they're actually moving away from that.
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:49.280]   Like I think in that recent icon is the biggest construction 3d printer company in the US
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.880]   as far as I know.
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:57.360]   And as far as I know, they've moved away from like, trying to like, install lots of systems
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:02.960]   in their walls as they get printed, and they've kind of moved on to like having that installed
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:06.560]   separately, which I think has made it their job a little bit easier.
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:11.920]   But it's again, not quite, it's hard to see how the 3d printer can fulfill fulfill its
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:17.040]   promises if it can't do anything just beyond the vertical elements, which again, are really
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:20.600]   the most construction are really quite cheap and simple to build.
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:24.520]   Now, if we take a step back and talk about like, overall, how expensive construction
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:30.960]   is, how much of it can just be explained by the bama cost effect, that like labor costs
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:35.400]   are increasing because labor is more productive in other industries, and therefore, construction
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:36.680]   is getting more expensive.
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:40.120]   Yeah, I mean, I think that's like a huge, huge chunk of it.
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:46.000]   Yeah, labor has not, you know, the labor fraction of it has, has, I think, not changed appreciably
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   enough.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.280]   I'm going to asterisk that because I haven't actually verified that and I need to and I'm
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:55.080]   remembering somebody that said, actually, they used to be much different.
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:57.160]   You sent me some literature related to it.
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:01.720]   So slight asterisk on that, but in general, yeah, the labor cost is just has remained
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:08.560]   just a huge fraction of the overall cost of the building, things that were like labor
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:14.200]   is a huge cost of it, right, and like reliably seeing their costs continue to rise.
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:18.360]   I think there's, there's no reason to believe that that's not a big part of it.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:22.920]   Now, I know this sounds like a question with an obvious answer, but in your post comparing
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:28.320]   the prices of construction in different countries, you do talk mentioned how the the cost of
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:33.560]   labor and the cost of materials is not as big a determiner of like how expensive it
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:35.160]   is to construct in different places.
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:40.560]   But what does matter is the, like the amount of government involvement and administrative
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:41.560]   overhead.
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:45.640]   I'm curious why those things like government involvement and administrative overhead have
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:49.320]   such a high consequence on the cost of construction.
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.880]   Yeah, that's a, that's a good question.
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:58.400]   I don't actually know if I have a unified theory of that, I mean, just basically with
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:02.360]   any regulation thing, it's just, you know, any heavily regulated thing, it's just any
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:09.720]   particular task that you're doing takes longer and is less reliable than it would be if it
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:10.720]   was not done, right?
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:13.480]   You can't just do it as fast as on your own schedule, right?
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:19.240]   It's, you end up being bottlenecked by government processes, processes, it reduces kind of,
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:21.800]   it narrows your, your options.
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:27.320]   So yeah, in general, I would expect that to, to kind of be the case, but I actually don't
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:34.120]   know if I have like a unified theory of how that works beyond just, it's a bunch of additional
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:40.160]   steps at any given part of the process, each of which kind of adds cost.
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:41.160]   Yeah.
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:45.960]   Now, one interesting trend we have in the United States with construction is that a
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:50.960]   lot of it is done by Latino workers, and especially by undocumented Latino workers.
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:54.440]   What is the effect of this on the price and the quality of construction?
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:59.160]   So if we have like a bunch of hardworking undocumented workers who are working for below
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:04.080]   market rates in the US, will this have like dampened the cost of construction over time
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:06.040]   or what do you think is going to happen?
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:14.800]   So I suspect that's probably one of the reasons why the US has comparatively low construction
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:16.760]   costs compared to other parts of the world.
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:21.240]   Like, well, well, I'll call it that for like residential construction, right.
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:24.960]   Which is single family homes and multifamily apartment buildings.
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:29.520]   Those are all built in the US that have like light framed wood and put together, like you
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:32.040]   said, by a lot of like immigrant workers.
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:39.360]   And then, yeah, because of that, it's, I, it would not surprise me if like those wages
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:44.880]   are a lot lower than, you know, the equivalent wage for like a carpenter in Germany or something
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:50.080]   like that, and that results in our, our, the cost of our residential construction, which
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:55.840]   is very, very low by, by world standards, I suspect that is, that is a big, that's a
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:00.960]   factor in why our costs of residential construction are quite low.
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:06.400]   Now, like overall, it seems from your blog posts that you're kind of pessimistic or you
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:11.560]   don't think that like different improvements in industrialization have like transferred
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:12.680]   over to construction yet.
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:17.720]   What do you think is the prospect of like future advances in AI having a big impact
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:18.720]   on construction?
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:23.320]   So like, oh, you know, with computer vision and with like advances in robotics, do you
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:29.360]   think we'll finally see some carryover into construction productivity or, or is it going
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:30.360]   to be more of the same?
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:31.360]   Yeah, it would.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:36.160]   I think there's definitely going to be progress on that axis.
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:37.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:42.520]   If you, if you can wire up your computer vision systems to like your, your robotic systems
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:47.640]   and your AI in such a way that like your, your capabilities for a, for a, a robot system
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:50.760]   are, are, are, are, are more expanded.
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:51.760]   Yeah.
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:55.680]   I kind of foresee being, you know, robotics being able to take like a larger and larger
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:00.400]   fraction of, of the tasks done on a typical construction site.
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:07.080]   I kind of see it being kind of done in, in, in like narrow avenues that gradually expands
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:08.080]   upward.
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:12.640]   Like you're starting to see a lot of companies that they have some robotic system that can
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:17.440]   do like one particular task, but it can actually do that task quite well.
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:21.080]   There's, there's a couple of company, different robot companies that, that have these little
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:25.240]   robots for like drawing wall layouts on like concrete slabs or whatever.
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:29.600]   So you know exactly where to like build your walls, which is, you would think it would
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:33.340]   not be like a difficult problem in construction, but it turns out that a lot of times people
[01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:39.440]   put the walls in the wrong spot and then you have to go back and move them later or just
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:41.120]   basically deal with it.
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:44.680]   And so, yeah, they have, it's basically a little Roomba type device that just draws
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:49.400]   the, the the wall layout onto the concrete slab and all the other systems as well.
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:53.080]   Like where the lines need to run through the slab and things like that.
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:59.740]   So yeah, I kind of suspect that you're just going to start to see robotics and systems
[01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:07.040]   like that just take a larger and larger share of the tasks on the construction site over
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.040]   time.
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:11.600]   What do you think of Flow?
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:16.800]   That's Adam Neumann's newest startup that is backed with $350 million from Anderson
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:17.800]   Horowitz.
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:25.080]   I do not have any strong opinions about that other than, wow, they're really giving him
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:26.080]   another $30,000.
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:27.080]   Right?
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:28.080]   Yeah.
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:31.600]   I do not have any particular strong opinions about that.
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:34.040]   I will say that, was it A16Z?
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:35.040]   Yeah.
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:39.880]   They made a lot, they make a lot of investments that like don't make sense to me, but I'm
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:40.880]   not a venture capitalist.
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:45.080]   So there's no reason to, you know, there's no reason that my judgment would be any good
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:46.280]   in this situation.
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:50.520]   So I'm just presuming they know something I do not.
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:51.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:56.000]   I'm going to be interviewing Andreessen later this month and I'm hoping I can ask him about
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   that.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000]   I would love to hear about that thing.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.200]   I mean, it's, you know, it's just, it may be just like, it may be as simple as like,
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:05.160]   you know, VC is all about like really high variance bets.
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:08.360]   There's nobody higher variance than Andreessen.
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:09.360]   Yeah.
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:10.360]   Yeah.
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:11.360]   Yeah.
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:12.360]   So Adam Neumann.
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:13.360]   Yeah.
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:16.320]   Maybe just on those terms, it makes sense.
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:20.880]   You had an interesting post about like how a bunch of, a lot of the knowledge in the
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:27.480]   construction industry is like informal and contained within, contained within like best
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:33.640]   practices or between, between relationships and like expectations that are not articulated
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:34.640]   all the time.
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:40.840]   It seems to me that this is also true of software in many cases, but software seems much more
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:46.760]   legible and open source, if that makes sense, then like these other sort of like physical
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:53.160]   disciplines like construction, despite again, having a lot of the knowledge contained within,
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:57.120]   you know, people's minds and within like the culture rather than like explicitly codified
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:58.120]   somewhere.
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:05.160]   So like, why, why, why do you think that construction is, seems more closed source than software?
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:06.160]   It's interesting.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:12.640]   I mean, to, to go back slightly to our, you know, products versus projects industry, right?
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:18.040]   A slightly different way of thinking about that is it just like craft based industries
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:23.520]   versus like, again, like an industrial process where a craft based industry, basically you
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:25.720]   have, and this isn't like a dichotomy, right?
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:30.640]   This is a spectrum, but in general, like craft based stuff, there's like an expertise and
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:36.120]   judgment aspect of it that is sort of pretty well embedded in the process that you can't
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:41.440]   really well remove it, you know, any sort of decision at any given point requires an
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:47.160]   expert or an artisan or somebody who understands like the relevant context and knows how to
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:52.800]   proceed based on the specific variables in this specific situation where like industrial
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:58.280]   process is more like, this has been sort of figured out and this is how it works every
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:12:59.280]   single time.
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:05.920]   And just construction is just very, very much on the craft end of the production spectrum
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:09.600]   where a lot, you know, the decision of like how to put these things together and how to
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:14.960]   wire, you know, this building or whatever, it's all left up to this sort of the expertise
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:18.600]   and the sort of judgments of the people doing sort of the installation.
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:22.880]   And what that gets you is that again, you can, it lets you put things together without
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:27.960]   having to do a very large amount of specifying exactly what you need, right?
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:33.680]   Like the drawings specify how it's going together, even something quite complicated are way fewer
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:39.880]   than the drawings needed to produce a Toyota Corolla, I'm sure, for instance, you know,
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:46.360]   so and the cost required, like, you know, to do it, like the design cost required to
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:54.720]   do it is in terms, in proportion to how expensive the thing is, is also much lower as well.
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:14:00.720]   Software is perhaps, and again, I'm not an expert on software development, but it's somewhat
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:07.240]   more legible by response in that the end product is like, it's, you know, it's very clear,
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:13.320]   you can clearly see every single part of it and how every single part of it touches every
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:14.320]   single other part.
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:17.480]   Perhaps I'm overstating that, you know, I'm sure a software could say, well, it's actually
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:21.280]   really not super obvious how these things work and why they're done this way or, or
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:22.280]   whatever.
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:30.280]   But you can see, you can clearly inspect every single part of it and see exactly how it does,
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:33.480]   you know, what it does and how it connects to the other part of it.
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:38.040]   You can't really, I mean, you can't really do that with a building.
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:43.600]   I guess I would also maybe say that there's, this is maybe an interesting question.
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:48.160]   With a building, it's not necessarily obvious how it got to the point that it did when it
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.160]   was put together.
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:54.200]   And a lot of times with like physical things, it ends up, even if you have the object, it
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:58.280]   is unclear how, what the process was to create it.
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:02.480]   And so a lot of times what you see is that even with like, this comes up with like industrial
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.480]   espionage, right?
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:06.800]   Or somebody who's trying to like steal some particular thing or whatever.
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:11.120]   A lot of times that doesn't help them as much as they would think to try to like recreate
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:12.120]   it.
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:15.320]   A lot of times they have to basically go through the entire process of figuring out how to
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:16.320]   make it.
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:21.120]   And it takes them just as long to do it as it did the original people doing the development.
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:26.360]   You saw this with like the atomic bomb, for instance, where like the people who like stole
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:31.160]   the, stole the plans for how to make it, or who had information on like exactly how their
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:36.640]   system, if the bomb worked or whatever, basically took as long to figure out how to make it
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:38.160]   as the U.S. did.
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:46.280]   So just a physical object, just the process used to make it is not necessarily just super,
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:47.280]   super legible.
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:48.280]   It tends to be a little bit hidden.
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:54.160]   I, and I was going to say that I, for perhaps that is not as true for, for software, but
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:56.200]   I actually realized, I don't actually know.
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:16:01.440]   And it's, it's very plausible to me that you could have some piece of software that was
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:02.440]   written.
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:05.520]   I guess I would maybe ask you this question, is it possible that you could have some piece
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:11.440]   of software that was written and then just it be utterly inscrutable as to how it came
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:16.600]   together and how you could like, you know, duplicate a similar, you know, a similar piece
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:17.600]   of software.
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:18.600]   Or is that like a category error?
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:19.600]   Yeah.
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:20.600]   That's a really interesting question.
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:24.080]   I mean, there are a lot of examples where if you don't like have the context on how,
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:27.500]   well, like why that was built a certain way, you wouldn't understand like what's going
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:28.500]   on.
[01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:35.840]   Like if you've heard of like fast inverse square root, that's the, yeah, for the, for
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:38.360]   people who are interested, there's like a great YouTube video on this that like goes
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.360]   through it.
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:42.080]   But basically just like a whole bunch of like, I mean, the guy who created John Carmack is
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:44.720]   like a super genius.
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:48.080]   And like, but if you just look at the algorithm, it's a few lines, but you would never understand
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:52.800]   like why this gives you an inverse square root unless you, um, so that kind of stuff
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:55.160]   where it's like, if you just saw the code, it's like, well, you, you, you would need
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:58.920]   to go through the mind of John Carmack when he's like, goes through like Newton's method
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:16:59.920]   and all these other things.
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:04.920]   And like why this particular float operation, um, anyways, but I guess the advantage software
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:08.960]   has is the ability to fork.
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:12.800]   And so you can, you can't like just take a building and then just make an exact replica
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:16.520]   of it and then just change the part you want to better understand to see what the effect
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:17.520]   is.
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:20.840]   Whereas with like, um, a software project, you can just fork it or you can just make
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:22.880]   an API call or something.
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:28.120]   And then, um, like try to, um, I guess this goes back to the modularity thing you were
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:29.120]   explaining, right?
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:35.000]   Like try to understand like the specific, uh, subcomponent, um, it's easier with software.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000]   Yeah.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   That's, that's interesting.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:43.280]   You can like, you can run experiments on your piece of software to like understand how it
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:48.960]   works a lot more easily at lower costs than you can with any physical object.
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:49.960]   Right.
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:54.160]   But especially like a giant building, right where, um, yeah, who knows?
[01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:55.160]   Right.
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:56.160]   Yeah.
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:57.160]   Okay.
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:00.560]   So let's say some, uh, mega corporation, the CEO of some mega corporation is like, uh,
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:04.400]   Brian, we want to build some really interesting skyscraper building.
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:09.160]   And you know, I've talked to the mayor and the governor and they're willing to get rid
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:10.160]   of all the building codes.
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:11.160]   So there's no building codes.
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.160]   There's no regulation.
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:16.560]   Um, you, we just want you to build, that's like a really cool skyscraper.
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:20.720]   What is it that you would do that would be like some idea you have for like some, I dunno,
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:25.040]   some innovation or some change that would like, what would you do if you were given
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:27.520]   this latitude to just build like a really cool building?
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:28.520]   Oh, interesting.
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:29.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:35.960]   I would like to see, uh, us fulfill the dream of like the early to mid 20th century and
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:37.960]   build a mile high skyscraper.
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:42.200]   Like this was the, this, you know, this was, this was the, when everybody was, was, you
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:47.240]   know, not everybody, but this was what people saw the development of skyscrapers going in
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:51.040]   sort of the thirties and forties and perhaps fifties.
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:56.000]   Frank Lloyd Wright designed this, uh, this, uh, mile high skyscraper called the Illinois,
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:01.540]   presumably back when this was in Chicago was like, you know, a bunch of a, a Metro of rising
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:02.540]   importance.
[01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:03.540]   Yeah.
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:06.520]   And there's, you know, the technology for it, uh, exists.
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:12.600]   I, I, I'm aware of other sort of like designed conceptual buildings this fall and you haven't
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.080]   really seen anyone do it.
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:19.800]   Even these people who are willing to clearly build these, uh, giants, you know, by white
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:20.800]   elephant projects.
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:25.720]   Basically nobody's, uh, tried to go the distance and build like the mile high skyscraper.
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:28.280]   I would like to see us do it.
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:29.280]   Interesting.
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:34.760]   Um, but I mean, I, I, you have a really interesting, uh, uh, essay in works in progress about like
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:35.760]   skyscraper height.
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:38.920]   And then, you know, one of the things you talked about is like, uh, how it's like the
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:44.140]   super linear increase in like lateral forces and other kinds of, um, uh, other kinds of
[01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:45.800]   impediments to building tall.
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:47.440]   How would you get over that kind of stuff?
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:51.960]   I mean, you would not, you, yeah, you basically by throwing a giant amount of money at the
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:52.960]   problem basically.
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:53.960]   I mean, yeah.
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:58.600]   So yeah, the basic gist of that is like the physical constraints do not allow you to build
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:01.240]   front, you know, a mile in height.
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:06.760]   It's sort of the economic and legal constraints, uh, that, uh, that sort of stopped this extreme
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:07.760]   construction.
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:12.560]   And yeah, even the, the, the economic constraints are significant enough that even in places
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:16.240]   where there's not legal constraints like China or Dubai or something like that, they still
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:20.280]   do not build this site because the economics of it are just so brutal.
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:26.160]   But, um, yeah, in, in this fantasy scenario, uh, yeah, a giant stack of money would get,
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:28.280]   uh, would get devoted to doing this.
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:32.240]   A stack of money, a mile high.
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:38.520]   Um, uh, so, uh, speaking of which in that post, you, um, you brought up that, uh, argument,
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:43.520]   uh, like that paper from, um, the economist, uh, Glazer that like says that we were leaving
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:47.520]   billions of dollars basically on the table by having this, uh, you know, building height
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:50.080]   codes because we're just giving up all this vertical space.
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:55.340]   I'm curious, uh, why you think it's the case that these developers don't have any sort
[01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:59.120]   of lobbying or political influence to be able to like collect the billions of dollars of
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:02.160]   deadweight loss that are created by these codes?
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:05.600]   Like why aren't they able to like organize politically in a way that like gets rid of
[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:08.040]   these regulations that are helping no one?
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:10.840]   Yeah, that's a really interesting question.
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:16.080]   In general, the strongest, uh, construction lobbying group I'm aware of is probably the
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:21.040]   National Association of Home Builders, which exerts quite a bit of influence to try to
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:26.560]   keep, um, the cost of building single family homes, uh, low.
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:32.780]   I'm not aware of any, anything, um, that, uh, that exists for, you know, large commercial
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:33.780]   buildings or something like that.
[01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:39.120]   Maybe association of general contractors or something, I guess my, my initial guess would
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:44.700]   be something to the effect of, you know, the, the, the natural constituencies for like opposing
[01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:49.360]   a big project like this are always going to be quite a bit grit, you know, at least as
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:55.420]   big, if not bigger than sort of the constituencies that would able would be able to, um, act for
[01:21:55.420 --> 01:21:56.420]   it.
[01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:57.420]   Right.
[01:21:57.420 --> 01:22:00.580]   So like any big giant construction project, even if it had like a lot of developers mobilized
[01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:06.820]   to try to support that quite a thing kind of thing also, um, also, uh, would have a,
[01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:11.420]   have a large constituency that would exist to, um, oppose basically, basically anyone
[01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:17.740]   who, uh, uh, lives in the area and these, you know, uh, who doesn't want this giant
[01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:21.700]   shadow of a building or is worried about the congestion that it would cause or, or whatever
[01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:22.700]   like that.
[01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:29.700]   And I guess a sort of paradox with this situation is that the places that need it the most because
[01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:35.180]   their rents are so high, the people that are living there already are going to be financially
[01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:36.700]   well-equipped to oppose it.
[01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:37.700]   Right.
[01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:40.780]   Like, and the, and a certain sense they're losing the most out of it.
[01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:41.780]   Right.
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:47.460]   Um, like if you, if you're making $50,000 a year, you might value the view out of your
[01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:53.020]   apartment and like $500, but if you're making $5 million a year, you might value that view,
[01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:57.900]   you know, proportionately more and be willing to expend a lot more to prevent it from, from
[01:22:57.900 --> 01:22:58.900]   being obstructed.
[01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:04.540]   So I feel like this sort of mechanism by where places get wealthier and need more housing
[01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:09.460]   kind of also creates its own opposition to some extent.
[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:12.880]   Which is why I think like a costume solution to this kind of thing would be optimal where
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:17.420]   it's like, if the view is worth more to you than like a apartment is worth to somebody
[01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:21.180]   else, then you can just pay them to like not build there.
[01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:25.100]   The view is not worth more than like a, an apartment is probably worth to somebody.
[01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:26.100]   Right.
[01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:31.020]   So, uh, you're just like an inoptimal allocation of resources, um, just based on who has political
[01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:32.020]   influence.
[01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:33.020]   Yeah.
[01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:34.020]   And, and it, yeah, it's an interesting question.
[01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:35.020]   I don't actually, I don't, I'm not super confident of that answer.
[01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:36.020]   I should look into it.
[01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:37.020]   I should look into it.
[01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:38.020]   Why don't developers have better lobbying efforts?
[01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:39.020]   It does seem like an unanswered question.
[01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:54.280]   Now, speaking of, um, being able to put projects into a tailspin and admosclerosis, you just
[01:23:54.280 --> 01:24:00.260]   recently published a very interesting and thorough, um, examination of how NEPA works.
[01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:03.420]   Do you want to explain what this law is and what its consequences are?
[01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:05.620]   And then I could ask you some more specific questions about it.
[01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:06.620]   Yeah, for sure.
[01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:10.080]   So NEPA is the, is the National Environmental Policy Act.
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:18.160]   Um, this is the law that basically requires, um, any major federal government action that
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:24.420]   might have, um, significant environmental impacts to do a very long and thorough and
[01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:30.220]   expensive environmental impact study before anything is, is done on a project, right?
[01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:37.100]   Um, it's gets, the law gets a large amount of attention because of how long these environmental
[01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:38.900]   impacts take for things to prepare.
[01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:42.060]   The average time currently is something like four and a half years.
[01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:46.700]   And in some cases, you know, since the average half of them are longer than that, um, the
[01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:50.500]   highway administration, for instance, they have something like eight and a half years
[01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:55.980]   to do an environmental impact statement, and that's before they can build a highway or
[01:24:55.980 --> 01:24:56.980]   something like that.
[01:24:56.980 --> 01:25:02.900]   So people are perpetually trying to figure out a way to reform this law, basically such
[01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:07.860]   that we would not have to wait years and years and years before building big important infrastructure
[01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:08.860]   projects.
[01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:09.860]   Um, basically.
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:14.260]   So that's the, that's the gist of, of, of what NEPA is and how it works.
[01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:15.260]   Yeah.
[01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:18.740]   You had a really interesting point in the article where you said that by adding this
[01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:23.100]   cost, you can basically think of it as like a tax on all major government action.
[01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:26.820]   And the effect of a tax is to reduce what you're taxing.
[01:25:26.820 --> 01:25:29.900]   And then, um, I thought at the end you had a really interesting argument to how like,
[01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:36.140]   uh, NEPA is an anti-law, um, uh, can you, can you explain this argument for podcast
[01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:37.140]   listeners?
[01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:38.140]   Yeah.
[01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:41.740]   Um, yeah, it's my spicy take at the end that I always have to throw in right at the end.
[01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:48.940]   Um, but so yeah, kind of the, the basic argument is that the purpose of a, uh, a law is roughly
[01:25:48.940 --> 01:25:54.540]   twofold as A is to encourage something that you would want more of or discourage something
[01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:56.140]   that you would, you would want less of.
[01:25:56.140 --> 01:26:00.060]   So, you know, we have laws against drug driving because we think drug driving is harmful and
[01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:02.980]   we want less drug driving in our society.
[01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:09.340]   And then the second purpose of a law is to basically reduce coordination problems and
[01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:13.260]   enable exchanges that might not otherwise be able to take place.
[01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:19.140]   That's, you know, um, the obvious example of this is the government enforces which side
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:22.540]   of the road you're allowed to drive on, not because one side is inherently better than
[01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:27.100]   the other, but because it's good if everybody agrees which side of the road to, to drive
[01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:28.100]   on.
[01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:33.620]   Um, contract law is, is in some ways like this, like it's good if, um, you know, people
[01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:37.780]   will be punished for breaking contracts because that allows people to go enter into them,
[01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:41.380]   which allows exchanges that might not otherwise, um, take place.
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:45.820]   Uh, there's a, I forget, I forget exactly what the example of this, but there's, there's
[01:26:45.820 --> 01:26:50.300]   an, there's a argument that's made like the, uh, the ability of the English government
[01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:57.300]   in like the 1600s, 1700s, like basically, um, have to pay back its debts was a really
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:27:02.340]   important development because it allowed it to, uh, raise money that it otherwise wouldn't
[01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:06.060]   be able to, because people could trust that they would be able to, to, uh, to get paid
[01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:07.060]   back.
[01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:11.700]   But anyway, so those are the two rough purposes of a law and NEPA does not do either of those
[01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:12.700]   things.
[01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:18.700]   Um, in the first it, because NEPA is basically a procedural statement or a requirement, it
[01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:26.140]   does not require the government to like weigh environmental concerns, especially heavily.
[01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:31.700]   Like it doesn't prevent a big oil and gas drilling project from taking place.
[01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:36.100]   Um, essentially it, uh, what it does require is that for any major environmental effects,
[01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:39.140]   you just have to document them very thoroughly.
[01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:45.340]   And so all it is, it's a documentation requirement and notifying and, and notifying the public
[01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:47.380]   of, of, of, of what you're doing.
[01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:53.420]   But, but it's, um, it doesn't prevent a major environmental, like negative effect, as long
[01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:57.340]   as you've documented it quite thoroughly, you can kind of do, uh, whatever you want.
[01:27:57.340 --> 01:28:01.020]   So it doesn't actually, and you know, the evidence is like very unclear as to whether
[01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:08.380]   it is, it has had like a net beneficial environmental, um, uh, effects.
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:13.100]   And to the extent that it has, I think there's a good argument that it has done so just by
[01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:15.580]   making it harder to do anything at all.
[01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:20.700]   Um, and then, so yeah, the other side of this is to create, you know, certainty, solve coordination
[01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:21.940]   problems, stuff like that.
[01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:24.740]   NEPA actually is very, very bad at this.
[01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:29.900]   It's creates a lot of uncertainty because of, because of the, um, the requirements for
[01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:35.460]   like meeting, doing the analysis are so unclear or constantly shifting.
[01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:40.300]   And like the definition of like, what is a major environmental effect has basically changed
[01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:41.300]   over time.
[01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:44.500]   You know, an obvious example is, um, in the 1970s.
[01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:49.540]   It was maybe not obvious that, uh, greenhouse gas emissions were a major environmental effect.
[01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:53.460]   Uh, but now in the 20, you know, 2020 is that obviously is.
[01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:58.260]   And so what you've had to do for a NEPA analysis changes over time, which is of course fine.
[01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:02.500]   Uh, on, on it's, uh, in that sense, right.
[01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:07.460]   But it does mean that it's very unclear when you have to, when you have to go through the
[01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:12.380]   process is unclear how long it's going to take and what is going to be involved and
[01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:15.380]   whether anybody is going to sort of litigate your decision.
[01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:20.740]   This is the other sort of big part of NEPA is that, uh, people are basically able to
[01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:25.900]   sue people for groups for like not completing the analysis thoroughly enough.
[01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:30.260]   They can't use, they can't usually, um, they can't permanently stop the project because
[01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:34.180]   all you need to do is basically show that you've documented your things thoroughly enough.
[01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:38.060]   And so once you have documented it thoroughly enough, they, they don't have grounds for
[01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:43.540]   stopping it anymore, but, um, they can slow it down if they slow it down enough, sometimes
[01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:46.740]   the project becomes unattractive and it gets canceled.
[01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:50.620]   That's kind of what a lot of these groups, uh, hope for.
[01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:53.940]   And so it basically, instead of creating certainty and solving coordination problems, it creates
[01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:59.620]   all this new uncertainty where people will like very deliberately try to avoid the process
[01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:05.060]   because they do not know how long it will take and how much it will cost to get their
[01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:06.060]   project approved.
[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:07.060]   And it's okay.
[01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:11.340]   So these, yeah, again, going through the process will take like a very, very, very, very long
[01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:12.340]   time.
[01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:16.100]   And so making like a business decision as to whether, like do a new, like offshore wind
[01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:20.980]   development or develop a new forest resource or something like that, it's, it's very hard
[01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:22.820]   to do any sort of economic analysis, right?
[01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:26.500]   If you don't know when your project is going to start, because you know, there's not a
[01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:28.380]   lot of business the process will take.
[01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:29.380]   Yeah.
[01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:30.380]   Yeah.
[01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:31.380]   That's so fascinating.
[01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:32.380]   All right.
[01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:33.380]   So I've got, um, a lot more questions about this.
[01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:36.820]   Um, cause yeah, your, uh, your breakdown is really interesting.
[01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:42.140]   So one thing is, uh, I don't know if you're familiar with the long termist movement.
[01:30:42.140 --> 01:30:44.180]   Have you come across this?
[01:30:44.180 --> 01:30:45.180]   Vaguely?
[01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:46.180]   Yeah.
[01:30:46.180 --> 01:30:47.180]   Okay.
[01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:51.180]   So one thing that they've like proposed is that this is not like a doctrine or anything,
[01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:57.580]   but like on the periphery, some idea I saw was that just as we have environmental review,
[01:30:57.580 --> 01:31:03.340]   we should have, um, a posterity review so that you're like analyzing the impacts of
[01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:07.660]   your actions on gender, you know, generations way down the line.
[01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:11.900]   Um, like what are the future impacts of your actions just as we analyze what are the environmental
[01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:13.500]   impacts of your actions?
[01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:18.620]   What do you think of an idea like that, given the various dysfunctions of the environmental
[01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:19.620]   review process?
[01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:20.620]   Yeah.
[01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:21.620]   A couple, a couple of thoughts.
[01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:29.060]   So one is just, I feel it, my gut response is that any additional review is just going
[01:31:29.060 --> 01:31:32.540]   to, you know, add additional time and complexity to your process, right?
[01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:36.980]   Like everything is like a, you know, it's a process that takes some amount of time and
[01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:39.420]   has some particular chance of success, right?
[01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:44.260]   So just adding another thing that like is adding basically another filter to the process,
[01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:49.700]   you get, it's only going to make the process slower and, and, uh, less likely to succeed
[01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:50.700]   rather than more.
[01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:54.660]   And then the other thing is just, you know, how do you, uh, and I, I, I know I've seen
[01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:58.940]   a take like this before, so this is not original at all, but how do you, how accurately are
[01:31:58.940 --> 01:32:06.060]   you going to be able to sort of predict what your, what your long term, um, uh, impacts
[01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:07.060]   are?
[01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:13.020]   Like, it's, it's not obvious to me that anybody making predictions in like, even over the
[01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:19.460]   past 20 years would have been able to sort of, uh, do so with any degree of precision.
[01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:23.220]   Even I'm not, it's not obvious he would even be able to get like the sign right on that,
[01:32:23.220 --> 01:32:27.980]   you know, um, whether it be net positive or, or, or net negative.
[01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:29.700]   I could be, I, I, you know, that's off the top of my head.
[01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:35.020]   I could definitely be persuaded, uh, otherwise from somebody who is, who has thought a lot
[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:36.020]   more about it.
[01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:39.100]   So I don't want to, that is not a strongly held opinion, but that's fine.
[01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:40.380]   That is not my immediate impression.
[01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:42.340]   That would be my critique as well.
[01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:46.540]   Like if you think of, um, like in the seventies, correct me if I'm wrong, but like the technical
[01:32:46.540 --> 01:32:51.180]   consensus at the time was that we would hit peak oil by the nineties.
[01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:54.940]   And of course that's because they couldn't predict like our, our ability to like find
[01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:57.140]   new reservoirs and like develop new technologies.
[01:32:57.140 --> 01:32:58.140]   Right.
[01:32:58.140 --> 01:33:00.820]   So, um, that, that made more oil available to us.
[01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:04.020]   So like, it just like very hard to predict like future trends.
[01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:07.540]   So, um, I, I, I don't know how much that kind of law would help.
[01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:10.140]   Uh, but so let, let me ask about, uh, uh, NAPA.
[01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:13.420]   I vaguely hear that in like the political deliberation, they're discussing reform to
[01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:15.220]   a NAPA.
[01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:17.420]   What would your ideal reform of NAPA look like?
[01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:19.620]   How would you reform the implementation?
[01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:20.620]   Yeah.
[01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:29.160]   I mean, I think on a very simple level, I would like to even the playing field.
[01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:36.660]   So like a lot of these newer energy technologies and have a lot of the same benefits that like
[01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:39.580]   the oil and gas has been able to accrue.
[01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:44.220]   So like for instance, oil, you know, oil and gas has a lot of categorical exclusions, um,
[01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:49.140]   for like certain drilling operations and for like, you know, drilling in the Gulf of Mexico,
[01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:53.460]   they actually have a lot of, a lot of NEPA exclusions, which was perhaps one of the reasons
[01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:57.700]   that, um, not one of the reasons, but you can obviously connect that to like the giant
[01:33:57.700 --> 01:33:58.700]   Deepwater Horizon accident.
[01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:03.660]   And yeah, so basically just giving this, given the, the technologies like wind and solar
[01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:08.780]   and like hot, you know, large scale transmission projects, giving those the same benefits that
[01:34:08.780 --> 01:34:13.540]   like oil and gas drilling and like your like natural gas pipelines have, what I think be
[01:34:13.540 --> 01:34:16.700]   like a massive, massive, um, boom.
[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:20.380]   So just off the top of my head, that's one thing that I would like to see.
[01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:21.380]   Yeah.
[01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:22.380]   Yeah.
[01:34:22.380 --> 01:34:25.020]   I wonder what you think about this, but like one, one, uh, one idea I had like reading
[01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:28.980]   the post was it, like, it doesn't make sense to me why this is enforced through the courts
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:31.740]   where anybody can just like bring a lawsuit.
[01:34:31.740 --> 01:34:37.320]   Like shouldn't there be like a single coherent, um, like bureaucracy whose, whose goal is
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:39.900]   to figure out like who's messing up and whatnot.
[01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:40.900]   Like, I don't know.
[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:43.020]   It seems like a mistake to have this like done through the courts.
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:44.020]   Yeah.
[01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:47.980]   I mean, there, I was reading a paper earlier about it and basically that from like a law
[01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:53.180]   review, it's like, yeah, NEPA is like a horribly drafted law because it contains no provisions
[01:34:53.180 --> 01:34:58.060]   for like, yeah, funding it or with a bureaucracy for like enforcing it or anything like this.
[01:34:58.060 --> 01:35:02.700]   And it's essentially through random chance at the courts to, you know, when it was passed,
[01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:07.020]   it was like a very activist period in the court and he decided to enforce this, like
[01:35:07.020 --> 01:35:11.420]   this provision for the impact statement, which was kind of added, just like not randomly,
[01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:17.020]   but added late in the process without a lot of fanfare or consideration.
[01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:22.460]   And then that like one little part of it ended up becoming the most important part because
[01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:25.460]   that's what the court decided to enforce, like really, really strongly.
[01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:30.260]   Um, but yeah, people are like, yeah, this is not, this is not how you would draft a
[01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:31.260]   environmental protection law.
[01:35:31.260 --> 01:35:36.100]   If you were, if you were doing it from scratch, it's this sort of weird thing that we've ended
[01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:38.580]   up with due to, uh, path dependency.
[01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:44.140]   Um, but yeah, you would want something, yeah, a government agency responsible, uh, a sort
[01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:49.740]   of an idea that I've seen or heard floated a few times is that you would want something
[01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:56.140]   that looked more like the OMB, which basically is charged with like figuring out how much
[01:35:56.140 --> 01:36:00.420]   you get additional, a given law is going to cost or something like that.
[01:36:00.420 --> 01:36:04.540]   Like, and, and you would want something like a bureaucracy attached to it that was just
[01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:07.980]   designed to like, you know, figure out the environmental effects of this.
[01:36:07.980 --> 01:36:11.700]   That was like decoupled from like the specific agency or whatever.
[01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:16.900]   Um, but the downside of that is, is for something like the, um, you know, especially for like
[01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:21.300]   a really environmental, uh, environmental protection statute, uh, is to whether it would
[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:27.020]   be captured by like political interests or not, and either just not enforced at all,
[01:36:27.020 --> 01:36:32.820]   if it was like a very conservative, um, staffing for it, or just unforced, like extremely,
[01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:37.580]   extremely vigorously, if it was, um, you know, on the other end of the spectrum.
[01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:43.140]   So that's kind of the risk of that, but yes, it's, it's, it's clearly not ideal that the
[01:36:43.140 --> 01:36:48.460]   court system is responsible for basically determining this.
[01:36:48.460 --> 01:36:52.300]   Even if there was like a bias in how the law was enforced, if there's a bureaucracy, the
[01:36:52.300 --> 01:36:55.540]   benefit is that you can just like fire the guy who's running it if you think he's not
[01:36:55.540 --> 01:36:58.500]   enforcing it correctly and replace them with somebody who's like, who you think will enforce
[01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:03.260]   it, uh, more appropriately, whereas with like the judiciary, if it's just like dozens of
[01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:07.780]   different judges, like, uh, having like independent, like, I guess, opinions of like how this should
[01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:12.300]   be enforced, there's nobody who's like responsible that you can, uh, you can say like enforce
[01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:13.300]   it differently.
[01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:14.300]   You know what I mean?
[01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:15.300]   Yeah.
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:18.960]   And it actually, it actually makes it because it's the court that actually makes it like
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:24.900]   a little bit hard to, to change it because any given change in the provision, you don't
[01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:30.380]   actually know what the effect of it is until somebody files a lawsuit referring to it and
[01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:32.280]   it works its way through the courts.
[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:36.860]   So there's like, you know, some people think that, um, during the Trump administration,
[01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:38.780]   there was some changes to how NEPA work.
[01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:43.580]   Cause that's one thing about it is that a lot of these laws are just, are federal level
[01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:48.940]   laws that are comparatively simpler to change, um, but they change some of these, these,
[01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:50.900]   these, these laws regarding it.
[01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:56.380]   And someone was like, yeah, this is, you know, designed to accelerate it, but because it's
[01:37:56.380 --> 01:38:00.980]   unsure how the courts are going to interpret them, it's actually going to kind of increase
[01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:05.580]   the risk for these projects in the short term until some of these lawsuits make their way
[01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:06.580]   through the courts.
[01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:11.020]   And we know exactly what is required or not because the court tells us, so yeah, it's
[01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:17.420]   a, it's a, it's a very inefficient system of, uh, legislative, you know, uh, implementing
[01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:18.420]   environmental requirements.
[01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:20.380]   And I don't think I'm not an expert on this.
[01:38:20.380 --> 01:38:25.100]   I don't think it's really how other countries do it.
[01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:30.740]   Um, I'm not, uh, this is again, I'm not strongly willing to spend some of the extra, but you
[01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:36.180]   know, a lot of other countries, almost every other country I think has something like requiring
[01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:40.980]   environmental impact statements, but I don't think it doesn't necessarily mean that they,
[01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:46.600]   um, that there's like a legit, they can, you know, the courts enforcing it via citizen
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:48.260]   lawsuits is, is how it's enforced.
[01:38:48.260 --> 01:38:52.500]   I think a lot of times, yeah, they're just, it's done via like another, a normal government
[01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:54.340]   bureaucracy or something like that.
[01:38:54.340 --> 01:38:55.340]   Okay.
[01:38:55.340 --> 01:39:00.900]   So I was actually just about to ask that like countries that have different or no, um, systems
[01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:06.300]   of environmental review, do they have speedier and more cost effective public works or do
[01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:11.740]   we, do you have data on this or, uh, yeah, I don't actually, uh, no, it would be very
[01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:13.220]   hard to separate that.
[01:39:13.220 --> 01:39:14.220]   Yeah.
[01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:15.220]   I don't know.
[01:39:15.220 --> 01:39:16.220]   That's all right.
[01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:20.380]   And then, um, you had a, you had a comment in that post that I found interesting.
[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:26.100]   You said this or uncertainty also makes changing NEPA somewhat risky.
[01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:31.220]   Experts have noted for instance, that rules to accelerate NEPA processes or impose maximum
[01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:36.660]   timelines might result in more of them being challenged in court by failing to take the
[01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:38.740]   proper, uh, quote unquote hard look.
[01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:40.420]   Um, do you want to explain this?
[01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:42.340]   Cause this is counterintuitive to me.
[01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:43.340]   Yeah.
[01:39:43.340 --> 01:39:49.340]   So the requirements, uh, for, um, meeting the NEPA requirement, and this is, this is
[01:39:49.340 --> 01:39:54.460]   a more general requirement, um, across other things, but you have to take what is what
[01:39:54.460 --> 01:40:00.620]   the courts call like a hard look where you have to consider these impacts and, uh, quite
[01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:01.940]   thoroughly.
[01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:07.860]   And so the sort of risk is that if you put a, um, put like a cap, you know, a timeline
[01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:11.900]   cap on some of these processes, like it has to be done in a year and if it's not done
[01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:14.140]   in a year, it's automatically approved.
[01:40:14.140 --> 01:40:17.300]   It's just an idea you see floated from, from time to time.
[01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:20.820]   The risk is that people will just say, okay, well we will go and litigate this project
[01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:21.820]   immediately.
[01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:26.220]   And then when we do, we will say they did not look hard enough at these impacts.
[01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:31.380]   And if there was a, you know, if they can't marshal the resources or something else like,
[01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:37.260]   you know, we needed to study some particular flowering species and it only has a flowering
[01:40:37.260 --> 01:40:42.780]   period of two weeks in the spring and we didn't have time to, you know, the time period was
[01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:48.140]   up before that happens, then the court, which is a, which is a thing that happens in NEPA
[01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:49.140]   apparently.
[01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:53.020]   Um, which, which is one of the reasons why these take multiple years, because if you're
[01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:58.180]   observing some species or whatever, you maybe need an entire year to actually, to actually
[01:40:58.180 --> 01:40:59.180]   observe.
[01:40:59.180 --> 01:41:03.980]   Um, but if you, you know, if you fail to look at this plant when it was during the flowering
[01:41:03.980 --> 01:41:05.460]   season, you don't know if it's actually there.
[01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:09.880]   And so you haven't considered the impacts on, on, on the, uh, potentially endangered
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:14.180]   species or whatever, and the court would say, yeah, you did not look hard enough at this.
[01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:16.060]   So go back and do it again.
[01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:21.460]   So it's, you see that mentioned quite a few times that, uh, timeline caps could be very
[01:41:21.460 --> 01:41:26.940]   easily backfire by just increasing the amount of increasing susceptible to litigation, which
[01:41:26.940 --> 01:41:30.380]   would just make these things take longer than they already do.
[01:41:30.380 --> 01:41:35.860]   Already you see a lot of like extra analysis due to risk aversion from the, from these
[01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:40.300]   federal agencies, the laws around NEPA actually say that your environmental impact statement
[01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:45.820]   should really not be longer than 150 pages, except in extreme circumstances.
[01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:50.620]   But the average environmental impact statement is now like 660 pages or something like that.
[01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:56.200]   So people are already like going more than what the law says they should do just out
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:57.200]   of risk aversion.
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:42:01.060]   So if you don't like fix what's fixed, what are fixed, the incentives that are causing
[01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:04.740]   this risk aversion, your, your solution will not work.
[01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:11.900]   I'm curious if you think that there's been a sort of talent to drain from physical engineering
[01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:14.860]   tasks like construction into software.
[01:42:14.860 --> 01:42:15.860]   Has that happened?
[01:42:15.860 --> 01:42:20.220]   And has that had an impact on, uh, the world of Adams or like, is that just a thing people
[01:42:20.220 --> 01:42:23.220]   like discuss on the internet, but it's not, it's not real.
[01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:28.420]   Oh yeah, I, I do think that's almost definitely happening.
[01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:34.820]   I mean, this was, this is my constant opinion when I was working as an engineer, especially
[01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:38.380]   when I was like managing younger engineers, right, who were getting paid like comparatively
[01:42:38.380 --> 01:42:39.380]   little.
[01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:42.380]   And I would always thinking I was always like on the verge of telling them, there's like,
[01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:48.340]   why don't you just go learn how to code and go three or three or four times as much at,
[01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:55.140]   you know, a fang company instead of doing this like fairly thankless work, um, uh, frankly.
[01:42:55.140 --> 01:43:02.180]   Um, yeah, so I think it's, it's very likely to, to be, um, an issue, you know, in some
[01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:07.820]   sense it's, it's theoretically like self-correcting right to the extent that where if you're,
[01:43:07.820 --> 01:43:14.060]   if the labor moves out of the field and it then gets more expensive, um, the, uh, the
[01:43:14.060 --> 01:43:17.700]   incentives around it changed a little bit and you're forced to find ways of building
[01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:23.820]   things with, with, uh, less, uh, labor requirements or where you can spread your, your labor development
[01:43:23.820 --> 01:43:25.300]   over a larger volume outfits.
[01:43:25.300 --> 01:43:30.540]   So arguably, you know, if the engineers are leaving and engineers are getting more expensive
[01:43:30.540 --> 01:43:33.580]   or, or whatever, you're going to basically find a way like, all right, we need to get
[01:43:33.580 --> 01:43:37.540]   more, that's going to push you towards like figuring out how to like spread your engineering
[01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:41.660]   effort over like a larger construction volume, which would be like, you know, using more
[01:43:41.660 --> 01:43:45.340]   prefab or using, you know, kit of parts assemblies and, and things like that.
[01:43:45.340 --> 01:43:52.180]   So theoretically to some extent it is, um, self-correcting, I guess the risk for that
[01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:59.420]   is like, if you, you know, if you scream off, you know, screen off the top 20% of most talented
[01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:06.180]   people or whatever, does that just like fundamentally handicap what your industry is, is kind of
[01:44:06.180 --> 01:44:11.740]   capable of doing, or does it just, you know, do your, do your incentives kind of push the
[01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:17.060]   other way and you try to like even lower your, your quality, the, um, uh, even more, I feel
[01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:19.300]   like I've heard some people make a complaint.
[01:44:19.300 --> 01:44:24.100]   So it's the fact with like semiconductor research, how like semiconductor engineering is actually
[01:44:24.100 --> 01:44:29.220]   not especially well-paid and it is relatively easy for like semiconductor engineers to go
[01:44:29.220 --> 01:44:31.660]   get jobs working in software development.
[01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:39.020]   And so you see sort of a brain dame from, from that, um, yeah, I think it actually may
[01:44:39.020 --> 01:44:45.100]   be correcting to some extent with, um, engineers last, last time I looked them a little bit
[01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:50.780]   out of the engineering game, but it, um, uh, the salaries for engineers that actually kind
[01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:55.740]   of risen quite a bit, a similar risk is to, and people are in construction complaining
[01:44:55.740 --> 01:44:56.740]   about this constantly.
[01:44:56.740 --> 01:45:02.540]   It's just the end of it, unavailability of, of, uh, skilled labor where, um, you know,
[01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:06.660]   like we talked about, like being able to like do a lot of these tasks requires like skilled
[01:45:06.660 --> 01:45:12.820]   expertise and able to do, and, um, you saw a lot of these people leave the labor force
[01:45:12.820 --> 01:45:18.620]   during the, uh, the greater session and then not really come back and, uh, people aren't
[01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:21.380]   just entering it at the rates that, that they need to.
[01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:25.740]   I think the average age of like a construction worker is like somewhere in the forties or
[01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:26.740]   perhaps fifties.
[01:45:26.740 --> 01:45:27.740]   It's like very, very high.
[01:45:27.740 --> 01:45:31.700]   Um, and so people are, and people are constantly complains like, ah, I can't get enough labor.
[01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:35.740]   There's not enough workers or whatever, but of course this also is just going to push,
[01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:42.240]   you know, incentivize finding, uh, ways to, um, basically get these buildings built using
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:43.240]   less labor.
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:48.460]   I'm a little bit less worried about like potential negative effects from that.
[01:45:48.460 --> 01:45:55.020]   I mean, there's a lot of historical examples of like labor constraints developing into,
[01:45:55.020 --> 01:45:58.740]   uh, you know, labor saving inventions and things like that.
[01:45:58.740 --> 01:46:01.380]   Like the, the, you know, the history of the U S is like that, right.
[01:46:01.380 --> 01:46:05.500]   Where we had like a real, not nearly enough labor as they, as sort of they need.
[01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:11.380]   And so we developed a lot of, um, uh, uh, labor saving machinery, the American system
[01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:12.860]   of manufacturing and things like that.
[01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:19.420]   Um, yeah, I'm a little bit less worried about that, but I could see it definitely taking
[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:24.900]   having sort of effects like that and the sort of, um, uh, other sides of the, uh, the industry.
[01:46:24.900 --> 01:46:25.900]   Yeah.
[01:46:25.900 --> 01:46:26.900]   Yeah.
[01:46:26.900 --> 01:46:30.060]   And even, um, who's the author of that global economic history book, but they made a point
[01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:34.580]   that the industrial revolution happened in Britain because the cost of labor was highest
[01:46:34.580 --> 01:46:36.860]   in Britain because there was a plague that killed up a bunch of people.
[01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:38.300]   So labor is really expensive.
[01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:39.300]   Yeah.
[01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:40.300]   I've heard that as well.
[01:46:40.300 --> 01:46:43.780]   I'm not an expert in economic history, so I'm trying and trying to avoid comments, you
[01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:46.540]   know, kind of things that I know, like very, very little about.
[01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:51.300]   And I guess, you know, one, the other factor is just that now as sort of venture capital
[01:46:51.300 --> 01:46:58.620]   expands its tentacles into other industries, you're seeing a lot more effort on developing
[01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:00.640]   sort of solutions for the built environment.
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:04.900]   So to some, you know, you're seeing more venture capital money flow into the space.
[01:47:04.900 --> 01:47:07.860]   So perhaps that will counteract to some extent.
[01:47:07.860 --> 01:47:09.260]   Uh, I don't know.
[01:47:09.260 --> 01:47:10.260]   Yeah.
[01:47:10.260 --> 01:47:11.260]   All right.
[01:47:11.260 --> 01:47:12.260]   Final question.
[01:47:12.260 --> 01:47:16.340]   Like many years ago, um, Tyler Cowen was like interviewed by Patrick Collison.
[01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:22.340]   Uh, and then like one of the things Tyler Cowen said was that there should be more blogs
[01:47:22.340 --> 01:47:26.900]   that are just like focused on one particular area or issue and then just kind of raise
[01:47:26.900 --> 01:47:32.180]   the salience of it and help like drive insight and understanding of it.
[01:47:32.180 --> 01:47:35.900]   And I feel like you've done that really well with, um, uh, construction and construction
[01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:37.460]   of productivity.
[01:47:37.460 --> 01:47:43.740]   And I'm curious, what other areas would you like to see the blogs that, uh, that do for
[01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:47.420]   their area of what you have done for construction productivity, which is just like take a broader
[01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:52.740]   view of what's happening, what the trends are, like try to add more insight into, um,
[01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:55.540]   like professional problems and things like that.
[01:47:55.540 --> 01:47:56.540]   Oh, good question.
[01:47:56.540 --> 01:47:59.140]   Um, yeah, I feel like there's so much about this.
[01:47:59.140 --> 01:48:03.460]   I was complaining this the other day that like, you know, just this, I think a very
[01:48:03.460 --> 01:48:09.900]   underrated problem is just this giant civilizational machine that like takes in raw materials and
[01:48:09.900 --> 01:48:14.820]   spits out finished goods and services and high quality of life.
[01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:19.540]   Nobody really knows how it works and mostly how it works is like completely undocumented
[01:48:19.540 --> 01:48:23.900]   is that does not exist in written information anywhere.
[01:48:23.900 --> 01:48:28.300]   And the information that is written down, it's like maybe in one particular company's,
[01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:31.140]   you know, share drive or something like that.
[01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:35.740]   Like there's no, the, the instructions for building like a Toyota or something don't
[01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:37.940]   exist in any way, shape or form.
[01:48:37.940 --> 01:48:43.580]   Um, and it might be very hard to kind of recreate that, you know, if you needed to, but yeah,
[01:48:43.580 --> 01:48:48.620]   just in general, I would like to see somebody do something similar for like manufacturing
[01:48:48.620 --> 01:48:54.620]   just in general, especially now because so much of that, um, so much of manufacturing
[01:48:54.620 --> 01:49:01.460]   U S knowledge has been lost to this move over to, uh, to, to China and other places where
[01:49:01.460 --> 01:49:02.460]   labor is cheaper.
[01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:08.620]   Um, there's just so much knowledge has been gone and just how things that get built, uh,
[01:49:08.620 --> 01:49:13.820]   and manufactured that just isn't written down anywhere or isn't written down and we're accessible.
[01:49:13.820 --> 01:49:18.260]   And, you know, you see kind of people share like the same small number of resources for
[01:49:18.260 --> 01:49:24.300]   how these things work, uh, over and over again, I asked a few, a few people who I thought
[01:49:24.300 --> 01:49:25.300]   would know about it.
[01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:30.860]   Like, is there any like book written that, um, actually explains like what it is like
[01:49:30.860 --> 01:49:35.460]   to build something, get something built in China or like what, like building things in
[01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:40.820]   China are actually like, and they're all like, no, I don't know any, I don't know any source
[01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:41.820]   that exists.
[01:49:41.820 --> 01:49:45.380]   There's a few blogs that like describe like their particular experiences, which again,
[01:49:45.380 --> 01:49:51.860]   that end up being like overly valuable resources, but there's no like general source of, of,
[01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:54.660]   of available information for how any of that works.
[01:49:54.660 --> 01:50:01.060]   Um, so yeah, I just think like documentation of, of, uh, how, uh, the civilization machine
[01:50:01.060 --> 01:50:06.780]   functions is just wildly under investigated, invested in, which I guess is, is true for
[01:50:06.780 --> 01:50:07.780]   documentation in general.
[01:50:07.780 --> 01:50:08.780]   Right?
[01:50:08.780 --> 01:50:13.620]   Like nobody wants to do that because the payoffs are far in the future and uncertain, um, and
[01:50:13.620 --> 01:50:16.860]   the costs are, uh, up front.
[01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:22.060]   So, um, it's not surprising to me that it doesn't exist, but, um, I do think that, you
[01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:25.620]   know, in general teams, people are really very interested in understanding how things
[01:50:25.620 --> 01:50:31.900]   work and if you can explain how something, uh, works, even if it seems like a fairly
[01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:36.100]   niche topic, you can get quite a bit of attention for doing stuff.
[01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:41.260]   So for anybody who works in, you know, manufacturing or like that, I think you would see, uh, you
[01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:47.300]   would find quite a bit of success if you started, uh, writing things up, uh, how it functions.
[01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:48.300]   Interesting.
[01:50:48.300 --> 01:50:49.300]   Okay.
[01:50:49.300 --> 01:50:50.300]   Excellent.
[01:50:50.300 --> 01:50:54.700]   To listeners who know about manufacturing, do, do spin up your, uh, do spin up your sub
[01:50:54.700 --> 01:50:55.700]   stacks.
[01:50:55.700 --> 01:50:56.700]   Okay.
[01:50:56.700 --> 01:51:00.140]   So this is part two of my conversation with Brian Potter.
[01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:03.260]   Um, the first conversation was really interesting.
[01:51:03.260 --> 01:51:08.300]   And then afterwards I realized that I had forgotten to ask Brian about this really interesting
[01:51:08.300 --> 01:51:12.100]   theory that, uh, Scott Alexander and others have written about.
[01:51:12.100 --> 01:51:14.460]   Uh, and Brian is the perfect person to talk to about this.
[01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:18.460]   So, uh, I take convenience of him and ask him to come on again.
[01:51:18.460 --> 01:51:23.380]   But the idea is basically, or the question is, why does modern architecture just look
[01:51:23.380 --> 01:51:28.320]   so much more ugly than things that were built a hundred years ago or 200 years ago?
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:32.660]   You would have thought that due to increases into technology and the buildup in new ideas
[01:51:32.660 --> 01:51:35.220]   and designs that things would become prettier.
[01:51:35.220 --> 01:51:38.300]   But if you look at like a building that was built in the last a hundred years, it just
[01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:42.220]   looks like a cylinder or a rectangle of glass and concrete.
[01:51:42.220 --> 01:51:45.980]   And if you look at things that were built before, you see like things like, uh, you
[01:51:45.980 --> 01:51:50.780]   know, the Sagrada Familia or like these intricate cathedrals, or even these skyscrapers that
[01:51:50.780 --> 01:51:56.340]   have all these, uh, flourishes and ornaments and all these decorations.
[01:51:56.340 --> 01:51:58.420]   So Brian, what is going on?
[01:51:58.420 --> 01:52:00.420]   Why are things so much uglier now?
[01:52:00.420 --> 01:52:01.420]   Sure.
[01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:02.420]   I have a few thoughts on this.
[01:52:02.420 --> 01:52:08.180]   I don't know if I have an answer to the actual question, but I can sort of add some context.
[01:52:08.180 --> 01:52:12.740]   I think, Hey, I'm not necessarily the best person to ask on this, a better person to
[01:52:12.740 --> 01:52:18.980]   ask on it would be an architect who can talk about like how, you know, the design and taste
[01:52:18.980 --> 01:52:24.140]   has like evolved over the course of, you know, the 20th and 19th century and stuff like that.
[01:52:24.140 --> 01:52:28.660]   But also in general, I don't have like a huge amount of opinion on aesthetics.
[01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:37.180]   And to the extent that I do, I do tend to favor the more like, you know, simple, minimalist,
[01:52:37.180 --> 01:52:38.180]   clean lines.
[01:52:38.180 --> 01:52:43.540]   Like one of my favorite, you know, piece of construction is this bridge called Salga Metoval,
[01:52:43.540 --> 01:52:46.340]   which is built in Switzerland.
[01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:48.420]   It's the banner that's on my Twitter account.
[01:52:48.420 --> 01:52:53.100]   And it's exactly this, it's like this really simple, minimalist, minimalist, just really
[01:52:53.100 --> 01:52:59.740]   tiny curve of concrete that's like just exactly in the shape that it needs to be to resist
[01:52:59.740 --> 01:53:00.740]   the forces on it.
[01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:04.380]   And so to some extent it's, to me, it's like, you're asking, you know, why did aesthetics
[01:53:04.380 --> 01:53:10.560]   change from like worst aesthetics to better aesthetics, you know, because they're better.
[01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:15.660]   That's obviously not what I actually think, but you know, just again, to a little bit
[01:53:15.660 --> 01:53:20.820]   where I'm, I'm coming from, you want to like separate out the question a little bit.
[01:53:20.820 --> 01:53:29.860]   I don't, I think it's more a question of why do build modern buildings have like less ornamentation,
[01:53:29.860 --> 01:53:33.420]   not necessarily that they're like ugly per se.
[01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:39.300]   I think there's like a really lot, a lot of like a really, you know, beautiful modern
[01:53:39.300 --> 01:53:44.220]   architecture and kind of what it, a lot of what it sort of seems to focus on.
[01:53:44.220 --> 01:53:47.620]   And again, an architect would be a better person to ask about this, but I will sort
[01:53:47.620 --> 01:53:49.100]   of muddle my way through.
[01:53:49.100 --> 01:53:55.420]   Using like light and space and form to like, create like these big, interesting, open,
[01:53:55.420 --> 01:54:01.740]   big impressive open spaces that like create a lot of just interesting shapes and like
[01:54:01.740 --> 01:54:05.460]   this big expansive space is what they're kind of really going for.
[01:54:05.460 --> 01:54:08.340]   A good example of this, like a building thing is interesting is if you look at like the
[01:54:08.340 --> 01:54:14.820]   new terminal for the Portland airport, which has this big giant mass timber roof, which
[01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:20.620]   is not a way of building these big large span structures, but it's really neat and kind
[01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:21.620]   of interesting.
[01:54:21.620 --> 01:54:29.020]   And that's like a lot of what kind of, you see these, a lot of architectures is kind
[01:54:29.020 --> 01:54:30.020]   of focused on.
[01:54:30.020 --> 01:54:32.820]   And that's like, that's been like pretty common throughout history, right?
[01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:36.420]   If you think cathedrals, it's like, they're trying to create these like big impressive
[01:54:36.420 --> 01:54:42.940]   spaces using, you know, with like, using like light and stuff to create, you know, this
[01:54:42.940 --> 01:54:45.540]   impressive space with like the Pantheon, it's like the same thing.
[01:54:45.540 --> 01:54:48.460]   It's like creating this big, open, impressive space.
[01:54:48.460 --> 01:54:54.780]   And so I think it's really, you know, you kind of want to separate out to some extent
[01:54:54.780 --> 01:55:00.580]   the question of why is it ugly, which I'm not necessarily agree with and why does it
[01:55:00.580 --> 01:55:05.540]   not have so much, why does that have so much less ornamentation, which I think is like
[01:55:05.540 --> 01:55:07.140]   a little bit more defensible.
[01:55:07.140 --> 01:55:08.140]   Okay.
[01:55:08.140 --> 01:55:12.420]   Actually, let me ask about the second one, cause I'm not sure I totally followed.
[01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:16.340]   So the ornamentation has been replaced by the openness?
[01:55:16.340 --> 01:55:17.340]   Well, yeah.
[01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:18.340]   Yeah.
[01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:24.860]   So I guess my point is that, you know, traditional, a lot of like, you know, interesting, impressive
[01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:30.900]   spaces were just focused on creating this big indoor, you know, impressive, large span
[01:55:30.900 --> 01:55:34.700]   space and using the, you know, playing with the light and stuff to do that.
[01:55:34.700 --> 01:55:40.580]   And that's like, that's a, that's been like common in like people buildings that are people
[01:55:40.580 --> 01:55:46.220]   think are impressive and you still see that today, architects still do that a lot, right?
[01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:52.140]   The using like big open areas with a lot of glass everywhere is kind of a tool in their
[01:55:52.140 --> 01:55:54.780]   tool belt to, to kind of do that to some extent.
[01:55:54.780 --> 01:55:55.780]   Gotcha.
[01:55:55.780 --> 01:55:56.780]   So, okay.
[01:55:56.780 --> 01:56:00.740]   So they were replacing like the old stone working and stone masonry stuff with, uh,
[01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:03.860]   and the gargoyles with, uh, with these kinds of things.
[01:56:03.860 --> 01:56:04.860]   Okay.
[01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:05.860]   I see.
[01:56:05.860 --> 01:56:06.860]   Okay.
[01:56:06.860 --> 01:56:12.340]   So, you know, the, the idea that the older designs were less efficient in some way to
[01:56:12.340 --> 01:56:17.220]   steel man, the opposite position, someone might say that there are a lot of the value
[01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:23.140]   of construction and building is just the aesthetic presence that has has in a city or a neighborhood.
[01:56:23.140 --> 01:56:27.260]   And to the extent that we've lost that, you know, maybe, maybe we got to use less material
[01:56:27.260 --> 01:56:33.300]   on a bridge or a skyscraper, but then it kind of just acts as like this, it just like this
[01:56:33.300 --> 01:56:38.340]   ugly thing in the middle of the city, um, or if not ugly, at least not as aesthetically
[01:56:38.340 --> 01:56:40.380]   pleasant as it could have otherwise been.
[01:56:40.380 --> 01:56:44.100]   Uh, and that that's something we should care about when we're doing construction.
[01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:45.420]   How would you react to something like that?
[01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:46.420]   Yeah.
[01:56:46.420 --> 01:56:50.260]   So I guess to clarify what I was talking about before, I don't think new buildings necessarily
[01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:53.660]   use less material in a sense.
[01:56:53.660 --> 01:56:58.500]   I just think it's, they have an aesthetic that's more minimalist and streamlined and
[01:56:58.500 --> 01:57:00.980]   without a lot of extra decoration.
[01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:05.980]   Uh, I think, you know, the complaint is like, Oh, I'll build in just a big, like circle,
[01:57:05.980 --> 01:57:11.540]   you know, cylinder of glass or a rectangle of, of glass or, or whatever like that.
[01:57:11.540 --> 01:57:19.460]   Um, I think one reason that that is true is because it may not be super interesting from
[01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:22.100]   the outside, but you're on like the inside of a building.
[01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:26.460]   It actually is, you actually kind of want like a whole lot of glass, like it's really
[01:57:26.460 --> 01:57:31.740]   nice to have a whole, you know, a large open space to, to walk through and to have like
[01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:37.220]   a lot of like natural light that didn't really, that wasn't really, that was very hard to
[01:57:37.220 --> 01:57:40.700]   do prior to like, you know, the mid 20th century.
[01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:46.140]   And because for a couple of reasons, one is because buildings weren't really air conditioned
[01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:47.140]   before that.
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:53.420]   Um, and another one is like, it was like really very, very, you know, to have like big expanse
[01:57:53.420 --> 01:57:59.340]   of glass, it's still expensive, but it was like even more expensive, uh, as you go, as
[01:57:59.340 --> 01:58:05.380]   you go, go further back, it was a glass making process invented in like the 1950s, 1960s
[01:58:05.380 --> 01:58:08.580]   called the float glass process, which made it a lot.
[01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:13.260]   You could basically make really high quality glass for like way, way, way cheaper than
[01:58:13.260 --> 01:58:14.980]   it was possible to previously.
[01:58:14.980 --> 01:58:20.020]   Um, and so that, you know, air conditioning and stuff like that, it basically, and then,
[01:58:20.020 --> 01:58:24.620]   you know, advances in like structural design, increased use of like steel and stuff like
[01:58:24.620 --> 01:58:25.620]   that.
[01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:28.340]   Um, it basically became a lot more possible to just have like, you're building this like
[01:58:28.340 --> 01:58:34.380]   a big giant slab of glass and have like a lot of natural light and a lot of openness
[01:58:34.380 --> 01:58:35.380]   on the inside.
[01:58:35.380 --> 01:58:40.380]   And that creates kind of a nice experience if you're actually in the building.
[01:58:40.380 --> 01:58:47.660]   Um, and I think that, cause some extent applies a little bit more, more generally, if you
[01:58:47.660 --> 01:58:52.660]   look at like, you know, if you look at, uh, if you look at like, you know, an HGTV remodel
[01:58:52.660 --> 01:58:56.460]   or something like that, everybody wants to create like a big giant open concept floor
[01:58:56.460 --> 01:59:01.500]   plan or whatever, with all the walls blown out and lots of natural light coming in everywhere.
[01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:06.620]   So I mean, to some extent, it's just like the technology, it seems like it's maybe a
[01:59:06.620 --> 01:59:11.980]   case of the technology evolved such that you can create this nicer interior space to some
[01:59:11.980 --> 01:59:18.180]   extent that came, perhaps came at the expense of like having a lot of really ornate decoration
[01:59:18.180 --> 01:59:21.420]   on the top, on the outside, not on top of the outside.
[01:59:21.420 --> 01:59:27.380]   Um, and you know, if you're building a building, it makes sense to, you know, optimize the
[01:59:27.380 --> 01:59:32.220]   inside at the, at the extent of the outside, because that's where, what is you're actually
[01:59:32.220 --> 01:59:33.220]   using.
[01:59:33.220 --> 01:59:34.220]   Okay.
[01:59:34.220 --> 01:59:35.220]   Yeah.
[01:59:35.220 --> 01:59:36.220]   That's interesting way to put it.
[01:59:36.220 --> 01:59:43.180]   I mean, one, uh, one comment that I've heard is if the, the progress of Yimby ism has been
[01:59:43.180 --> 01:59:49.060]   hurt by the fact that new buildings, because of this rational self interest are ugly on
[01:59:49.060 --> 01:59:51.700]   the outside and very pleasant on the inside.
[01:59:51.700 --> 01:59:56.660]   But the result is that the people who are like, I don't know, the community organizers
[01:59:56.660 --> 02:00:00.420]   or whatever, the other people in the community will oppose these new buildings because what
[02:00:00.420 --> 02:00:02.300]   they get to see is the outside.
[02:00:02.300 --> 02:00:06.580]   And you know, these, all of these historical preservation boards, they will notice that
[02:00:06.580 --> 02:00:10.500]   these older buildings that are not as pleasant on the inside and have obviously less occupancy
[02:00:10.500 --> 02:00:14.700]   and everything, uh, they look more pleasant in their neighborhood than the new buildings
[02:00:14.700 --> 02:00:17.060]   that people want to tear these down and build.
[02:00:17.060 --> 02:00:22.540]   And then, so if we want to convince the Nimby's to go along with new construction, you kind
[02:00:22.540 --> 02:00:23.540]   of have to make it look beautiful.
[02:00:23.540 --> 02:00:24.540]   What do you think about that?
[02:00:24.540 --> 02:00:25.540]   Yeah.
[02:00:25.540 --> 02:00:31.580]   I bet that's, I, that sounds, it seems like it's true probably to some extent.
[02:00:31.580 --> 02:00:37.020]   I mean, there is, that's like the fundamental tension in like real estate, right?
[02:00:37.020 --> 02:00:41.500]   Is that any property you have has a lot, you know, has like a lot of externalities and
[02:00:41.500 --> 02:00:43.460]   influence for the value of everything around it.
[02:00:43.460 --> 02:00:48.180]   So like it's this big game of negotiate any given thing you build, it's like a big negotiation
[02:00:48.180 --> 02:00:51.900]   between you and everything in the immediate area.
[02:00:51.900 --> 02:00:56.460]   And that's why things like zoning and stuff like that exists in the first place, even
[02:00:56.460 --> 02:01:01.340]   if it's not, you know, necessarily implemented in an especially way that people think is
[02:01:01.340 --> 02:01:02.340]   good.
[02:01:02.340 --> 02:01:05.980]   I think it's probably a little bit easy to over index on that.
[02:01:05.980 --> 02:01:09.900]   Um, I wouldn't, it would not surprise me if like, you know, it's like, okay, we'll build
[02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:10.900]   this.
[02:01:10.900 --> 02:01:11.900]   And it's like a really beautiful old building.
[02:01:11.900 --> 02:01:14.340]   It's like, no, it's still going to, it's still going to be a giant building.
[02:01:14.340 --> 02:01:15.700]   It's still going to mess up my traffic.
[02:01:15.700 --> 02:01:18.820]   It's still going to have a bunch of renters that are going to come in and reduce my property
[02:01:18.820 --> 02:01:19.820]   values.
[02:01:19.820 --> 02:01:23.780]   You know, you see a lot of these like historical preservation things, want to preserve things
[02:01:23.780 --> 02:01:30.180]   like old gas stations and laundromats and things that are not beautiful at all, or like
[02:01:30.180 --> 02:01:32.140]   parking lots and stuff like that.
[02:01:32.140 --> 02:01:37.500]   Um, so I, you know, I think that's probably true on some margin.
[02:01:37.500 --> 02:01:45.140]   I would be surprised if it's like, you know, this is the one thing we need to fix to untangle
[02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:46.140]   this problem.
[02:01:46.140 --> 02:01:47.140]   Gotcha.
[02:01:47.140 --> 02:01:51.180]   I wanted to ask, by the way, you mentioned, um, how indoor air conditioning and heating
[02:01:51.180 --> 02:01:52.540]   has changed this dynamics.
[02:01:52.540 --> 02:01:56.740]   Is it just because you have enough insulation that even if you lose heat through the glass,
[02:01:56.740 --> 02:01:57.740]   that's fine or?
[02:01:57.740 --> 02:02:01.820]   No, I mean, basically if you're, if you're, um, if you have like a glass, you know, a
[02:02:01.820 --> 02:02:06.300]   big glass wall, um, on your, as the, as your exterior building, right?
[02:02:06.300 --> 02:02:10.340]   That like is, if you don't have air conditioning and that thing is just going to like cook
[02:02:10.340 --> 02:02:14.300]   in whenever it gets hot out, that it's going to basically be like a greenhouse.
[02:02:14.300 --> 02:02:18.420]   So you basically need air conditioning to sort of make that habitable.
[02:02:18.420 --> 02:02:23.780]   You see this with like single family homes too, where, um, where when air conditioning
[02:02:23.780 --> 02:02:29.580]   started to become like popular and like installed by default, all of a sudden they started building
[02:02:29.580 --> 02:02:33.540]   these houses with like these big giant picture windows, which they didn't have before, which
[02:02:33.540 --> 02:02:34.540]   people like, right.
[02:02:34.540 --> 02:02:36.900]   Again, this makes like a nice inside space.
[02:02:36.900 --> 02:02:41.300]   And if you're going to be inside, you want, that's the part you want to focus on.
[02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:46.180]   But again, it basically is predicated on having air conditioner to control the climate.
[02:02:46.180 --> 02:02:47.180]   Gotcha.
[02:02:47.180 --> 02:02:48.180]   Okay.
[02:02:48.180 --> 02:02:52.500]   So that explains why the outsides of buildings aren't as pretty as it used to be, but, uh,
[02:02:52.500 --> 02:02:55.500]   there's still the question of why insides are so minimalistic.
[02:02:55.500 --> 02:02:57.540]   Like there, I don't know if you saw this by the way.
[02:02:57.540 --> 02:03:01.660]   So about a year or two ago, Microsoft announced that they were building this new office for
[02:03:01.660 --> 02:03:06.820]   developers in India and the interior, the outside, it looks like a modern, you know,
[02:03:06.820 --> 02:03:12.340]   glass building, but the inside that all these like really interesting Mughal architectural
[02:03:12.340 --> 02:03:18.020]   details and craftsmanship that made it look, you know, for everything from the furniture
[02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:24.060]   to the floor layout, to the arches of the entrances, uh, was supposed to like, look
[02:03:24.060 --> 02:03:25.060]   like a Mughal palace.
[02:03:25.060 --> 02:03:26.700]   And it actually looks really cool.
[02:03:26.700 --> 02:03:32.660]   Um, and so why don't more developers do something like that on the interiors of these buildings?
[02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:35.260]   Uh, yeah, I mean, again, good question.
[02:03:35.260 --> 02:03:40.980]   I think for the most part, a developer is very broadly speaking, and again, I'm not
[02:03:40.980 --> 02:03:45.260]   a developer, so this is, I'm going to muddle my way through it as best I can.
[02:03:45.260 --> 02:03:49.500]   Um, they're basically building the space to rent out, right, or to sell to somebody
[02:03:49.500 --> 02:03:50.500]   else.
[02:03:50.500 --> 02:03:54.260]   So they're going to like, they're going to, they're creating like a, a lot of times
[02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:59.020]   they, they, they, um, it's, it's development's called like shell and core, which they, which
[02:03:59.020 --> 02:04:03.100]   I think I'm using that correctly, but, um, where they basically don't even like finish
[02:04:03.100 --> 02:04:04.100]   the inside.
[02:04:04.100 --> 02:04:06.340]   It's all just like rod open studs and everything like that.
[02:04:06.340 --> 02:04:10.820]   And some in the tenant comes in and does whatever they want to the space, but they're basically
[02:04:10.820 --> 02:04:16.620]   in the business of creating like usable space for some given class of market that they're
[02:04:16.620 --> 02:04:17.620]   trying to attack.
[02:04:17.620 --> 02:04:18.620]   Right.
[02:04:18.620 --> 02:04:21.740]   They're not in the business of, of, of making fancy architecture.
[02:04:21.740 --> 02:04:23.700]   Same if you're buying a single family home, right?
[02:04:23.700 --> 02:04:27.700]   You come in with blank walls and you put up all your different pictures that you want
[02:04:27.700 --> 02:04:32.300]   and different, uh, you know, decorations and paint it however you want and add your funky
[02:04:32.300 --> 02:04:34.300]   wallpaper or whatever.
[02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:36.620]   And then when you move, you can take all that stuff out.
[02:04:36.620 --> 02:04:39.260]   The next person can come in and put everything that they want.
[02:04:39.260 --> 02:04:44.620]   So it's just, I think to some extent you see like a decoupling of the aesthetic design
[02:04:44.620 --> 02:04:46.260]   from the building itself.
[02:04:46.260 --> 02:04:47.260]   Okay.
[02:04:47.260 --> 02:04:52.380]   So then this is really a revealed preference about the people who are actually renting
[02:04:52.380 --> 02:04:56.740]   or buying these properties that like people, so actually people who are living there actually
[02:04:56.740 --> 02:04:58.780]   don't want this kind of interior design maybe.
[02:04:58.780 --> 02:04:59.780]   Yeah.
[02:04:59.780 --> 02:05:04.420]   I think again, it comes back to a little bit about like a question of like aesthetic style
[02:05:04.420 --> 02:05:10.020]   and just like, do people like want a lot of ornamentation and, uh, you know, fundamental
[02:05:10.020 --> 02:05:11.020]   attractiveness.
[02:05:11.020 --> 02:05:16.580]   Cause again, people do focus a lot on like making these spaces like attractive and a
[02:05:16.580 --> 02:05:20.220]   lot of times they do that by like having like big and nice and open, a lot of natural light
[02:05:20.220 --> 02:05:23.900]   and like a cool, you know, glass staircase or whatever that goes from here to there.
[02:05:23.900 --> 02:05:29.900]   People like the new, you know, somebody pointing to the, uh, the new, um, Google headquarters,
[02:05:29.900 --> 02:05:34.380]   not, I don't know how new it is, but on the, on the newer side, basically it's like, yeah,
[02:05:34.380 --> 02:05:38.980]   this big, big giant, like, you know, dome type thing with a lot of like structural detail
[02:05:38.980 --> 02:05:42.660]   visible and a lot of like, yeah, just lots of like coming into this big, giant open space,
[02:05:42.660 --> 02:05:46.660]   a lot of like interesting staircases and kind of kind of stuff like that.
[02:05:46.660 --> 02:05:52.620]   So in some extent, it's just like a style with like less ornamentation necessarily than
[02:05:52.620 --> 02:05:56.380]   like bad aesthetics per se.
[02:05:56.380 --> 02:05:57.700]   Okay.
[02:05:57.700 --> 02:05:58.700]   Gotcha.
[02:05:58.700 --> 02:06:05.020]   The other theories that are out there about this emphasize more the cultural and aesthetic
[02:06:05.020 --> 02:06:09.700]   changes rather than the actual practical necessities of these kinds of changes that you've talked
[02:06:09.700 --> 02:06:10.700]   about.
[02:06:10.700 --> 02:06:16.660]   So one theory is that if you look at the change in men's clothing over the last two centuries,
[02:06:16.660 --> 02:06:21.580]   it's become also much more minimalistic and much less colorful and ornamental, right?
[02:06:21.580 --> 02:06:26.780]   So if you look at, you know, a King Louie or something, he's like wearing a suit with
[02:06:26.780 --> 02:06:31.420]   all of these studded colors and dyes and even gems and stuff.
[02:06:31.420 --> 02:06:35.540]   And if you look at like a picture of Joe Biden, you know, he's just wearing a suit, not even
[02:06:35.540 --> 02:06:36.540]   a tie anymore, right?
[02:06:36.540 --> 02:06:38.660]   It's just a black suit and a white shirt.
[02:06:38.660 --> 02:06:44.820]   So this is a continuation of this sort of aesthetic trend towards being very minimalistic.
[02:06:44.820 --> 02:06:45.820]   What's your reaction to that?
[02:06:45.820 --> 02:06:46.820]   Yeah.
[02:06:46.820 --> 02:06:52.540]   I mean, I think that's true to like some extent, this is one of the difficulties having a conversation
[02:06:52.540 --> 02:06:57.820]   like that is that there's so many like degrees of freedom, it's hard to pin down, you know,
[02:06:57.820 --> 02:07:00.900]   what specifically you're talking about, what class of things you're specifically talking
[02:07:00.900 --> 02:07:01.900]   about.
[02:07:01.900 --> 02:07:04.860]   Like if you're talking about, you know, if you look at like an example from fashions,
[02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:09.500]   if you look at like streetwear or something like that, if you just Google streetwear or
[02:07:09.500 --> 02:07:16.020]   something like that, you will find a ton of pictures of like really sort of quite ornate,
[02:07:16.020 --> 02:07:17.020]   interesting clothing.
[02:07:17.020 --> 02:07:20.540]   It's not, you know, there will be some stuff that's minimalist, but there will be a lot
[02:07:20.540 --> 02:07:24.220]   that's like not necessarily minimalist at all.
[02:07:24.220 --> 02:07:32.140]   So yeah, I, you know, it's, I don't, I guess I get, I guess in some way I disagree with
[02:07:32.140 --> 02:07:33.140]   the premise.
[02:07:33.140 --> 02:07:37.460]   I mean, if you're talking about like some like elite counter signaling thing, like,
[02:07:37.460 --> 02:07:43.420]   you know, it's so easy and cheap to make like ornate colorful clothing that it's not like
[02:07:43.420 --> 02:07:44.420]   a signal of status anymore.
[02:07:44.420 --> 02:07:48.180]   So you have to counter signal by like a very simple clothing, you know, maybe there's something,
[02:07:48.180 --> 02:07:53.340]   you know, to that, but that's like a different thing than like, why are things ugly in general,
[02:07:53.340 --> 02:07:54.340]   right?
[02:07:54.340 --> 02:07:59.340]   One thing that people also talk about, uh, is the increasing cost of labor that now you
[02:07:59.340 --> 02:08:04.860]   can't hire people to spend the higher talented stonemasons to spend hours on every square
[02:08:04.860 --> 02:08:07.580]   foot of the outside of a building.
[02:08:07.580 --> 02:08:12.860]   So I was in India like six months ago and we went to New Delhi, uh, to visit this new
[02:08:12.860 --> 02:08:18.140]   temple that was built, the Swaminarayan Akshardham, I'm sure I mispronounced it, but, but anyway,
[02:08:18.140 --> 02:08:22.020]   so it's, it's this really intricate and cool design on the outside.
[02:08:22.020 --> 02:08:30.980]   It just covered in these hand-carved stones with like these intricate idols and different
[02:08:30.980 --> 02:08:36.700]   images and, you know, it's really cool, but I think it took like tens of thousands of
[02:08:36.700 --> 02:08:42.220]   hours, probably way more and like thousands of workers and stonemasons to actually construct
[02:08:42.220 --> 02:08:43.220]   that.
[02:08:43.220 --> 02:08:48.700]   Um, which is obviously not going to be very feasible economically in a Western country.
[02:08:48.700 --> 02:08:52.340]   So one theory is just that we don't, you know, just too expensive to do that kind of stuff
[02:08:52.340 --> 02:08:53.340]   anymore.
[02:08:53.340 --> 02:08:55.540]   You need to do something that doesn't require as much manpower.
[02:08:55.540 --> 02:08:56.540]   Yeah.
[02:08:56.540 --> 02:09:02.900]   I mean, I think there's, there's, that's definitely gotta be part of the story, right?
[02:09:02.900 --> 02:09:06.980]   I mean, you know, construction as we know is not really gotten any cheaper, but it also
[02:09:06.980 --> 02:09:09.020]   hasn't gotten more expensive, right?
[02:09:09.020 --> 02:09:13.620]   Like a lot of this other, basically things that are pure labor, like other services,
[02:09:13.620 --> 02:09:14.620]   right?
[02:09:14.620 --> 02:09:18.340]   Like medical care, education, stuff like that, which has gotten more expensive.
[02:09:18.340 --> 02:09:23.900]   And part of the, part of that is probably because we've found ways to like pull labor
[02:09:23.900 --> 02:09:24.900]   out of the process.
[02:09:24.900 --> 02:09:29.220]   So, so construction only rises at the rate of inflation instead of faster than the rate
[02:09:29.220 --> 02:09:30.220]   of inflation.
[02:09:30.220 --> 02:09:35.580]   Um, and yeah, so like super labor intensive things like masonry that just, you know, gets
[02:09:35.580 --> 02:09:36.580]   done anymore.
[02:09:36.580 --> 02:09:41.500]   And there's probably like a vicious cycle there where, you know, you hire less of it.
[02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:43.980]   And so there's fewer masons available.
[02:09:43.980 --> 02:09:49.780]   And so they get more expensive and it, you know, the skill gets more scarce and now it's
[02:09:49.780 --> 02:09:55.060]   to hire someone to do like really ornate masonry work in the U S is probably really difficult
[02:09:55.060 --> 02:09:56.420]   to like even find them.
[02:09:56.420 --> 02:09:59.100]   I'm sure they exist, but it's probably not trivial.
[02:09:59.100 --> 02:10:03.540]   And if you're like, you know, have your schedule, you're trying to meet, it's not super straightforward.
[02:10:03.540 --> 02:10:08.020]   Uh, it's an example of this is, uh, I can't remember if we talked about this in part one
[02:10:08.020 --> 02:10:14.980]   or not, but the Isijinu temple in Japan, which is this temple complex that they've been like,
[02:10:14.980 --> 02:10:18.900]   uh, it gets like torn down and rebuilt every 20 years.
[02:10:18.900 --> 02:10:24.180]   And they've been doing, and they've been doing this for, uh, like 1300 years or something
[02:10:24.180 --> 02:10:25.180]   like that.
[02:10:25.180 --> 02:10:30.820]   Um, so it's using like 1300 year old, uh, construction techniques, like, you know, fast
[02:10:30.820 --> 02:10:34.020]   grooves and like particular woodworking methods or whatever.
[02:10:34.020 --> 02:10:38.980]   Uh, and it's now like quite difficult for them to find a lot of these skills, right?
[02:10:38.980 --> 02:10:42.260]   There's just not that many roof thatchers around anymore.
[02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:48.420]   Um, it's so, you know, again, I can imagine that like, you know, it's a, it was some sort
[02:10:48.420 --> 02:10:51.540]   of a, a, a similar cycle with like, with like masonry.
[02:10:51.540 --> 02:10:56.820]   Um, I don't think that's like the whole story because a lot of these, like, a lot of these
[02:10:56.820 --> 02:11:02.060]   like things do like are kind of built in a way that like make buildings, um, a lot of
[02:11:02.060 --> 02:11:05.380]   this like minimalist style, it's actually quite expensive to do.
[02:11:05.380 --> 02:11:09.980]   You know, a glass curtain wall is actually really expensive to, to build on a building
[02:11:09.980 --> 02:11:13.820]   because it lets in so much, because glass is just expensive by itself.
[02:11:13.820 --> 02:11:18.580]   And because it lets in so much light and it gets so hot and you need so much more, uh,
[02:11:18.580 --> 02:11:21.940]   you know, so many, so much, a more expensive mechanical system to keep it cool.
[02:11:21.940 --> 02:11:26.300]   And, but you've talked, uh, I've talked to architects like, why do the owners love these,
[02:11:26.300 --> 02:11:27.300]   you know, glass curtain walls?
[02:11:27.300 --> 02:11:30.660]   It seems like, especially for like now where like everyone is like really concerned about
[02:11:30.660 --> 02:11:36.020]   like climate change and, uh, you know, greenhouse emissions of your, uh, whatever it is, your,
[02:11:36.020 --> 02:11:37.020]   your, your building.
[02:11:37.020 --> 02:11:40.540]   People like, yeah, they, you know, they just really owners just really love this all glass
[02:11:40.540 --> 02:11:43.900]   look and they're willing to sort of pay extra to get it.
[02:11:43.900 --> 02:11:47.420]   And if you look like the very early, this is the sort of style of construction where
[02:11:47.420 --> 02:11:52.380]   you just have a big glass facade, it's called for like a skyscraper, it's called the international
[02:11:52.380 --> 02:11:53.380]   style.
[02:11:53.380 --> 02:11:58.500]   Uh, and you see like early international style skyscrapers, they were actually quite expensive,
[02:11:58.500 --> 02:12:02.180]   um, more expensive than the traditional way of, of building.
[02:12:02.180 --> 02:12:07.380]   But again, you know, the, the people who were like building it really liked the aesthetic.
[02:12:07.380 --> 02:12:11.300]   And again, it gave you some other options in terms of like light on the inside or whatever.
[02:12:11.300 --> 02:12:14.540]   So it was, they decided that it was, that it was worth it.
[02:12:14.540 --> 02:12:19.820]   So I think, yeah, that's, that's definitely probably part of the story, but again, it's,
[02:12:19.820 --> 02:12:24.420]   I think definitely doesn't seem like it can be, it can be all of it.
[02:12:24.420 --> 02:12:25.420]   Gotcha.
[02:12:25.420 --> 02:12:26.420]   Okay.
[02:12:26.420 --> 02:12:27.420]   Yeah.
[02:12:27.420 --> 02:12:29.300]   To the extent that it is part of the story, somebody left an interesting comment on one
[02:12:29.300 --> 02:12:34.580]   of Scott Alexander's posts on this, uh, thing about, you know, how modern construction looks
[02:12:34.580 --> 02:12:35.980]   different than older construction.
[02:12:35.980 --> 02:12:42.100]   Uh, so this is a comment from fluffy Buffalo, he writes, or he or she writes, I think new
[02:12:42.100 --> 02:12:49.180]   technology should help a lot with 3d painters, CNC machines, robots, CAD, and AI.
[02:12:49.180 --> 02:12:54.300]   It shouldn't be too hard to come up with a way to produce eye-pleasing ornaments, murals,
[02:12:54.300 --> 02:12:56.540]   and building shapes at a reasonable price.
[02:12:56.540 --> 02:12:59.980]   And then they go on, but no one is doing it because the current crop of architects can
[02:12:59.980 --> 02:13:02.700]   apparently only think in steel, concrete, and glass.
[02:13:02.700 --> 02:13:06.660]   So do, uh, how plausible do you think this is?
[02:13:06.660 --> 02:13:07.660]   Yeah.
[02:13:07.660 --> 02:13:12.700]   So, I mean, that, what kind of, that makes me think of, and I think I read some of the
[02:13:12.700 --> 02:13:17.900]   comments on this, on that post, and I think one of the people mentioned that, but like,
[02:13:17.900 --> 02:13:24.580]   yeah, the, the, the Victorian style of house basically came about because of, uh, mass
[02:13:24.580 --> 02:13:30.660]   production methods, which made like really ornate wood decorations to, you know, you
[02:13:30.660 --> 02:13:34.260]   could make those like really, really cheaply, just like they were just cranked out on some
[02:13:34.260 --> 02:13:37.620]   milling machine in a factory somewhere, and then you could just buy them and it's able
[02:13:37.620 --> 02:13:39.260]   to move to your house or whatever.
[02:13:39.260 --> 02:13:44.700]   And so that, that style is basically a function of technology, making that cheaper.
[02:13:44.700 --> 02:13:49.620]   And then of course you don't, you know, that was in style for a while, it's not in style
[02:13:49.620 --> 02:13:54.580]   anymore, uh, for, um, you know, shifting, the shifting sands of aesthetics, but also
[02:13:54.580 --> 02:13:58.980]   I think part of it is that, and this is, I think more broadly applicable, it's actually
[02:13:58.980 --> 02:14:04.540]   kind of a hassle to have all this like ornamentation all over your house or whatever.
[02:14:04.540 --> 02:14:10.380]   Um, on the inside, it's just lots and lots of stuff to like dust and keep clean or whatever,
[02:14:10.380 --> 02:14:12.200]   which again, comes back to cost disease.
[02:14:12.200 --> 02:14:16.460]   If you have servants to do that for you, it's fine, but if you don't have servants, it's
[02:14:16.460 --> 02:14:22.000]   you, it's creates a lot of extra work for you, um, same on the exterior, but then also
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:27.780]   there is the issue that in general, you want your building to like shed water and, you
[02:14:27.780 --> 02:14:29.820]   know, direct it away from the house as possible.
[02:14:29.820 --> 02:14:34.460]   If you have a lot of like little nooks and crannies and ornamentation stuff for water
[02:14:34.460 --> 02:14:38.100]   to collect, that's pretty bad from a durability perspective.
[02:14:38.100 --> 02:14:44.100]   Um, I don't think, I would be careful not to index over index on that because obviously
[02:14:44.100 --> 02:14:49.980]   you can build like extra and people can and people did build like extremely durable, beautiful
[02:14:49.980 --> 02:14:52.060]   masonry brick buildings are right.
[02:14:52.060 --> 02:14:56.180]   It's not like that makes it impossible, but it is something to like, as we consider, uh,
[02:14:56.180 --> 02:15:02.460]   that it does on the margin, probably make your maintenance costs, um, go up.
[02:15:02.460 --> 02:15:03.460]   Okay.
[02:15:03.460 --> 02:15:07.980]   So, uh, are you optimistic overall, maybe not with these specific technologies, but
[02:15:07.980 --> 02:15:13.100]   just, and maybe not with, you know, having or ornamentation or something, but do you
[02:15:13.100 --> 02:15:18.780]   think that in a hundred years, the technology would enable like construction of buildings
[02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:25.420]   that look prettier than, uh, modern buildings, but, uh, and also are more maintainable, um,
[02:15:25.420 --> 02:15:30.620]   or at least as maintainable, or is it basically going to be steel and glass towers for the
[02:15:30.620 --> 02:15:33.380]   time of, or, you know, the upcoming future?
[02:15:33.380 --> 02:15:34.380]   Yeah.
[02:15:34.380 --> 02:15:35.380]   That's a, that's a good question.
[02:15:35.380 --> 02:15:36.940]   Um, there's a lot of enthusiasm.
[02:15:36.940 --> 02:15:41.660]   Some of it is like architecture and so we'll see how well it actually gets adopted, but
[02:15:41.660 --> 02:15:48.460]   for like more, um, timber, you know, large, tall, you know, tall buildings, uh, heavy
[02:15:48.460 --> 02:15:50.060]   timber elements.
[02:15:50.060 --> 02:15:53.460]   I don't know if that will get, you know, partially it's like an aesthetic thing.
[02:15:53.460 --> 02:15:59.140]   Partially it's, uh, you know, the carbon, if you, from a carbon perspective, right.
[02:15:59.140 --> 02:16:04.380]   It's, uh, using a lot of timber versus steel or concrete is like way, way better on, uh,
[02:16:04.380 --> 02:16:05.380]   on that calculus.
[02:16:05.380 --> 02:16:07.220]   Um, and it does kind of look nice.
[02:16:07.220 --> 02:16:10.820]   A lot of the, like, you know, a lot of these like, um, tech companies are building like
[02:16:10.820 --> 02:16:15.500]   these ornate timber offices, um, and stuff like that.
[02:16:15.500 --> 02:16:22.020]   So that's like one trend and then kind of, um, yeah, I, I, I kinda, I, there's not like
[02:16:22.020 --> 02:16:27.900]   an obvious technology that could like usurp like the sort of standard out we have, you
[02:16:27.900 --> 02:16:33.200]   know, unless it's, unless it's like a, uh, a dramatic development is like material science
[02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:38.620]   or whatever, or somebody finds some way of building something that's, uh, you know, it's,
[02:16:38.620 --> 02:16:42.060]   it's way cheaper and gives you like way more options than you had before.
[02:16:42.060 --> 02:16:45.460]   Like, that's, you know, what like steel and then like concrete gave you, right.
[02:16:45.460 --> 02:16:50.300]   All of a sudden you could build things in ways that you couldn't do it before steel,
[02:16:50.300 --> 02:16:55.380]   because you could use so much less structure to build pine and, uh, concrete because it
[02:16:55.380 --> 02:16:56.380]   was like liquids.
[02:16:56.380 --> 02:16:58.900]   So you could make it, you could all of a sudden make any shape that you want.
[02:16:58.900 --> 02:17:05.540]   And that's when you get all these like really cool, interesting shells and, uh, you know,
[02:17:05.540 --> 02:17:10.540]   really ornate concrete domes, stuff like that, which of course we also don't build anymore.
[02:17:10.540 --> 02:17:15.460]   So I don't, I don't see like an obvious, like technology to kind of replace that.
[02:17:15.460 --> 02:17:19.260]   And then I guess, you know, the other thing is like, did the, you know, did the, when
[02:17:19.260 --> 02:17:24.940]   all of a sudden you had technology that could like easily duplicate or make any sort of
[02:17:24.940 --> 02:17:26.900]   art possible, right.
[02:17:26.900 --> 02:17:33.500]   Did that all, did that usher in a new era of like way better art or like 2d aesthetics?
[02:17:33.500 --> 02:17:37.500]   I don't necessarily think, I don't necessarily think that it did.
[02:17:37.500 --> 02:17:38.500]   Right.
[02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:42.860]   Um, so I think if you could all of a sudden build any sort of shape that you want cheaply
[02:17:42.860 --> 02:17:47.460]   and easily, it's, you know, it's, uh, it's not, it's not obvious to me that that would
[02:17:47.460 --> 02:17:49.860]   all of a sudden, okay, now we can get like really cool things.
[02:17:49.860 --> 02:17:53.340]   I'm sure you would see like a lot of interesting experiments on the, on the margin or whatever,
[02:17:53.340 --> 02:17:57.860]   but it's not obvious to me that like the standard way of building in some ways that might become
[02:17:57.860 --> 02:17:59.260]   even like less interesting.
[02:17:59.260 --> 02:18:00.260]   Right.
[02:18:00.260 --> 02:18:04.820]   So there is the question of why we haven't seen in these other fields, better aesthetics.
[02:18:04.820 --> 02:18:10.740]   So given how much you can do with artistic, like the traditional art today, why do these
[02:18:10.740 --> 02:18:14.540]   like bill of paintings that are selling for millions of dollars look like, you know, there's
[02:18:14.540 --> 02:18:18.900]   a, obviously the, the common perception and stereotype about them is that they're very
[02:18:18.900 --> 02:18:21.540]   like simple and ugly.
[02:18:21.540 --> 02:18:26.040]   And that to, so to apply that to architecture and engineering, there's this idea that Scott
[02:18:26.040 --> 02:18:30.620]   Alexander kind of talked about this a lot in his post that there's this like cabal of
[02:18:30.620 --> 02:18:36.140]   modernist architects in these guilds who are just like very obsessed with building these
[02:18:36.140 --> 02:18:39.100]   buildings that the public doesn't like to look at.
[02:18:39.100 --> 02:18:42.500]   Given your exposure to the industry, do you think that's true that like the architects
[02:18:42.500 --> 02:18:46.980]   are just have a completely different sense of aesthetics than the average public?
[02:18:46.980 --> 02:18:51.780]   I think there's probably something to that in like where like you go to architecture
[02:18:51.780 --> 02:18:56.540]   school and architecture school is like adjacent to art school.
[02:18:56.540 --> 02:18:57.620]   Right.
[02:18:57.620 --> 02:19:00.820]   And you learn like, you know, how to design buildings or whatever, but you also learn
[02:19:00.820 --> 02:19:04.380]   like a specific way of looking and thinking at them about them.
[02:19:04.380 --> 02:19:08.380]   And that like filters down into like how you design your building, something like that.
[02:19:08.380 --> 02:19:13.540]   But I think architects are, you know, again, they are competing in a marketplace and the
[02:19:13.540 --> 02:19:19.140]   vast majority of them who are not architects are basically trying to having to deliver
[02:19:19.140 --> 02:19:23.420]   that buildings that owners like ought and like, and are happy with.
[02:19:23.420 --> 02:19:26.140]   And if they don't do that, they're going to go out of business.
[02:19:26.140 --> 02:19:32.100]   I think, I think most architects you will talk to will basically say, yeah, I don't
[02:19:32.100 --> 02:19:33.980]   give the owner like a building that he's happy with.
[02:19:33.980 --> 02:19:35.980]   I am not doing my job correctly.
[02:19:35.980 --> 02:19:40.540]   And they're definitely, you know, they're being hired for like, there's among many other
[02:19:40.540 --> 02:19:43.620]   things that are like sense of taste, right.
[02:19:43.620 --> 02:19:47.300]   Perhaps there's that, you know, part of the story, it's like a fragment or whatever, but
[02:19:47.300 --> 02:19:50.980]   I think it's, would be very easy to over index.
[02:19:50.980 --> 02:19:53.300]   And I think there's a lot of ways that's not true.
[02:19:53.300 --> 02:19:54.300]   Okay.
[02:19:54.300 --> 02:19:55.300]   Okay.
[02:19:55.300 --> 02:19:56.300]   Okay.
[02:19:56.300 --> 02:19:58.660]   So I'm really glad we got a chance to cover this topic.
[02:19:58.660 --> 02:20:01.820]   And I appreciate all those explanations.
[02:20:01.820 --> 02:20:05.100]   But actually, there's one question that I didn't get, I didn't forgot to ask you last
[02:20:05.100 --> 02:20:10.260]   time that I'm curious about your opinion on is, let's say somebody listens to the conversation
[02:20:10.260 --> 02:20:15.980]   and, or they've been a follower of your blog and this has got them interested in engineering.
[02:20:15.980 --> 02:20:20.260]   Somebody may be in like high school or maybe early in college or something for them to
[02:20:20.260 --> 02:20:26.180]   be able to do cool things in these fields in the future, what kind of training and career
[02:20:26.180 --> 02:20:31.140]   advice would you give them that they should pursue to be like, get involved and innovate
[02:20:31.140 --> 02:20:32.140]   in these fields?
[02:20:32.140 --> 02:20:33.140]   Hmm.
[02:20:33.140 --> 02:20:34.140]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[02:20:34.140 --> 02:20:40.140]   I, I don't have a super good answer that I fell into it very much, very much on accident.
[02:20:40.140 --> 02:20:46.660]   I was, you know, I spent the very large chunk of my career just doing, you know, pretty
[02:20:46.660 --> 02:20:49.380]   standard work a day engineering type stuff.
[02:20:49.380 --> 02:20:53.740]   And then I sort of fell ass backwards into a job at a construction startup.
[02:20:53.740 --> 02:20:58.740]   And then that is sort of led me, led me to, to, to other places.
[02:20:58.740 --> 02:21:04.620]   Um, I guess, yeah, if you're an engineer, like go to a good, I, I, I feel sort of gross
[02:21:04.620 --> 02:21:09.980]   giving this answer, um, because in general, you know, go to a good engineering school,
[02:21:09.980 --> 02:21:16.300]   you're, you know, perpetuating the college industrial complex, but, um, you know, people
[02:21:16.300 --> 02:21:21.220]   do really care about that, especially like in, in sort of the fields of, you know, building
[02:21:21.220 --> 02:21:22.660]   engineering that I'm more familiar with.
[02:21:22.660 --> 02:21:25.260]   They do care about that, uh, quite a bit.
[02:21:25.260 --> 02:21:29.420]   I went to a reasonably good engineering school and that probably opened doors for me that
[02:21:29.420 --> 02:21:31.900]   it would not have, um, otherwise.
[02:21:31.900 --> 02:21:38.460]   Um, so yeah, go to a, you know, go to a good engineering school, go to like a lot of like
[02:21:38.460 --> 02:21:42.780]   the status indicators, uh, that are like very obvious, like go to a good engineering school
[02:21:42.780 --> 02:21:46.060]   and go to like a, you know, a top tier firm, whatever that does kind of matter.
[02:21:46.060 --> 02:21:51.060]   Uh, people do pay attention to those things, you know, matter, quote, unquote, uh, it matters
[02:21:51.060 --> 02:21:55.140]   in the sense that people pay attention to those things in like the building development
[02:21:55.140 --> 02:21:56.140]   world.
[02:21:56.140 --> 02:21:59.980]   And then if you, you know, if you went to MIT or, you know, Caltech, and then you had
[02:21:59.980 --> 02:22:04.900]   a, you know, an internship, it's, you know, Skidmore, Ode, Merrill or whatever, that's
[02:22:04.900 --> 02:22:08.820]   going to open quite a few doors for you.
[02:22:08.820 --> 02:22:13.940]   Um, I'm not amazingly happy with that, with that answer.
[02:22:13.940 --> 02:22:16.900]   I do think that it is, uh, that it is true.
[02:22:16.900 --> 02:22:17.900]   Yeah.
[02:22:17.900 --> 02:22:22.100]   I, you know, another way would just be to try to, uh, come in from, you know, a more
[02:22:22.100 --> 02:22:27.700]   oblique angle, angle, focus on like, you know, software and stuff like that, and then work
[02:22:27.700 --> 02:22:30.620]   at one of the, you know, cause there's so many more startups and stuff that are now
[02:22:30.620 --> 02:22:35.140]   tackling the construction space, they're increasingly in need of like software developers and stuff
[02:22:35.140 --> 02:22:36.140]   like that.
[02:22:36.140 --> 02:22:40.980]   And that would be a, uh, probably a, a lower risk way to do it because it's probably, you
[02:22:40.980 --> 02:22:44.420]   know, you don't need to necessarily go to a fancy school to become a software developer.
[02:22:44.420 --> 02:22:49.220]   And then if he doesn't work out, you can just go get a job at a fine company and make $600,000
[02:22:49.220 --> 02:22:50.220]   a year.
[02:22:50.220 --> 02:22:51.220]   Yeah.
[02:22:51.220 --> 02:22:56.140]   See, look at, look and see how like the startups, um, in the, in the space are changing and
[02:22:56.140 --> 02:22:57.140]   growing.
[02:22:57.140 --> 02:23:01.900]   And by the time some folks got out, the, the building space might look, uh, pretty different
[02:23:01.900 --> 02:23:08.180]   in technology and software stuff is like kind of slowly forcing its way in there a lot more.
[02:23:08.180 --> 02:23:09.180]   Okay.
[02:23:09.180 --> 02:23:14.980]   Um, but then, so if they want to transition from just like being an engineer to working
[02:23:14.980 --> 02:23:20.380]   on the forefront stuff that you write and talk about, is working at a startup the ideal
[02:23:20.380 --> 02:23:21.380]   way to do that?
[02:23:21.380 --> 02:23:22.380]   Oh, that's a good question.
[02:23:22.380 --> 02:23:26.980]   Um, there's a lot of, there's a lot of, yeah, I think there's, there's a lot of
[02:23:26.980 --> 02:23:30.740]   startups that are doing, yeah, really interesting stuff, not just in software, but like a lot
[02:23:30.740 --> 02:23:31.740]   of, yeah.
[02:23:31.740 --> 02:23:33.780]   Interesting building technology stuff.
[02:23:33.780 --> 02:23:37.380]   Uh, a lot of, you know, there's a lot of like green building stuff that has worked.
[02:23:37.380 --> 02:23:41.700]   There's a workout that is being developed, uh, folks working on like low carbon concrete
[02:23:41.700 --> 02:23:43.380]   and there's like low carbon steels.
[02:23:43.380 --> 02:23:44.380]   Yeah.
[02:23:44.380 --> 02:23:50.100]   There's a lot of stuff doing like construction robotics, a lot of like prefab stuff.
[02:23:50.100 --> 02:23:53.460]   Startup world is really kind of trying to start to eat the, um, uh, the construction
[02:23:53.460 --> 02:23:54.460]   world.
[02:23:54.460 --> 02:23:55.460]   And there's like a lot of.
[02:23:55.460 --> 02:23:56.460]   Opportunities there.
[02:23:56.460 --> 02:24:00.740]   So, you know, very broadly, I would say I see a lot of innovation happening.
[02:24:00.740 --> 02:24:05.700]   So I think that's a good place to sort of look and see what's, uh, what's going on.
[02:24:05.700 --> 02:24:06.700]   Awesome.
[02:24:06.700 --> 02:24:07.700]   Okay.
[02:24:07.700 --> 02:24:09.820]   Well, Brian, thank you so much for coming back a second time.
[02:24:09.820 --> 02:24:11.420]   Uh, I really appreciate it.
[02:24:11.420 --> 02:24:15.620]   And I'm glad we got a chance to talk about these, uh, talk about this question because
[02:24:15.620 --> 02:24:19.220]   it is very interesting and it's good to get an actual engineer's perspective on it so
[02:24:19.220 --> 02:24:22.340]   that we're not just doing like cultural theory and we actually understand the practicalities
[02:24:22.340 --> 02:24:25.180]   of what's involved in, um, all those kinds of things.
[02:24:25.180 --> 02:24:27.460]   Okay, Brian, this was super fascinating.
[02:24:27.460 --> 02:24:34.020]   I highly recommend people check out your blog, which you can find@constructionphysics.substack.com
[02:24:34.020 --> 02:24:36.420]   and they can also follow you on Twitter.
[02:24:36.420 --> 02:24:38.500]   We'll leave the handle in the description.
[02:24:38.500 --> 02:24:41.220]   Anything else you would like to plug or say at the end?
[02:24:41.220 --> 02:24:42.220]   Uh, yeah, I do.
[02:24:42.220 --> 02:24:46.780]   Uh, I'm doing some work for the Institute for Progress, which is a think tank designed
[02:24:46.780 --> 02:24:51.940]   to, uh, advance industrial progress and progress studies ideas more generally.
[02:24:51.940 --> 02:24:53.620]   So you should check them out as well.
[02:24:53.620 --> 02:24:54.620]   Okay.
