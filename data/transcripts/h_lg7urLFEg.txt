[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   - How does serotonin have adequate levels of serotonin?
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.480]   - Having adequate levels of serotonin
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.160]   is absolutely critical for people depressed,
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.880]   as well as people who are not depressed,
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.440]   to feel a sense of wellbeing,
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.120]   just overall sense of wellbeing,
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.520]   being okay with who they are and where life is at,
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.400]   being able to lean into effort and all these things.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.720]   It's absolutely critical that we have adequate levels
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.700]   of serotonin in the brain.
[00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.340]   Now, you may have heard, and it is absolutely true,
[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.080]   that 90% of the serotonin manufactured in your body
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.560]   is in the gut.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.500]   Now, what you don't often hear
[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.580]   is that serotonin stays in the gut, right?
[00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.160]   We hear these days, oh, you know,
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.060]   most of your serotonin is manufactured in your gut,
[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.200]   which has given millions of people the false impression
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.820]   that if you get your gut serotonin right,
[00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.580]   somehow it's traveling up to your brain
[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.220]   and performing all the important roles
[00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.860]   that serotonin plays in your brain.
[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.080]   That's not how it works at all.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.220]   Fortunately, however, there are ways
[00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.460]   that you can modify the levels of serotonin in your gut,
[00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.420]   and indeed the levels of serotonin in your gut powerfully impact
[00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.320]   the levels of serotonin in your brain.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.760]   And this occurs, you guessed it, by way of the vagus.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.220]   It's a super cool mechanism,
[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.460]   and it's one that you can exert some positive control over,
[00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.800]   in order to, for instance, increase your baseline levels
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.100]   of mood in order to increase levels of serotonin,
[00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.760]   if that's something that you seek.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.240]   Here's the pathway and the mechanism,
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.300]   and I'm going to provide this in kind of top contour form.
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.060]   In the future, I'll do an entire episode about serotonin,
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.000]   but here's the idea.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.700]   In your gut, you have cells, including neurons,
[00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.200]   but you also have a lot of other cells,
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.200]   mostly other cells, frankly.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.540]   And there's a particular category of cells
[00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.900]   called the enterochromafin cells.
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.860]   You don't need to know that name,
[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.780]   but if you want, they're the enterochromafin cells,
[00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.500]   and they manufacture serotonin.
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.440]   They do that through a beautiful pathway
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.380]   involving an enzymatic reaction
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.580]   that converts tryptophan from the food you eat,
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.080]   tryptophan's an amino acid,
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.240]   gets converted eventually into serotonin.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.300]   There are a bunch of steps in there in the biochemistry,
[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.980]   gets converted into serotonin.
[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.900]   That serotonin binds to the ends of neurons,
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.980]   the axons of neurons in the vagus nerve
[00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.800]   that innervate your gut, not just your stomach,
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.980]   but your large intestine and your small intestine.
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.860]   Remember, those sensory afferents,
[00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.760]   those sensory axons that extend into the body
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.540]   have receptors on them, right?
[00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.380]   The serotonin in the gut,
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.780]   assuming you're getting enough tryptophan,
[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.900]   and assuming the milieu of your gut is correct,
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.780]   we'll talk about what that means
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.180]   and how you can exert control over it,
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.840]   get the milieu right,
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.960]   that serotonin binds to the ends of those axons in the gut
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.880]   and stimulates a particular category of them
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.040]   that then relays the signal up and through nodos ganglion,
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.940]   you now are familiar with these names,
[00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.660]   up into the brain to the nucleus tractus solitaris,
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.960]   okay, that NTS again,
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.520]   and then the nucleus tractus solitaris,
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.400]   doesn't just communicate with locus coeruleus
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.400]   and with nucleus basalis,
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.520]   it also sends a powerful signal
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.660]   to what's called the dorsal raphe nucleus.
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.460]   The dorsal raphe nucleus in your brain
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.280]   is responsible for the release
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.320]   of the majority of the serotonin in your brain.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.120]   So when you hear that most of the serotonin in your body
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.000]   is made in your gut,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.600]   that's true and it stays in your gut,
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.020]   but the levels of serotonin are communicated
[00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.880]   to the brain by the vagus
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.200]   and then stimulates the release of serotonin
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.380]   from the dorsal raphe nucleus.
[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.760]   So the question therefore becomes,
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.920]   if we want to increase levels of serotonin in the brain
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.080]   or simply to maintain healthy levels of serotonin in the brain
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.220]   for somebody who's not depressed
[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.800]   or maybe somebody who's having low mood,
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.620]   just to keep elevated levels of mood
[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.780]   and proper levels of serotonin overall,
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.380]   because it's involved in lots of things, not just mood,
[00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.800]   we need to make sure that we're getting adequate production
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.680]   of serotonin in the gut.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.400]   And again, adequate production of serotonin in the gut
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.900]   has a bunch of other positive effects
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.820]   on the immune system, on gut motility.
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.640]   In fact, having adequate levels of serotonin in the gut
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.900]   is powerfully associated with having a healthy gut
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.820]   and not having irritable gut.
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.520]   Irritable bowel syndrome is something that vexes many people.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.720]   You know, it might sound kind of funny
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.560]   to those of you that don't have,
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.120]   oh, you have an irritable bowel.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.500]   People with IBS, irritable bowel syndrome,
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.040]   oftentimes suffer tremendously.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.020]   They can't go out to dinner.
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.600]   They can't eat foods that other people offer them.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.880]   They'll eat a bunch of foods for a while and feel fine.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.160]   Then they feel terrible.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.880]   It's not just about having diarrhea.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.740]   Often they have a bunch of other gut issues
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.740]   and it's correlated with a bunch
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.400]   of other major problems over time.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.280]   We're going to do an entire episode about gut health
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.900]   as it relates to IBS.
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.840]   There are things that you can do to improve IBS.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.640]   One of them is to keep your,
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.280]   or get your gut levels of serotonin right.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.540]   How do you do that?
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.700]   Well, one way to do that is to make sure
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.380]   that the microbiota of your gut are healthy
[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.860]   and that they are diverse.
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.660]   The best way to do that,
[00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.820]   not using any kind of supplementation,
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.880]   is to make sure that you're ingesting one to four servings
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.600]   of low sugar fermented foods per day.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.220]   I've talked about this before on the podcast.
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.740]   This is based on beautiful data
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.900]   from my colleague, Justin Sonnenberg,
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.120]   and Christopher Gardner at Stanford,
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.320]   showed that the ingestion of one to four servings
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.420]   of low sugar fermented foods per day.
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.540]   So these would be things like kimchi, sauerkraut,
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.420]   again, low sugar.
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.180]   Look at the labels.
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.700]   This is the stuff that would need to be refrigerated.
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.440]   We're not talking about pickles kept on the non-refrigerated
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.020]   shelf and the non-refrigerated section of the grocery store,
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.100]   but rather the brine and the pickles
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.920]   that don't have a ton of sugar.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.640]   So the sour pickles, that is,
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.580]   that are kept in the refrigerator, things like kimchi,
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.520]   things like kombucha.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.900]   Keep in mind, some kombucha has alcohol.
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.180]   So keep that in mind if you're giving this to kids
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.020]   who shouldn't be ingesting alcohol.
[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.300]   Any adults probably shouldn't be ingesting alcohol.
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.600]   Kombucha has very little alcohol,
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.480]   but if you're an alcoholic
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.800]   and you're completely avoiding alcohol,
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.840]   you should know that.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.480]   Kombucha contains some alcohol.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.860]   Things like kefir, quality yogurts, low sugar yogurts.
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.000]   You can look up online,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.720]   what are different low sugar fermented foods?
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.600]   These things are going to improve the gut microbiota
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.380]   that in turn promote the production of serotonin,
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.560]   if and only if, this is important,
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.900]   if and only if there's also sufficient levels of tryptophan
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.420]   in your dietary intake.
[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.280]   So you're going to want to take a look at what you're eating
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.220]   and just through a simple online search,
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.840]   you can figure out whether or not
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.300]   you're getting sufficient levels of tryptophan.
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.280]   Many people are familiar with the idea,
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.240]   because it's true,
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.760]   that turkey contains high levels of tryptophan.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.740]   This is thought to be responsible
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.480]   for the post Thanksgiving dinner effect,
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.380]   although that's probably due to just eating a lot of food.
[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.340]   And when the gut is distended,
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.140]   the distension of the gut is communicated
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.780]   by mechanosensors up the vagus nerve sensory neurons
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.340]   and set in motion the so-called rest and digest,
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.300]   or I guess it would be like collapse and pass out.
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.860]   And in the case of Thanksgiving,
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.820]   collapse and pass out effect
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.400]   of having a lot of food in your gut,
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.420]   doesn't matter what the food is,
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.460]   but you're going to want to make sure
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.520]   that you're ingesting foods
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.220]   with sufficient levels of tryptophan.
[00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.260]   So dairy products will do that.
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.520]   White turkey meat will do that.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.560]   There are other foods that have tryptophan in them.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.060]   I'm not going to bother to list those off now.
[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.020]   You can simply look those up.
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.340]   So make sure you're getting enough tryptophan in your diet.
[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.180]   Make sure that you're getting
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.940]   enough low sugar fermented foods,
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.280]   or if you're not doing that,
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.560]   and perhaps even if you are,
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.640]   you might think about supplementing your diet
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.860]   with probiotic on occasion, right?
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.400]   I'm not talking about constantly taking
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.040]   high doses of probiotics.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.740]   I actually don't recommend that,
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.260]   but for many people who are suffering low mood,
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.080]   supplementing with a quality probiotic
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.640]   can actually improve mood.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.080]   And the purported mechanism by which that happens
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.880]   is the increase in serotonin that is allowed
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.920]   by improving the gut microbiota
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.660]   and including foods with enough tryptophan,
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.720]   which is the precursor to serotonin.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.460]   So what I've done here is I've created
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.340]   the real conceptual link, the anatomical link,
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.700]   and the chemical link between the production of serotonin
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.900]   in the gut and serotonin in the brain.
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.220]   And I wouldn't be talking about this
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.440]   if there wasn't actually data on this,
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.140]   I'll include links to a few papers about the,
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.820]   and here I'm quoting the title of a great paper,
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.940]   the interaction of the vagus nerve and serotonin
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.840]   in the gut brain axis.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.160]   There's also been at least one clinical trial study
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.140]   exploring how taking probiotics,
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:04.980]   and in this case,
[00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.920]   it was actually probiotics plus magnesium.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.900]   It was magnesium orotate,
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.720]   which is just one form of magnesium,
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.860]   as well as I would say a low-ish dose of coenzyme Q10.
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.580]   Combining those three things in this paper entitled,
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.780]   Probiotics and Magnesium Orotate,
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.580]   it should have said probiotics and Magnesium Orotate
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.580]   and coenzyme Q10,
[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.580]   but the title is Probiotics and Magnesium Orotate
[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.840]   for the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder,
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.780]   a Randomized Double Blind Control Trial.
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.780]   And I want to emphasize that the results of this paper show
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.580]   that in the short term,
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.540]   there's an improvement in symptoms of major depression.
[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.260]   That is symptoms of major depression were reduced
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:50.260]   through the administration of this combination of probiotics,
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.260]   magnesium orotate, and coenzyme Q10.
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.260]   However, it was a short-lived effect.
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.260]   Now, it was also a short-lived treatment,
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.260]   but it was a short-lived effect that showed up in the,
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260]   essentially starting about the four-week mark,
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.580]   and then carried out to 10 and 15 weeks,
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.060]   the effect disappeared.
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.300]   Now, this is important because what it suggests
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.900]   is that in the short-term,
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.040]   if you're seeking to improve your mood,
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.060]   or if you're suffering from major depression,
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.560]   please seek help for major depression.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.300]   This, of course, wouldn't be the only approach.
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.140]   You don't want to, you know,
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.860]   start being your own psychiatrist.
[00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.380]   This treatment very well could be combined with things,
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.660]   and should be combined probably with things like exercise,
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.140]   maybe with pharmacologic treatment,
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.400]   with antidepressant drugs.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.200]   It really depends on the situation.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.780]   But if you are somebody who's suffering
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.700]   from major depression or just mild depression,
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.120]   or if you're just seeking to maintain healthy serotonin levels,
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.200]   or improve your mood slightly,
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.180]   the consumption of things that are going to improve
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:51.260]   your gut microbiome absolutely is going to support that process.
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.800]   This has been shown over and over again,
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.780]   because the gut microbiota create these short chain fatty acids
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.680]   that are critically involved in this biochemical pathway
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.480]   that converts tryptophan into serotonin.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.680]   I'm going to repeat that because it's very important.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.920]   The microbiota of the gut,
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.000]   if they're diverse and you have enough of them,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.500]   are going to produce the short chain fatty acids
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.540]   that are critically required for the conversion of tryptophan,
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.620]   which again is going to come from your diet,
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.220]   into the serotonin of your gut,
[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.920]   which in turn is going to be relayed.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.980]   And it's not the actual serotonin that's relayed,
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.900]   but the presence of serotonin at sufficient levels in the gut
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.200]   is communicated by the vagus nerve
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.760]   up to the dorsal raphe nucleus.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.120]   Remember there's some stations in between,
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.460]   but it's communicated up to the dorsal raphe,
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.620]   and your dorsal raphe then releases serotonin in the brain.
[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:41.080]   Again, a beautiful coordination of the body and the brain,
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.540]   just as activity levels in the body and the brain
[00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.840]   are matched through the vagus,
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.120]   or from the brain to the body,
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.640]   depending on the direction of flow, right?
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.400]   Alertness in the brain, body becomes alert.
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.780]   alertness in the body, brain becomes alert.
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:56.740]   Serotonin elevated in the gut, serotonin elevated in the brain.
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.720]   All of that happens by way of vagal signaling.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:07.860]   alertness in the brain.
