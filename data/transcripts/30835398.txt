[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.760]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.480]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.140]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.400]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.160]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.480]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.960]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.560]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.840]   this homeschooling possibility or deep
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.880]   into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.440]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.440]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.760]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.960]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.500]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.320]   Well, listeners, I'm so glad that you came back
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.680]   for part two of the practicalities of practicum.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.000]   As you know, from last week,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.960]   Jill and I had so much to share
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.720]   and so much to love about practicum
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.840]   and so many things that we wanted to tell you guys
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.320]   about this year's practicum
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.720]   that we couldn't fit it all in one episode.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.620]   So we're back.
[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.080]   I've got Jill Philbrick back with me again.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.420]   Hey, Jill.
[00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.400]   - Hi, it's nice to be here.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.400]   - And I am really excited about the specifics
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.840]   that we're gonna talk about today.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.840]   But let's go back.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.920]   Let's kind of set the stage.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.320]   If any of you missed part one,
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.760]   you can go back and listen to part one later,
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.760]   but we're glad you're here for part two.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.220]   What we kind of talked about at practicum last,
[00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.680]   on the podcast last week about practicum
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.260]   is basically how much Jill and I love practicum.
[00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.680]   We love the fellowship of practicum,
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.360]   how we get together with our buddies from community
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.040]   and new friends who may be joining community.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.680]   And even those people who are just kind of checking us out,
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.160]   we love the fellowship.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.080]   We really enjoy being inspired.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.520]   We get inspired from hearing other people's stories
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.960]   of their joys and triumphs and their struggles.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.580]   We get inspired by looking at new material
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.580]   and sometimes old material in new ways.
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.580]   We get inspired to become better lead learners in our homes
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.180]   as we learn more and more about the classical tools
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.860]   of learning and how to wield them well.
[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.340]   And we're equipped.
[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.660]   We get equipped to use those tools
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.600]   because practicum really is practical.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.280]   We actually practice the things that we talk about
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.980]   so that we can go home with a little bit of confidence
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.080]   that we could reproduce some of these great activities
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.020]   at home with our kids.
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.000]   Now, I know Jill, I want to out you a little bit
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.880]   mostly because I've heard you out yourself like this
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.120]   for years.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.440]   I know that you have said in years past,
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.200]   and I've heard you say this at practicum,
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.880]   I always believed I was not a math person
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.880]   or I have never been an art person, okay?
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.840]   And I've heard other people say that
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.680]   and I myself have said this.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.680]   Why, Jill, do you not say those things anymore?
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.240]   - Well, it is a wonderful thing
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.000]   not to say those things anymore.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.280]   - It is, it is.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.320]   - I will say that when I said those things,
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.980]   I always felt just a little convicted in my heart,
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:01.080]   you know, to limit ourself and to already decide
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.100]   that God can't reach us in this area,
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.240]   which is totally wrong.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.440]   - I know, I know.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.020]   What were you mostly saying
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.940]   when you said I'm not a math person
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.320]   or I'm not an art person?
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.280]   What did you really mean by that?
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.280]   - That I didn't feel equipped or maybe sometimes worthy,
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.640]   you know, or that I felt that I didn't have the background
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.800]   and I wouldn't have known that it was that
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.640]   I didn't have the background or the vocabulary.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.760]   I thought I just didn't enjoy it and didn't understand it.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.960]   - Okay, 'cause I was gonna say,
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.320]   wow, girl, you are way more noble than me.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.180]   When I said stuff like I'm not a math person
[00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.860]   or I'm not an art person,
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.860]   what I meant is I don't like that stuff.
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.500]   I do not like that stuff.
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.740]   Do not bring that stuff over here to me.
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.620]   I only teach it in my homeschool because I have to.
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.100]   I am not a math person.
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.540]   And what I meant was, I don't like that.
[00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.900]   I was never good at that.
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.180]   I never understood it, okay?
[00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.740]   So you're better than me, you're better than me.
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.220]   - No, I start, I don't.
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.060]   Now I have the vocabulary to be noble.
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.740]   But no, at the time, I was sitting in the mire.
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.260]   - Okay, 'cause I want listeners,
[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.740]   if you were sitting out there thinking,
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.580]   yeah, when I say I'm not a math person,
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.020]   I mean, I don't like it, I don't want to like it,
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.460]   I don't want you to help me like it, all that stuff, okay?
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.860]   So we are you.
[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.180]   We have all walked that path.
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.620]   But I think you really hit on something true, Jill.
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.180]   When we look at why we're not an art person
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.020]   or why we're not a math person,
[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.440]   it's because we feel ill-equipped
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.300]   to deal with those subjects ourselves.
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.740]   And if we feel ill-equipped to enjoy them
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.180]   and explore them for ourselves,
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.020]   we really feel ill-equipped to lead our children
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.420]   to have any kind of different relationship
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.560]   with those subjects than we have.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.780]   - Right, because--
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.540]   - So we redeemed it.
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.300]   - Exactly, we think, well, it was miserable for me,
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.700]   and so sorry to go, it's gonna be miserable for you too.
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.900]   Here you go.
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.220]   - Right, hate to burst your bubble,
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.540]   this is what it's like, okay?
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.620]   And I knew that I didn't want to pass that on,
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.860]   but before I started going to CC Practicums,
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.780]   I really didn't see any other options.
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.820]   I didn't know, I did not know
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.820]   how to redeem these subjects for myself.
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.040]   - So what helped you?
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.420]   How did you become a reformed--
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.260]   - Yes.
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.940]   - Knot person?
[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.900]   - Right, that is a great thing.
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.820]   I'm no longer a knot.
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:43.660]   - Yes, yes.
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:49.660]   - So I would say that as I came to Practicums
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.220]   and learned more things,
[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.220]   I definitely learned to love learning as an adult much more,
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.000]   but honestly, it was those five core habits.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.560]   - Huh, okay.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.020]   - Yes, it really was.
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.720]   The year we came out with the five core habits,
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.820]   I remember there was a slide on the Practicum
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.540]   that had a piece of art, a work, a painting,
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.380]   and there was, if I'm remembering correctly,
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.740]   there was maybe some people either about to fight
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:21.740]   or had just fought,
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.660]   and there were women over there on the stairs,
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.420]   and there were different colors,
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.100]   and there were some columns that looked ancient,
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.540]   but I remember looking at that piece of art and thinking,
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.100]   all I know is whether I like it or don't like it,
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.900]   and I'm ready to click to the next slide,
[00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.860]   and here we're gonna actually talk about it
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.220]   for a few minutes.
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.460]   And so just name the things you can see,
[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.240]   and I think, well, I can do that.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.100]   That's a man, that's a woman, that's a sword,
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.940]   that's a wall, that's a tapestry.
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.380]   Okay, name the colors you see.
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.340]   Okay, great, I know my colors.
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.380]   That's red, well, maybe I don't know my colors
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.620]   'cause it's that one over there.
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.460]   What color would you call that, you know?
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.560]   - Right, right.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.260]   - And so then looking closer,
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.060]   and well, do you see any shadows?
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.460]   Oh my, yes, I do.
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.760]   There's someone in the shadow over there.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.660]   So that ending and looking closer,
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.380]   and then does it remind you of anything?
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.760]   Well, yes, it can remind me of ancient stories
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.900]   where there were sword fights
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.980]   or women who were either cheering or moaning
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.540]   because the fight was about to happen.
[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:28.260]   Or maybe it was the lightsaber thing
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.260]   my kids did in the backyard last week.
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.100]   - Yes, yes.
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.580]   - It doesn't have to only be ancient stories.
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.420]   It could be from fiction, from nonfiction,
[00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:40.000]   from biblical, from our own experience.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.540]   And then what story might we tell?
[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:46.100]   Well, I did consider myself a language person.
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:50.100]   So my dad told us stories growing up.
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.180]   And so for me to think,
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.180]   oh, well, could I make up a story for this?
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.220]   Well, yes, and I could make it a silly story.
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.380]   I don't even have to make it a good story,
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.900]   you know, publishable story.
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.100]   It could just be one my children and I would enjoy.
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.460]   Or can I read about it and learn the story behind it?
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.500]   And then how else might I express it?
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.300]   Well, for me, day one might be stick figures.
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.060]   Or we could pose, you know, pose,
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.020]   or we could write a poem about it.
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.460]   So just that gave me enough to think,
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:27.100]   all right, I can now look at any piece of art
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.740]   and I at least know where to start.
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.580]   I think I didn't know where to start.
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:36.700]   Yeah, so that was huge.
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.580]   And then not long after that,
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:43.580]   we actually took a week to go to DC as a family.
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:48.660]   And some friends of ours also went the same week
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.740]   and she was an art major.
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.740]   And so just to follow up from what I'd learned about art,
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.300]   she said, "Okay, look at some of these pieces of art
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.900]   "because there's too much to see in one week.
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.660]   "Just see which ones you like the best
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.220]   "and then spend your time in that hall."
[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.060]   And so that--
[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.580]   - That's a great suggestion.
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.180]   - It really was, 'cause there was just no way to do all--
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.340]   - You get overwhelmed.
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.460]   You are easily overwhelmed.
[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:15.180]   - Oh, yes, well, and some of us naturally, easily.
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.780]   (all laughing)
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.300]   And I, and it just so happened,
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.140]   and I know it feels that I'm just the same
[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.380]   as everybody else, but I really do love Van Gogh.
[00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:31.380]   And so that he, his exhibits were there
[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.380]   the week we were there.
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.220]   His was the year that his was coming through
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.460]   and it happened to be there.
[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.460]   And there were probably 20 or 30
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.300]   of his original works there.
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.020]   And I knew where to start.
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.460]   So I could go-- - Oh, yes.
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.180]   - And my family gave me space to not be rushed.
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.980]   It was really the only, I just said,
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.540]   "I just have this one, like an hour or two here."
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.940]   And they were, "Absolutely, take your hour or two."
[00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.380]   And they wandered and did other things,
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.340]   but I could ponder and look.
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:10.340]   And it was so life-giving to have learned how to start
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:16.620]   and what to think and what questions to ask myself.
[00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:21.620]   And it changed everything for me about art
[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.740]   and about how I see myself.
[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:27.380]   I no longer thought that I do not belong
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.860]   in an art conversation.
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:34.980]   - That is huge.
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:35.820]   That is huge.
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.540]   I absolutely love that.
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:41.500]   You belong in the conversation.
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.540]   And listeners, parents, whoever you are,
[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.060]   if you're listening,
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:50.300]   isn't that what we want most?
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:54.020]   To be able to be part of the conversation.
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.580]   And when we say, "I'm not an art person,
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.220]   "I'm not a math person,"
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.820]   what we usually mean is,
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.900]   "I don't think I can talk to you about this
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.860]   "because I don't know where to start.
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.900]   "I don't know what to say.
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.380]   "I don't know how to respond.
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.700]   "I feel lost."
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.300]   And so for you to be able to say,
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:16.660]   "You know what?
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.660]   "I belong in this conversation
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.420]   "and here's where I started
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.300]   "and here's where I'm going.
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.140]   "Let me talk to you about that."
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:28.300]   And be able to appreciate not only the art,
[00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:33.300]   but to appreciate your part in the conversation is huge.
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.740]   - Exactly.
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.660]   And then knowing those five core habits
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.900]   equipped me to do the same thing with math.
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.220]   - Yes!
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.620]   Yes, because math is art.
[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:44.460]   - Oh, wow.
[00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.620]   - There's shapes.
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.660]   - We're gonna have to sit with that one for a minute.
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:48.500]   - Right.
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.380]   Think about those symbols.
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.740]   I mean, it's all symbols.
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:53.580]   Numbers.
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.540]   Think about why would we even have different fonts
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:00.540]   on our keyboard if it didn't matter
[00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:01.940]   what your four looks like?
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.900]   Why would you choose your wedding invitation
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.820]   to have at whatever o'clock
[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.420]   written with this certain font
[00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.620]   if that didn't speak beauty to you?
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.460]   Why would you want your child
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:18.180]   not to have a big piece of messy blobs of ink
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:22.020]   if it didn't look nice when those numbers were ordered?
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:28.340]   There is such satisfaction in numbers and letters
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.740]   and they're all combined in math, which is super exciting.
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.260]   So, I mean, in a good way.
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:40.260]   To know the code, to look at what those things mean
[00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.180]   and how you can write them.
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.660]   And then, we all have different handwriting.
[00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:47.060]   So, my symbol for division
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.620]   is going to look a little different
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.180]   than my child's symbol for division,
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.540]   but we know what they mean.
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.420]   - Wow.
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.260]   - And then sometimes, you know,
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260]   I learned in the Math Mat Workshops to,
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.660]   now I cross my sevens.
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:00.500]   And it has-
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.460]   - Oh, so they don't look like ones.
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.620]   - Right, because I had a lot of that happening
[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.820]   and all my life.
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.020]   And even with my own children's,
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.900]   sometimes you can misread your own work
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.700]   and then you start multiplying the wrong thing
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.380]   and you don't know how you got the answer.
[00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:17.020]   - And you can pull the breadcrumbs back
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.620]   because you turned one of them into a piece of cake.
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:20.540]   - Exactly.
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:23.260]   And now you're not talking about the right thing anymore.
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.860]   So, you have equivocated.
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.300]   - Yes, yes.
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:34.300]   So, the idea not only is math art,
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.740]   but it is a story.
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:40.820]   I loved when I could see a math principle
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.780]   and find God in it,
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.780]   but I still didn't feel like a math person
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.100]   because I wasn't strong in calculations.
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.100]   So, I saw myself as a person
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.340]   who enjoyed seeing God in things,
[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:53.820]   like maybe the distributive law.
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.660]   And I could say, oh, you know,
[00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.460]   we're all in this parentheses,
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.380]   but God on the outside is this number
[00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:05.340]   that is being multiplied by everything in the parentheses.
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.300]   And it takes a long time to say all that
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.100]   if you don't have the right vocabulary.
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.420]   It takes a long time to say math things
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.220]   when you don't know the names of the parts.
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:20.300]   And so, looking at math from a grammar point of view,
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.260]   using the five core habits
[00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:27.500]   helps us learn the right names for the right parts.
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.700]   And so, our children can learn the difference
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.700]   in parentheses, brackets, and braces,
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.420]   braces, not braces,
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.020]   when I didn't really know.
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.300]   I didn't, I would have to review.
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.580]   And it was so simple,
[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.580]   but to teach our youngest students the difference in that,
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:48.180]   just like we would teach our youngest children at home,
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.580]   the difference in maybe different kinds of tools
[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:52.420]   in the garage.
[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:56.340]   What's the difference between a metric and a standard wrench
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.500]   or what's the difference in the kitchen
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:02.260]   between a teaspoon and a tablespoon
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:07.260]   or all these things that they learn the vocabulary for.
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:11.060]   And so, knowing to be able to name the parts
[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:16.060]   of any expression or equation is a great place to start,
[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.380]   even if I can't calculate everything.
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:24.060]   And so, I can appreciate what I do know.
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.940]   And I'm again, invited to this table
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.900]   and I am again, invited to a conversation
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.380]   where I do know something.
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:33.900]   - That is really cool.
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:34.740]   - Something.
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:35.980]   - Yes, and I love that.
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:39.500]   I love that jump that you made from the art,
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.900]   feeling like I can't be part of the conversation
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:42.740]   to the math,
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.500]   because a lot of us feel that way about math too.
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.780]   And I know a lot of listeners who have heard
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:54.340]   that this year it's the MathMap practicum
[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:58.380]   have already decided, okay, A, it's math
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.980]   and I'm not a math person.
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:04.940]   And B, it's the MathMap and nobody in my house
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.620]   is gonna be using the MathMap this year.
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:11.380]   And so, maybe I'll just save my practicum time
[00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.620]   and do something else that day.
[00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:16.620]   So, we are here to say, don't do that.
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:22.980]   You've now heard that just those classical skills,
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:26.460]   that the five core habits of grammar
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:31.460]   are such an eye-opening way
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.900]   to come into the conversation about math.
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.300]   Even if you feel like you're not a math person,
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.660]   you may discover that you can join the conversation
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.260]   when you do the things like Jill was just describing.
[00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.620]   Learn to name what you see,
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:52.860]   a number and a numeral and different shapes
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:54.340]   and different symbols.
[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:59.340]   If you can begin to name what you see,
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.700]   then you can enter into the conversation.
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:06.380]   You're talking, you're using the right language
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.780]   and you know what those words mean.
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:12.060]   And so, you are able to participate
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.660]   and become a math person.
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.900]   But Jill, the kinds of things
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.580]   that you were talking about with art,
[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:23.580]   like giving yourself time to look at things
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:28.380]   and to notice differences and to just do,
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.300]   like you're not getting ready to paint the great,
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:36.020]   the next thing that they're gonna put in the Louvre.
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.180]   You're not thinking that.
[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:40.500]   You are saying, how is this painting
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.580]   like the one beside of it?
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:43.420]   - Yes.
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.420]   - And what colors have been used
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.860]   and are there any brush strokes
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.500]   and are there shadow?
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:54.220]   You're just comparing and you are naming things.
[00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:57.820]   It gives me hope that people
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:01.780]   who would still to this moment say, I'm not a math person,
[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.780]   could enter into the conversation
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:08.820]   by just looking at a page in the Math Map
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:14.300]   and just saying, what looks familiar to you
[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.340]   and what doesn't look familiar to you?
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.460]   Is that the kind of thing we're gonna be doing
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:22.220]   at the Math Map Practicum this year?
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.580]   - Yes, we will definitely be doing some of those things.
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:30.580]   We will be slowing down from the stress
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:35.700]   of calculate all this correctly now without a calculator
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.860]   and you need to get it right or you're not a math person
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:42.620]   into look at these colors, look how they overlap,
[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.380]   what might that say about the different kinds of numbers
[00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.620]   we're working with?
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.900]   Or that's in the, at the very beginning,
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.740]   they're gonna talk about what you'll hear.
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.620]   You'll hear about the domains,
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.340]   which are the kinds of numbers that we use.
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.220]   And if you think about domain, like you might say,
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.380]   well, my domain is the yard.
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.020]   I'm in charge of everything.
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.100]   I do the landscaping, I do the mowing,
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.780]   one person in your family might be their domain.
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:11.340]   Another's domain might be the kitchen.
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.100]   Another's domain might be all the IT.
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.180]   Another's domain, the things that they're in charge of.
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.700]   - Right, okay.
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.940]   - And so if we say the domain of natural numbers
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.500]   or the domain of fractions,
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:29.500]   the domain of, well, complex numbers,
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.620]   lots of different domains,
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.140]   but the simple, the ones we might be most familiar
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.940]   with hearing would be natural or integer or fraction,
[00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.380]   and it can expand from there.
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.820]   But they're all kinds of numbers.
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:45.580]   So if you were doing this giant stair-step layering,
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.620]   you'd have a big category of numbers
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:51.300]   and then you'd have subcategories and they narrow.
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.420]   So those domains we'll be looking at,
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.100]   they have different colors that correspond.
[00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.700]   You'll see that at practicum.
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.740]   So we'll just be looking, look at this,
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:01.140]   look at these colors, look at where they overlap,
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:03.140]   look at the categories there are.
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:07.740]   And even that, it might feel like you're not doing math,
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:12.540]   but we are, we are learning how to categorize numbers
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.260]   and how to think about numbers in groups.
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:19.300]   - So we'll actually get to look at the math map
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:22.740]   and see how it's constructed and how it's put together.
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:27.740]   And we'll begin to bend our minds around this new system
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:30.060]   of learning math as a family.
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.660]   So we're gonna see it.
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:35.460]   Okay, so guys, listen, that is one reason to go.
[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.060]   Even if nobody in your house is gonna be using it
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.380]   in the fall, what a wonderful thing
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:43.380]   to get in on the ground floor,
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:45.660]   'cause how can you join the conversation
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.220]   if you don't even know anything
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:49.220]   about what you're talking about?
[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:52.220]   And so being able, so at practicum this year,
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.460]   you're gonna be able to see the math map
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:59.660]   and how it's laid out and get a feel
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:04.580]   for the way we're gonna study math together as a family.
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:09.580]   - Yes, I think the big shifts that will occur,
[00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:13.980]   but it might take some, it'll take some laying down
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:17.660]   of something and some picking up of other things.
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:22.660]   So for instance, if we want to, I think,
[00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:28.420]   enjoy math the way, more organically,
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.940]   and I don't mean without assessment.
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:34.500]   When I say organic, I mean, we still need
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:39.500]   to be marking what we have learned.
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:43.020]   But I think pulling the calculations
[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.100]   into its own category and understanding
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.740]   that is one part of math.
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:53.660]   But grammar is a valuable part of math.
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:57.420]   And comparison of two kinds of equations
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.700]   is a valuable part of math.
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:03.060]   And having a conversation about where we see God
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.460]   in math is a valuable part of math.
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.180]   And understanding the equation we're looking at
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:12.620]   and what dimension that is possible
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.500]   is a valuable part of math.
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.460]   And if we only, I think we shortchange ourself.
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:21.420]   When we focus only on calculations
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:25.260]   and we skip or brush past,
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.220]   because there's a test waiting,
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.300]   there's standardized tests waiting.
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:32.020]   And so we think I need to know these calculations.
[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:37.020]   And the most we branch away from that is for a word problem.
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:42.060]   But not to really think through the pondering of math,
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:48.540]   the joy of math, the discovery of math.
[00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:53.500]   And I think it's gonna take a little bit of willingness
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.340]   to de-stress.
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.980]   - Okay, I'm hearing things like that.
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:02.820]   All right, y'all who are listening with me,
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:06.620]   I am hearing a lot of things that make me believe
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.420]   I might have some stuff to unlearn.
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:15.580]   And to shed, and I think it's gonna make me lighter.
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:20.340]   I'm gonna be able to travel along the math map better
[00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:23.620]   without some of that stuff hanging onto me.
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:24.820]   But I hear what you're saying.
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:29.260]   It's gonna take us a while to get comfortable
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:32.180]   learning math in this old way.
[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.700]   But I absolutely loved what you said.
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:40.700]   We're gonna be introduced to the grammar of math
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:45.100]   that is deeper and before calculations
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.300]   ever need to become part of our equation.
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:50.140]   If you'll pardon all those puns.
[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.260]   And we're gonna be introduced to the grammar of math
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:55.900]   and encouraged to both see
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:59.340]   and be part of the bigger conversation.
[00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:03.620]   And that's gonna require us to slow down
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:08.620]   and stop seeing math as an end in itself.
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.460]   - Yes.
[00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:13.500]   - That is part of a greater conversation
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.940]   that God is trying to draw us into.
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:19.020]   - Yes, because it's fun.
[00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:22.020]   It's fun to learn new things without,
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.540]   I think sometimes maybe we only think
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.900]   that the value of learning math
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.260]   is to pass a test or to use it.
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.620]   But nobody feels that way, or maybe some do.
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:34.060]   We often don't feel that way about reading.
[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.580]   We don't think, well, if I'm not going to read Homer,
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.540]   I guess I don't need to learn how to say these words.
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:44.140]   No, we still want to know how to read words.
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:47.220]   Or maybe now that I have learned
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:49.300]   that I do belong in the art conversation,
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:54.300]   I don't feel that I shouldn't enjoy art and play with art
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:57.020]   if I'm not going to be an artist.
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:58.340]   - An artist, oh wow.
[00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.900]   - And maybe I am an artist.
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:04.820]   Maybe just putting stuff on the plate a little neater
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.020]   makes me an artist.
[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:09.620]   Maybe lining up my math letters and numbers
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.100]   a little differently makes me an artist.
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:16.780]   Maybe arranging how I set up my workspace
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:17.980]   makes me an artist.
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:22.980]   Maybe I'm a mathematician because I have two lungs
[00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:28.020]   and I have one heart and I have arms and legs
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.580]   and parts that I can count and pathways
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.660]   that I can follow in my veins.
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:36.500]   And I can look at the trees and I can see
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:40.100]   where things intersect and I can follow the power lines
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:43.100]   and see that they're parallel, but they're curved.
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:47.580]   And all those things are so rich.
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:51.420]   And I don't think God wants us to miss noticing.
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:55.940]   So we can take, it's not only to pass the test,
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:59.220]   but it's also just to enrich us as people.
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:02.420]   - I will tell you, here's the truth.
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:05.060]   I have been, in the spirit of full disclosure,
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:09.260]   I have been attending these MathMap book clubs
[00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.340]   over the last several months.
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:16.020]   And I will tell you that I had reformed.
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.340]   I was no longer saying things out loud
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.180]   like I am not a math person.
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.980]   I had stopped saying that stuff.
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:27.780]   But until, and it was several weeks in to the book club
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:30.380]   before I really thought, you know,
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:35.380]   math could actually potentially possibly be fun, okay?
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:38.860]   And it took me, okay, me, classical educator,
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:42.700]   it took me several, it took me, oh my gosh,
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:47.020]   more than a handful of attendances before I thought,
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:50.820]   before I kind of relaxed my shoulder muscles
[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:52.980]   and stopped looking for,
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.860]   but do I already understand all about this?
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:28:00.860]   And I relaxed and thought, oh my word, this could be fun.
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:04.980]   And the last several ones, even when we got into deep stuff,
[00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:09.700]   like, you know, imaginary numbers and derivatives.
[00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:14.140]   And like, I thought when she,
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:16.300]   when we started talking about that on the book club,
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.780]   I thought, yeah, I have stopped having fun now.
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:22.700]   But then when I listened and I thought, oh, wait,
[00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:26.900]   I think, I think I see something I never saw before.
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:28.700]   That is so interesting.
[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:33.700]   And I remember thinking, if I had had the math map,
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:37.340]   I might potentially have enjoyed calculus.
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:42.060]   I have never had that thought in my life before last week,
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:45.540]   okay, but the math map, y'all, is different.
[00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:50.540]   If you will give yourself to the process and listen,
[00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:54.980]   all those of you who think,
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:57.140]   I don't want to see this math map thing.
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.740]   I don't want to know a new way of doing math.
[00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:03.020]   I can barely do the old way of doing math.
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:06.780]   You just need to let go and take a deep breath and fall.
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:11.780]   You need to go to practicum so that you can see
[00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:16.460]   what math education can be.
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:19.140]   And I don't mean educating your children.
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.060]   I mean, educating yourself,
[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:26.100]   because once you start playing with numbers,
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:29.220]   the way we have taught ourselves to play with words
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.300]   and you start having fun with it,
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:35.740]   and you start asking different kinds of questions,
[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:38.900]   your kids are going to want in on this.
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:39.740]   - Yes.
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.740]   - It looks way more fun.
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.820]   - That happened to us.
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:45.700]   I was in the pilot. - Really?
[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:49.980]   - Yes, I was in the pilot with my youngest son,
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.300]   who is now in challenge two,
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.180]   and he was in the challenge A pilot.
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:59.180]   And my older son, who was in challenge one or two
[00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:04.340]   at the time, saw us doing math together and said,
[00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:07.780]   "Hey, can I do this with you?"
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:10.460]   And if we had a question, we'd be working through things
[00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:11.500]   and he'd sit down.
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.780]   And so I pulled him off of Saxon
[00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:19.700]   and he did the math math with us at home,
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.380]   even though he was not a challenge A student.
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.340]   - Right.
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:25.940]   - He loved it, loved it.
[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:30.260]   In fact, he kept doing mostly complex.
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.700]   He's done for his high school career,
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:36.780]   he has done the complex several times,
[00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:40.620]   and he did the "Understanding Mathematics" book one year
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.980]   because I thought, well, you know,
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:45.660]   you're still doing this same level of math
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.460]   and let's just see.
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.500]   He did that whole book one year for his math curriculum.
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.820]   We dabbled in a little bit of Saxon just to see,
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.420]   but he had what he needed.
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.740]   And now he works for an engineering firm
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:02.220]   and he did not go to college.
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.380]   It's open to him if he wants to,
[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:07.500]   but he worked with my husband in an engineering firm
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:11.740]   and he has the math he needs and more.
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:15.180]   He grew, we grew, I grew.
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:17.700]   And I've heard so many times
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.060]   from being a part of this math pilot,
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:23.340]   so many tutors who were in the pilot said
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:26.900]   that if they were looking at the complex,
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:28.300]   which is the level for challenge A
[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.460]   that's rolling out this year nationwide,
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:34.340]   that's the level that was piloted for multiple years now.
[00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:36.060]   If they would look at that and they thought,
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:39.220]   oh, I don't think I quite get it.
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:43.220]   They would go to the naturals, which is online free.
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:44.980]   - Yes, yes.
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:48.820]   - Look at those pages and after just tracing,
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:51.700]   and I don't mean just as in minimizing it.
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:56.700]   I mean, the more simple approach of decluttering
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:02.580]   and tracing and naming that you find in the naturals,
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:05.660]   they would have an aha moment and they'd say,
[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:10.660]   oh, now I know exactly what to do in the complex pages.
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:14.780]   And so just, and again, not just in a minimizing way,
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:17.260]   but in a more simple approach,
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:21.100]   but taking the time to look at a narrower domain
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:24.460]   of the natural numbers, looking at those pages,
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:28.500]   tracing, copying, and making comparisons,
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:32.100]   looking to see what connections and patterns they saw,
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.500]   they could then go to the complex pages.
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:39.100]   So that is why no matter what level you choose to do,
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:42.500]   even if you have a child who's not in challenge A,
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.180]   then do the complex.
[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:46.340]   Even if you have a child going into challenge A,
[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:50.460]   do the naturals, do them.
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:55.460]   And they're rolling out more than one online free this year.
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:57.980]   You can download them, you can use them.
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:02.000]   They won't have all the resources that you're paying for
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.940]   when you buy the complex level,
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:09.940]   but there is enough to trace, copy, watch the book clubs,
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.300]   learn about it.
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:14.020]   I mean, you can look up a definition online too,
[00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:16.160]   if you don't have everything.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.460]   The CDC has never said we are the only authority
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.180]   and you cannot walk out of this.
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:27.560]   So you can do that, but there's even a glossary online.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.420]   There's an audio glossary online.
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.440]   If you don't know how to read the equation.
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.120]   So there's so much equipping there.
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:39.000]   I did the naturals and it's so valuable.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.500]   It's incredibly valuable.
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.340]   - That's so good, Jill.
[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:42.460]   It's so good.
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:46.540]   What I want people to hear, two things,
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:51.020]   your absolute enthusiasm for the MathMap
[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:56.020]   and our invitation to meet the MathMap
[00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:58.680]   at practicum this year.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:02.460]   We really want you all to commit
[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:05.700]   to coming to practicum this year.
[00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:09.500]   Whether or not you think you're a math person,
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:14.100]   whether or not your family is going to be
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:17.420]   using the MathMap in challenge A
[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.660]   or piloting another level
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:24.460]   or using the free other levels that you have online,
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:27.000]   even if you don't have any intention
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.340]   of experiencing the MathMap in community
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:33.480]   or at home this year,
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:38.480]   practicum is a great time for you to meet the MathMap.
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.400]   And here's the thing.
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:48.360]   I think it's really important for us to play with numbers
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:54.420]   and to immerse ourselves in the MathMap when we're together.
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:59.420]   Why is it so important to do this in community, Jill?
[00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:05.480]   - Well, there's a conversation that takes place in community
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.400]   and we draw on each other's strengths.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.400]   I'm a challenge A tutor this year
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.440]   and my class will often say,
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.200]   why is it so easy in community?
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.680]   - Oh.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.480]   - You know, whether it's the Latin,
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:22.800]   whether it's the math, whatever it is.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:26.460]   And I say, well, are you talking about it at home
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.560]   or are you just sitting there doing it?
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:33.560]   Because if we expect our children and ourselves
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.740]   to sit there in a little,
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:38.940]   I mean, when I went to private school in high school,
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:42.220]   the first year was just these little cubbies with dividers.
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:44.740]   That was not even a zero amount of fun.
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:48.460]   We were on the negative end of the number line
[00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:50.260]   for the amount of fun I was having.
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:55.920]   We needed snacks to bring me up to zero, you know?
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.120]   - Yes.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.120]   - Right?
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:04.000]   And so we didn't, if you don't have a conversation,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.700]   you're just by yourself.
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:08.280]   And how are you going to draw on another strength?
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.720]   You only come with what you've got.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.800]   And so when another person can go,
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.880]   oh, well, what about, or have you seen,
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:19.880]   or oh, look at this, it sparks more things.
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:24.380]   And for adults to do that, when we do it,
[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:26.220]   we can maybe understand a little more
[00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:27.560]   why our children need it.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:33.700]   If we don't do it, we put expectations on our children
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:37.620]   that we don't put on ourselves sometimes.
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:41.100]   And we want to be on a team to accomplish something,
[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:45.160]   but then we might think our child needs to just work alone.
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:49.460]   Well, some of us work well alone and some of us don't,
[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:53.220]   but we just, we need to experience a little
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.300]   of what they might be doing.
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.260]   For instance, I did Memory Master one year,
[00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:58.100]   actually several years.
[00:36:58.100 --> 00:36:58.940]   - Oh, good for you.
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:02.160]   - I did with my youngest son, he wanted to do it.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.960]   So he and I did it together three years in a row.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:09.720]   And I will tell you that doing Memory Master
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:13.540]   with actual expectation that I need to prove this
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.020]   and get it right was very different
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:17.340]   than me preparing my child for Memory Master.
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.740]   - Yes, good for you.
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:21.580]   That's a great, that's a great injunction
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:23.100]   for us to go to practicum.
[00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:26.660]   We're actually doing what it is we're gonna be encouraging
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:28.660]   our children to do.
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:32.260]   - If we don't know what it feels like for them to look at it
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:37.140]   and to compare or to remember to be asked questions,
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:40.060]   then we can sometimes think, oh, you can do this,
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:41.380]   just do it, it's not that hard.
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.580]   - Right, we don't realize how hard it is.
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:46.980]   You're right, you are exactly right about that.
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:48.740]   The other reason, the other thing I think
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:53.340]   that we will absolutely learn from doing the math map
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:57.500]   at practicum together is it's gonna take some time
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:00.580]   for us to break our bad math habits.
[00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:03.520]   The habit that says, I look at that
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.220]   and I don't know the full backstory,
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:08.380]   so there's absolutely no value in me practicing this
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:11.660]   or tracing this or observing it or attending to it
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:13.140]   'cause I don't know what it means.
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:15.540]   That's a bad habit that we need to break.
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:19.100]   And we can break it together at practicum.
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:24.100]   We can simply trace or simply observe
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:28.780]   or simply attend to differences or simply compare
[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:32.700]   and recognize after we do that that, you know,
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:35.980]   we actually have gleaned something valuable for that,
[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:40.500]   from that, even though we did not solve a problem
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:44.460]   and get an answer for every page of math we did.
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:48.740]   Right, we've learned to break that habit with history,
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:53.580]   with science, with English and Latin grammar in foundations.
[00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:56.020]   We don't expect our child to be able to tell us
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:57.860]   the causes of a war.
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:00.500]   We just teach them the song that has the dates in it
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:02.020]   and who the leaders were.
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:03.780]   And we're totally fine with that,
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:07.220]   knowing that later they're gonna read about it.
[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:09.620]   So maybe we can do the same thing with math.
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:14.620]   Maybe we can say, okay, let's count two dots
[00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:18.820]   and two flowers and maybe two pi
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:20.900]   with theme coming off the top
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:23.980]   and then maybe two symbols of pi.
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:26.100]   - This is, it's really amazing.
[00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:28.700]   I really, listeners, I really am,
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.340]   I want to encourage you to go to the Math Map
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.580]   because it is so fundamentally changed
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:36.980]   the way I think about math education.
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:38.820]   And man, I'm a hard sell.
[00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:42.260]   And I am planning, I am planning as a grownup,
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:47.260]   as a grandma, to go back and redeem my math education
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:51.340]   even more than a classical education with my children
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:56.340]   has redeemed it so that I am ready to fully love
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:40:01.020]   and explore math with my grandkids.
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:05.100]   And that's why I want you to come to practicum.
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:07.260]   Jill, why do you want people to come
[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:09.980]   to the Math Map practicum this year?
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:13.140]   - Well, aside from the incredible joy
[00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:16.700]   that math is waiting to give all of us,
[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:18.700]   well, God is, through math,
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:22.260]   it really is another chance for us to practice
[00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:25.700]   those classical skills, which we do in any topic.
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:30.420]   Whether it was history, literature, Latin, math,
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:34.060]   it's a great refresher for what the actual tools
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:38.100]   that we have are and how to use them.
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:40.740]   And when we practice it in one area,
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:43.140]   it can refresh us in every area.
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:48.140]   So the classical side is obviously a great time to come
[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:51.340]   and practice those skills, even if maybe the topic
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:54.340]   isn't one that appeals to you right off the bat,
[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:56.420]   but it can open new doors.
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.460]   You might, it's like trying a new restaurant
[00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:00.220]   that maybe you didn't think you wanted to try.
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.900]   And I'm famous for that because I love to repeat
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:05.460]   what I love and I don't like trying new things.
[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:06.300]   - Yes.
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:08.100]   - And all my friends know that.
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:09.500]   (laughing)
[00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.940]   They have to drag me to new places.
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:14.300]   And then I buy the most familiar thing I can find
[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:17.940]   on the menu instead of branching out.
[00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:19.100]   (laughing)
[00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.700]   - So you're encouraging us to branch out.
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:22.940]   That's great.
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:24.980]   - Come to a new restaurant, try a new thing.
[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:27.420]   But the good news is we actually want you to look
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:28.460]   for what's familiar.
[00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:31.140]   We're not asking anyone-- - Oh, that's so good.
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:34.380]   - To totally try the most absurd thing,
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:37.020]   but we're saying what's familiar to you
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.780]   and let's start from there.
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:40.060]   - That is awesome.
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:40.900]   That is awesome.
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:44.420]   So you guys come to the MathMap Practicum this year.
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:48.620]   You will discover how to meet God in math.
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:53.340]   You will discover how to redeem your math education.
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:57.140]   You will discover how to introduce your kids
[00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:02.140]   to the skills of learning and how to employ them on math
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:05.740]   in a way you probably never thought of before.
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:10.540]   You will discover how to enter the math conversation
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:15.540]   and maybe realize that you in fact might be a math person.
[00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:19.500]   I hope we'll see you there.
[00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:24.500]   Jill, thank you so much for sharing your enthusiasm
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.860]   for becoming a math person with all of us.
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:28.380]   I appreciate that.
[00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:29.900]   - I'm glad to do it.
[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:32.220]   - Guys, I hope that you will enjoy the rest
[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:34.100]   of this gorgeous spring day.
[00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:36.300]   I have a book recommendation for you.
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:37.980]   It just seems like the perfect thing
[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:41.860]   as I look out into my backyard where everything is blooming
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:45.060]   and the woods seem so inviting to me.
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:47.140]   Have you guys ever read "The Secret Garden"?
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:50.220]   It was made for a day like this,
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:51.980]   but I mostly want to let you know
[00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:56.260]   that one of our newest Copper Lodge Library editions
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:58.300]   is "The Secret Garden."
[00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:00.940]   It is a beloved classic novel
[00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:05.940]   and the Copper Lodge Library edition has footnotes
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:09.140]   that will define some unfamiliar words for you,
[00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:12.500]   will give your kids pronunciations of words
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:16.060]   that maybe they've seen before, but never known how to say.
[00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:19.620]   It will give you historical context.
[00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:21.540]   There's all kinds of helps
[00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:25.100]   in the Copper Lodge Library edition of "The Secret Garden"
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:28.260]   that will make your family's reading of it
[00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:30.860]   richer than ever before.
[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:33.020]   There's some great illustrations in there,
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:36.620]   there are wide margins so you can jot down notes,
[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:40.100]   just like you're really talking to the author.
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:42.700]   "The Secret Garden" is a great book for the springtime,
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:44.940]   but it's a great book for families
[00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:48.500]   who are looking for Christian themes to talk about,
[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:50.580]   themes like love and redemption
[00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:53.500]   and the importance of community.
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:56.460]   So if you're looking for a great read aloud
[00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:59.100]   after you get through playing with numbers
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:00.940]   this spring and summer,
