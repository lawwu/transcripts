[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060]   [silence]
[00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.260]   Your ability to focus,
[00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.180]   and in fact, your ability of neurons
[00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.980]   to encode specific information in your environment,
[00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.660]   that is to represent what's out there in the world,
[00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.600]   is actually related to your blood glucose level.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.220]   Now, here I'm setting aside the discussion
[00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.380]   of ketosis and ketogenic diets for the moment,
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.400]   but there's a beautiful study
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.980]   that was published in "Neuron" not long ago
[00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.020]   that showed that the tuning,
[00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.860]   that is the precision with which neurons in the brain
[00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.900]   will represent things in our environment,
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.240]   is actually much greater
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.540]   when there is sufficient glucose in the brain.
[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.620]   Translated into English,
[00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.560]   this means that when we are fasted,
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.520]   or when our blood glucose is very low,
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.380]   we aren't able to perceive
[00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.540]   and think about things as clearly.
[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.260]   Now, there's a twist to this, however.
[00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.340]   Many people who practice intermittent fasting,
[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.180]   and I should say,
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.940]   I practice a sort of pseudo-intermittent fasting.
[00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.140]   I generally eat my meals
[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.380]   between the hours of 11 a.m. and 8 p.m.,
[00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.420]   although sometimes there's some wiggle around that.
[00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.780]   Occasionally, I have an early breakfast.
[00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.220]   I'm not super rigid about it,
[00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.580]   but I know there are a number of people
[00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.740]   who are doing longer fasts,
[00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.180]   so they're eating in a six-hour window.
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.340]   We did an entire episode about fasting.
[00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.500]   You can, again, find that at hubermanlab.com.
[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.260]   We'll likely have Sachin Panda,
[00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.300]   who's an expert in intermittent fasting, on the podcast.
[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.760]   Intermittent fasting
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.560]   has a lot of different potential benefits.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.980]   For some people, it's a convenient way
[00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:17.960]   to restrict their calories.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.180]   For other people, it's a convenient way to avoid eating.
[00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.700]   That is, it's easier to not eat
[00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.820]   than to eat a small portion,
[00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.020]   so they opt for intermittent fasting,
[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.400]   and so on and so forth.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.220]   But one of the things that you hear very often
[00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.940]   is that some people like being fasted
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.300]   because they like the clarity of mind that it provides.
[00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.580]   Here's the situation.
[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.520]   Neurons, unless you're in a ketogenic diet,
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.060]   really thrive on glucose.
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.660]   They love glucose.
[00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.180]   And as I mentioned before,
[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.020]   your ability to think and perceive things
[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.380]   is actually enhanced
[00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.580]   by having sufficient glucose in your bloodstream.
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.980]   So why would it be that some people experience
[00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.620]   a heightened state of mental clarity when they are fasted?
[00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.460]   I've certainly experienced that before.
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.060]   Well, I should say that provided you're well-hydrated enough
[00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.000]   and you have enough electrolytes in your system,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.620]   what tends to happen is that when you ingest food,
[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.140]   there's a shift in your nervous system
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.200]   towards so-called parasympathetic mode.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.700]   That is, the more relaxed,
[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.300]   you've probably heard it as rest and digest,
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.140]   although it does other things,
[00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.020]   the more relaxed mode that can indeed make us very sleepy.
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.340]   If we have too many carbohydrates,
[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.960]   it actually can make us quite sleepy.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.660]   However, if we have any food, if we have enough of it,
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.260]   that is, if our gut is full,
[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.700]   it diverts blood to our gut and we become sleepy
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.940]   and we can't focus as well.
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.900]   So a lot of people really like fasting
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.200]   in the state of being fasted for focus and concentration
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.440]   because they don't have as much
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.420]   of that parasympathetic activation,
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.460]   they're just not as sleepy.
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.060]   And in fact, under those conditions,
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.840]   half as much caffeine will give you just as much lift
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.000]   as twice as much caffeine will give you
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.240]   on a full belly of pasta.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.000]   And that's just the way that caffeine interacts
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.880]   with blood glucose.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.440]   So what I'd like you to imagine
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.800]   is if you had a measure of focus from zero to 10,
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.920]   these are arbitrary units,
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.480]   10 being maximally focused and zero being not focused at all,
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.540]   imagine a U-shaped function, right?
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.380]   Where if you're very fasted,
[00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.620]   you're going to have a high degree
[00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.360]   of focus and concentration.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.860]   But then if you ingest some food and your belly is full,
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.200]   your focus and concentration is reduced.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.740]   But having enough blood glucose
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.820]   and maybe even elevated blood glucose
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.340]   will increase cognitive function.
[00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.580]   So there are two ends of the spectrum.
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.820]   On one end of the spectrum,
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.660]   blood glucose is relatively low and you're fasted
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.220]   and you can think and behave in a very concentrated way.
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.820]   And on the other end of the spectrum,
[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.220]   you have a lot of blood glucose
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.660]   or I should say sufficient blood glucose.
[00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.940]   You never want your blood glucose to be too high.
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.700]   And that allows your neurons to encode and perceive
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.940]   and basically allow you to think really clearly.
[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.020]   So you sort of have to pick your condition.
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.300]   What do you want for your bouts of focus and concentration?
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.340]   I actually do both.
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.860]   So what I do is, as I mentioned before,
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.820]   I eat my meal sometime around 11 a.m.,
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.940]   my first meal typically,
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.860]   unless I'm very hungry when I wake up.
[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.020]   And so I will do my workout and one bout of focused work.
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.060]   I always think of this as my hard work early in the day.
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.460]   And I do that fasted.
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.740]   I'll be consuming water with electrolytes,
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.180]   maybe Element or other electrolytes,
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.460]   maybe some caffeine as well in the form of Yerba Mate
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.680]   or coffee.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.860]   That's my first focus bout of 90 minutes or less.
[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.340]   That is essentially done fasted.
[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.380]   And then I'll eat.
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.220]   And then I do notice after I eat,
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.420]   I actually have a diminished capacity to focus.
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.720]   But then again, in the afternoon,
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.700]   I will do another 90 minute bout of focus.
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.220]   And I'll talk about some of the tools I use
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.620]   to make sure that that bout of focus is optimal
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.940]   for getting the most amount of focused work done,
[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.820]   whether or not it's mental work or physical work,
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.060]   although I tend to do my physical work early in the day
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.060]   and my mental work both early and late in the day.
[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.860]   So to make this very simple or as simple as I can for you,
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.540]   being fasted is great for focus and concentration,
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.620]   provided you're not thinking about food the entire time.
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.740]   And being fed is terrific for focus and concentration,
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.040]   actually can improve neuronal function,
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.460]   provided that you didn't eat too much food.
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.760]   So one way to manage this is if you're going to have a lunch
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.900]   to make sure that you don't stuff yourself at lunch,
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.260]   that you're not overeating and to not get quite so full
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.220]   that you push your nervous system
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.660]   into this parasympathetic mode
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.740]   and make it hard to focus in the afternoon.
[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.100]   I know a lot of people experience a dip
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.820]   or even a crash in energy in the afternoon
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.420]   that make it really hard to focus.
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.420]   For that reason, I'll just remind people of a tool
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.140]   I've talked about many times before,
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.460]   which is based on the biology of adenosine and caffeine,
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.620]   et cetera, which is to delay your first caffeine intake
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.180]   to 90 to 120 minutes after waking up.
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.220]   I know that can be painful for certain people.
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.200]   I violate that rule when I'm working out
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.300]   very early in the morning,
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.780]   I'll drink my caffeine before my workout,
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.700]   which often occurs within 30 to 60 minutes of waking.
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.460]   But in general, unless I'm working out very early,
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.460]   I will ingest my caffeine 90 to 120 minutes
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.020]   after I wake up.
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.420]   So again, I want to emphasize
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.660]   that if you hear somebody out there say,
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.140]   being fasted is optimal for focus and concentration,
[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.740]   well, that is true in one context
[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.300]   and perhaps ideal for a certain part of the day.
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.300]   And other people will say, no, you know,
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.500]   neurons run on glucose,
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.380]   you need glucose in your bloodstream
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.900]   in order to get those neurons to be tuned,
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.060]   that is to respond with electrical activity
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.460]   in the optimal way when you're reading something
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.740]   or when you're trying to perform exercise.
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.820]   Well, that's also true.
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.860]   And of course, you can incorporate both.
[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.300]   I, in fact, as I just described,
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.620]   incorporate both fasted states and fed states
[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.600]   in order to optimize my concentration and focus.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.700]   (upbeat music)
