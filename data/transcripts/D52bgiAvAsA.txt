[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.720]   - Hey Kyle, I'm Alberto, I'm 25.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.280]   I currently work as a solutions consultant
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.040]   at one of the big four firms.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.320]   I once stumbled across your book, "Deep Work"
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.160]   and let me say, it really changed my life.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.480]   I've never felt so understood in my whole life.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.840]   So I was reading about Ben,
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.800]   the University of Virginia grad with a degree in economics
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.920]   who decided to quit his job as a human spreadsheet
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.560]   and become a computer programmer.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.040]   I followed the same road
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.840]   since I also received a degree in economics
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.120]   and decided to increase my value
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.520]   by learning about programming.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.040]   My question to you Kyle is,
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.040]   I feel that I possess somewhat valuable skills
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.880]   to the marketplace,
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.280]   hence my background in economics
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.480]   and consulting and programming,
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.560]   but I really don't want to be implementing systems
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.280]   tailored to a client's needs for the rest of my life.
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.000]   I remember you quoted Henry David Thoreau
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.720]   on digital minimalism.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.960]   "The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.620]   "which is required to be exchanged for it.
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.480]   "Immediately or in the long run."
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.560]   Well, I really don't want to trade my life just for money.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.520]   In economics we call this diminishing return.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.740]   Do I really want to spend more time of my life working
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.360]   just to get a nicer car or a nicer house?
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.000]   I'll be better off by applying valuable skills
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.760]   to something more meaningful.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.920]   As someone who has been impacted by your books,
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.760]   I wanted to ask you,
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.160]   do you have any advice for me as to how to live
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.320]   a more meaningful and valuable life?
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.160]   Thank you, Kyle.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.080]   Well, the first thing I'd recommend is moving back in time
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.680]   in my library of books to the book that I published
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.880]   before "Deep Work" to the book "So Good They Can't Ignore You"
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.800]   which I published in 2012.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.700]   I think you're going to find some insights in that book
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.340]   that are going to be useful to your quandary.
[00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.180]   It's also worth keeping in mind that I wrote that book first
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.380]   and "Deep Work" in some sense was a response
[00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.480]   to "So Good They Can't Ignore You."
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.440]   So a lot of what I talk about in "Deep Work"
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.760]   can be put into a broader context,
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.600]   into a context of a life well-lived
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.120]   if you also read its predecessor,
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.520]   "So Good They Can't Ignore You."
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.100]   You're going to find in that book, for example,
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.520]   a case study of someone in a similar position.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.360]   Her name was Lulu.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.320]   She started as a math major.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.080]   I think it might've been Amherst, might've been Swarthmore,
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.360]   but she was a math major who taught herself
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.500]   some basic computer programming,
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.400]   got a job in quality assurance.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.040]   So this is relatively low down on the pecking order.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.640]   This is testing software.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.500]   Using some of the skills she was picking up
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.680]   about computer programming,
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.040]   she then automated some of the QA testing.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.640]   She began to make herself more valuable.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.320]   And now she could come up with these automated testing tools
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.000]   that were automating a lot of these processes,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.960]   and that opened up new opportunities.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.560]   That led her into mastering database development
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.980]   because there was a natural shift over there,
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.640]   and she became even more valuable
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.660]   because she could now design
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.560]   these complex database-driven systems.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.320]   I think she focused in particular on financial institutions,
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.520]   so she really knew how to do this.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.640]   And what was interesting about this case study in that book
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.520]   is what she did next.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.160]   She said, "Great, now that I'm really valuable,
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.600]   let me take this career capital out for a spin."
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.580]   And she completely reinvented her life
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.920]   into a six-months-on, six-months-off structure.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.920]   Six-month engagement, six-month adventuring.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.920]   Six-month engagement, six-month adventuring.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.840]   And during these adventure months,
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.840]   there's lots of different things she would do.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.080]   Her family was from Thailand,
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.740]   so she would sometimes go spend months in Thailand.
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.280]   She learned how to fly a plane.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.300]   She learned how to scuba dive.
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.380]   She had this cool house they lived in,
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.160]   in Jamaica Plain, that they were working on.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.160]   And so what she did here was took her skill out for a spin
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.700]   to build a journey that really resonated with her.
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.160]   That is the basic idea of So Good They Can't Ignore You,
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.880]   that you build skills to get career capital.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.880]   You then invest that career capital to get in your career
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.000]   the things that resonate
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.600]   and to get away from the things that don't.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.560]   And this is gonna be different for different people.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.680]   And so for some people, what resonates is,
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.280]   "I wanna be a master of the universe.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.620]   I wanna start up that is a unicorn.
[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.060]   I wanna be a Sand Hill Road, raising millions of dollars
[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.120]   and winning that competition
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.060]   to be the biggest company in my sector."
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.900]   And for other people,
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.800]   they wanna spend six months a year scuba diving,
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.120]   or they wanna live on land somewhere.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.240]   I mean, whatever it is that resonates,
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.800]   building skill is gonna be the leverage you have
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.260]   to get into your life the things that actually matter.
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.720]   So read So Good They Can't Ignore You,
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.480]   'cause this is a more nuanced approach.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.840]   I worry listening to your call
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.000]   that you might be falling into the trap of,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.800]   "Oh, I don't like this programming.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.040]   I don't like this job.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.080]   Let me just quit it and do something completely different.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.180]   Let me go start a vineyard somewhere.
[00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.180]   If I just completely change my job,
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.660]   then maybe I'll like that new job better."
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.660]   This is not a challenge of having the right job.
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.860]   It's the challenge of having the right leverage
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.060]   in the marketplace to make your life what you want it to be.
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.400]   Your building skills as a programmer, great.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.540]   Take that capital out for a spin.
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.700]   Start thinking through what resonates, what doesn't.
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.820]   What's the lifestyle you want?
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:14.900]   What's the lifestyle you don't?
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.580]   What do you want in your working life, what you don't?
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.940]   What you want in your life outside of work,
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:18.780]   what don't you want?
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.040]   And then start figuring out,
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.820]   do I have enough skill to trade to get this in my life?
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.060]   And if not, how do I get that skill?
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.580]   Anyways, it's a more nuanced approach.
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.340]   Deep work in some sense is a good strategy
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.200]   for acquiring rare and valuable skills.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.180]   So good they can't ignore you.
[00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.380]   We'll tell you why you want to do it
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.420]   and what you want to do with them.
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.260]   So check out that book.
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.460]   I think you'll like it.
