[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.780]   The holidays start here at Ralph's, with a variety of options to celebrate traditions
[00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.060]   old and new.
[00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.860]   You could do a classic herb roasted turkey, or spice it up and make turkey tacos.
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.560]   Serve up a go-to shrimp cocktail, or use Simple Truth wild-caught shrimp for your first Cajun
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.560]   risotto.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.620]   Make creamy mac and cheese, or a spinach artichoke fondue from our selection of Murray's cheese.
[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.700]   No matter how you shop, Ralph's has all the freshest ingredients to embrace all your
[00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.580]   holiday traditions, Ralph's, fresh for everyone.
[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:48.700]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, it's live Q&A.
[00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.420]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.060]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now each

[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.260]   We begin with Martin, and let's see, is it, oops, wrong button, there we go.
[00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.260]   Martin, welcome.
[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.260]   Are you in Prague?
[00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.940]   Or is this a phone line from Prague?
[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.900]   - Yes, I'm from, hey, Joshua.
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.900]   - Welcome.
[00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.900]   - Can you hear me all right?
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.900]   - Sounds great, sir, go ahead.
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.900]   - Thank you.
[00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.660]   Long time, I'm from the Czech Republic, Europe.
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.100]   I've been following your content since 2018, I think, and even grabbed a bunch of your
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.100]   courses.
[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.100]   I love what you do.
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.100]   So first of all, thank you.
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.100]   - My pleasure.
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.340]   - Now, I'm wondering, in your recent podcast with Mikhail, you touched on this interesting
[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.700]   residency program in Panama, where you only need to spend one day there every two years
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.740]   in order to maintain your residency.
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.740]   - Right.
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.900]   - It's really promising, but I'm a bit lost on the details.
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.220]   Unfortunately, neither me nor my wife can come with you to Panama in January, which
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.580]   would be amazing and probably solve this, but it's not possible, unfortunately.
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.220]   Well, to be more specific with my question, or rather questions, so first, what is this
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.740]   residency program?
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.220]   As in, does it have a name by which I could find more information on it?
[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.420]   Can I fill out the application online, or is it a personal visit required?
[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.260]   And if so, is it a matter of going to the immigration office and, I don't know, walking
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.700]   out two hours later with a permit, or does it take a couple of days?
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.540]   And then I'm thinking, once the residency permit is approved, do I need to be present
[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.340]   to collect the documents, or can they be mailed to Europe?
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.460]   I'm asking because if me and my wife are planning a round trip from Europe to Panama, we don't
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.500]   want to waste time and money by having to go multiple times.
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.140]   Ideally, we'd want to do it in one go.
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.260]   I know it's a lot of quite specific questions, but I feel like the answers might be quick
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.740]   and concise.
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.620]   - Why are you interested in residency in another country such as Panama?
[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:46.820]   - Well, I'm in Europe, and as everybody knows, the situation is just not amazing.
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:53.020]   We would like to have a plan B, ideally on a different continent.
[00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:02.140]   I bought your international escape plan course, which was great, I could recommend it to anyone.
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:09.020]   It's more of like the general understanding of these concepts, but not really many practical
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.700]   examples which I think wouldn't make sense to put it in the course, but that's what I'm
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.700]   missing now.
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:24.820]   Panama, it's just, it looks good, but I just don't know where to pick up, where to start.
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:32.100]   - So I know that you would love specific information, and I would like to give it to you, but I
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.300]   I'm going to just gently sidestep that for a couple of reasons.
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.660]   Number one, things change in the world of immigration all the time.
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.140]   I'm happy to answer specific information, but at the moment, I don't know all of the
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.900]   answers to your question, because I'm not presenting those sessions at the event in
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.900]   Panama.
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.900]   Mikel is.
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.900]   So he's the one to ask.
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.820]   I would begin by going to his podcast, which is Expat Money, and search for some of his
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:04.860]   episodes, his public episodes that are about Panama, and see those details that are there.
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.180]   Also, there is quite a lot of information, more specific information around for specific
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:16.820]   countries, but I can't answer you exactly all of the details of each of the Panamanian
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.400]   residency programs, because I'm not current on all of them.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.660]   He's going to be the one who's presenting those sessions in January, and I'll be learning
[00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.740]   alongside everyone who's there at the event, which, of course, everyone who's able to travel
[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:36.340]   in January should sign up at expatmoney.com/radical and come and hang out with us in Panama.
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.900]   What I would say for you, kind of just speaking more generally, is that there are a number
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.900]   of residence programs that would fit what you're looking for, if by what you're looking
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:56.420]   for is just to have basically an ability to have a residence permit in another country,
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.900]   and a residence permit in another country where you don't have to move there, but a
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.600]   place where if I wanted to go there, I could.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.180]   Some of the better ones are in the Americas.
[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:16.420]   Probably the top three would be Panama, Mexico, Paraguay are probably the top three that have
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:22.740]   minimal kind of time on the ground requirements, and they all work about the same.
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:30.300]   Basically you're going to need to make some kind of investment into the country, so Panama
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:35.500]   has the Friendly Nations Visa, again, Mikel's going to go over all those details there of
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.220]   that, but basically there's going to be a variety of different options for you to make
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.900]   an investment into the country in some way.
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:47.020]   Now sometimes that can be done by simply opening a company, so you open a company, put money
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.720]   in a bank account, et cetera.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.220]   Sometimes it can be done by actually purchasing land or something in the country.
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.300]   Sometimes it's done just by showing, "Hey, I have this amount of money in the bank,"
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.620]   or "I have this amount of passive income."
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:06.020]   So if you have income that is regular and that's coming in from a pension or some passive
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.700]   source, pretty much, I would say 80% of Latin America, you can get a residence permit with
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.700]   that.
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:19.340]   Now all of the residence permits that I am aware of in Latin America, all of the residence
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.540]   permits are going to require you to physically go to the country.
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.140]   None of these countries are doing scams, none of them where it's just, "Oh, fill out something
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.140]   online."
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.820]   All of them are going to require you to go to the country, and I would say that if you
[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:37.580]   don't have at least some connection to the country or desire to have some connection
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.780]   to the country, then that's probably not a country you should choose.
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.500]   When it was a few years ago and I was in a position kind of like what I'm guessing you're
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:51.060]   in, which means that I didn't have much of a backup plan, I was from one country, I didn't
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:55.820]   have a long solution of anything, then I thought to myself, "Oh, you know what?
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:02.060]   I'll go anywhere, I'll do anything, et cetera, and I'll definitely go where I can just get
[00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.940]   a permit and even if I'm only going just to renew my permit, that's going to be fine."
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:12.620]   Well things changed and as time went on, I realized that's probably not really enough.
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:18.740]   And so if I were you, I would rather see you choose a residence permit or some kind of
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:27.780]   backup plan in a country that has a "less high quality program" but that you actually
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:33.340]   want to spend time in or go to or are going to enjoy traveling to than someone with a
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.780]   better program that you just don't want to go.
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:41.180]   And so before I would encourage you to go deep into Panama or any country, I would say
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:45.980]   you owe it to yourself to at least visit the place if capable.
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:50.380]   Now, you can visit it with the plan of going and establishing for the first time with a
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.100]   plan of establishing residency, that's fine, I've done that.
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:57.740]   But what I'm saying is that if that's the only thing and you don't find other things
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.580]   that attract you to it, it may not be the best thing.
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:07.300]   And so in some cases, you might be better off to choosing something that's closer to
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:13.940]   home for where you are in the Czech Republic or looking for something that's closer to
[00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.380]   home.
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.540]   You asked another question that I – oh, costs, I think it was.
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:27.180]   Basically, once you – with most residency programs, especially in Latin America, it's
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:32.260]   a few thousand dollars of lawyer fees, a few thousand dollars of miscellaneous fees to
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.620]   get all of your stuff and then the cost of the paperwork.
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:40.860]   And so the costs are fairly accessible, it's just a matter of finding out do I need to
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:45.220]   purchase property, if I do need to purchase property, how much, is it going to be a good
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.500]   investment, is there a way to make money on it, etc.
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.980]   And those are of course very personal questions that are going to come down to how much money
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.180]   do you want to invest.
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:59.300]   The world of internationalization is wide open to somebody who's willing to invest
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.300]   money and you can make money on it.
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:08.240]   You can go to many places where they have formalized residency by investment programs
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.620]   or citizenship by investment programs and invest in those countries.
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:15.780]   And if your investment is large enough, you can – almost any country will roll out the
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.020]   carpet for you.
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.920]   But that's where it's fairly personal and you'll want to look through your investment
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.380]   portfolio and choose something that is appropriate to you.
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:28.740]   So I know I'm sidestepping the answer slightly, it's simply because I can't quote off the
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:33.340]   top of my head all of the details of the Panamanian programs.
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:38.680]   I will be able to after January, but that's Mikel's job.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.280]   But did I give you something to think about there?
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.960]   Do you want to ask another question?
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.280]   No, I appreciate it, thank you.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:51.520]   I'll just go to Mikel's podcast, but this was also helpful.
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.520]   Thank you.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.520]   Good, good.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.140]   Have you also, being from the Czech Republic, have you and – if you're married – have
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:02.160]   you and your wife fully looked into your European heritage to see if there are any other options
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.880]   that are available to you with your European heritage?
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.560]   Yes, we have.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.000]   Unfortunately, everyone's just European.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:20.280]   We would at best get a – maybe get a second passport for another EU country, which is
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:27.800]   – well, it's a good start, but it doesn't solve our problems, really.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.720]   Not necessarily, but I think you should still do it.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.120]   What would be the other country that you might have the ability to claim a passport for?
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.120]   Sweden.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.120]   Sweden.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.680]   So I think that Europeans don't tend to do this because they don't see the point.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:46.040]   Like, look, we're all in the EU, there's no point, EU's going to be fine, et cetera,
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:51.040]   and they don't go and claim heritage passports because they just don't want to do it.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.560]   But I would point out to you a few things.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:57.320]   Your first step, before you go and establish a residency somewhere else, your first step
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:03.720]   should be to claim any kind of heritage citizenship that you have the ability to claim, you should
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.520]   claim it and you should get the documentation for it.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:10.440]   Now one reason people don't do that is they don't want to pay for the passport fees.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.440]   Maybe it's 150 euros every 10 years, something like that.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.880]   I think that's a small price to pay for something that could be passed along and endure
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:22.240]   for your children, be passed along throughout the many years, et cetera.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:26.920]   So you should do it even – but you don't always have to get the passport.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.400]   So I've worked with families who didn't have a lot of money, but they had a bunch
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.560]   of children, and then my point was go ahead and register for the citizenship, get your
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:39.120]   documentation, and even if you don't keep the passports current, at least have that.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:44.760]   The next thing is that even within the European Union, yes, it is true that if you were to
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:49.640]   put side by side, say, a Swedish passport with a Czech passport, there would be a very
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:54.880]   similar profile and both of them give you easy access to the European Union.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:13:00.200]   That may be true, but that doesn't mean that it's always the case that there's
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.200]   no value.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.420]   So I couldn't comment on Sweden and Czech Republic, but countries I do know about.
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:10.080]   Say you're a citizen of France and you have the ability to be a citizen of France, well,
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:14.080]   as a French citizen, you would have access to all of the French overseas territories
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:19.360]   that you don't have access to as a Czech citizen, or similar with the Netherlands.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.640]   The Netherlands, huge number of overseas territories that Dutch citizens can move to with minimal
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.760]   paperwork but that Czech citizens can't.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.400]   And so there are benefits to having the different passports.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.480]   And then in addition to that, trying to find your happiness this winter?

[00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.240]   You deserve this.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:03.560]   Go from here to happiness, flying direct with Fiji Airways.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:11.760]   I don't think the European Union as a project is dead this decade, but it's one of those
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:18.040]   things where it wouldn't surprise me if in 50 years it were either disbanded or very
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.800]   different than it is now.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:25.800]   And you see enough cracks in it to recognize the value of having those things claimed.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.780]   But countries like Sweden, if you don't maintain your ties to the country, then your options
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.280]   can be limited there.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:38.560]   So before you go and establish necessarily your foreign residence on the other side of
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:46.760]   the world, you should first go ahead and claim any other citizenships that you have access
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:50.920]   to and then go ahead and build your plan B of a place that I'd want to go.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:54.160]   And then don't think also that it has to be on the other side of the world.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:59.880]   So Latin America is great and it's pretty accessible from Europe depending on where
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.880]   you are.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:05.260]   And Latin America has the benefit of being a very open place with lots of great programs
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.260]   that are a great deal.
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:14.520]   But again, if you're not willing to go there and look forward to those trips, then I think
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:19.600]   you should consider something that is closer to home where you would actually want to go.
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.160]   So I know I'm repeating myself there, but claim the Swedish citizenship and for any
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.240]   other European listeners, go ahead and claim the citizenship.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:31.240]   Even if you don't maintain four passports that all have a red or burgundy cover, that's
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.240]   fine.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.080]   But at least claim the citizenships and keep them current because your children and your
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.760]   grandchildren may be very grateful that you did.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:43.560]   Thank you Joshua, this is very helpful.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.560]   My pleasure.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.560]   Thank you.
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.560]   We move on to Timothy in Virginia.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.560]   Timothy, welcome to the show.
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.560]   How can I serve you today?
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:53.040]   Hi Joshua, thanks for taking my call.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.040]   I have what probably is a quick question for you, which is I'm hoping you can just give
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:03.760]   me a quick and dirty answer to how you would go about sort of a low budget, low hanging
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.800]   fruit audio recording setup.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:11.120]   So for background, I have a two and a half year old son and he's got one of those sort
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.600]   of proprietary format music players for toddlers.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:19.120]   And we figured out that he really likes when I record his picture books, put them all on
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.120]   a card as it turns out in this format for him.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.580]   And then he just listens to them over and over again, far in excess of how much time
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.400]   I could spend reading to him.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.920]   Anyway, I just want to sort of up the quality on that a little bit.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:36.760]   I've done recording on my phone and sometimes the microphone isn't great.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.880]   And then I guess the other piece of the question is post-processing.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.880]   I'm not sure what a good tool would be to get the volume sort of set at the right level,
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:50.360]   maybe equalize the different tracks so that again, it just works a little bit better.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.380]   Absolutely.
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:57.120]   When you recorded on your phone and you said the quality wasn't great, did you take any
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:02.920]   pains to create something like a recording booth, even if it was in your closet or something
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.800]   like that?
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.800]   Spend it all.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.800]   Okay.
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:12.240]   So there is your basic problem because if you don't want to spend any money, I'll tell
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.760]   you the thing that you don't want to spend any money on, you already have it and it's
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.800]   the phone.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.000]   It's your phone.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.360]   Not a headset, not necessarily, not an ear pod, air pods or anything like that, just
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.160]   the actual phone.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:31.720]   And the microphone that is in the phone is perfectly functional and can be perfectly
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.360]   high quality.
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:40.640]   But the kind of microphone that it is requires you to spend some time and effort on basically
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.800]   an acoustic system.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:46.440]   And so the best thing that you can do is walk into your walk-in closet where you're surrounded
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.920]   by fabric, coats, et cetera.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:54.160]   Go into the very back corner of the closet, slide aside your coats and whatever soft things
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:18:00.200]   are there hanging and set your phone on the shelf in front of you where it'll be completely
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:04.240]   surrounded by fabric in the back of a carpeted closet, et cetera.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:08.720]   And basically what you're trying to do is you're trying to use any version of that where
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.440]   you have sound deadening.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:18.080]   So for example, I recently recorded sometime back, I recorded a podcast in a hotel.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.760]   We were traveling, my family was in the room, there was no business center, we were in an
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:27.200]   airport hotel, so I was out by the airport, I couldn't find any decent place to record
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.320]   like I usually can.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:33.040]   So I wound up going to a corner of the lobby, I pushed the couch back, I sat down on the
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:37.560]   floor behind the couch, I took the couch cushions, put them over my head and my audio quality,
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:42.080]   no one really would have known that it was perfectly reasonable.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.400]   And I tried to create instead of an echoey room, even what I have right now, which I'll
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:49.440]   explain in a moment, I tried to create some form of sound dampening.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.060]   And so if you do that and then you put your mouth about a foot and a half, two feet away
[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:56.680]   from the phone, something like that, and you speak in a good tone of voice, you'll get
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:00.040]   a perfectly usable recording from that.
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:05.240]   And there's really no need for you to go out and purchase other microphones if that's good
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.640]   enough for you.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:11.540]   But it won't work if you sit at your desk where it's hard surfaces, it won't work if
[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.780]   you are in your living room where there's a lot of echoey space.
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:19.640]   It needs to be a small room with as much fabric and padding as possible and then you can just
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.640]   use your phone.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:27.500]   The second thing that you do with it is then process it and there's lots of audio processing
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.180]   equipment that you can use if you know what you're doing.
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:35.820]   So there's a free one that you can use called Audacity that's available for all of the platforms.
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:39.200]   That's the most popular and it's a very powerful audio editing system.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.120]   So if you want to trim your audio or you want to break it up into tracks and things like
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:47.960]   that, just take the audio file that you created on your phone and then move it into Audacity
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.400]   on your computer and you can edit it there.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:56.300]   And you can also do any kind of dynamic corrections that you want to do.
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:03.160]   What I would recommend to you is use a service, use something called Auphonic.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.420]   And Auphonic is A-U-P-H-O-N-I-C.
[00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:07.920]   This is different from Audacity.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:13.280]   Audacity is the free open source piece of audio editing equipment that you can put on
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.280]   your computers.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:21.080]   Auphonic is an automatic piece of software that will automatically help to improve your
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.080]   audio quality.
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.380]   And it basically does two or three things.
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:30.640]   The first thing it does is you can run a background noise processor on it.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:34.280]   So let's say that there's some kind of hiss or let's say you have some electrical noise
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:39.560]   that slips into your recording or just some background noise or something like that.
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:47.200]   Auphonic uses basically an algorithm to trim that background noise out of the system.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:54.040]   The second thing that Auphonic will do is it will level the voices.
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:21:02.360]   And so there is a standard in audio recording for the loudness for an audio track.
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:07.960]   And so all professionally produced podcasts or audio books, etc. will have a consistent
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.120]   loudness factor.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:15.840]   And so what Auphonic will do is it will automatically create that loudness with your voice file
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.320]   using an algorithm.
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.680]   And it does a really good job with it and it's really simple.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.800]   And so you can actually just put the Auphonic app on your phone and you can buy a little
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:24.800]   time from them.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:25.800]   They give you a little bit free.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.040]   I don't remember how much.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.700]   And then you can just run it through the app and it'll give you the MP3 out the other side.
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:35.320]   And so when I record a podcast episode on my phone, I just hold out my phone in front
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.320]   of me.
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.480]   And if I find a soft environment, like let's say that I'm on the road, sometimes I'll sit
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.020]   in a car or someplace where there's fabric and the sound waves aren't going to be bouncing
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:45.020]   all over the place.
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:49.840]   I'll hold my phone about a foot or so in front of me, I'll record and then I just upload
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:53.240]   it straight to the Auphonic app on my phone and then from there it can go straight to
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.480]   the podcast feed.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.560]   In your case, it would just go straight to an audio file that you can download and put
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.120]   onto your son's MP3 player.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.040]   And I would say that that's probably all that you need.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:09.020]   If you want to buy a microphone, then what you're going to look for is, and I won't go
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:11.760]   through specific models, I'll just tell you what you need to know.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:17.600]   If you want to buy a microphone, look for something that is called a dynamic microphone.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:22.320]   And a dynamic microphone as contrasted with a condenser microphone.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:28.360]   So if you were to go to a professional audio studio to record your audio book or something
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:32.840]   like that, you would be standing in front of a condenser microphone.
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:37.840]   And a condenser microphone is really wonderful because it creates a really high quality audio
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.460]   recording because it picks up all the sound.
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:45.180]   But the problem is in order for it to function well, you need to have a very well built sound
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.440]   booth or sound stage with good acoustics.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:55.440]   A dynamic microphone is the kind of microphone that a news reporter holds in his hands while
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.940]   he's standing in a noisy crowd.
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:04.000]   And it's designed to only really pick up what is close to the microphone and to exclude
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.080]   most of the noise that's around.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:11.600]   And so I record, basically all of my microphones are dynamic microphones.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:16.560]   And what that means is that I don't really give much thought at all to sound treatment.
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.960]   I don't record in a sound booth.
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:23.960]   I can record basically anywhere because I have a dynamic microphone.
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:28.920]   And you can buy a dynamic microphone that you can plug into your computer with a USB
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:29.920]   cable.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:30.920]   That works really well.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.600]   I'm not current in all the models.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:37.280]   The model that I used to recommend for that was the Audio-Technica ATR2100.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.760]   But I'm sure that they have changed that.
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:44.320]   But if you just do a web search of some kind for dynamic microphone with USB input, you'll
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.120]   find lots of those.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:51.520]   And then there's a whole slew of new microphones that are available for podcasters, et cetera,
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.960]   that will give you a direct connection to your computer so you can record directly into
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.580]   a program like Audacity.
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:00.320]   But you can do it sitting at your desk and you don't need any kind of sound treatment.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:03.840]   And so those are my recommendations of how to start.
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:08.520]   But I think your cell phone is good enough as long as you do the recordings in your closet.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.800]   Great.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:11.800]   Thanks for all those recommendations.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:12.800]   That's what I needed.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.800]   My pleasure.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.400]   We move on to Teresa in Missouri.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.400]   Welcome, Teresa.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.400]   How can I serve you today?
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.400]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:22.240]   This is Brendan, not Teresa, but it's okay.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.040]   That was surprising.
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.480]   Go ahead.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:32.840]   I have a question about everyone's favorite topic, which is permanent or whole life insurance.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:39.640]   I've been working with a financial guy from Northwestern about two things, exploring whole
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.540]   life insurance and then disability insurance, disability.
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:46.440]   I'm fine with what he's proposed and everything.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.800]   The rates look reasonable.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:54.960]   On the whole life side, however, he's explained it to me several different ways.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:01.240]   And I'll be honest, the whole thing kind of seems like a pyramid scheme.
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:07.720]   He shows me this table and the basis is, you don't want everything in the stock market
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:13.040]   because you want to draw on a different asset base, which is tax advantage when the market
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.140]   is down in retirement.
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:16.600]   And that makes sense.
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:23.460]   But there's, in my opinion, there's ways around, there's ways to achieve that in retirement
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:29.680]   or closer to retirement than for me at 27 years old, for me and my wife to open up whole
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:36.800]   life policy and pile a bunch of money in there and the cash value doesn't actually break
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.160]   even until year 13.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:48.960]   And in addition to that, I don't see how the tax advantage-ness of the cash value when
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:57.360]   you take it out of the account outweighs that return risk, so to speak, because if anything
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:03.160]   changes between me and my wife's age now and 10 years from now, a lot can happen, especially
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:07.440]   since we're starting to raise a family and we don't know what our situation is going
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:11.220]   to look like after kids are here.
[00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:18.440]   So anyway, I don't think that necessarily outweighs the inflexibility of, or sorry,
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:24.340]   I guess rather flexibility, if we were to keep the money in, you know, CD, high yield
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:31.920]   savings account, bonds, what have you, just in a brokerage account and manage it our way.
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:37.040]   Am I missing something that I haven't considered yet?
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.520]   Or is that basically it?
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:42.080]   What's your household income?
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:49.200]   Between my wife and I, we make about $250,000.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.040]   Do you need whole life insurance?
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:57.680]   Well, to answer that question, you have to say, "Do I need life insurance?"
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:05.240]   So remember, first of all, if you do not value having whole life insurance, or let me use
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:10.360]   the word permanent life insurance, meaning life insurance that's going to last forever,
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.420]   I don't think you should buy it.
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:16.960]   If it's exclusively an investment play where you're trying to say, "Okay, there's the
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:21.960]   cash value and that's the only thing you care about," then I don't think anybody should
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.840]   buy whole life insurance in that situation.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:30.680]   You need to at least appreciate the whole life insurance, that factor of the whole life
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.880]   insurance.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:36.280]   So that would be the first thing that I think is important to note.
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.960]   Now it might be difficult for you in your mid to late 20s.
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.480]   You said 27 you were?
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.880]   That's right.
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:43.880]   Okay.
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:48.480]   Do you currently own life insurance, term life insurance?
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:53.240]   The only life insurance my wife and I own is through our employers at that standard
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:57.000]   one-year salary.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.800]   So I had this conversation exactly with the advisor, I said, "As of right now, if you
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:06.280]   remove the word whole and just said, 'Do you need life insurance?'"
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:12.520]   I'd say, "No, because if either my wife or I were to die today, we could take off work
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:18.040]   for a year with all the money we have saved now, we would be totally fine, and a year
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:22.600]   from now, either one of us could pick up and carry on with our lives."
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:23.600]   Right.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:24.600]   Right.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.600]   So here's where I think.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:31.920]   I think you've got a young advisor who hasn't figured out how to sell guys like you insurance,
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:35.880]   and he's being super intellectual, which I'm willing to be intellectual, right?
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.080]   I don't make any commissions, et cetera.
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.520]   But I think he's being silly for not first selling you insurance.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:47.720]   Because in my experience, any time I tried to sell a 27-year-old insurance who didn't
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:53.480]   own insurance first, they just didn't have the same appreciation of it.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:58.180]   And so if I were in his shoes trying to sell you life insurance, I wouldn't be trying to
[00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:01.840]   sell you whole life insurance, I'd be trying to sell you term life insurance.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:06.200]   And I would speak about it kind of the way that I speak about it publicly, which is somewhat
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.200]   flippantly.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:11.700]   I would emphasize the fact that, meaning I wouldn't drag you through a long detailed
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:15.240]   needs analysis, because you just said it yourself, "I don't need the stuff.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.240]   Don't need it."
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:19.200]   And after all, if I died, my wife would be fine.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:25.080]   She's got a year worth of stuff, she can go and she can take care of herself, she can
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.680]   go find someone else, she can work for herself, I'd be fine if she was gone, et cetera.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.040]   You don't really need it.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:36.240]   And so the reason you're wrestling with it is because most guys in your situation will
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.960]   wrestle with it.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:42.600]   Being 27, being male, not having children, never having owned significant amounts of
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.840]   life insurance, you don't really value those things.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:51.000]   And so you're open to it, that's why you're calling me, but you don't value those things
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   on a real basis.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.480]   What I'll tell you is that I value insurance.
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.480]   I value it enormously.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:03.720]   And I value it regardless of whether I have children or not.
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:08.040]   There's a whole discussion there, et cetera, that it does change quite a lot when you have
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.240]   children.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:16.600]   But I value the ability that I had as a young man before I really had any significant assets.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:21.560]   I valued the ability that I had to take care of people around me.
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:25.960]   And for a 27-year-old guy, non-smoker, you could buy a million dollars of life insurance
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.540]   for about 50 bucks a month, probably less.
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:34.740]   And so in your world, 50 bucks a month doesn't make any difference whatsoever to your budget.
[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:39.800]   But once you own a term life insurance policy with a million dollars of coverage, and you
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:45.400]   recognize that, hey, if I die, my wife is going to be, she's in good shape, or my parents,
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.720]   they're going to have half a million dollars that's going to see them through, it starts
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.720]   to change things.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:53.080]   And I vividly remember when I was a young life insurance agent, because remember, I
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.200]   started selling life insurance at 23 years old.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:01.700]   And so I was trying to sell people who were, I sold a lot of people in my natural market,
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:06.000]   people who were not parents, sometimes they were single, et cetera.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.680]   And this good friend of mine bought a life insurance policy from me.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:15.340]   And he was a young guy, single guy, he was getting a job, it doesn't matter.
[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:19.180]   But he bought a term life insurance policy from me, bought a disability insurance and
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.400]   a term life insurance policy from me.
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:25.040]   And there was not much, and it was basically a conversation like this.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:32.300]   And this guy loved to fish, and he would go out on his boat, he would drive up from South
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:37.700]   Florida up to his family's place in Southwest Florida, excuse me, Northwest Florida, and
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:39.260]   he would go fishing on the bay.
[00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:43.740]   And he told me one time, after he owned the policy about six months or so, he said, you
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:44.980]   know, something happened recently.
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:48.860]   And he'd gone out fishing on the bay, and he'd done something dumb, and he almost fell
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:53.300]   on top of his, I can't remember, maybe it was his spear, I mean, this is a long time
[00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:54.300]   ago.
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:57.260]   But he did something where he wondered if he was going to make it.
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:02.160]   And he was out by himself on the boat fishing by himself, and he almost killed himself.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:08.420]   And he realized, and he told me, unprompted, he realized how glad he was that he had bought
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:13.140]   a term life insurance policy from me, because of the money that it allowed him to pass along
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:18.980]   for his family, for his parents, etc.
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:22.100]   And that always stuck with me, because I had the same feeling.
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:26.260]   I never owned life insurance until I signed up at 23 years old to be a life insurance
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:27.260]   agent.
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.260]   I didn't know what it felt like.
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:31.500]   And then I bought life insurance, but I bought it just because I figured I should own what
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:32.500]   I had.
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:36.340]   But after a while, I started to recognize, no, it feels really good to know that, in
[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:39.340]   my case, my first beneficiary was my parents.
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:43.900]   It feels really good to know that I've taken care of my parents if I'm dead.
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.980]   Because after all, I'm their son, I'll take care of them, etc.
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:53.340]   And so what I've found is that, as the years go by, and you actually have life insurance,
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:54.940]   most men appreciate that.
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:33:00.380]   And they start to recognize the value of that, that they're able to take care of their loved
[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:02.820]   ones even if they're dead and gone.
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:08.540]   And by purchasing insurance, they're able to control large amounts of money for their
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:10.580]   loved ones if they're not here.
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:14.620]   And we have unlimited amounts of confidence, when we're young, in our ability to make
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:19.540]   our wives multi-millionaires many times over, and our parents are going to live their golden
[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:22.380]   age in comfort, etc.
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:27.440]   But it's very much ambition when we're young, and yet life insurance is a tool that allows
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:30.120]   us to actually make that happen.
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:34.620]   And so until you actually own life insurance, I don't think you're going to get any of
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:35.620]   those emotions.
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.900]   You're not going to experience that.
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:41.780]   That's only going to come when you actually buy a life insurance policy.
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:46.580]   An individual life insurance policy is not at your job, a term life insurance policy,
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:47.740]   so it's inexpensive.
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:51.900]   And then you'll recognize that, "Hey, I've got this covered, and that's going to be something
[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:54.100]   that takes care of other people."
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:57.220]   So that would be the first thing that I would suggest to you.
[00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:02.660]   Now, the next thing that happens is you need to, if you were to buy permanent life insurance,
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:07.580]   you would need to actually appreciate the value of having that life insurance around
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:08.580]   forever.
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:11.000]   And I don't think this happens as quickly.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:17.940]   But what happens is that when we are younger, we are filled again with unlimited amounts
[00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:22.140]   of confidence about our ability to be rich very, very quickly.
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:27.840]   And then what happens is sometimes it doesn't go as quickly as we had imagined, and we suffer
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.580]   various setbacks.
[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:33.780]   And a business fails, or we make some dumb decisions and lose a bunch of money, or we
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:38.700]   go through a divorce, or something happens.
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:42.460]   And what we realize is that life is more precarious.
[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:48.140]   And it's not unusual for a guy who's, say, 47 – let's say you buy a 20-year term policy
[00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:52.660]   when you're 27, which I don't recommend – but you get to 47, and all of a sudden you realize,
[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:54.860]   "You know, I'm still a little behind."
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:59.420]   And then what happens is also you watch people go through medical things, and you start to
[00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:01.180]   be aware of your mortality.
[00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:05.820]   Usually this happens as you maybe approach about your 35th, 40th, 45th birthday, somewhere
[00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:06.820]   in there.
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:11.620]   Whereas at the stage of life that you're in as a young man, you think that it's pretty
[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:18.820]   unlikely that you yourself would ever be significantly sick or significantly disabled in any way.
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:23.380]   But you reach my age, as I'm approaching my fifth decade, and I'm not that much older,
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:28.520]   but then I see enough people around that are peers of mine.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:32.580]   And this guy has a stroke, that guy has a heart attack, this guy breaks his legs, and
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:36.020]   you realize, "I'm mortal," and that mortality hits you.
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:40.700]   And when that mortality hits you, you recognize that while you may be blessed with good genetics,
[00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:45.900]   as I am, and probably you are, and while you yourself may do everything possible to maintain
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:50.900]   your health, et cetera, there's a certain amount that none of us control.
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:57.060]   And if you wind up behind on your money, and you wind up worrying about your mortality,
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:01.300]   then all of a sudden the idea of having whole life insurance hits differently, and you're
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:04.540]   more grateful for it, because instead of having to figure out, "Am I going to die this year
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:09.220]   or not," then you're worried about those things.
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:14.060]   And so those are just some lessons that I learned selling life insurance, and I think
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:17.080]   the guy that you're an agent hasn't learned that yet.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:22.100]   Because I think most experienced agents, if they walked into a situation like a sales
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:26.660]   situation, if I were advising that agent in the sales situation that he's in, based upon
[00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:30.340]   the two minutes you told me, I would tell that agent, "You're a fool for bringing up
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:31.940]   the idea of whole life insurance."
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:35.220]   I would sell you disability income insurance, I would sell you a million dollar term life
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:38.140]   insurance, maybe two, and I would move on.
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:42.100]   And I would come back a year later, and after you've owned those things for a year, I would
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:45.140]   check in and see how you're feeling, and then I would just start converting the term life
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:46.540]   insurance.
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:50.220]   Now we'll move to the intellectual thing about like, well, should one versus another?
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:55.680]   But I think just from life experience, that's what's at the core of kind of this conflict
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:00.020]   you're feeling, is you don't yet value life insurance, and you certainly don't value whole
[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:01.020]   life insurance.
[00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:05.540]   It's just purely a cash on cash return, where do I get more money, setting up a seedy ladder
[00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.700]   at my bank, or a life insurance policy.
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:08.700]   Do you agree?
[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:09.700]   Yes.
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:10.700]   I agree.
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:12.600]   All right.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.140]   So now let me address your question directly.
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:17.940]   And by the way, let me just be to you.
[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:21.380]   For your situation, I don't think you should buy whole life insurance.
[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:23.340]   I think you should just buy a disability policy.
[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:26.460]   I think you should buy a term insurance policy from your guy.
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:30.620]   Make sure it's an annual renewable term policy, so you have lots of flexibility.
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:31.620]   Buy one for you.
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:32.740]   Buy one for your wife.
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.100]   Let it go.
[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:37.540]   The other thing is from a purely investment standpoint, because let's talk about kind
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:43.060]   of intellectually, et cetera, from a purely investment standpoint, buying whole life insurance
[00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:48.060]   should be behind maxing out all of your retirement accounts.
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:52.860]   And so I want to make sure that your 401(k) is maxed out, your wife's 401(k) is completely
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:57.140]   maxed out, access to Roth IRAs, if you're eligible, is maxed out.
[00:37:57.140 --> 00:38:01.780]   I want to make sure you're maxing out every possible account, because those accounts,
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:07.900]   when pushed against life insurance, they share all of the same benefits that life insurance
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:14.020]   has, but yet they're superior because of better potential investment returns, because of stocks
[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:20.020]   versus bonds, as well as superior for matching money, tax breaks, et cetera.
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:24.900]   So it's only after you've maxed out all of those things that we would come back to whole
[00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:30.060]   life insurance and say, "Does this play a role in your plan?"
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:32.060]   Does that make sense intellectually?
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:34.060]   Yes, it does.
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.060]   Okay.
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:42.100]   Now, life insurance has a couple of features that you can't match yourself in a fixed income
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:45.900]   portfolio or something like a seedy ladder.
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:52.220]   Those features may or may not be valuable to you based upon where you are in life.
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:57.380]   So first, life insurance provides you with an insurance benefit.
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:01.500]   I'm not going to go through it in depth, but that's what I mentioned to you, because life
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:04.900]   insurance gives you insurance, and that's really valuable.
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:10.440]   Because even though your cost of premium versus benefit of death benefit is so much bigger
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:15.220]   with term life insurance, $50 a month, $1 million of coverage, whereas with your whole
[00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:21.740]   life policy, it's $600 a month, $1 million of coverage, what kind of policy are you looking
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:24.020]   at in terms of numbers?
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:36.460]   For me, it was $6,000 a year, and the death benefit immediately was $450,000.
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:40.260]   Here's a $5 bet.
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:43.460]   Cold drink next time we see each other in person.
[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:46.940]   Guarantee you, your agent that you're talking to has been in the business less than three
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:54.500]   years, guarantee you, because he's doing what I would have done in times past until I learned
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:58.620]   that this is a dumb way to sell life insurance and whatnot.
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:02.780]   So yeah, $500 a month for what was the face amount you said?
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:03.780]   $450,000.
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:06.420]   For $450,000, right.
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.740]   So there's a big difference between $50 a month and over a million of coverage versus
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:12.140]   $500 a month and $450,000.
[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:18.700]   However, if you were to go and put $500 a month into your seedy ladder, it would take
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:24.020]   you several decades before you wind up with $450,000 of coverage in it.
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:30.540]   And so even though the cost now with whole life insurance is significantly higher than
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:35.860]   the cost of term life insurance, you do still get a significant benefit that if you put
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:42.500]   that $6,000 in this year, $6,000 for the next three years, you're $18,000 in, but then you
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:48.220]   die and your beneficiary gets $450,000, that's a benefit.
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:53.820]   And you can't replicate that with a seedy ladder without also going out and supplementing
[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:55.520]   a term insurance policy.
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:04.500]   So that's the first feature that whole life insurance has that your own investment has.
[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:06.220]   Hello, Jan from Toyota here.
[00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:07.220]   Hi, Jan.
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:08.220]   Just wanted to say thanks.
[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:13.100]   With the Grand Highlander we got at Toyotathon, we've been able to do so much, including five
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:19.420]   different ski trips, four family functions, three potlucks, two shopping sprees, and we
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.740]   even got a really big tree.
[00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:24.660]   Wow, I'm really impressed.
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:27.940]   Dealer inventory Mayberry offers our subject to change throughout Toyotathon, which ends
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:28.940]   on January 2nd.
[00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:31.420]   See your participating Toyota dealer for details.
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:34.380]   Toyota, let's go places.
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:42.500]   The second feature that the term insurance has is that it is primarily a fixed income
[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.020]   asset.
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:47.340]   And so this can be an advantage or a disadvantage.
[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:53.540]   The disadvantage is that you're generally going to have a lower overall rate of return
[00:41:53.540 --> 00:42:00.020]   than you will have from your stock investments, because generally the return on bonds is lower
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:05.620]   than the return on stocks because lenders make less money than owners.
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:07.520]   Owners make more money than lenders.
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:10.100]   Of course, the flip side is that you get less volatility.
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:21.460]   And in a life insurance policy, in exchange for lower return, you get zero volatility.
[00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:26.380]   So you get an asset that increases in value each and every year on a guaranteed basis
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:27.900]   no matter what.
[00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:35.420]   And that can be a useful feature in smoothing out other aspects of your portfolio.
[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:41.500]   So if you have a highly volatile investment portfolio and you also have money that is
[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:48.220]   not volatile, then if things are bad in your other investments, in your volatile investments,
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:52.880]   at least you still have a pot of money here that is not volatile.
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:58.700]   And that's a huge feature that life insurance has that is very valuable in supplementing
[00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.480]   those other pots of money.
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:05.180]   I think we all of us should never have all of our money in volatile investments.
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:11.900]   We should always have a few safer pots of money that are our insurance funds.
[00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:17.000]   And I mean that loosely, but it can be quite literally insurance funds because it balances
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.760]   out the other things that we're doing.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:23.280]   And so that's a feature of whole life insurance.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:30.100]   You can replicate that feature with a CD ladder, a bond ladder, your own bond fund.
[00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:36.360]   The bond fund can be tricky because if you're in a bond fund and interest rates increase,
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:38.640]   then of course your bond values would decrease.
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:42.860]   And so you don't face that risk in a whole life insurance policy.
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:46.280]   Your cash values will never decrease in a whole life policy.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:50.880]   Whereas if you're investing in a bond fund, your actual values could decrease.
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:55.920]   But generally you could build that with, as you said, a CD ladder or individual bond purchases,
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:58.000]   a bond ladder of some kind.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   The third feature of life insurance is that the inside buildup of cash values is tax deferred.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:13.040]   And so as those cash values increase, there is no current tax owed on those increases.
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:18.480]   And that's not the same case if you have your CD ladder or your bond ladder.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:24.320]   So if you build your CD ladder or your bond ladder at your bank, every year that those
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:32.400]   bonds come due or mature, you're going to have interest and you're going to pay that
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.480]   interest at current tax rates.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:38.680]   Whereas the inside buildup of cash values are not taxed currently.
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:41.160]   So that's a feature of life insurance.
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:49.920]   The next feature of whole life insurance is that in some cases, in some states, cash value
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:56.040]   in a life insurance policy is exempt from the claims of creditors by state law.
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:00.840]   And so let's say that you accumulate $100,000 in a life insurance policy as compared to
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:04.320]   $100,000 in a CD ladder that you have at your bank.
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:09.240]   Well if somebody sues you and they win a lawsuit against you, they would be able to claim against
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:15.440]   your $100,000 in the bank, whereas they wouldn't be able to if you live in a state where those
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.280]   assets are protected.
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:23.320]   Similar things of bankruptcy claims, et cetera, is that in some cases, in some states, even
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:27.640]   through bankruptcy, your assets in your life insurance policy are exempt from the claims
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:31.580]   of creditors, whereas the assets that are at your bank are not.
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:37.420]   And so for some people that can be more valuable or less valuable.
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:43.040]   When we get to the concept of actually withdrawing money, it gets complicated, and I like to
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:50.200]   avoid that a lot of times in public conversation because it's a bit sticky.
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:56.160]   One feature of life insurance is that you can gain access to the cash values through
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:04.380]   the form of a policy loan, and that policy loan is not taxable when you take it out.
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:10.600]   And so if you compare that to, say, the CD ladder, there's just not really any comparison.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:15.380]   You wouldn't take a loan necessarily against your CD ladder, although you could in theory
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:17.760]   pledge it as collateral, but you wouldn't take a loan.
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:25.020]   And because you're being taxed on that on a current basis, it's not perfectly comparable.
[00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:29.860]   This feature of a life insurance policy can be an advantage, meaning you can get the money
[00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:34.140]   out with no tax, but it can also be a disadvantage because what the insurance agent undoubtedly
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:38.900]   is not telling you is that if you ever cancel the policy and lapse the policy, cancel the
[00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:44.460]   policy, et cetera, then all of your gain in the policy is taxed to you as ordinary income.
[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:49.860]   And so if you don't keep the policy in force forever, then all of your benefits, all of
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:55.160]   those tax benefits just slide away because now it's taxed to you as ordinary income when
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:56.160]   the policy is canceled.
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:00.580]   You would get your basis out first to tax-free, and then all of your gain is taxed as ordinary
[00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:01.580]   income.
[00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:05.820]   Now, ordinarily when insurance agents talk about it, they encourage you to plan to keep
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:09.740]   the policy in force, and you can keep the policy in force, but you can never quite access
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:10.740]   all of the money.
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:14.540]   And so you have to actually access – you have to want the policy.
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:18.460]   So those are the basic features that do make a life insurance policy different than what
[00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:22.780]   you could have at your bank, the CD ladder or a bond ladder.
[00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:26.740]   I don't know that one is superior to another.
[00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:31.020]   It's just a matter of do you value those features.
[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:36.500]   What I primarily use my whole life insurance for is simply as my emergency fund.
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:38.900]   And so my emergency fund, I keep money in the bank.
[00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:43.220]   I keep cash, et cetera, physical currency, et cetera, as far as my emergency fund.
[00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:47.760]   But I like to have a big emergency fund, and I don't want to go around and keep that
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:50.420]   much money in a bank account.
[00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:57.580]   And so this to me is where my whole life insurance policies really shine because they go up every
[00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:58.580]   year.
[00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:00.860]   There's no time where they ever get smaller.
[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:01.860]   They always go up.
[00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:04.260]   They're completely protected from the claims of creditors.
[00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:06.180]   I don't have to worry about them.
[00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:07.180]   They're private money.
[00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:12.260]   Yes, I have the record at the insurance companies, the money that I own, but that doesn't generally
[00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:13.700]   come up in other things.
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:16.080]   They're not tied to my credit score, et cetera.
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:17.560]   So it's private money.
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:22.420]   And then if I have an emergency and I need a lot of money, I can quickly go and get it.
[00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:25.460]   And of course, I would use a credit card first, and then if I needed to pay off the credit
[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:29.160]   card, I would just use the life insurance cash values.
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:34.260]   And to me, that feels like an appropriate thing for most people.
[00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:38.740]   And so I don't think that you should go and try to buy big, enormous policies or view
[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:41.060]   this as a primary investment objective.
[00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:45.100]   I think that just for your longer term, safer dollars that you're going to have for a long
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:49.300]   time, that's where these policies work out well.
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.260]   They're not big money makers.
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:56.260]   Mine doesn't make me a fortune, but it's a useful asset that complements some of the
[00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:58.300]   other assets.
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:01.940]   And I've used on various occasions when I needed cash, and I just go to the policy,
[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:05.660]   take it out, pay it back in a few months, a year or two, whatever is needed.
[00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:06.660]   And it's really nice.
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:10.420]   And the nice thing about it is that the interest rate, when I first started selling life insurance
[00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:13.380]   in 2003, the interest rates were down.
[00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:16.580]   And it just seemed like they just went down, down, down, down, down my entire career of
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:17.580]   selling.
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:24.080]   Well, now, and so policy interest rates, you get an 8% policy interest rate.
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:28.100]   And I always thought, because I could always borrow it much cheaper, that's no big deal.
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:31.540]   Today, as interest rates have gone up, then now all of a sudden the idea that you can
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:35.180]   borrow against your policy at 8% is a much more attractive thing.
[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:41.820]   So in summary, if I were in your shoes, I wouldn't worry too much about whole life insurance.
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:43.260]   I would buy the disability policy.
[00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:45.180]   I would buy a term life policy.
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:49.140]   If I were going to buy a whole life policy, I would buy something like a burial policy,
[00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:52.580]   you know, a $50,000 policy, something like that, something that I know I'll want around
[00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:53.580]   forever.
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:55.820]   And then I would max out all my investment accounts.
[00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:59.340]   I would take a good hard look at my career plans, etc.
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:01.900]   And then I would come back and I would reassess that in the future.
[00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:05.460]   And I would just tell the insurance agent, "Look, I'm open to it, but I'll reassess it
[00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:06.460]   in the future."
[00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:09.780]   And what I want you to be cautious of is the big downside.
[00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:14.660]   One of the big negatives of owning life insurance is that once you commit to a premium payment,
[00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:16.460]   you're committed to the premium payment.
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:22.660]   And so real example, where that's not the case with the money you put in your CD ladder.
[00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:26.580]   If you're going to put $6,000 a year in a life insurance, you've got to put that $6,000
[00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:27.580]   every year in.
[00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:31.500]   Well, if you're 27 years old, you've got a dual income, etc., no big deal.
[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:35.520]   But what if you're 29 years old and your wife's going to stay home with a baby and now your
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:37.060]   income has dropped by half?
[00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:40.260]   Well, that can be more difficult to make that $6,000 payment.
[00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:44.540]   And so I'd never want you to put an amount of money in life insurance that you're not
[00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:48.560]   very confident that you can keep making that premium payment no matter what.
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:52.100]   And that usually means you want to do something that's meaningful, but a little bit less than
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:53.340]   what you would otherwise need.
[00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:55.660]   So those are my comments.
[00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:56.660]   Go ahead.
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:57.660]   That helps a lot.
[00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:07.820]   As far as the term policies go, I come back to them and say, "Hey, I'd rather do this
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:08.820]   instead.
[00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:12.800]   What limits would you recommend, a million dollars on both my wife and I?"
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.700]   So you can do this technically with a needs analysis.
[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:17.580]   That's the correct way to do it.
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:20.540]   Needs analysis is where you sit down and you say, "All right, how much debt would need
[00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:21.900]   to be paid off?
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:24.260]   How much money would need to be provided, et cetera?"
[00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:27.820]   That's the way that an insurance agent does it, is to do a needs analysis.
[00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:31.620]   When you do a needs analysis, generally you're going to always come out for someone in your
[00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:36.180]   situation with somewhere between 10 to 20 times your annual income of life insurance.
[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:43.900]   And you do it just that way because our expenditures and our lifestyle is normally calibrated to
[00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:45.180]   our income.
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:49.380]   And so you're going to wind up with somewhere between 10 to 20 times your annual income
[00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:52.340]   of life insurance need.
[00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:59.060]   So if your income is 150 and your wife is 150 or 125 and 125, then I would recommend
[00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:03.200]   you buy at least 10 times your income for you, at least 10 times for her.
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:08.180]   If you like the idea of insurance and it feels good, buy more.
[00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:09.580]   But I don't think you're there right now.
[00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:14.640]   So with the belief that I have about insurance, I would buy more.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.700]   But with the belief that you have about insurance, if you bought a million dollars, a million
[00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:23.340]   and a half dollars for each of you, I would be totally happy because I would know that
[00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:27.260]   I've covered everything from the worst case scenario as an insurance agent, meaning my
[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:29.320]   ethical duty as an insurance agent.
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:36.140]   As an insurance agent, my ethical duty to you, the client, is to persuade you, if I'm
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:40.740]   able at all, to buy enough insurance that your loved ones are protected in the case
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:46.140]   of either death, obviously, or in the case that you can't get insurance in the future.
[00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:49.820]   So if I'm working with you at 27 years old, you don't have children, but let's assume
[00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:53.500]   that you and your wife want to have children in the future, which would be common, then
[00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:59.240]   I want to make sure that you have at least some insurance if your wife dies on childbirth
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:06.460]   or if you, two years from now, get stricken with cancer and now you can't get insurance
[00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:08.460]   anymore for the rest of your life.
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:14.320]   And what happens is that just like doctors see a lot of blood, insurance agents wind
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:17.940]   up experiencing a lot of difficult stories.
[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:22.440]   And those stories fill us with, over time, with more conviction to make sure that every
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:24.140]   family is taken care of.
[00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:29.260]   And it genuinely does become a moral duty, an ethical duty, to try to make sure that
[00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:30.260]   your family is taken care of.
[00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:33.860]   Now, if you've got at least a million dollars, I can take care of everything.
[00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:37.020]   Your family is not destitute if you're dead.
[00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:42.300]   And so while I would like you to have as much as would be appropriate to your lifestyle,
[00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:48.780]   all I really need in the case of, let's say, that you die when your baby is one year old,
[00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:55.420]   all I really need is five or six years of care for your wife so that she can get that
[00:53:55.420 --> 00:54:01.620]   one-year-old to school age and she can recalibrate and get back to a job, et cetera.
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:07.380]   And so basically, a million dollars allows that to happen, whereas a few million dollars
[00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:10.900]   means that if she ever marries again, she marries for love, not money, and the kids
[00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:13.620]   are taken care of, and college funds, et cetera.
[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:15.660]   But my job is at least enough.
[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:18.500]   And so a million dollars is at least enough.
[00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:22.580]   And then if you're willing to buy more, you should buy up to 20 times your income.
[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:23.580]   Got it.
[00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:24.580]   Thank you very much, Joshua.
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:25.580]   I appreciate it.
[00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:26.580]   I hope to answer your question.
[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:27.580]   My pleasure.
[00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:28.580]   Congratulations.
[00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:30.180]   And then we skipped over it.
[00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:31.180]   You said it.
[00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:34.820]   But just make sure that you absolutely get the disability income insurance, because that's
[00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:35.820]   the one that matters.
[00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:40.420]   If you could only afford disability, get disability, and skip the life insurance, because that's
[00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:41.700]   the one that really matters.
[00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:42.700]   We go on to Daniel in Texas.
[00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:43.700]   Daniel, welcome to the show.
[00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:44.700]   What can I serve you today?
[00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:45.860]   Thank you, Joshua.
[00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:54.340]   So my question is about buying a business and then running with it and kind of the attitude
[00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:55.340]   behind it.
[00:54:55.340 --> 00:55:02.220]   The more specific question with that is, would you ever buy a business in a close market
[00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:10.780]   to something you want to do, or close niche, and then try and shift that existing business
[00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:13.100]   to do what you want it to do?
[00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:18.300]   I can give you an example.
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:22.540]   Looking at, I would like to start a business doing decorative water features, having some
[00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:26.660]   struggles getting that off the ground into a going venture.
[00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:31.780]   And so I've kind of looked into the realm of, well, what if I bought an existing landscaping
[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:38.460]   business, especially it's easier to buy ones that are primarily maintenance.
[00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:41.940]   Obviously some of them still do some landscaping installs, et cetera, right?
[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:48.220]   And then my intention would be over time to basically shift only to the water features
[00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:54.060]   and get rid of the other stuff, at least the lawn maintenance kind of thing.
[00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:59.700]   So I guess my thought is, is that viable?
[00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:00.700]   Does that make sense?
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:04.940]   So if I go in there on day one, well, I've lost my entire customer base.
[00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:06.780]   My marketing base no longer matters, right?
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:10.300]   Because I've totally done it, I've gotten rid of that.
[00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:15.780]   But if I slowly transition, say, over a couple of years, does that make sense or is that
[00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:21.780]   a bad attitude to have or bad outlook to have when you're looking at purchasing a business?
[00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:28.340]   I think it could make sense, but the primary question to me would be, is this necessary
[00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:31.540]   for you to make the transition?
[00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:35.340]   And is this necessary for me to make the transition?
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:40.220]   So if we use that as a specific example, let's play two scenarios here.
[00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:45.820]   Scenario A is you're working a job that you despise, but you're making enough money to
[00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:48.980]   provide you with your income.
[00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:52.100]   You have enough money saved, you can go buy the landscaping business.
[00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:55.580]   You really want to start the water feature business, but you don't have any customers
[00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:59.320]   right now, and you just hate your job with everything that's in you, and the job itself
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:01.900]   is keeping you from being able to do the water features.
[00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:05.660]   Well, in that situation, it makes all the sense in the world to me to go and buy the
[00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:07.260]   landscaping business.
[00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:10.900]   That switches you from something that you despise to something that you could tolerate,
[00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:15.140]   and then in the fullness of time, after a few years, you can move yourself fully in
[00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:17.460]   the direction of the water features business.
[00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:23.100]   But it's more of an escape plan from a locked-in situation that you're in right now.
[00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:28.260]   Now, scenario B is let's say that you're doing a business right now that would allow you
[00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:29.860]   to have full flexibility.
[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:32.160]   You could go and get customers.
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:35.380]   You could go and build water features, et cetera.
[00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:39.500]   It's just that you need to find customers first, and you have enough money coming in
[00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:41.340]   from this job that it's covering.
[00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:46.340]   Well, in that situation, the idea of buying a landscaping business as a pathway to the
[00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:51.540]   water features doesn't, to me, make so much sense, unless it provides you with something
[00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:53.260]   that you specifically need.
[00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:58.860]   But if I imagine the water features business, that, to me, seems like a business that you
[00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:01.060]   don't need a lot of infrastructure for.
[00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:04.340]   You need some knowledge, and you're going to need a crew, but you could hire the crew
[00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:08.900]   for the job using day laborers as long as you're there to supervise them.
[00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:12.860]   So unless you needed the landscape business to transition, then it just seems like an
[00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:16.420]   unwieldy path, and after all, you're going to wind up with a couple of broken-down trucks
[00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:20.980]   and a crew of people, two of whom are going to quit on day one, and the other is you didn't
[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:24.380]   hire them, and they just want to do things the old way, and they want to run a lawnmower
[00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:26.380]   and a weed eater, and they don't want to put in water features.
[00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:28.020]   We don't like this work, et cetera.
[00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:29.340]   It sounds like a real hassle.
[00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:34.340]   So I think the compelling reason, to me, would be, is this a better transition from where
[00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:35.340]   you are?
[00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:36.420]   If so, go for it.
[00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:42.260]   If not, does this help you in some way that just going directly after the water features
[00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:45.060]   business doesn't provide?
[00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:46.060]   Sure.
[00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:49.060]   That makes sense.
[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:59.240]   Yeah, I was kind of thinking about it as there's obviously all of that, right?
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:05.220]   It seems like it would also, one, it's kind of the statistics are statistics, right?
[00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:14.420]   But at least according to the statistics, a business that's purchased with an SBA loan,
[00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:19.100]   which partially just represents that the numbers have been adequately run to make sure they
[00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:20.620]   actually work, right?
[00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:25.780]   When the seller says, yeah, it makes a million dollars in revenue, it actually does, and
[00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:27.460]   that's not been fudged around with, right?
[00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:35.100]   So they have a, accordingly, a 98% success rate, as opposed to a startup, which has,
[00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:39.620]   I don't know, probably overall, it's less than 5%, something like that.
[00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:41.820]   Certainly it's not high.
[00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:49.140]   Now, I'm assuming that the business kind of in the SBA statistics is going relatively
[00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:52.760]   in a straight path, right, as opposed to shifting its course.
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:56.780]   But it seems like that could be a far more successful path.
[00:59:56.780 --> 01:00:01.300]   And worst case, to some degree, you buy a job that you don't love, but you have all
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:05.580]   the benefits of owning your own business along with that as well.
[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:10.900]   So that was kind of the pathway in some ways as I was thinking about it.
[01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:13.500]   And I think what you just said, though, aligns with what I'm saying.
[01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:19.460]   So if you're stuck right now in a situation that, if you're stuck in a situation right
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:25.460]   now that is not allowing you all the freedom that you would like to have to build the water
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:30.660]   features business, and if you are willing to own the landscape business, then absolutely,
[01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:35.140]   go buy the landscape business, as long as you're willing for that to be your primary
[01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:36.140]   day job.
[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:40.140]   But when you started asking, it sounds like you really don't want to do landscaping, you
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:46.740]   want to do water features, and I don't know how successful you would be switching from
[01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:49.260]   landscaping to doing water features.
[01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:55.700]   And so to me, it seems like it's more important to go as directly in the direction of your
[01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:57.400]   goals.
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:04.620]   If the water features are what you want to do, then go after the water features as diligently
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:08.660]   as possible, and only change course when you need to.
[01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:13.660]   And so something like a water features business, to me, seems like the kind of thing that all
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:24.180]   of your expenses, most of your expenses, can take place after you actually book some business.
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.820]   So you don't need a lot of infrastructure.
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:30.380]   You might need to do a project or two so that you can show people what you've done.
[01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:33.260]   Maybe it's your house, your neighbor's house, or something like that.
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:37.460]   But a lot of your work is just a matter of booking the business, and once you actually
[01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:41.940]   have a check that clears the bank, then you can go out, hire the laborers, purchase the
[01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:46.900]   equipment, you can rent all of your stuff, and you can get the work done, and that will
[01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:48.180]   teach you more.
[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:57.940]   So business failure and success, those statistics are interesting to look at, but they're not
[01:01:57.940 --> 01:02:01.940]   a good guidance of what you yourself should expect.
[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:05.500]   So for example, do a majority or at least many new businesses fail?
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:06.860]   Absolutely, they do.
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:12.380]   But if you look at the businesses that fail from people who've run businesses before,
[01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:14.580]   the percentage is much, much lower.
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:18.300]   And so people who've run businesses successfully understand how to run businesses, and their
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:20.020]   new businesses don't fail.
[01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:23.820]   And I think one of the big reasons their new businesses generally don't fail is they don't
[01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:27.700]   spend any money until they make money, and they only spend money when they make money.
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:32.980]   And so what is different from me now versus me when I was 20 years old, when I was 20
[01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:35.740]   years old and I wanted to start a business, I would have gone out, bought a new pickup
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:38.900]   truck, put my sign on the side, and been like, "Look, I got a great business.
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:43.500]   Today, I'll go rent a U-Haul pickup truck or a U-Haul van and keep the expenses down
[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:48.060]   and just do it in a U-Haul van until you get to the point where that's just not appropriate
[01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:50.180]   and you need more equipment."
[01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:55.380]   And so I think experienced business people understand you get money in the bank first
[01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:59.260]   and you sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, and then you only start buying stuff when you
[01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:02.460]   absolutely need it and when the business has proven itself.
[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:07.740]   So I think the best model for what you're describing is five years from now, if you
[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:13.640]   own a landscaping business that makes you a good living as expected based upon the numbers
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:18.300]   that you're describing and you do one water feature a year, are you happier with that
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:23.420]   decision or are you happier staying with what you're doing right now, not having to deal
[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:29.220]   with the business, not having taken out a bunch of debt, et cetera, and doing one water
[01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:30.220]   feature a year?
[01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:32.580]   Which of those is the better fit?
[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:38.060]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:39.060]   Probably the second one.
[01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:43.440]   And that's partially I'm at a place where I have lots of flexibility with my job, which
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:51.180]   is great, but it's also not providing for me monetarily in the way that I would like
[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:52.180]   it to at this point.
[01:03:52.180 --> 01:04:00.540]   So I'm trying to parlay all of that and also not put our family in a bad financial place
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:04.940]   by just going for it kind of thing.
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:08.020]   So in that situation, don't go into debt.
[01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:10.000]   Don't buy a business that you don't want to own.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.400]   Don't go into debt.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:17.720]   Just market like crazy and develop, do a water feature in your yard.
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:22.240]   Make sure you create a portfolio of ideas, even if it's just a portfolio of other people's
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:26.760]   ideas and go to the neighborhoods where those kinds of things might be interested and figure
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:29.600]   out how to get marketing materials in front of those people.
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:39.440]   Maybe it's door-to-door, flyering a neighborhood, I don't know, but making some kind of targeted
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:45.600]   ads, targeting people on Facebook, on whatever it is in your area.
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:50.000]   Create some ways of advertising and just spend some money on advertising and marketing and
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.400]   go and meet with some people.
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:56.640]   Do some water features on Saturday-Sunday jobs, take a week of vacation, do a water
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:01.880]   feature on a week of vacation if you need to, but get some actual business done and
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:06.520]   then start getting the referrals from the business and see if there's repeat business.
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:11.600]   And then just quit your job when your job is getting in the way of your business.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.640]   To me, that's a more direct path.
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:14.880]   You won't go into debt.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:18.660]   You won't assume all of the unknowns of the crews and the deferred maintenance on the
[01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:22.220]   trucks and all the stuff that you're going to pay for and you'll be doing the business
[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:26.640]   that you want to have and probably you'd have a better business because again, the water
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:30.200]   features business won't need much overhead.
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.080]   You can do most of it with rented equipment.
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:35.880]   You can do most of it with day laborers, etc.
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:41.100]   And so that lower overhead will lead to a higher chance of success as well versus all
[01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:44.440]   of the overhead of the existing lawn maintenance business.
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:45.440]   That'd be my guess.
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:46.440]   Sure.
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:47.440]   That makes sense.
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:48.440]   All right.
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:49.440]   Okay.
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:50.440]   Cool.
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:51.440]   Keep me in the loop.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:52.440]   Thank you much.
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:53.440]   Want to hear about it in the future.
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:54.440]   And with that, we go to Billings, Montana.
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:55.440]   Welcome to the show.
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:56.440]   How can I serve you today?
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:57.440]   Hey Joshua.
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:06.080]   I was curious if your thoughts have changed at all on food insecurity and famine kind
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:07.080]   of on a global level.
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:10.360]   You had an episode maybe a year ago or so.
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:15.840]   I think you had some relevant concerns and just curious if that's changed, if any of
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:20.240]   those things that you were concerned about played out or maybe you haven't thought about
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:21.240]   it anymore.
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:22.240]   Just curious.
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.240]   That's a good question.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:30.400]   So I would not create that show today because I don't have the same pressing fear or concern
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:34.840]   or need to warn as I felt at that time.
[01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:36.520]   We've had good global harvests.
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:39.540]   We've had all kinds of good news.
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:45.700]   And so most of the worst-case scenarios of the last year or two were avoided.
[01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:48.440]   And so I'm incredibly grateful for that.
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:56.500]   I'm a little chagrined because I don't enjoy being wrong about stuff, but I'm confident
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:07:01.160]   that I'd made the right decision of warning about things that I did at the time.
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:13.120]   From a systemic basis, the risks continue to be high, and there are real problems.
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:17.080]   I'm just not as emotionally invested in them as I was.
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:19.340]   And so I think things were better.
[01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:24.120]   I'm grateful that nothing horrific for most of us has happened over the last year.
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.860]   There are still significant problems.
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:30.560]   There's every reason to be concerned about food insecurity on a long-term basis, but
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:34.400]   it didn't emerge over the past year.
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:38.480]   I think if I went back and listened to that podcast, I'd try to be very responsible in
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:39.760]   how I talk about things.
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:43.660]   I think I would be satisfied with what I did.
[01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:46.040]   On that issue, it was funny.
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:50.200]   When Gary North was alive, I asked him a question one time in his forums because Gary North
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:54.680]   was a big proponent of Y2K concerns.
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:08:00.840]   He acquired the moniker of Scary Gary because of all of his Y2K warnings, and he was warning
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:03.960]   about Y2K and writing all over the place.
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:10.360]   I asked him, I don't know, sometime 2018, somewhere like that, I asked him if he regretted
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:11.360]   it.
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:17.040]   And he made a comment to me of something like, "It's much more important to be courageous
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:22.040]   enough to speak the truth as you see it than it is to worry about your reputation," or
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.600]   something like that.
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:28.920]   He was more eloquent, but that was the basic idea, was that there's a good chance that
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.560]   you're going to be wrong about things.
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:34.640]   But if you care about people, you owe it to yourself and to them to have the courage to
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:40.000]   act, even if you're wrong, and to say things how you see it.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.400]   So I'm satisfied with that.
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:42.880]   Now, what do you do for it?
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:51.800]   I think the actual preparation is exactly the same, and so I felt a need at that time
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:57.240]   to go a little bit beyond my usual laconic attitude and encourage people strongly.
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:03.120]   But I think that all sensible men and all sensible women should be prepared for famine
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:08.160]   at all times, because famine has been one of the biggest killers of mankind throughout
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.560]   all of recorded history.
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:21.200]   And even though our societies have done seemingly a better job of distributing food, et cetera,
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:25.300]   for us, it's one of those things that is so core that we really should be prepared at
[01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:26.300]   all times.
[01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:31.960]   And the cost of preparation from a financial cost is very, very low.
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:37.800]   Generally speaking, most of us don't spend that big of our money on food.
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:42.440]   And so living in the West, it's ironic that our need for preparation seems lower than
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:43.440]   a lot of people.
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:48.280]   We're not living in Pakistan and dealing with horrific climate change and all kinds of issues
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:51.180]   that they're dealing with, so we don't think about it.
[01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:54.640]   But on the other hand, if we wanted to actually protect ourselves, you know, 5,000 bucks spent
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:57.240]   and you're covered, your family is taken care of.
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:01.720]   And so I think that all people should have some reserves of food.
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:06.320]   I think that all people should have some long-term reserves of food, and that it should be enough
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:12.280]   that if there is a disruption, a couple of bad harvests, a climatic change, a volcano
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:16.920]   blows off and wrecks crops this year, natural gas means that we can't fertilize as much
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:17.920]   as possible.
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:22.360]   So the impact of famine and the potential for famine is very, very high.
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:26.080]   And so we should absolutely be prepared for it at all times.
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:28.560]   It's a sensible thing to do.
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:32.920]   And the easiest time to prepare for famine is when no one else is preparing for famine
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:34.020]   and food is abundant.
[01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:42.040]   So I'm grateful that I was wrong about my biggest worries, but I still stand by the
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:46.040]   value of the need to be prepared for bad scenarios like famine.
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:47.040]   Yeah.
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:52.880]   I appreciate your insight and also glad we didn't have a famine.
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:55.920]   Do you have time for unrelated?
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:56.920]   Sure.
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:57.920]   Go ahead.
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:58.920]   Second question?
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:10:59.920]   Yep.
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:00.920]   Sure.
[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:06.680]   I'm curious for someone that is learning a second language, would you typically recommend
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:14.160]   that they would get to the point of some level of fluency before adding a third language?
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:20.160]   Or is there benefit to adding additional in parallel?
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:25.720]   And then I guess, you know, is there an estimated amount of time that you think on an ongoing
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:34.200]   basis is needed kind of per foreign language to keep at a fluent or semi-fluent level?
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.100]   I think it would be different.
[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:42.520]   If someone is learning a second language, I think my answer would be different than
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:47.300]   if someone is learning a fourth language.
[01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:55.320]   If you've never acquired a second language to a high degree of fluency, then I think
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:12:00.280]   that's an experience that you will want to go through before trying to do it in a second
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:05.560]   and a third language because it changes your confidence level.
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:10.280]   And so if you're interested in languages, but you haven't demonstrated that interest
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:19.160]   even to the point of learning a second language to a moderately high degree, then I think
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:20.760]   you should do that first.
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:24.360]   Because after you've done that, your confidence will be very high.
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:29.800]   I think there's a somewhat well-known polyglot named Steve Kaufman.
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:33.880]   And Steve Kaufman is a guy in history.
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:37.660]   He grew up as a monolingual English-speaking Canadian.
[01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:40.880]   He studied a little bit of French in high school, etc.
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:48.800]   But his first real second language was when he, after high school, went to France as a
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:56.320]   laborer and ultimately learned French after being inspired by a very enthusiastic French
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:57.560]   teacher.
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:00.960]   And after learning French, he went to college in France, etc.
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:06.240]   So after learning French to a high degree, that inspired him where some years down the
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:10.160]   road, he was working for the Canadian Diplomatic Corps.
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:14.040]   And he raised his hand and said, "I can learn Chinese."
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:18.400]   And that started his career and ultimately started his true multilingualism.
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:23.200]   But it was all based upon the confidence that he had developed from learning French to a
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:24.200]   high level.
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:28.280]   Now, once you have that confidence and once you've figured out kind of what works for
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:32.200]   you, because if you talk to language learners, all language learners will have a different
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:34.200]   idea of what works for them.
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:36.000]   Some people just want to sit around and watch movies.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.440]   Some people just want to sit around and read.
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:38.800]   Some people want to study grammar books.
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:40.880]   Some people want to take classes, etc.
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:46.880]   And so all of the lessons that you learn in learning your second language are things that
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:51.200]   will dramatically infuse your approach with future languages.
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:58.040]   Now, if somebody has successfully learned at least a foreign language, then I think
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:05.920]   the answer to the question is much more related to interest and goals than it is actual technique.
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:12.760]   From my experience and from listening to a lot of polyglots talk about it, the human
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:20.920]   brain seems perfectly capable of distinguishing among languages without very much confusion.
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:25.920]   It may be true that if you're just starting for the very first time, and again, you've
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:29.960]   never learned a foreign language, starting to study Italian and Spanish or Spanish and
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:33.480]   Portuguese simultaneously, that's not smart.
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:35.480]   You want to have some separation.
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:43.280]   But a skilled Spanish speaker who can certainly study Portuguese and keep them distinct, it's
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:46.760]   more just a matter of time, of how much time are you actually going to do this and what
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:50.240]   kind of results do you want.
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:57.000]   True polyglots don't seem to have any real skill or aptitude for languages that can be
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.360]   measurable.
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:04.120]   What they do have is they have interest, and that interest causes them to put in the hours,
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:07.480]   and then the hours result in high skill in languages.
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:13.880]   And so if somebody has a high interest and they want to learn three new languages simultaneously
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:18.640]   to the point where they're totally ready to put four hours per day into all three of them,
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:22.200]   then there's no downside to studying the three.
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:26.940]   And if their interest is in learning the three languages rather than in learning one language
[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:29.440]   to a high degree, that would be the qualifying factor.
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.440]   Do what you want to.
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:32.620]   We're just doing this for fun.
[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:38.240]   What I have found is that it's more a matter of, again, they don't really compete, it's
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:41.600]   a matter of interest and it's a matter of how quickly do I get results.
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:46.520]   So I'm not, I wouldn't term myself as a polyglot.
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:53.600]   I speak advanced intermediate Spanish, I speak intermediate French, and I dabble in German
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:57.720]   and Latin and Greek and some of the other things, but I just go based upon my interest.
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:03.700]   And I don't see that they interfere with one another, but I also observe that the progress
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:07.260]   I make only comes when I spend time with the language.
[01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:11.660]   And so it's a matter of, and the languages that I spend time with, I can make progress
[01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:12.660]   in them.
[01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:15.620]   It's just a matter of, do I want to make progress in them?
[01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:16.620]   Is that clear enough?
[01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:17.620]   - Yep.
[01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:18.620]   That makes sense.
[01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:19.620]   Thank you.
[01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:20.620]   Appreciate it.
[01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:21.620]   - Go with what you're interested in.
[01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:22.620]   All right.
[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:24.620]   We move on to Austin in Louisiana.
[01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:25.620]   Welcome to the show.
[01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:26.620]   How can I serve you today, Austin?
[01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:27.620]   - Hey, Josh.
[01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:38.460]   The reason I'm calling today is I have recently gotten engaged and in preparation for us getting
[01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:44.060]   married, sorry, I'm finishing up a run here, so I'm a little out of breath.
[01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:48.300]   We are looking at signing a prenuptial agreement.
[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:52.380]   And so I just wanted your thoughts on anything that we should be considering when putting
[01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:53.380]   that together.
[01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:57.580]   Why do you want to sign a prenuptial agreement?
[01:16:57.580 --> 01:17:03.380]   - So going into marriage, we have a pretty big, or what I would consider a pretty big
[01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:06.960]   disparity in our net worth.
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:14.540]   And so I'm looking at it from the concept of, if anything were ever to go wrong and
[01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:20.180]   we were to end up getting divorced, that those assets that I'm bringing into the marriage
[01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:21.180]   would be protected.
[01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:22.180]   - Good.
[01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:29.700]   I think that is the appropriate reason and the disparity does make it important.
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:31.580]   Which of you has more wealth?
[01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:34.180]   - That would be me.
[01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:38.380]   - And are you already discussing the details of a prenuptial agreement going into that?
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:42.700]   Is that a comfortable conversation for you or you haven't started it yet?
[01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:48.180]   - No, we've had the conversation prior to getting engaged and we've actually been together
[01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:53.460]   for approximately nine years at this point, so we're common law in the states that recognize
[01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:56.500]   common law, but we're just making it official in the state we live in.
[01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:57.940]   - Okay.
[01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:05.540]   So the first recommendation is, I would recommend to you the NOLO book, N-O-L-O, the Legal Self-Help
[01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:06.540]   Publishers.
[01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:11.580]   They have a book called "Prenuptial Agreements, How to Write a Fair and Lasting Contract."
[01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:18.340]   And that is always my first recommendation because while you will undoubtedly retain
[01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:24.220]   the services of a lawyer, the work that you and she do in advance will make your legal
[01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:26.620]   fees significantly cheaper.
[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:31.900]   And it's way better for you to grab a $30 book and work your way through it and spend
[01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:33.740]   10 hours on it.
[01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:40.260]   And you and she together going through it, that'll drive a good outcome.
[01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:46.180]   And so I would begin with purchasing the book on prenuptial agreements from NOLO.
[01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:47.540]   That's the starting point.
[01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:53.980]   Now that book is a self-help book and I, of course, can't summarize a 400-page book and
[01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:54.980]   I'm not a lawyer.
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:19:00.220]   So most of my education on this subject is just study just like anyone else.
[01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:03.820]   But there are a few principles that I want to bring your attention to.
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:14.340]   The first principle is that if you are going to establish a prenup, that process requires
[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:23.060]   you to make a complete and honest and transparent declaration of all of your assets for both
[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:24.420]   of you.
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:30.980]   And so don't have any illusions for either of you that there's going to be anything hidden
[01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:33.860]   or anything undisclosed.
[01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:38.620]   And so I think the process of going through a prenup book and using the self-help forms
[01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:43.980]   and everything in there to kind of lay things out is almost a good test for are we willing
[01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:47.060]   to communicate about these things and is there any decision.
[01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:52.900]   Because in order for a prenup to be legally binding, it has to have complete disclosure
[01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:54.380]   of all of your assets.
[01:19:54.380 --> 01:20:00.720]   And if you leave any assets out of that disclosure process, that automatically invalidates the
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:03.500]   prenup and invalidates the entire process.
[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:07.780]   I have known people who for this reason alone, they didn't initiate a prenup because they
[01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:13.220]   decided that it was better for them to try to maintain secrecy than it was to do a prenup.
[01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:14.220]   I don't recommend that.
[01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:19.140]   I'm just saying that it's an important point that even moving to the point of a prenup
[01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:21.700]   requires full disclosure.
[01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:26.380]   Number two is that if you're going to establish a prenup, it'll be important that each of
[01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:31.980]   you has your own separate counsel.
[01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:36.580]   And so it's important that you can go through it together, but I wouldn't take, she needs
[01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:40.700]   to have her lawyer, you need to have your lawyer who are looking over your shoulders
[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:45.020]   and actually making sure that it's fully defensible.
[01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:48.600]   Because in order for the contract not to be invalidated by the court, there has to be
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:53.880]   proof that the contract was entered into with good representation and that both parties
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:55.980]   were fully informed.
[01:20:55.980 --> 01:21:02.020]   And in this situation, that's super important for her because as the disadvantaged party,
[01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:08.380]   the party who's less wealthy, then she needs to have really good counsel, she needs to
[01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:12.740]   have counsel defending her and making sure that her interests are taken care of.
[01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:16.540]   Because presumably, the way the court will see it, you're the one pushing the prenup
[01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:18.900]   because you're the one who has the wealth.
[01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:23.780]   She's disadvantaged and so therefore you have to defend her in that way and that starts
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:24.780]   now.
[01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:29.220]   The third thing that's really important is that in order for the contract to be valid,
[01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:38.980]   there can't be any emotional manipulation or any kind of reason to think that, I forget
[01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:43.280]   the legal terms, but basically it has to be entered into when there's no pressure.
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:51.980]   So there's a famous story online of a basketball player or a sports athlete who was engaged
[01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:56.780]   to this girl and he sent her the prenup, like you gotta sign the prenup, but she didn't
[01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:57.780]   sign it.
[01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:00.060]   And she didn't sign it, I'm gonna sign it, I'm gonna sign it, I'm gonna sign it.
[01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:04.860]   We get to the wedding day and she didn't sign the prenup and he called off the whole wedding
[01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:07.340]   even after I spent a lot of money.
[01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:10.140]   And it's an interesting story, he tells the story.
[01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:13.780]   And the point of it is that even if she had signed it on the wedding day when she's breaking
[01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:16.620]   down in tears because he signed off the wedding, it's too late.
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:21.220]   The prenup has to be signed long in advance of the wedding and there needs to be no emotional
[01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:24.080]   pressure that could later be used to invalidate the agreement.
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:29.340]   So your proper planning needs to include that.
[01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:33.180]   So those are the key things that I always warn everybody about, that in order for the
[01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:36.900]   prenup to be valid, you have to be super careful about how you go about it.
[01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:45.040]   And then it's a matter of sitting down and laying out, here is what works and it's gotta
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:47.380]   be fair to you and fair to her.
[01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:51.060]   And so going through the self-help book I think will be a good way for you to do that
[01:22:51.060 --> 01:22:54.780]   pre-work and then when you're ready to sit with your lawyers, their job will be a little
[01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:56.860]   bit easier and a little bit less time-consuming.
[01:22:56.860 --> 01:22:57.860]   Okay.
[01:22:57.860 --> 01:23:02.460]   And then do you have a moment for a follow-up?
[01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:03.460]   Absolutely.
[01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:04.820]   Go ahead.
[01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:10.760]   So on that same line of thinking as two people that are getting ready to officially merge
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:17.260]   their lives, would you have any other recommendations as we're looking at our finances, starting
[01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:24.140]   to combine finances and all that, of things that we should do prior to our marriage or
[01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:29.060]   shortly thereafter to kind of just strengthen our household financially?
[01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:31.140]   How old are you guys?
[01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:32.140]   I'm 39.
[01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:33.140]   She's 33.
[01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:36.420]   And do either of you have children?
[01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:42.060]   We do not, but that is kind of in the plans for us in the near future.
[01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:44.780]   I don't know.
[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:50.980]   I guess what I would say is it's hard.
[01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:55.220]   The way that you've gone about this relationship makes it hard because there's no bright line
[01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:56.220]   indicator.
[01:23:56.220 --> 01:24:01.620]   So, for example, normally you say, "Well, don't merge any finances until you're married."
[01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:05.060]   But as you said, well, common law marriage, some people consider you married and right
[01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:10.420]   now if you left her and abandoned her, she could probably bring a suit against you because
[01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:14.500]   of and possibly file some claim against you.
[01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:18.780]   It's better that the fact that you don't have children is important.
[01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:25.960]   But it's not as simple and as obvious as unmarried married.
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:32.340]   So I guess what I would say is that it's better to keep things as separate as possible until
[01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:39.780]   you're married because your legal protections come with marriage and also your legal opportunities.
[01:24:39.780 --> 01:24:45.060]   So simple things like transferring money, a husband and wife had the unlimited ability
[01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:47.700]   to transfer money between each other without any issues.
[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:50.940]   So you could transfer money, transfer assets, all that stuff.
[01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:56.220]   Meanwhile, if she's not your legal wife and you give her a car because you wanted to,
[01:24:56.220 --> 01:25:00.260]   well, technically you should have filed a gift tax return, things like that.
[01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:05.240]   It all becomes muddy, et cetera, because our legal system is structured around marriage.
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:10.400]   So since you're moving in the direction of marriage, I would say just work on the prenup
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:14.080]   as quickly as possible and then move to the marriage as quickly as possible.
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:20.200]   There's no reason to wait a long time for marriage and then fully merge everything.
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:23.360]   And the good thing is that you're young enough that I think that you'll be able to do that
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:25.000]   with minimal problems.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.120]   Where most of the issues get really difficult is when two people are together in their middle
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:34.880]   age and both of them are calcified in their independence and unwilling to submit to one
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:38.680]   another, unwilling to work together, unwilling to do those things.
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:41.820]   And that's where it just doesn't seem like getting together doesn't seem like a good
[01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:42.820]   idea in the first place.
[01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:44.680]   It's like we've got to keep everything separate.
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:49.360]   But both you and she being together for nine years, you've been together when young, you're
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:51.160]   probably well-suited for each other.
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:56.360]   I would just say do the prenup conversation and then get the wedding done and get to it
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:00.920]   and then merge everything fully and work it out between you.
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:09.200]   But don't muddy the waters of the prenup conversation by trying to merge things and arrange property,
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:10.200]   etc.
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:17.280]   You just pay all the bills just like you have been and get the prenup and the marriage done
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:20.160]   and then merge her and she'll be your wife.
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:21.160]   That's how I do it.
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:22.160]   Okay.
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:23.160]   Yeah.
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:24.160]   Okay.
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:25.160]   I appreciate the feedback.
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:26.160]   My pleasure.
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:29.200]   Congratulations and I hope that everything works out well and that the conversations
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:32.080]   go smoothly and productively.
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:36.280]   And just one quick comment, I've got you muted Austin and I'll just say this real quick before
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:37.640]   I move on to the next caller.
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:42.320]   I think that the conversation around the prenup is more important than anything else.
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:45.480]   Just basically to judge like how well are we able to do this.
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:52.360]   And a fair prenup I really believe needs to take care of your wife and this is your duty.
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:59.720]   And I guess I'll moralize for just a moment because it is really important to me.
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:04.800]   There are a lot of men who are taken advantage of in divorce court.
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:08.920]   There are a lot of men who have been ruined in divorce court.
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:14.560]   And that is why many men don't want to marry and it's very common in marriage circles for
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:20.760]   those men to say, "I'm never getting married and if I do get married, I'm going to get
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:21.920]   a prenup."
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:26.840]   And I do think that when there is a significant disparity in wealth, you need to have a prenuptial
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:27.840]   agreement.
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:29.280]   That is appropriate.
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:35.000]   However, in the same way that even working out the details of it, a prenuptial agreement
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:41.440]   does not mean that if we divorce, I get everything and my wife gets nothing.
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:43.200]   That is immoral.
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:50.200]   If a woman comes and marries you and especially if she gives up her life and her livelihood
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:55.820]   to be your wife, she is deserving of legal protection.
[01:27:55.820 --> 01:28:03.560]   And so I'm very sympathetic to men who get wronged by divorce courts.
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:09.880]   But I'm more sympathetic in many cases to women who get wronged by divorce.
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:15.360]   And this is where unfortunately it's a very difficult time to work through in our modern
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:16.560]   era.
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:22.760]   Because since the inception of no fault divorce, everything has gotten muddied.
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:33.360]   I believe that if a man or a woman abandon his or her marriage vows, that is cause for
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:36.840]   appropriate sanctions.
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:41.920]   And so let's say that a man comes along, he's married to a woman, the woman is faithful
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:45.720]   to him, but he is unfaithful to her.
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:49.640]   He commits adultery against her, he abandons her, etc.
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:55.960]   Well I want the court to have full power to invade his life, invade his finances, etc.
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:57.240]   and take care of her.
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:02.720]   Because in entering into a relationship with him, in bearing his children, in caring for
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:08.080]   his home, etc. to say nothing of any financial contribution that she brought into it, she
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:09.400]   deserves to be cared for.
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:11.880]   And so I want the court to have that power.
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:16.380]   On the same hand, let's say that a man and a woman are married, and the man is perfectly
[01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:21.280]   faithful but the woman is unfaithful to him, and she commits adultery against him, or she
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:27.600]   abandons him, or does some great deed that is wrong and violates the marriage contract.
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:33.080]   Then I absolutely do not want the man's life to be destroyed to provide for her, because
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:34.080]   that's immoral.
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:38.280]   If a woman walks away from the marriage and she abandons her work, why should she be paid
[01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:42.880]   from the man on an ongoing basis alimony and child support, etc.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:46.960]   But on the other hand, if there was wrong done and the man was wrong, then absolutely
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:49.080]   he should pay child support, alimony, etc.
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:51.400]   And I think most people agree with this.
[01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:56.600]   The problem is, has become very acute in the age of no-fault divorce.
[01:29:56.600 --> 01:30:00.440]   Whereas now, as a man and a woman, you can divorce each other for any reason or for no
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:01.440]   reason at all.
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:04.240]   And of course most people don't do that, there's always a reason.
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:10.400]   But because a man and a woman can do that, it eliminates all safety from marriage.
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:17.880]   So if in this situation where you're getting married and your wife is coming to the marriage
[01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:22.400]   with you, if she decides five years from now, she just doesn't have the feelings for you
[01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:26.280]   anymore, and she turns around and she wants to leave, legally speaking, she can do that.
[01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:27.760]   She can divorce you and leave.
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:30.660]   And that's where the prenup is really important.
[01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:38.180]   But the flip side of this is that you owe her a duty of care as your wife.
[01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:46.640]   And so let's assume that you and she are married, she bears you your children, and 15 years
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:50.900]   from now she has three children, and then you decide, "I'm going to up and divorce her."
[01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:58.220]   Your prenup had better compensate her properly for her work and for her contribution.
[01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:00.540]   It's super, super important, morally speaking.
[01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:01.780]   You are responsible for her.
[01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:07.240]   You are her husband, you are her head, and therefore you must care for her and provide
[01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:10.220]   for her even in the case of divorce.
[01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:15.260]   So the prenup has to reflect this moral truth and it has to be weighty enough on you and
[01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:20.260]   weighty enough on her that you're in it and in it for life, otherwise, you know, don't
[01:31:20.260 --> 01:31:21.620]   get married in the first place.
[01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:27.660]   So the easiest thing to do is when people are young and they get married, they get married
[01:31:27.660 --> 01:31:29.580]   young and they build it together, right?
[01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:32.140]   So my wife and I married relatively young.
[01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:36.020]   We didn't have much when we started and I don't have a prenup and nor would I want one
[01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:43.260]   nor would I advise one because we're in it and she is just as responsible for the success
[01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:44.740]   of our family as I am.
[01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:45.740]   We are a team.
[01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:47.220]   We are indivisible.
[01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:53.460]   That's different than if you're, you know, 60 years old and she's 30 and you've built
[01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:54.460]   your...
[01:31:54.460 --> 01:31:56.060]   Well, there's obviously a different situation.
[01:31:56.060 --> 01:32:00.180]   And so you guys being closer in age, you just want to work this out and you want to be very
[01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:05.060]   clear and I want to be clear to you as the wealthier party that as you're working this
[01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:10.780]   through, your agreement, what you agree, what you reach in your agreement has to be not
[01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:15.740]   only legally acceptable, which is where you'll get the advice of the lawyers and what the
[01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:19.820]   courts and everything would actually uphold because remember, this contract, if this contract
[01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:25.420]   is deemed to be unfair, then it can be held as null and void by the courts and so it has
[01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:26.580]   to be fair.
[01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:32.980]   But just in your own psychology, you need to embrace fully the idea that, you know,
[01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:39.420]   I'm responsible and that I owe her and that her job, if she's going to be my wife, it's
[01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:44.420]   not like you bring everything to the marriage because you got the money and she brings nothing.
[01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:49.580]   What she brings to the marriage is enormously important and is enormously valuable and you
[01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:52.420]   just want to recognize it emotionally.
[01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:57.780]   So it's hard to go too deep into that stuff without insight, but just hopefully that's
[01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:02.660]   a small encouragement that puts you in the right frame of mind, Austin.
[01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:08.980]   No, that's great stuff to think about, Joshua, and I appreciate you taking the time to go
[01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:12.500]   a little bit deeper than just consulting a lawyer, which you always do.
[01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:14.460]   You never disappoint on that front.
[01:33:14.460 --> 01:33:15.460]   Good.
[01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:16.460]   My pleasure.
[01:33:16.460 --> 01:33:21.820]   It's really important because it's a super emotional issue and the way that I think these
[01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:27.380]   issues are dealt with, especially in a sea of men who have been hurt by divorce court
[01:33:27.380 --> 01:33:32.340]   and who are in difficult situations, is they're just often dealt with very callously.
[01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:36.700]   And I think we need to deal with them appropriately.
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:41.840]   We need to speak directly to men and directly to women that when men and women sin and they
[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:46.300]   violate their marriage vows and they divorce, etc., it needs to be dealt with.
[01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:51.780]   But our courts are in a wreck because they've lost the ability to deal with this.
[01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:58.940]   And they treat all divorce claims seemingly as the same, and morally they are not the
[01:33:58.940 --> 01:33:59.940]   same.
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:05.620]   So talk about those things and work them through directly with her, and I think you guys, congratulations.
[01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:07.380]   I think you guys are going to have great success.
[01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:08.820]   We finish up today in the great state of Indiana.
[01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:09.820]   Welcome to the show.
[01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:10.820]   How can I serve you today?
[01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:11.820]   Hey, Joshua.
[01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:12.820]   Can you hear me?
[01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:17.980]   I can hear you, but we got a little bit of digital lag, so go ahead and let's make sure
[01:34:17.980 --> 01:34:18.980]   it's clear.
[01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:19.980]   All right.
[01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:25.700]   Well, I'm happy to get on the line, first of all.
[01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:28.700]   Thank you for all you've been doing.
[01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:32.820]   And I just got a couple of questions.
[01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:36.620]   I am that listener that you've been talking about.
[01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:40.020]   I started listening to you when I was only making about $30,000.
[01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:46.860]   You've inspired me to advance my life and make strides, and I want to thank you for
[01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:47.860]   that.
[01:34:47.860 --> 01:34:48.860]   Wonderful.
[01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:49.860]   That makes my day.
[01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:50.860]   Yeah.
[01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:51.860]   Yeah.
[01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:52.860]   Yeah.
[01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:56.180]   I always hear you say that you don't hear from these scholars, so I just wanted to make
[01:34:56.180 --> 01:34:57.980]   sure you knew I was one.
[01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:58.980]   Thank you.
[01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:08.260]   At the moment, I've kind of transferred from driving CDL commercial vehicles, and I'm making
[01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:10.860]   twice as much as I was two years ago.
[01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:16.500]   And I'm just kind of looking, trying to cast a big net to where I can actually go next
[01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:21.380]   to maybe double my income again, or stuff I can do that.
[01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:28.620]   So I've been listening to a lot of podcasts, and just getting a broad view of the world,
[01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:31.860]   and maybe something I can get into and dive into.
[01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:38.180]   And entrepreneurship kind of seems to have that drawing allure for me, and something
[01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:40.420]   I kind of want to get into.
[01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:46.980]   But with all the advances with AI and everything, it seems like it's a real crazy time to try
[01:35:46.980 --> 01:35:48.540]   to do something like that.
[01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:57.060]   So I just wanted to get your take on the landscape of AI versus business, and what are you thinking?
[01:35:57.060 --> 01:35:59.940]   How old are you currently?
[01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:01.700]   I am 39.
[01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:04.820]   And do you have family that is dependent on you?
[01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:07.460]   Do you have wife, children to support?
[01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:08.460]   I do.
[01:36:08.460 --> 01:36:09.460]   I do.
[01:36:09.460 --> 01:36:12.380]   I have two boys, and my wife is actually pregnant right now.
[01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:13.380]   Oh, congratulations.
[01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:14.380]   Wonderful.
[01:36:14.380 --> 01:36:15.380]   Thank you.
[01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:18.700]   And are you over the road right now, or are you local or regional?
[01:36:18.700 --> 01:36:20.620]   I'm home every night.
[01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:23.700]   So yeah, I'm a dedicated home driver.
[01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:24.700]   All right.
[01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:32.980]   And in terms of your own background, prior to driving, do you have any particular academic
[01:36:32.980 --> 01:36:34.140]   things that you studied in the past?
[01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:36.060]   Do you have degrees, et cetera?
[01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:38.380]   Or kind of starting from zero?
[01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:39.380]   Okay.
[01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:41.740]   I am starting from zero.
[01:36:41.740 --> 01:36:48.220]   I never even graduated high school.
[01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:52.280]   Are you capable of academics if you were interested?
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:57.220]   Are things like reading books, taking tests, academic discussions, and things like that,
[01:36:57.220 --> 01:36:59.860]   are you capable of them if you're interested?
[01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:02.420]   Yeah, I believe I am.
[01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:08.340]   I haven't been in school since high school, but when I put my mind to getting the CDL
[01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:09.900]   it was really not a big deal.
[01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:12.260]   I sat down with the manual, took the test.
[01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:17.300]   It was pretty easy for me to wrap my head around the whole thing.
[01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:24.580]   I believe in my last few, about five years of my life, I really got more into audiobooks
[01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:26.580]   and things like that.
[01:37:26.580 --> 01:37:28.580]   So I believe I'm educated.
[01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:34.860]   I believe I can go to school and get something if I was passionate about it.
[01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:35.860]   Right.
[01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:45.860]   So it's important to identify this because there are a lot of people who didn't finish
[01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:50.620]   high school or didn't go to do anything beyond high school who are perfectly cognitively
[01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:51.620]   capable.
[01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:54.640]   They're smart enough to do plenty of college work.
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:56.140]   They just never cared.
[01:37:56.140 --> 01:37:57.340]   And it wasn't important to them.
[01:37:57.340 --> 01:38:00.420]   And because they didn't care, it wasn't important to them, they didn't pursue it, et cetera.
[01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:04.040]   They didn't do it at the normal time when it was convenient to do it.
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:08.380]   And so that doesn't really say much, but you do need to understand where your strengths
[01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:15.580]   lie, is that if you are interested in an intellectual life or an intellectual job, you need to make
[01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:18.500]   sure that you have a good basic natural strength there.
[01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:22.900]   On the other hand, if you're not interested in that and you're really skillful with other
[01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:28.400]   forms of knowledge and skill, you really work well with your hands, you really work well
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:31.440]   with people, et cetera, then you want to have some sense of that.
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:39.160]   And so I would begin by taking some kind of psychological career surveys and tests and
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:43.200]   get an idea of what the psychologists think might be good careers for me.
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:44.460]   That would be a good starting place.
[01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:45.460]   Have you done that yet?
[01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:46.460]   No, no, no.
[01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:47.460]   I haven't done that.
[01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:48.460]   Okay.
[01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:49.460]   I don't have them off the top of my mind.
[01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:50.460]   Yeah, go ahead.
[01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:56.980]   I was just saying, like I just said, I've kind of just been casting a big net to just
[01:38:56.980 --> 01:39:03.160]   see if anything really grabs ahold of me and feels like something I could get into or really
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:04.160]   grab ahold of.
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:10.560]   I've done really well with skill-based things like construction and a lot of glass work.
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:17.560]   I'd sell anything that really took a skill with my hands, but that's all I've really
[01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:20.000]   been able to apply myself to.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000]   Right.
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:28.220]   So I would suggest that you take as many career-oriented tests as you're able to.
[01:39:28.220 --> 01:39:30.700]   I don't have my list current.
[01:39:30.700 --> 01:39:34.460]   In my career and income course that I used to teach, I gave a whole list, and some of
[01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:36.120]   those still are valid, but they changed.
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:41.900]   So if I woke up in your shoes, I would go to chat GPT, and I would ask chat, and I would
[01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:47.500]   say I'm interested in changing my career, and I'd like to take a list of – I'd like
[01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:51.880]   to take some psychological evaluations to see the kinds of careers that I'm more interested
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:52.880]   in.
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:58.740]   Please give me a list of 10 different career tests that I should consider taking and see
[01:39:58.740 --> 01:40:03.180]   what's given to you, and take four or five, eight of them, whatever is appropriate.
[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:04.780]   A lot of them will be done yourself.
[01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:06.020]   A lot of them you could just do online.
[01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:11.120]   A lot of them will cost you $40, $50, et cetera, but those things will give you a starting
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:16.140]   place based upon what the psychologists think you might be well-suited for, and regardless
[01:40:16.140 --> 01:40:21.900]   of whether you pursue entrepreneurship or whether you pursue a job or just a career
[01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:27.020]   change of a job to something else, it can inform you about some of the fields that you're
[01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:33.340]   interested in, and that will inform your educational pathway in terms of the next step.
[01:40:33.340 --> 01:40:38.940]   Then in terms of job change and career change, yes, change is omnipresent.
[01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:44.340]   That's always happening, and yes, entire industries are being enormously disrupted
[01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:51.020]   by artificial intelligence, and it's only just getting started, but I don't think that
[01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:54.540]   generally speaking you should worry too much about that.
[01:40:54.540 --> 01:40:59.380]   Rather, you should just simply go where there's opportunity because that's your first thing
[01:40:59.380 --> 01:41:04.380]   is before you leave your job, you need to create something better, and in order for
[01:41:04.380 --> 01:41:07.580]   you to create something better, you have to go and look for opportunity, and once you
[01:41:07.580 --> 01:41:12.260]   find opportunity and you have a job offer for something that's better, then you can
[01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:20.620]   assess it in the light of a risk, and is this job subject to artificial intelligence.
[01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:25.860]   But without a specific idea of a job or idea of a business, there's really no point in
[01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:30.540]   worrying too much about the risks because you're just going to spend time finding reasons
[01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:33.460]   why it won't work rather than reasons why it will work.
[01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:36.820]   The only time that you want to really think deeply about the risks is when you have a
[01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:41.260]   clear positive plan as to what you really want to do, and then you're just testing it
[01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:46.180]   and saying how susceptible is this to self-driving cars, how susceptible is this job or business
[01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:52.420]   to automation, how susceptible is this job or business to offshoring or artificial intelligence,
[01:41:52.420 --> 01:41:53.420]   etc.
[01:41:53.420 --> 01:42:03.660]   But don't do that until you actually have an idea of where you want to go.
[01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:09.060]   Could you list today three different ideas of jobs or businesses or industries that you
[01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:11.740]   think you might be interested in?
[01:42:11.740 --> 01:42:12.740]   Yes.
[01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:13.740]   Okay.
[01:42:13.740 --> 01:42:14.740]   Shoot.
[01:42:14.740 --> 01:42:17.940]   One's a board game making company.
[01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:24.300]   I've already made two of them, just out of a hobby for a gift for a family member, but
[01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:25.420]   they came out really well.
[01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:27.900]   They played through really well.
[01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:32.220]   I felt that there was a lot of passion in that for me, and I figured it had a lot of
[01:42:32.220 --> 01:42:35.660]   leverage and something that I might be able to go.
[01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:38.860]   So I've kind of looked into that a little bit.
[01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:45.260]   Something else is, obviously, the big trend with robots and AI, I would love to play around
[01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:49.020]   and have some kind of little company that makes robots because that just seems like
[01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:55.740]   I'd be ahead of the curve, but that's more fantasy style, but definitely interesting
[01:42:55.740 --> 01:42:56.740]   to me.
[01:42:56.740 --> 01:43:02.500]   And then something else would be like, me and my wife have kind of looked into doing
[01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:14.620]   a franchise kind of restaurant or bar or something like that, but I feel like that's more complex
[01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:18.340]   with a lot of people turner over rate.
[01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:22.340]   Me and her both worked in a lot of restaurants our entire life, so we do know the industry
[01:43:22.340 --> 01:43:27.300]   from kind of front to back.
[01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:30.580]   So those are three things that we've kind of shot around.
[01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:31.580]   Right.
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:36.940]   Well, the good news about those three things is that probably with all of them, with possibly
[01:43:36.940 --> 01:43:45.300]   the exception of robots or AI, it doesn't sound like more degrees or academic qualifications
[01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:47.840]   are necessary.
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:52.340]   You certainly have to learn a lot, but in terms of getting a college degree, et cetera,
[01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:54.460]   for all three of those, it's not necessary.
[01:43:54.460 --> 01:44:01.040]   So that's one of the themes that I was looking for because if you are interested in a direction
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:04.980]   that's going to require more academic qualifications, then your answer is go get yourself a college
[01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:08.580]   degree as quickly as you can, get it done so that you have that.
[01:44:08.580 --> 01:44:12.660]   But if you don't need that, then focus mostly on learning what you need to learn for the
[01:44:12.660 --> 01:44:14.700]   actual task at hand.
[01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:20.420]   For the board game company, that I would say is probably a matter of licensing.
[01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:26.980]   And what I mean is that it would be hard for me to see how you would start a board game
[01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:34.980]   company, but in terms of creating a board game and having a licensing deal for the game
[01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:39.740]   that you have created, that is probably a productive use of time and that's probably
[01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:43.380]   something that you could do with learning your way around, figuring out what do you
[01:44:43.380 --> 01:44:47.900]   need to know about how to license something, how do you negotiate something like that,
[01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:53.160]   figure out who you would speak to in terms of getting your game brought to life, et cetera.
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:57.480]   But I would think that if I had created a board game, the first path that I would explore
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:45:02.500]   very deeply would just be selling the license to the board game rather than actually trying
[01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:05.660]   to create a "board game company."
[01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:10.260]   And to me, that seems simple and that seems something you could produce, that seems something
[01:45:10.260 --> 01:45:11.620]   you could pursue.
[01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:16.480]   And so get yourself involved in whatever education is necessary and to kind of figure out how
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:20.860]   to go about doing that and then see what kind of contacts you can make and see what options
[01:45:20.860 --> 01:45:22.560]   are out there.
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:29.840]   In terms of robots and AI, I would say there are clearly – I don't know anything about
[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:30.840]   robots.
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:35.540]   That would seem to me something where you would need to educate yourself and probably
[01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:45.860]   get involved with a company as an employee of some kind to begin with, unless you tinker
[01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:50.220]   with robots in your garage and have something through.
[01:45:50.220 --> 01:45:57.100]   Creating physical items, physical things requires a whole more complex set of skills than just
[01:45:57.100 --> 01:45:59.420]   creating digital items.
[01:45:59.420 --> 01:46:06.420]   Digital items have a very low barrier to entry because it's just lines of code.
[01:46:06.420 --> 01:46:11.980]   And of course, lines of code can be very complex, but you can learn to use tools very effectively.
[01:46:11.980 --> 01:46:19.940]   I was following a guy's story yesterday on Twitter and he – I guess I should switch
[01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:20.940]   to X.
[01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:23.580]   I hate the name, but I'll switch.
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:33.100]   Anyway, he was telling about how he's building up – he's creating AI models for companies.
[01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:35.400]   And he had this video that he had made using AI.
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:38.460]   Just this beautiful lady walking on a beach, etc.
[01:46:38.460 --> 01:46:43.980]   Beautiful lady and he was talking about how he's creating customized AI models for companies
[01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:48.860]   to basically create their models, to model their apparel, model their products, etc.
[01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:55.500]   And helping them create their own in-house set of computer-generated avatars for their
[01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:56.500]   products.
[01:46:56.500 --> 01:46:57.500]   And I thought, "Isn't that fascinating?"
[01:46:57.500 --> 01:47:01.060]   That's the kind of business that certainly you need to learn some tools and everything,
[01:47:01.060 --> 01:47:06.940]   but that's the kind of thing that has a lot more opportunity for a guy to hustle rather
[01:47:06.940 --> 01:47:09.160]   than needing technical capacity.
[01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:12.740]   You have to have enough technical capacity to do the work, but that's more of a matter
[01:47:12.740 --> 01:47:18.600]   of going and applying your hustle to finding customers for it and working out the agreements.
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:23.340]   And so, things like that are within your reach in terms of AI, and I think there's going
[01:47:23.340 --> 01:47:29.340]   to be a whole slew of opportunities as we watch these new models transform, industry
[01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:31.780]   after industry after industry.
[01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:39.460]   And so, I don't know how relevant coding ability will be to that or how relevant just
[01:47:39.460 --> 01:47:42.420]   hustle will be to that, but you should explore that.
[01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:46.660]   You should explore coding and see if you are attracted to the idea of learning to be a
[01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:47.660]   coder.
[01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:52.420]   There's plenty of resources out there for how to be a self-developed coder, and I think
[01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:59.420]   a year or two of nighttime weekends work could transform you into a perfectly hireable coder
[01:47:59.420 --> 01:48:05.020]   that would make more than what you're making right now and have a lot more upside potential
[01:48:05.020 --> 01:48:06.620]   as your skills grow.
[01:48:06.620 --> 01:48:11.140]   Or you might be attracted to the entrepreneurial side of finding some little niche that makes
[01:48:11.140 --> 01:48:14.500]   sense to you and then applying it.
[01:48:14.500 --> 01:48:18.940]   Robots, on the other hand, because of the intersection with hardware and software, do
[01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:21.040]   have a higher barrier to entry.
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:27.540]   And so, while I'm never going to deny that an individual could develop skills and create
[01:48:27.540 --> 01:48:33.380]   a robot in your yard that does something useful, I would think that that would be more appropriate
[01:48:33.380 --> 01:48:39.300]   to finding a job in something that interests you from a robot perspective.
[01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:45.060]   Third one, opening a franchise restaurant or a bar, that's probably your most likely
[01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:49.500]   money maker and absolutely kind of the simplest thing.
[01:48:49.500 --> 01:48:55.820]   It's also, of the three that you said, it's the least likely to be impacted by the risks
[01:48:55.820 --> 01:48:56.820]   of AI.
[01:48:56.820 --> 01:48:58.700]   Restaurants aren't going anywhere.
[01:48:58.700 --> 01:49:06.180]   A bar is always going to be popular, and that's a business that you know based upon your background
[01:49:06.180 --> 01:49:07.900]   and your wife's background, et cetera.
[01:49:07.900 --> 01:49:14.540]   And so, opening a restaurant or opening a bar, to me, sounds like a winner in a totally
[01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:18.740]   protected business from the risks of AI.
[01:49:18.740 --> 01:49:19.740]   And who knows?
[01:49:19.740 --> 01:49:24.500]   Maybe you bring in a robot hamburger machine or a robot drink maker and that's kind of
[01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:27.700]   a component of what you offer.
[01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:32.220]   But that's going to be probably the biggest limitation there would be your access to capital.
[01:49:32.220 --> 01:49:36.660]   So depending on how much money you have saved or depending on how much money you can borrow
[01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:41.700]   or what you have access to in terms of your money that you have saved, investments that
[01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:46.140]   you have, access to other people's money, people that would believe in you, et cetera,
[01:49:46.140 --> 01:49:48.940]   your biggest challenge is just going to be access to capital.
[01:49:48.940 --> 01:49:57.020]   And so, that to me is kind of your highest success probability endeavor that could quickly
[01:49:57.020 --> 01:50:01.500]   free you from trucking, but you're going to have to figure out where to get the money
[01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:05.780]   and you're going to have to have the franchise that you want to do if you want to do a franchise
[01:50:05.780 --> 01:50:06.780]   location.
[01:50:06.780 --> 01:50:11.780]   So, I like all those ideas, all I can just say is keep pursuing it, pursue it aggressively
[01:50:11.780 --> 01:50:16.760]   and then see what you're drawn towards in terms of interest and opportunity, et cetera.
[01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:19.820]   I wish I had something more profound, but that's what I got.
[01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:25.060]   No, no, no, that's, I mean, that's kind of what I expected was, you know, a generalized
[01:50:25.060 --> 01:50:28.460]   summarization and like I just bouncing ideas.
[01:50:28.460 --> 01:50:31.620]   I've got one more question if you've got time.
[01:50:31.620 --> 01:50:33.340]   Sure, go ahead.
[01:50:33.340 --> 01:50:34.340]   Okay.
[01:50:34.340 --> 01:50:39.220]   So, I'm completely sold on trying to homeschool my kids.
[01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:45.900]   I kind of come off in the conversation a little bit overbearing with my wife and I think that
[01:50:45.900 --> 01:50:54.500]   slightly put her off of the situation and I don't, I'd like to try to work on getting
[01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:59.900]   back on track, but I don't think she believes me when I say that the school systems aren't
[01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:05.060]   really doing the best job and that I think we could do better and I think one of the
[01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:11.460]   big thing determining factors is that, well, we just had twin, we have four-year-old twins.
[01:51:11.460 --> 01:51:17.900]   So, when they were born, we were very busy back and forth and they're about four and
[01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:24.500]   they, they'll talk to us, but like they're not having conversations with us, you know,
[01:51:24.500 --> 01:51:30.780]   they'll give us demands and, you know, prompts and, you know, and it's getting a lot better
[01:51:30.780 --> 01:51:31.780]   in the last six months.
[01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:37.780]   It's gotten a lot better, but what happened is we kind of got spooked and we had them
[01:51:37.780 --> 01:51:40.620]   and we wanted to get, you know, some professional help.
[01:51:40.620 --> 01:51:47.100]   So, we signed them up at, you know, a speech therapist and it was at the local school and
[01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:48.100]   they seen them.
[01:51:48.100 --> 01:51:50.620]   They said they, you know, they were a little bit underdeveloped.
[01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:56.380]   They suggested kindergarten, pre-K, and so we were like, well, okay.
[01:51:56.380 --> 01:52:03.700]   And so, now they're already in school and I'm kind of like, I think it's doing good
[01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:09.140]   for them because the teachers all very care and I think at this level, they all are very
[01:52:09.140 --> 01:52:13.100]   interactive and care and I think it's doing good for them.
[01:52:13.100 --> 01:52:22.620]   So, I'm kind of like caught between this like, oh no, school's not that good, but, you know,
[01:52:22.620 --> 01:52:27.740]   but we weren't doing as good a job as we felt like or, you know, I don't know, I just want
[01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:28.740]   to run that by you.
[01:52:28.740 --> 01:52:29.740]   Yeah.
[01:52:29.740 --> 01:52:32.380]   So, your oldest two children are four and then you, do you have another younger or do
[01:52:32.380 --> 01:52:34.300]   you have another older?
[01:52:34.300 --> 01:52:36.580]   I have another older, he's 14.
[01:52:36.580 --> 01:52:37.580]   Okay.
[01:52:37.580 --> 01:52:39.700]   And then your wife is expecting a baby right now?
[01:52:39.700 --> 01:52:40.700]   Yep.
[01:52:40.700 --> 01:52:41.700]   Okay.
[01:52:41.700 --> 01:52:42.700]   So, maybe twins, who knows?
[01:52:42.700 --> 01:52:43.700]   Maybe twins again.
[01:52:43.700 --> 01:52:48.860]   And in terms of your, in terms of your 14 year old, what has been his or her pathway
[01:52:48.860 --> 01:52:51.700]   through school?
[01:52:51.700 --> 01:52:56.660]   Just public schooling the whole time and, you know, I'm really not that satisfied with
[01:52:56.660 --> 01:52:57.660]   it.
[01:52:57.660 --> 01:52:58.660]   Okay.
[01:52:58.660 --> 01:52:59.660]   And how's he doing?
[01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:04.300]   Like, is it working or you said you're not satisfied, but how's he doing?
[01:53:04.300 --> 01:53:05.640]   He's making it through.
[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:07.380]   He's not interested in it.
[01:53:07.380 --> 01:53:08.380]   Okay.
[01:53:08.380 --> 01:53:12.660]   So, he, you know, he's a typical 14 year old boy.
[01:53:12.660 --> 01:53:13.660]   He did well.
[01:53:13.660 --> 01:53:19.820]   He, you know, the last two years before this, we kind of really had to get on him about
[01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:20.820]   doing his grades.
[01:53:20.820 --> 01:53:23.540]   He just, he's good enough to do the grades.
[01:53:23.540 --> 01:53:25.620]   He's just lazy about getting them.
[01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:26.620]   Right.
[01:53:26.620 --> 01:53:33.500]   So, and then now we're into high school and he's just kind of like, this isn't for me,
[01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:38.340]   you know, I'm doing it because I have to, kind of thing.
[01:53:38.340 --> 01:53:46.260]   And how recent is your personal interest in this topic of homeschooling?
[01:53:46.260 --> 01:53:50.500]   I got to say in the last two years, you know, you kind of hit me with some, some podcasts
[01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:55.860]   and I, you've kind of really gotten me thinking and kind of like analyzing my 14 year old
[01:53:55.860 --> 01:54:01.180]   and seeing some of the bad trends and like, kind of like listening to a more about what's
[01:54:01.180 --> 01:54:07.380]   going on in school and, you know, it's, it's not really a bad school, but like all the
[01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:10.780]   kids, all they want to do or seems like they want to fight.
[01:54:10.780 --> 01:54:17.860]   I mean, like that's, that's the majority of stories that I hear is like, oh, the kids
[01:54:17.860 --> 01:54:21.860]   were fighting in the bathroom or, you know, in the lunchroom or whatever.
[01:54:21.860 --> 01:54:26.980]   And I'm just kind of like, man, do I really want my kid in this area?
[01:54:26.980 --> 01:54:30.980]   Like, and we're in, we're like actually in a good part of town.
[01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:31.980]   Right.
[01:54:31.980 --> 01:54:32.980]   Right.
[01:54:32.980 --> 01:54:33.980]   Okay.
[01:54:33.980 --> 01:54:37.820]   So first of all, I'm glad that you're interested in this.
[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:41.420]   I'm glad that my content has had an influence on that.
[01:54:41.420 --> 01:54:47.060]   So I think this is however, how you deal with this or how you interact with this, I think
[01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:53.860]   is really important and you're going to get great results if you go about this in a thoughtful
[01:54:53.860 --> 01:55:03.900]   way and, and, and you can get really bad results if you aren't careful and thoughtful.
[01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:09.100]   So let's begin with this, right up until two years ago, you didn't have much interest in
[01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:13.620]   the topic of schooling, education, et cetera.
[01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:16.780]   This is a fairly recent thing for you.
[01:55:16.780 --> 01:55:23.220]   And while it's wonderful that you are now interested, you have to recognize that other
[01:55:23.220 --> 01:55:28.860]   people are going to remember you more about how you were up until two years ago, rather
[01:55:28.860 --> 01:55:30.460]   than how you are today.
[01:55:30.460 --> 01:55:34.220]   And so whenever you get super interested in something and you start educating yourself,
[01:55:34.220 --> 01:55:38.220]   et cetera, you've got to be thoughtful about how you share that with other people and not
[01:55:38.220 --> 01:55:44.380]   just go around telling everyone why they're wrong and rather be, be more considerate in
[01:55:44.380 --> 01:55:45.820]   how you do that.
[01:55:45.820 --> 01:55:52.340]   And so it's your, what you are learning is perfectly valid, but wisdom would say that
[01:55:52.340 --> 01:55:57.940]   you shouldn't just spout it out to everybody else and expect them to just be a hundred
[01:55:57.940 --> 01:55:59.940]   percent on the same board with you.
[01:55:59.940 --> 01:56:03.620]   After all, it took you 12 years with your older child, you had a child who was 12 years
[01:56:03.620 --> 01:56:06.260]   old before you took an interest in his education.
[01:56:06.260 --> 01:56:11.860]   And so you're not going to undo that in two years or in two months.
[01:56:11.860 --> 01:56:18.180]   So it's important for you to be thoughtful and considerate in how you interact with others.
[01:56:18.180 --> 01:56:22.300]   Also in terms of your relationship with your wife, it's really, really important that you
[01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:27.560]   are thoughtful and considerate in how you approach the subject with her.
[01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:32.700]   She has four-year-old twins, regardless of whether they were in school or not, that is
[01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:34.960]   an enormous workload for her.
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:38.540]   It is hard work to take care of four-year-old twins.
[01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:42.620]   And then with her expecting another baby, that makes it even more difficult.
[01:56:42.620 --> 01:56:47.200]   And if she's looking at you and she saw that for 12 years, you were totally disinterested
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:51.580]   in education of your kid and just, "Oh, send him home, he's doing fine, blah, blah, blah,"
[01:56:51.580 --> 01:56:52.580]   et cetera.
[01:56:52.580 --> 01:56:55.540]   And now all of a sudden there's a random podcast on the internet that you're listening to,
[01:56:55.540 --> 01:56:58.480]   it's got all these weird radical ideas, et cetera.
[01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:01.980]   You're going to need to really be wise in how you approach this subject and you're going
[01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:06.960]   to need to understand what she's willing to do and what she's not willing to do.
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:10.400]   Because there's a good chance that regardless of what you do, a lot of it's going to come
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:12.100]   down on her.
[01:57:12.100 --> 01:57:19.680]   Now if you can do it yourself, then okay, great, but that's probably not going to work
[01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:22.720]   well until or unless you're able to adjust some of your schedule.
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:28.200]   And so it's perfectly understandable if your wife gives some pushback to you with your
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:33.320]   latest crazy ideas that aren't borne out by bringing her along with you and are all going
[01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:35.480]   to result in a whole lot of work for her.
[01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:38.840]   And after all, she's going to question what she was doing before.
[01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:40.500]   So you got to be really thoughtful.
[01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:45.680]   And as a husband, a husband who arrives at a great destination and doesn't have his wife
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:48.340]   beside him is a failure as a husband.
[01:57:48.340 --> 01:57:53.940]   So one of your jobs is you can never outpace your wife on the change that you're leading
[01:57:53.940 --> 01:57:57.620]   your family in, is that she's got to be right there with you.
[01:57:57.620 --> 01:58:01.460]   And that often means that you're going to go slower than what you otherwise would have
[01:58:01.460 --> 01:58:04.560]   been, but you have to have her with you.
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:08.680]   And that means that you have to think together with her and you have to listen to her and
[01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:14.900]   you have to interact in a way that demonstrates that you value her input and that it's not
[01:58:14.900 --> 01:58:19.620]   just you, you know, being a dictator that I heard this great podcast, but rather that
[01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:24.740]   you initiate conversations and that conviction of whatever you guys are going to do with
[01:58:24.740 --> 01:58:28.540]   your children has to come together.
[01:58:28.540 --> 01:58:31.200]   Otherwise it's going to be a complete and total failure.
[01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:35.740]   And so the first thing you should assess is over the last couple of years, what have I
[01:58:35.740 --> 01:58:40.140]   done or what can I do to bring, what have I done to bring my wife together with me to
[01:58:40.140 --> 01:58:41.420]   think with her?
[01:58:41.420 --> 01:58:43.540]   Have I shared with her what I'm thinking about?
[01:58:43.540 --> 01:58:47.740]   That's usually the first thing is that a lot of times as a guy, you spend all your time
[01:58:47.740 --> 01:58:50.580]   thinking and your wife says, you know, Hey, you know, how was your day?
[01:58:50.580 --> 01:58:51.580]   What are you thinking about?
[01:58:51.580 --> 01:58:53.180]   And you're thinking, but you don't want to talk to her.
[01:58:53.180 --> 01:58:57.280]   And so it's important to make sure that she's always in the loop of what you're thinking,
[01:58:57.280 --> 01:59:00.340]   that you open your mouth and you tell her what you're thinking about and the ideas that
[01:59:00.340 --> 01:59:01.340]   you have, et cetera.
[01:59:01.340 --> 01:59:06.300]   And I'm not saying what you have or haven't done, just speaking broadly, broadly on the
[01:59:06.300 --> 01:59:07.300]   subject.
[01:59:07.300 --> 01:59:10.820]   So no criticism here, but you want to make sure that you're really diligent about that.
[01:59:10.820 --> 01:59:14.340]   And then you want to give her time to think about these things.
[01:59:14.340 --> 01:59:18.740]   And then you want to ask her for her input and her perspective in order for her to feel
[01:59:18.740 --> 01:59:20.020]   confident in you.
[01:59:20.020 --> 01:59:22.380]   She has to feel like you care about her.
[01:59:22.380 --> 01:59:25.780]   And the way that we show people that we care about them is generally, we listen to them.
[01:59:25.780 --> 01:59:29.060]   We spend time with them and we listen to them and we take their input and we take their
[01:59:29.060 --> 01:59:30.340]   feedback, et cetera.
[01:59:30.340 --> 01:59:32.020]   And that's the starting point.
[01:59:32.020 --> 01:59:36.100]   So then in that context, if you've done a good job with that, now you can start to go
[01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:37.500]   in a different direction.
[01:59:37.500 --> 01:59:39.460]   But if not, you'll want to start there.
[01:59:39.460 --> 01:59:46.060]   Now, if you don't have super productive conversations, then one of the things that you'll want to
[01:59:46.060 --> 01:59:50.260]   bring in is you'll want to bring in a resource, something that you'll talk about together,
[01:59:50.260 --> 01:59:51.820]   you'll think about together.
[01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:57.300]   So husbands and wives, especially if you don't have, if it's not natural, if you don't naturally
[01:59:57.300 --> 02:00:02.220]   think together, one thing that can be really helpful is to have something that you work
[02:00:02.220 --> 02:00:03.580]   on together.
[02:00:03.580 --> 02:00:09.540]   So a book that you're reading together or a podcast that you're listening to together,
[02:00:09.540 --> 02:00:11.860]   a book that you're listening together, et cetera.
[02:00:11.860 --> 02:00:15.700]   On this subject, school, I now have, I've just finished a book that was new to me.
[02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:19.080]   I now have a starting point that I would recommend to you.
[02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:23.980]   And the book is called Rethinking School by author Susan Wise Bower.
[02:00:23.980 --> 02:00:28.620]   Again, it's called Rethinking School by author Susan Wise Bower.
[02:00:28.620 --> 02:00:35.340]   Susan Wise Bower is fairly well-known in homeschooling circles because she wrote various books, but
[02:00:35.340 --> 02:00:38.860]   her most well-known ones are books called The Well-Trained Mind and The Well-Educated
[02:00:38.860 --> 02:00:43.520]   Mind, et cetera, that are widely used in the classical homeschooling tradition.
[02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:47.340]   But this book, I think it's fairly recent of her, I really appreciated this book.
[02:00:47.340 --> 02:00:52.100]   And what I appreciated the most about it is she does a good job of carefully laying out
[02:00:52.100 --> 02:00:57.100]   some of the great things about the school system and also where a lot of this tension
[02:00:57.100 --> 02:00:59.380]   that we have with the school system comes.
[02:00:59.380 --> 02:01:05.740]   And then she systematically gives good advice for parents at every level of engagement with
[02:01:05.740 --> 02:01:07.220]   the system.
[02:01:07.220 --> 02:01:13.780]   And what's really important about this is that I don't think that the answers are either
[02:01:13.780 --> 02:01:17.020]   you put your children in a government school or you homeschool.
[02:01:17.020 --> 02:01:21.580]   There are a lot of people who can't homeschool, don't want to homeschool, won't homeschool.
[02:01:21.580 --> 02:01:24.020]   And I think we need to have a lot of options beyond that.
[02:01:24.020 --> 02:01:28.540]   And so I really appreciated how she works through this step-by-step.
[02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:32.460]   And if you're going to have your children in the government school, she goes through
[02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:35.220]   how to get the best results out of that.
[02:01:35.220 --> 02:01:39.740]   For example, with your 14-year-old, one of the first things I would do before disrupting
[02:01:39.740 --> 02:01:43.540]   his life would be to focus on afterschooling him.
[02:01:43.540 --> 02:01:48.860]   What I mean is that it's your job, regardless of what the school does or doesn't do well,
[02:01:48.860 --> 02:01:52.620]   it's your job as a father to help him to succeed.
[02:01:52.620 --> 02:01:56.060]   And that means that he's going to have to succeed in the academics where he's good at
[02:01:56.060 --> 02:01:57.060]   it.
[02:01:57.060 --> 02:01:59.820]   And you're going to have to coach him into a life path that is productive so he doesn't
[02:01:59.820 --> 02:02:03.740]   just wander in the desert for 10 years and then wake up as a 30-year-old and say, "Okay,
[02:02:03.740 --> 02:02:06.500]   I'm going to get serious about life 10 years behind."
[02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:12.380]   And so you need to be working with him very intensively as a father regardless of what
[02:02:12.380 --> 02:02:14.460]   school he's in or not in.
[02:02:14.460 --> 02:02:18.860]   And in that process, you will shore up those areas where the schooling is weak.
[02:02:18.860 --> 02:02:19.860]   You'll find solutions.
[02:02:19.860 --> 02:02:21.660]   You'll interact with him, etc.
[02:02:21.660 --> 02:02:26.220]   And a lot of that can be done independent of the schooling.
[02:02:26.220 --> 02:02:28.060]   Other things you want to test on.
[02:02:28.060 --> 02:02:30.500]   So I'm not going to do this in a personalized way.
[02:02:30.500 --> 02:02:32.140]   So I'm going to ask these to you rhetorically.
[02:02:32.140 --> 02:02:35.860]   But other things I'm going to test on is, do you go to your parent-teacher meetings?
[02:02:35.860 --> 02:02:37.980]   Do you know who your children's parents are?
[02:02:37.980 --> 02:02:38.980]   There's a lot you...
[02:02:38.980 --> 02:02:39.980]   Sorry, your children's parents.
[02:02:39.980 --> 02:02:43.140]   Do you know who your children's teachers are?
[02:02:43.140 --> 02:02:50.220]   A very different meaning there.
[02:02:50.220 --> 02:02:52.420]   So are you involved?
[02:02:52.420 --> 02:02:56.780]   You can go a long way towards just simply being involved with your child within the
[02:02:56.780 --> 02:03:00.420]   current school context before you even think about doing something else, before you think
[02:03:00.420 --> 02:03:02.660]   about homeschooling, etc.
[02:03:02.660 --> 02:03:04.260]   And then you can assign your child.
[02:03:04.260 --> 02:03:09.420]   One good way of seeing how homeschooling is going to work is going to be to find out,
[02:03:09.420 --> 02:03:12.260]   is my child willing to take direction from me?
[02:03:12.260 --> 02:03:16.620]   Can I give my 14-year-old a course on Khan Academy and require him...
[02:03:16.620 --> 02:03:20.020]   By the way, Khan Academy has a great career course that maybe you and he could go through
[02:03:20.020 --> 02:03:25.020]   together because you might enjoy that, and talk about that, and will he take assignments
[02:03:25.020 --> 02:03:26.540]   from me there?
[02:03:26.540 --> 02:03:33.180]   Or if I put out resources for him, will he sit down and pick up some of the books that
[02:03:33.180 --> 02:03:35.580]   I leave strewn around the house, or can we...
[02:03:35.580 --> 02:03:36.580]   What can we do?
[02:03:36.580 --> 02:03:39.580]   And so you want to test these things before you just disrupt everything for you to move
[02:03:39.580 --> 02:03:42.800]   in a thoughtful and wise way.
[02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:45.860]   So I would encourage you, go through the Rethinking School book.
[02:03:45.860 --> 02:03:50.340]   Now, in terms of homeschooling, one of the things that you'll really want to do is that
[02:03:50.340 --> 02:03:52.820]   especially if your wife is going to be doing...
[02:03:52.820 --> 02:03:56.460]   Would be doing some of the...
[02:03:56.460 --> 02:03:57.780]   Some or most of the work, right?
[02:03:57.780 --> 02:04:02.660]   I always say that because I do most of the homeschooling for my older children.
[02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:04.380]   My wife does for the younger children.
[02:04:04.380 --> 02:04:09.060]   So our family, I'm the guy who's really into it, but that's not the normal case.
[02:04:09.060 --> 02:04:12.740]   Most of the time, the fathers are not that into it, the mothers are.
[02:04:12.740 --> 02:04:17.780]   And so I think homeschooling moms is an appropriate moniker to use, even though I'm a homeschooling
[02:04:17.780 --> 02:04:20.980]   mom, I guess.
[02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:26.980]   But when dealing with females who are going to homeschool, there's usually a few basic
[02:04:26.980 --> 02:04:31.340]   things that they have to come to conviction about.
[02:04:31.340 --> 02:04:34.040]   And these take time, but I'm just going to list three for you.
[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:37.500]   Thing number one is, is this normal?
[02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:38.980]   Is this normal?
[02:04:38.980 --> 02:04:43.580]   And if you don't know anybody who homeschools, you've never been around homeschoolers, you
[02:04:43.580 --> 02:04:50.740]   never had the idea, whatever, just the whole normality of this is hard for some people
[02:04:50.740 --> 02:04:51.740]   to get to.
[02:04:51.740 --> 02:04:56.200]   I don't understand this because it's been normal for me my entire life, and I'm surrounded
[02:04:56.200 --> 02:04:58.940]   by people for whom it's normal, et cetera.
[02:04:58.940 --> 02:05:03.620]   And so what's weird for me is the idea that any parent would send their child to a government
[02:05:03.620 --> 02:05:04.620]   school.
[02:05:04.620 --> 02:05:05.820]   To me, that's the craziest thing in the world.
[02:05:05.820 --> 02:05:06.820]   You don't know?
[02:05:06.820 --> 02:05:08.860]   You didn't pick the teacher for your child?
[02:05:08.860 --> 02:05:17.460]   It's quite unthinkable for me, but I recognize that I don't reflect the general trend.
[02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:20.500]   I'm pointing out that influence matters.
[02:05:20.500 --> 02:05:24.420]   And so if your wife doesn't know any other homeschoolers, she doesn't know any homeschooling
[02:05:24.420 --> 02:05:27.580]   family, she's never been around it, she's just going to say, "It's not even normal.
[02:05:27.580 --> 02:05:28.580]   I don't know."
[02:05:28.580 --> 02:05:33.080]   So you have to make sure that you and she both understand, if you're going to go in
[02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:37.100]   that direction, okay, this is normal, and that's going to require exposure.
[02:05:37.100 --> 02:05:40.460]   Number two is going to be a question of, is this good?
[02:05:40.460 --> 02:05:42.900]   Is this good for a child?
[02:05:42.900 --> 02:05:48.300]   Because if somebody has an idea that homeschooling is not good for a child, then no mother is
[02:05:48.300 --> 02:05:51.180]   going to allow her children to be put in a situation that's not good for them.
[02:05:51.180 --> 02:05:52.340]   That would be unthinkable.
[02:05:52.340 --> 02:05:54.600]   That's a dereliction of her duty.
[02:05:54.600 --> 02:05:59.220]   And so you have to be convinced that it's good, and that's also kind of a philosophical
[02:05:59.220 --> 02:06:00.220]   discussion.
[02:06:00.220 --> 02:06:01.220]   How would we know if it's good?
[02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:02.780]   How do we know what a good education is?
[02:06:02.780 --> 02:06:04.060]   What do we want for our children?
[02:06:04.060 --> 02:06:05.140]   What are our ambitions?
[02:06:05.140 --> 02:06:06.980]   What's possible for them, et cetera?
[02:06:06.980 --> 02:06:12.620]   So you want to get around people and hear their stories and just ask yourself, "Is
[02:06:12.620 --> 02:06:13.620]   this good?"
[02:06:13.620 --> 02:06:15.860]   And then the number three is, "Am I capable?
[02:06:15.860 --> 02:06:16.860]   Am I capable?"
[02:06:16.860 --> 02:06:22.420]   And one of the weaknesses that really besets a lot of homeschooling moms is they doubt
[02:06:22.420 --> 02:06:23.420]   their capability.
[02:06:23.420 --> 02:06:26.420]   They think, "Oh, I can't do that.
[02:06:26.420 --> 02:06:30.580]   After all, I didn't go to college," or, "I don't have a teaching degree," or, "How
[02:06:30.580 --> 02:06:33.180]   am I going to teach calculus to my child?
[02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:34.580]   Am I capable of doing it?"
[02:06:34.580 --> 02:06:36.580]   And they really doubt their abilities.
[02:06:36.580 --> 02:06:41.860]   And I think this is something that moms struggle with more than we do.
[02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:45.460]   As men, we're full of unbridled confidence in our ability to do anything, whether we've
[02:06:45.460 --> 02:06:47.300]   ever tried it or not.
[02:06:47.300 --> 02:06:52.660]   Most of it misplaced, but we still have the confidence, whereas women are much more akin
[02:06:52.660 --> 02:06:55.620]   to saying, "Well, I just can't do it."
[02:06:55.620 --> 02:06:58.380]   But that's where you need a plan.
[02:06:58.380 --> 02:07:01.320]   And what you can do is, number one, is you need to build her confidence.
[02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:05.840]   And part of the way you build her confidence is by showing her a way that she can do it.
[02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:11.820]   And so this is where you need to understand, because there's a learning process.
[02:07:11.820 --> 02:07:16.680]   A mother who's never homeschooled her children might exclusively have the idea of what she
[02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:18.800]   was exposed to as schooling growing up.
[02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:20.960]   She's like, "I can't do that.
[02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:26.240]   I can't set up a blackboard in my living room and stand in front of it for eight hours and
[02:07:26.240 --> 02:07:28.160]   watch my child through eight subjects, et cetera.
[02:07:28.160 --> 02:07:29.700]   I can't do that."
[02:07:29.700 --> 02:07:34.280]   But if you understand how different homeschooling can actually be, and often is, from that,
[02:07:34.280 --> 02:07:35.280]   it's different.
[02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:38.080]   And so you'll want to expose to curriculum options.
[02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:42.840]   You want to expose to a little bit of ideas about what you're drawn towards, et cetera.
[02:07:42.840 --> 02:07:48.560]   You want her to understand that she can do it, because the reality is that any mom can
[02:07:48.560 --> 02:07:51.360]   easily homeschool her children.
[02:07:51.360 --> 02:07:56.920]   It really helps if a mother can read and write, at least at a fourth grade level, because
[02:07:56.920 --> 02:07:58.720]   then it makes it a little easier.
[02:07:58.720 --> 02:08:04.180]   But now, being a little joking, but not really, I'm convinced that a mother who had a little
[02:08:04.180 --> 02:08:09.020]   bit of thought, even if she herself couldn't read or write, could effectively homeschool
[02:08:09.020 --> 02:08:14.480]   a child, because we're not dealing with areas where it's the actual specialized instruction
[02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:15.680]   that makes the difference.
[02:08:15.680 --> 02:08:23.880]   Most of it is a matter of a general environment and working on a systematic basis with the
[02:08:23.880 --> 02:08:24.880]   child.
[02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:30.280]   And then she just needs to have the confidence that she can bring in experts wherever appropriate.
[02:08:30.280 --> 02:08:34.560]   So for example, right now, you could probably, because in most places you can, you could
[02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:40.360]   probably have access to all of the special education teachers or all of the therapists
[02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:43.800]   and whatnot in the school system, even if you homeschooled and just sent the children
[02:08:43.800 --> 02:08:46.680]   there for therapy.
[02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:50.120]   Many school districts will allow you to pick and choose what you participate in.
[02:08:50.120 --> 02:08:53.840]   And so you can do things at home that are better at home, and then go and find teachers
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:55.200]   for where that's better.
[02:08:55.200 --> 02:08:58.120]   And that's the most important thing that she understands, is that you don't have to make
[02:08:58.120 --> 02:08:59.640]   it up.
[02:08:59.640 --> 02:09:04.480]   There are dozens and dozens of completely done-for-you curricula that are great, that
[02:09:04.480 --> 02:09:08.600]   are really wonderful, wonderful environments that she can just sit down and say, "Work
[02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:13.040]   through the thing with the child, and read these pages from this book, ask these questions,
[02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:14.480]   do these worksheets," et cetera.
[02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:18.160]   It's all laid out by whatever curriculum provider you're interested in.
[02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:21.620]   And then if she needs, if the children need a more advanced teacher, you just go get the
[02:09:21.620 --> 02:09:23.480]   more advanced teacher.
[02:09:23.480 --> 02:09:27.160]   But that takes time to build that belief, and that takes time to build that experience.
[02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:32.680]   So I have it in abundance because of exposure, research, and experience, but it would be
[02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:37.160]   very unusual for her to have that without a good amount of work on your part, and you
[02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:40.800]   guys going and getting exposed, and her knowing other homeschooled moms, and asking all of
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:45.400]   her questions, and going to a convention, and seeing all the things, and finding a message
[02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:49.320]   board that she's into, or a Facebook group, or a YouTube channel, or something like that.
[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:52.560]   I think it's going to take some time for those things to build.
[02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:58.720]   And if she's going to be the homeschooled mom, she's got to be in it, like in it.
[02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:03.520]   It can't be you pushing it on her, or it's just going to create problems in your marriage,
[02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:05.320]   in your house, and with your children.
[02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:06.320]   She's got to be in it.
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:10.400]   So your job is to bring her along with you, to work together, to say what's best for our
[02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:11.400]   family.
[02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:15.560]   And then here's my final thing of my fairly lengthy monologue here.
[02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:17.280]   Nothing is forever.
[02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:21.440]   All this stuff can change all the time, and you don't have to decide anything that's for
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:22.440]   good.
[02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:27.400]   So I think that classrooms for young children can be wonderful places.
[02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:28.800]   They're just great.
[02:10:28.800 --> 02:10:32.520]   There's a major difference between your four-year-old's classrooms and your 14-year-old's classrooms
[02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:34.840]   in terms of the experience.
[02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:36.280]   Four-year-old classrooms are awesome.
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:37.280]   They're just so fun.
[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:38.680]   The teachers love the children.
[02:10:38.680 --> 02:10:40.040]   The teachers do all the work.
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:41.040]   They're fantastic.
[02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:44.120]   Your 14-year-old classroom may be different.
[02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:47.040]   And so things are different at different ages.
[02:10:47.040 --> 02:10:50.260]   And you can enroll your child in school, and you can pull your child out of school, and
[02:10:50.260 --> 02:10:53.620]   you can homeschool for six months, and you can go right back into the government school,
[02:10:53.620 --> 02:10:56.340]   and you can do this thing for a year, and you can do that thing for a year, and you
[02:10:56.340 --> 02:10:59.340]   can try this, and you can drop that, and you can change this.
[02:10:59.340 --> 02:11:00.820]   None of this stuff is permanent.
[02:11:00.820 --> 02:11:04.460]   So don't think that you have to do this forever like this, or you're going to screw up your
[02:11:04.460 --> 02:11:05.460]   child.
[02:11:05.460 --> 02:11:09.580]   Just get an idea, do your research, and be thoughtful, and then go in that direction.
[02:11:09.580 --> 02:11:14.500]   And then reassess regularly and say, "Is what we're doing working, or do we want to change
[02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:15.500]   something?"
[02:11:15.500 --> 02:11:20.500]   Maybe that should give you enough freedom and flexibility in your thinking to approach
[02:11:20.500 --> 02:11:25.340]   your children and say, "What is necessary for my children to flourish?"
[02:11:25.340 --> 02:11:26.900]   Because I conclude with this.
[02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:33.420]   Regardless of what you choose in terms of this particular school, your responsibility
[02:11:33.420 --> 02:11:36.580]   as a father for your children does not change.
[02:11:36.580 --> 02:11:40.100]   Their education is your responsibility.
[02:11:40.100 --> 02:11:45.620]   It's absolutely your responsibility to see that they are educated and prepared in all
[02:11:45.620 --> 02:11:48.980]   ways that they need to be for success in life.
[02:11:48.980 --> 02:11:52.180]   That includes academic knowledge, because we live in an academic society.
[02:11:52.180 --> 02:11:55.840]   That includes moral knowledge, because we live in a moral world.
[02:11:55.840 --> 02:11:59.660]   That includes career knowledge, because we live in a financial system, et cetera.
[02:11:59.660 --> 02:12:02.900]   So you are responsible to prepare your children for that.
[02:12:02.900 --> 02:12:08.220]   And then in that context, as you embrace fully your responsibility, then you can go and say,
[02:12:08.220 --> 02:12:10.820]   "Well, am I going to use the government school?
[02:12:10.820 --> 02:12:12.780]   What aspects of the government school can I use for it?
[02:12:12.780 --> 02:12:14.340]   Am I going to use a private school?
[02:12:14.340 --> 02:12:15.980]   Am I going to use a private tutor?
[02:12:15.980 --> 02:12:16.980]   Am I going to teach?
[02:12:16.980 --> 02:12:17.980]   How am I going to do that?"
[02:12:17.980 --> 02:12:22.820]   And then ask God for wisdom to say, "Here, in this context, is what I can do."
[02:12:22.820 --> 02:12:28.900]   Because you have that responsibility no matter those external factors.
[02:12:28.900 --> 02:12:32.740]   And especially with your 14-year-old, this is where you've got to roll up your sleeves
[02:12:32.740 --> 02:12:38.820]   and you've got to be in there with him every single day, constantly engaging him, helping
[02:12:38.820 --> 02:12:43.500]   him to think, coaching him to where he needs, because these are the most crucial years for
[02:12:43.500 --> 02:12:44.780]   you as a father.
[02:12:44.780 --> 02:12:48.140]   You could disappear out of the lives of your four-year-olds and come back in a year and
[02:12:48.140 --> 02:12:50.380]   pick up where you left off with minimal damage.
[02:12:50.380 --> 02:12:54.060]   But with a 14-year-old, this is where you're on stage.
[02:12:54.060 --> 02:12:55.060]   These are your years.
[02:12:55.060 --> 02:12:57.180]   And so you've got to be in there day and night.
[02:12:57.180 --> 02:12:58.180]   So those are my thoughts.
[02:12:58.180 --> 02:12:59.180]   Hope that helps.
[02:12:59.180 --> 02:13:00.180]   Awesome.
[02:13:00.180 --> 02:13:01.180]   Awesome.
[02:13:01.180 --> 02:13:02.180]   Yeah.
[02:13:02.180 --> 02:13:11.340]   You know, in the last two years, I've really taken, maybe I felt guilty that I wasn't involved
[02:13:11.340 --> 02:13:15.180]   in my son's education as much as I felt like maybe I should have.
[02:13:15.180 --> 02:13:18.900]   Well, I should have been more.
[02:13:18.900 --> 02:13:24.640]   Maybe I think that's the feelings I harbored and why I may have came on so strong to my
[02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:32.140]   wife about pushing to make a better situation for the more children that are on the way
[02:13:32.140 --> 02:13:38.940]   and I think, you know, like you said, the confidence thing is her big issue because
[02:13:38.940 --> 02:13:42.340]   we've had a lot of conversations and we're both kind of on par.
[02:13:42.340 --> 02:13:44.780]   Yes, we think it's a good idea.
[02:13:44.780 --> 02:13:49.260]   You know, we kind of throw it around a little bit, but we're not, we haven't like, you know,
[02:13:49.260 --> 02:13:50.900]   put anything in stone.
[02:13:50.900 --> 02:13:55.820]   And then the fact that, you know, we had to go get them evaluated, kind of like said it
[02:13:55.820 --> 02:14:00.580]   felt like we put us on our heels on the whole situation.
[02:14:00.580 --> 02:14:01.580]   But yeah, yeah.
[02:14:01.580 --> 02:14:03.780]   Thank you so much for going through that again.
[02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:08.860]   And I know you've done the homeschool thing, several episodes on that, but, you know, I
[02:14:08.860 --> 02:14:11.060]   just wanted to shoot it by you.
[02:14:11.060 --> 02:14:12.060]   Yeah.
[02:14:12.060 --> 02:14:13.060]   Keep your ears out.
[02:14:13.060 --> 02:14:17.540]   I have, you know, we're coming up on episode 1000 of Radical Personal Finance and I haven't
[02:14:17.540 --> 02:14:20.220]   publicized what my plans are and whatnot.
[02:14:20.220 --> 02:14:22.940]   And I do intend to continue with Radical Personal Finance.
[02:14:22.940 --> 02:14:29.780]   But as is probably no doubt obvious to any long-term listener of the show, I have enormous
[02:14:29.780 --> 02:14:32.940]   levels of passion for this subject.
[02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:37.060]   And so, I intend to do more on this in the future and share more.
[02:14:37.060 --> 02:14:38.740]   I have enormous levels of passion.
[02:14:38.740 --> 02:14:41.500]   I have increasing levels of confidence from my own experience.
[02:14:41.500 --> 02:14:46.860]   And I just, I believe that this is so important because we are living in a world in which
[02:14:46.860 --> 02:14:49.920]   the systems of the old are not working.
[02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:52.100]   They are collapsing left, right and center.
[02:14:52.100 --> 02:14:54.920]   And we have to envision the systems of the new world.
[02:14:54.920 --> 02:15:02.000]   And so, just very practically with your wife, get around some homeschooled people, you know,
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:03.000]   in your local community.
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:07.580]   Look for a community in terms of people that you can interact with.
[02:15:07.580 --> 02:15:12.080]   And if you can get her around some homeschool moms, again, whatever function is locally,
[02:15:12.080 --> 02:15:14.020]   there's plenty there for you.
[02:15:14.020 --> 02:15:17.800]   Recognize that with four-year-olds, there is nothing that needs to be done.
[02:15:17.800 --> 02:15:19.840]   And so, yes, you should seek out specialists.
[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:20.840]   That's your job.
[02:15:20.840 --> 02:15:22.480]   And if those specialists are helping, great.
[02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:29.560]   But there is zero evidence that you need to put your children in school at four, five,
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:31.080]   etc.
[02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:35.920]   There are plenty of people who didn't start anything formalized until seven and you're
[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:37.160]   not behind.
[02:15:37.160 --> 02:15:40.000]   And so, like, you have plenty of time.
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000]   There's no reason to stress at all.
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:45.800]   Now, with your 14-year-old, you have proven that a man can make it in the world without
[02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:47.320]   a high school diploma.
[02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:53.080]   So you have that experience, but that experience also probably shows you that it's better off
[02:15:53.080 --> 02:15:54.080]   that he have it.
[02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:55.080]   But guess what?
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:58.720]   You can write up a high school diploma on a piece of paper with a pencil and a ruler,
[02:15:58.720 --> 02:16:02.920]   and it's just as valid as the high school diploma from your local government school.
[02:16:02.920 --> 02:16:05.640]   It's something that you make up based upon what you do.
[02:16:05.640 --> 02:16:10.360]   And that's what the secret, like, I appreciate when people start looking into it, you're
[02:16:10.360 --> 02:16:11.360]   scandalized.
[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:14.520]   And you realize, wait a second, my government school doesn't have to be accredited, it just
[02:16:14.520 --> 02:16:17.760]   continues issuing diplomas even if it's not accredited and all kinds of stuff.
[02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:22.120]   So what you really need to focus on is with your 14-year-old, explore the options, and
[02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:28.880]   then figure out what would be some of the best options for him to see to his success.
[02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:32.780]   And at this point in time, we can see even from our discussions with AI and everything
[02:16:32.780 --> 02:16:38.280]   that you're going through, et cetera, probably those subjects that he's studying in school,
[02:16:38.280 --> 02:16:41.920]   I believe they're important for knowledge, et cetera, but it's going to be more important
[02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:46.960]   that you start laboring with him on areas of interest and developing skills, et cetera.
[02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:51.000]   So I'm an academic, I think we need to encourage the academics.
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:55.480]   I'm not in favor of abandoning a liberal arts education and just funneling people into trade
[02:16:55.480 --> 02:16:56.480]   schools.
[02:16:56.480 --> 02:16:59.760]   But you want to interact with him and figure out where his interests are and really connect
[02:16:59.760 --> 02:17:00.840]   with him and coach him.
[02:17:00.840 --> 02:17:02.120]   So I will quit.
[02:17:02.120 --> 02:17:03.960]   Thank you all so much for listening to today's Friday Q&A show.
[02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:04.960]   I hope you've enjoyed it.
[02:17:04.960 --> 02:17:05.960]   I have certainly enjoyed it.
[02:17:05.960 --> 02:17:09.600]   I always enjoy these shows, they make me think, they make it easy, I just show up and do my
[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:12.800]   best to give you my thoughts and hopefully it's useful to you.
[02:17:12.800 --> 02:17:13.800]   Thank you so much for listening.
[02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:16.840]   A couple of things that were mentioned on the show today that I will remind you of,
[02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:21.120]   number one, I had the caller that I called in the beginning about internationalization,
[02:17:21.120 --> 02:17:25.120]   said nice things about my course, unsolicited, internationalskateplan.com.
[02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:29.680]   If you yourself are interested in figuring out a backup plan, internationalskateplan.com.
[02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:33.840]   I would really love for you to come and hang out with me in Panama if you are able or interested
[02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:35.080]   in any of those things.
[02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:36.920]   I feel like I wish I'd done a better job.
[02:17:36.920 --> 02:17:40.720]   I have not looked into the details of the Panama details in the last year and they changed
[02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:43.240]   everything enormously 18 months ago.
[02:17:43.240 --> 02:17:47.240]   So I'll be educating myself on their specific visa options when I'm there in January.
[02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:50.200]   But I'd love for you to come and be there alongside and we'll talk about it over cigars
[02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:52.200]   or cold drinks at night or something like that.
[02:17:52.200 --> 02:17:58.240]   Go to expatmoney.com/radical, expatmoney.com/radical, sign up for that event there in January.
[02:17:58.240 --> 02:18:00.240]   It's coming up soon, expatmoney.com/radical.
[02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:16.880]   And if you'd like to join me next week, patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance, and with that, I'm out of here.
[02:18:16.880 --> 02:18:21.120]   The holidays start here at Ralph's with a variety of options to celebrate traditions
[02:18:21.120 --> 02:18:22.400]   old and new.
[02:18:22.400 --> 02:18:27.200]   You could do a classic herb roasted turkey or spice it up and make turkey tacos, serve
[02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:33.740]   up a go-to shrimp cocktail or use simple truth wild-caught shrimp for your first Cajun risotto.
[02:18:33.740 --> 02:18:38.960]   Make creamy mac and cheese or a spinach artichoke fondue from our selection of Murray's cheese.
[02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:43.480]   No matter how you shop, Ralph's has all the freshest ingredients to embrace all your holiday
[02:18:43.480 --> 02:18:44.480]   traditions.
[02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:45.480]   Ralph's.
