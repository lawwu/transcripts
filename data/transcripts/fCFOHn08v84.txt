[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640]   I really like the Card Pointers app and I've used it for a long time.
[00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.100]   I think it's easy to use.
[00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.020]   I think it does a lot more than what you need it to do when you think, how do I manage this?
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.900]   And I'm not saying you can't use the other ones, but I'll tell you why I like the app
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.980]   and why I decided to partner with Card Pointers to get a discount for all of you
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.500]   because I think it has a ton of value.
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.660]   So first, you could just put all your cards in and you could do it without having to link your bank.
[00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.660]   So you could just say, I have an Amex Platinum and then it's added to your app
[00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.680]   and they keep track of all the perks and the benefits of that card
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.540]   because the app knows what the perks and benefits are of an Amex Platinum.
[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.300]   Now, if you go in and tell it, here's the date I signed up for that card
[00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.220]   and then they'll know, here's when your annual fees due and all that kind of stuff.
[00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.580]   So there's a view in the app where I could say, show me the calendar of all my upcoming annual fees
[00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.060]   so I can keep track on maybe I want to cancel a card before that happens.
[00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.440]   Maybe I want to call up and see if there's a retention offer, anything like that.
