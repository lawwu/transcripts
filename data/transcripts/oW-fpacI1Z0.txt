[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540]   [Silence]
[00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.880]   Let's talk about psilocybin.
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.480]   And again, today we're going to focus
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.960]   specifically on psilocybin and we're going to set aside
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.760]   all the other psychedelics for future episodes.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.120]   Psilocybin is what's called a tryptamine.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.960]   That refers to its chemical composition,
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.200]   not to the so-called psychedelic tryp.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.320]   In fact, it's spelled differently.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.320]   Tryptamine is T-R-Y-P, tryp, T-R-I-P, of course.
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.640]   Tryptamines include psilocybin,
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.000]   but also things like DMT and 5-MeO-DMT.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.320]   The tryptamine psychedelics
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.960]   very closely resemble serotonin itself.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.800]   That's right.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.560]   Most of you have probably heard of the chemical serotonin.
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.120]   And serotonin is what's called a neuromodulator,
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.720]   which means your brain and body naturally make it,
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.640]   and that it modifies or changes the activity
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.440]   of other neurons and neural circuits.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.440]   And it does that generally by either increasing
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.700]   or decreasing the activity of those neural circuits.
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.260]   If I were to show you a picture of the chemical structure
[00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.640]   of psilocybin or its active derivative, psilocin,
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.520]   and I were to also put right alongside it
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.920]   an image of the chemical structure of serotonin,
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.480]   provided that you weren't a chemist
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.680]   who really likes to focus
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.280]   on the detailed differences between things,
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.040]   you would say those look very similar.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.160]   And indeed, psilocybin and its active form, psilocin,
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.360]   are very similar structurally and chemically
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.060]   to serotonin itself.
[00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.160]   Now, as I mentioned before,
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.160]   serotonin is something that you naturally make.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.520]   And yes, it's true that about 90% of the serotonin
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.760]   in your brain and body is manufactured in your gut.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.960]   However, contrary to popular belief,
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.120]   the serotonin in your brain is not manufactured
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.600]   from the serotonin in your gut.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.020]   You have separate independent sources of serotonin.
[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.220]   That is, you have particular neurons
[00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.000]   that make serotonin in your brain.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.680]   You also have serotonin in your gut,
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.640]   and those work more or less in parallel, separately.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.100]   Now, what does serotonin do?
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.180]   This is really important to understand
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.060]   because of the similarity between psilocybin
[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.340]   and its active form, psilocin, and serotonin.
[00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.220]   Serotonin, in that it's a neuromodulator,
[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.260]   changes the activity of other neurons,
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.980]   and the net effects of those changes
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.340]   are things that you're familiar with.
[00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.280]   For instance, satiety,
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.340]   or the feeling that we've had enough of various things,
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.540]   such as food, or a social interaction, or sex,
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.940]   or pleasure of any kind.
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.020]   Serotonin is involved in all of that
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.940]   and an enormous number of other things,
[00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.940]   such as mood regulation,
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.420]   such as our sense of pleasure itself, or lack of pleasure,
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.740]   such as whether or not we feel motivated or not motivated.
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.220]   It works in concert with other neuromodulators,
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.740]   such as dopamine, and epinephrine, and norepinephrine.
[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.040]   In fact, if this were an episode about serotonin,
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.660]   which it is not,
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.380]   you would soon realize that serotonin
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.620]   is involved in so many different functions
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.840]   that impact our daily life.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.860]   And that is one reason why
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.180]   certain antidepressant medications,
[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.420]   which alter, either increase or decrease,
[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.540]   the amount of serotonin transmission in the brain,
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.820]   will often have a lot of side effects
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.700]   related to things like mood, libido,
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.780]   appetite, sleep, et cetera.
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.260]   It's because serotonin is involved
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.860]   in so many different things.
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.540]   And serotonin is involved in so many different things
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.960]   because there are a lot of different
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.660]   so-called serotonin receptors.
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.820]   Serotonin is a chemical that we call a ligand,
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.120]   and the chemical ligand is simply the thing
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.860]   that plugs into the receptor for that chemical or ligand.
[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.700]   The receptors, in this case, serotonin receptors,
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.140]   have the opportunity to do all sorts of different things.
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.060]   They can change the activity of neurons,
[00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.820]   making them more active or less active.
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.900]   They can cause growth factors to be released,
[00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.580]   making sure that those neurons reinforce
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.700]   or even build up stronger connections
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.180]   so that they're more likely to be active in the future.
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.080]   Serotonin binding to particular receptors
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.140]   can even change the gene expression in particular cells,
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.840]   making those cells proliferate, so make more of them,
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.680]   making those cells more robust,
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.260]   making those cells interact with new elements
[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.480]   of the brain and body.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.660]   Basically, serotonin and all these different receptors
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.380]   that it binds to has dozens, if not hundreds,
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.220]   and maybe even thousands of different functions.
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.140]   So the fact that psilocybin so closely resembles serotonin
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.780]   leads to a very important question
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.060]   that we should all be asking ourselves,
[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.820]   which is why is it that psilocybin,
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.640]   which looks so much like serotonin,
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.340]   when one takes it in the form of magic mushrooms
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.180]   or some other form,
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.220]   maybe the synthetic form of psilocybin itself,
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.600]   which nowadays is manufactured in laboratories
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.620]   and placed in different psilocybin-containing foods
[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.940]   and pills, et cetera,
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.940]   why that leads to complex yet fairly circumscribed
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.280]   sets of experience like visual and auditory hallucinations,
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.020]   changes in particular thought patterns,
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.580]   and neuroplasticity that, in many cases,
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.580]   in the clinical setting, provided things are done correctly,
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.980]   improvements in mood, relief from depression,
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.540]   relief from various compulsive disorders, et cetera, right?
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.000]   This is really what you need to understand
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.940]   if you want to understand psilocybin and how it works
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.140]   and how to make it work optimally
[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.380]   for a given condition or goal.
[00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.540]   You have to understand what it's actually doing
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.940]   and what allows psilocybin to do fairly specific things
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.420]   in comparison to serotonin,
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.360]   even though psilocybin and serotonin are so similar,
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.180]   is that psilocybin mainly binds to and activates
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.820]   the so-called serotonin 2A receptor.
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.060]   The serotonin 2A receptor is one of, again,
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.100]   many different serotonin receptors,
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.920]   but serotonin 2A is expressed in particular areas
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.640]   of the brain and even on particular areas of neurons
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.600]   in the brain that allow for very specific types of changes
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.600]   in neural circuitry to take place,
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.400]   not just when one is under the influence of psilocybin,
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.220]   but afterwards as well.
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.320]   So really, in order to have a useful discussion
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.800]   about psilocybin, we need to talk a lot
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.000]   about the serotonin 2A receptor,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.720]   but fortunately for you,
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.920]   unless you're somebody really interested
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.020]   in structural biology or cell biology,
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.880]   that discussion is not going to be
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.000]   about the binding pocket for serotonin
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.880]   on serotonin 2A receptor,
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.480]   or a lot of the downstream signaling
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.800]   of the serotonin 2A receptor.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.560]   We'll talk a little bit about that where it's relevant,
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.880]   but more importantly,
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.360]   at least for sake of today's discussion,
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.560]   we're going to talk about how the serotonin 2A receptor
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.880]   is really the one responsible for triggering
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.200]   all the changes in neural circuitry
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.240]   that lead to the changes, that is the improvements in mood,
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.440]   the relief from compulsive disorders in many case,
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.840]   but really it's the serotonin 2A receptor selectivity
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.620]   of psilocybin that is leading to all the excitement
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.480]   that you hear about in terms of psilocybin
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.020]   as a therapeutic tool.
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.840]   Let me say that from a slightly different angle.
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.580]   There are data that I'll talk about today,
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.260]   which show that one, although in most cases,
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.800]   two psilocybin journeys done with particular dosages
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.060]   of psilocybin lead to maximal binding or occupancy
[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.840]   of those serotonin 2A receptors in ways that lead
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.600]   to significant and unprecedented relief
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.900]   for major depression.
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.840]   In fact, you'll soon learn that the clinical trials
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.040]   for psilocybin are outperforming standard therapy
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.000]   and outperforming so-called SSRIs
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.860]   and various other antidepressants
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.980]   in terms of providing depression relief
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.000]   in ways that are frankly staggering, not just to me,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.900]   but to the psychiatric community at large.
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.880]   And this is where so much of the excitement is coming from.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.420]   Now, that statement could be taken one way,
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.320]   which is to just say, okay, well,
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.740]   here's a compound psilocybin that outperforms SSRIs
[00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.820]   and therefore all the attention should be on psilocybin.
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:48.820]   But SSRI stands for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor.
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.700]   In other words, the SSRIs of which there's now a lot
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.780]   of controversy, things like Prozac, Zoloft, et cetera.
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.240]   I'm sure you've heard some of this controversy.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.380]   There are people who are very pro-SSRIs,
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.280]   although there are a growing number of people
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.140]   who really feel that the SSRIs are probably most appropriate
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.340]   for things like obsessive compulsive disorder,
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.460]   where they in fact can be very beneficial.
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:13.340]   But there's a lot of kind of leaning back from SSRIs
[00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.620]   as the be-all end-all for the treatment
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.860]   of depression nowadays because of the side effect profiles.
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.880]   And the fact that it's not even really clear
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.420]   that serotonin deficiencies are the major cause
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.660]   of depression in the first place.
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.620]   Now, again, we're talking about psilocybin,
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.620]   not about SSRIs, but you should be thinking,
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:34.940]   wait, how is it that two molecules, psilocybin
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:39.940]   and some particular SSRI, both of which look like
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.860]   and/or increase serotonin transmission in the brain,
[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.440]   are leading to either incredibly positive
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.620]   and interesting outcomes or to kind
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.300]   of troubling side effect riddled outcomes.
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.980]   And again, it all boils back down to the selectivity
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.620]   of psilocybin to bind that serotonin to a receptor.
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.060]   And so in order to understand how psilocybin works
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.260]   and in order to understand proper dosing profiles
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.540]   and spacing of sessions, aka journeys,
[00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.060]   we really need to talk a little bit more
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.260]   about the serotonin 2A receptor, where it is in the brain,
[00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.340]   what sorts of things happen when psilocybin binds
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.520]   the serotonin 2A receptor, and how those things set
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.300]   in motion the various changes, the neuroplasticity
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.140]   that allows people to feel better in terms of their mood.
[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.700]   And as you'll soon learn, can experience more pleasure
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.040]   and joy from things like music and enhanced creativity.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.780]   All the things that I do believe,
[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.700]   whether or not people are thinking about
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.360]   or maybe even exploring psilocybin for recreational
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.380]   or therapeutic purposes, all the things that people want
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.020]   and are really talking about and perhaps even doing
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.300]   psilocybin in order to obtain.
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.880]   [upbeat music]
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.700]   (upbeat music)
