[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.160]   - Okay, Pastor John, here's a question
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.040]   from Eric in Iowa City, and I think you're gonna
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.500]   really like Eric's question.
[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.440]   He asks, quote, "I have seen the power of poetry
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.400]   "to express ideas and feelings.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.600]   "I'm convinced that writing poetry would be good
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.820]   "for my own soul, my family, and those I serve in ministry.
[00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.580]   "The problem is, I've never taken a course in school
[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.480]   "on writing poetry.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.680]   "My question is, how do you begin
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.080]   "and what books do you recommend?"
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.120]   End quote, what do you say, Pastor John?
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.400]   - Oh, I love that question.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.960]   I love the heart that wants to grow
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.960]   in the crafting of language so that it serves God
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.560]   as fully as it possibly can.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.560]   Let me start by saying, there are all levels
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.080]   and kinds of poetry, from the most refined
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.840]   and careful and thoughtful and ingenious and deep,
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.520]   and the simplest, most homey,
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.080]   takes a heap of living to make a house a home
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.640]   kind of poetry from Edgar Guest.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.600]   I grew up in a home where my dad read poetry to us,
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.760]   and it was always of the simplest kind,
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.040]   and I think that's what families need.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.720]   Families don't need really obscure poetry.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.600]   Families need birthday poems and anniversary poems
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.840]   and Christmas poems and Thanksgiving poems
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.760]   where dad or mom or children just write something sweet
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.600]   and beautiful from their hearts for God
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.440]   and shouldn't worry too much about any criticism
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.520]   that it's gonna receive because it's artistic quality.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.520]   But there is a whole history of great poetry
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.520]   that moves you along and takes you deeper
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.040]   into the way language is used.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.160]   And here's a couple of pointers.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.240]   There are two books I'd recommend.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.680]   One is Ted Koozer.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.600]   He was the Poet Laureate of America about five
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.640]   or six years ago.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.920]   Ted Koozer, K-O-O-S-E-R,
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.920]   The Poetry Home Repair Manual, a poetry handbook,
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.120]   The Poetry Home Repair Manual,
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.600]   Practical Advice for Beginning Poets,
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.520]   and then Mary Oliver, a poetry handbook.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.400]   So those are two books that are written precisely
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.080]   to answer Eric's question about how do you just get started?
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.760]   A third thing, I mean, a second thing I'd say
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.480]   besides reading those books would be take a class
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.760]   at a community college or colleges.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.720]   Take a class on poetry and surprise yourself
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.520]   by getting back into school.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.560]   I would say, here's something really practical
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.840]   everybody can do.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.080]   Memorize some psalms.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.080]   Memorize psalms.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.400]   Because when you memorize,
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.200]   you start to get a feel for language.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.480]   You can say them over and over again to yourself
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.120]   and try different ways of reciting the psalms
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.120]   so that they have the kind of symmetrical parallelism
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.640]   and ring that they ought to have.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.760]   And I would say that about other poems as well.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.600]   I remember sitting in the class in Romantic Poetry
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.600]   with Clyde Kilby, and he read a poem to us by John Keats.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.560]   And I can't remember the name of it right now,
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.480]   but he said, "I promise you, if you memorize this poem,
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.480]   "it will serve you to enlarge your soul in 50 years."
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.520]   And it was just the sheer memorizing of a beautiful poem
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.440]   that made the difference.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.640]   But here's the most important thing.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.640]   If a person wants to grow in his ability to write poetry
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.280]   that's not just rose, the red, violet, or blue,
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.920]   I try to write poetry, so do you.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.360]   If they wanna grow beyond something,
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.440]   into something richer and deeper, read poetry.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.280]   Just read it.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.600]   Get, a book would be "The Sacrifice of Praise,"
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.600]   an anthology of Christian poetry by James Trott,
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.120]   T-R-O-T-T, "The Sacrifice of Praise."
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.760]   Or on the memory thing,
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.720]   there's a book called "Committed to Memory,"
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.760]   "The 100 Best Poems to Memorize," by John Hollander.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.600]   So, but mainly, just go to Barnes & Noble,
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.640]   go to the poetry shelf, pull down some anthology,
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.840]   and start reading poetry.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.400]   'Cause what'll happen is, when you read great poetry,
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.360]   you start to catch a feel of what makes it great.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.600]   - Excellent, that's a good place to start
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.920]   for the beginning poet.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.760]   Thank you, Pastor John,
