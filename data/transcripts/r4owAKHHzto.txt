[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.480]   See what we got here.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.800]   So we have a question here from Alexis.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.680]   Sort of similar to a question we did earlier,
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.360]   so we can come at it from a different angle.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.520]   Alexis says, how would you apply the concepts of Deep
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.560]   Ork to one's kids?
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.440]   So she says, I'm a parent and have
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.840]   noticed that electronics generally reduce
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.080]   our daughter's attention span.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.040]   As such, we ban video games and social media,
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.360]   but we do let her do protective activities on electronics.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.040]   Mostly we require reading.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.760]   She gets to do TV, movies, has earned time
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.800]   for piano school, et cetera.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.360]   What would you do?
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.480]   Our daughter is 14 now.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.880]   I mean, I think that's fine.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.720]   So 14-year-olds are not going to be fantastic at focus.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.120]   It's a practiced art, and their brains are scattered.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.080]   So yes, avoid, as I talked about earlier in the show,
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.160]   avoid online video games, avoid social media for kids.
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.720]   And by kids, I mean even adolescents.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.120]   That's going to be poison.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.640]   I don't really mind TV.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.080]   I don't mind your shows you watch.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.760]   You obviously do the same advice we learned in the 1980s,
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.920]   have some control over it.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.320]   So you can't just use the TV all the time.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.880]   But I'm not one of these strict screen time zealots
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.360]   where my 14-year-old gets to watch one minute of TV.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.440]   I think some of that's more about the parents wanting
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.200]   to feel like they're optimizing parenting,
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.620]   that it is going to make some big difference for the kid.
[00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.160]   And it makes the kids kind of weird.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.740]   So I don't worry about that too much.
[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.160]   And then separately, you need to sort of introduce the notion
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.840]   that concentration on hard things
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.520]   is an important, respectable, really useful skill.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.000]   You can talk about this.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.200]   There's examples of this.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.120]   We're watching the Olympics.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.320]   We're looking at this artist.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.360]   We went to this movie.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.160]   This type of stuff that's really inspiring.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.780]   How do you do that?
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.160]   You focus really hard on things.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.000]   You're willing to do it even when it's hard.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.760]   You push yourself.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.240]   There's grace in that.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.160]   There's something really deeply human in that.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.920]   You demonstrate it.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.420]   If you're walking around your house
[00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.120]   as a parent with your phone, looking on your phone
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.360]   all the time, doing all these text message threads,
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.660]   it doesn't matter what you say.
[00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.240]   They see it.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.800]   Like, no, no, this is what life should be.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.960]   So keep the phone in the foyer.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.960]   Don't carry it with you throughout their house.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.880]   Let them see in your life, hey, I prioritize other things.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.600]   I'm not constantly distracted.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.760]   And then you can literally just give them structure
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.400]   so they can practice it.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.940]   All right, so you have some homework.
[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.880]   Let's think through how we want to do this.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.320]   Let's schedule it on the calendar.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.080]   We have set times we do it.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.680]   Let's push ourselves, take a break.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.120]   How do you organize your thoughts?
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.640]   You can literally work with and practice and help kids
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.120]   get more comfortable with this.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.840]   I talked with my nine-year-old about this with math.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.720]   Really walking him through, what are you
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.240]   doing in your head when you're trying to solve a hard math
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.840]   problem?
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.560]   Because we don't tell kids this, and they don't know.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.040]   Like, I don't know.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.600]   I just kind of hope it comes to me or something.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.400]   Really walking him through.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.960]   Like, your paper is an extension of your working memory,
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.000]   and it's a strategy.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.520]   And then you're recording your work.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.060]   And then this is when you concentrate,
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.160]   is at very set leaps.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.320]   Like, it's not just random.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.940]   It's not just you thinking and hoping something comes from it.
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:00.920]   So then you can practice.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.080]   Practice structured thinking.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.040]   So do those three things.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.960]   Get rid of the poison, which is the online video
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.800]   games and the social media.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.840]   Demonstrate that you prioritize depth.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.480]   Talk about depth and concentration
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.240]   and how it's the key to a life well-lived.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.640]   And then actually literally help them practice.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.240]   And then don't expect your 14-year-old
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.560]   to be Richard Feynman.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.440]   It's a 14-year-old brain, not a 34-year-old brain,
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.040]   not a 44-year-old brain that's been doing this for a long time.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.280]   So then have some flexibility on your expectations there.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.440]   Kids are kids.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.280]   They don't need to be--
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.480]   you don't necessarily want them to be super locked in.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.320]   That's actually something I talk about a lot.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.240]   I think-- and we've talked about this on the show before.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.320]   You know, careful what you wish for.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.760]   You get this around here in these competitive areas,
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.800]   like the Washington, DC area, this sort of underlying dream
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.000]   of like, man, I kind of wish my kid was a prodigy,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.400]   like just awesome at math or something.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.120]   And just, you know--
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.600]   because you get as a parent these victory points,
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.080]   these victories of like, they're the best,
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.160]   and they're moving up, and you somehow
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.760]   vicariously take these victories.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.440]   And all I'm saying is be careful what you wish for.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.560]   Rarely the foundation of a good, meaningful, deep life
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.680]   if you're too good at something like that early on.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.760]   Be that physical or intellectual.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.400]   Careful what you wish for.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.120]   Find things you can do in your own life
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.520]   to feel good about yourself, not what did my kid do?
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.960]   Because you didn't do that anyway,
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.960]   so you shouldn't feel good about that anyways.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
