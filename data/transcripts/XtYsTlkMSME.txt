[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.120]   Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue. One of the cool parts about our job as trusted sources
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.520]   of financial advice is people email us all the time. They give us not to brags about
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.520]   their financial situation, they have questions, they have problems that come up. They email
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.920]   us at AskTheCompoundShow@gmail.com. Duncan, what's going on today?
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.560]   Well, I just wanted to start out today kind of saying that I'm sorry, I guess maybe I
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.680]   jinxed myself, all the bragging I've done in recent months about my beautiful checking
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.760]   account that paid 4.27% interest. I got an email yesterday, they're shutting down because
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.520]   of all the banking turmoil. So, yeah, pour one out for Enzo Bank.
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.020]   So you're creating your own bank run here?
[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.120]   No, no, no. I mean, they're closing down. They said they're closing down. So yeah, it's
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.600]   just I felt like I needed to let people know because I kind of bragged a little bit about
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.160]   it. Like, oh, yeah, why would you have T-bills if you have a checking account that pays you
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.160]   4.27%?
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.040]   Well, I blame Jerome Powell for your banking account shutting down. So where are you gonna
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.280]   move it now? Just a regular old bank?
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.520]   So they're recommending a place, I'm not gonna save a name, but it reminds me of the villain
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.320]   from from Toy Story. The name, it sounds very not legit, but but they pay 5% interest for
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.060]   the first three months, and then they're offering the 4.27 that Enzo offered. So I'm gonna do
[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.520]   it probably. But um, yeah, they don't sound super legit.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.160]   14% chance you lose all your money, just putting it out there. Okay, let's do a question.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.880]   Okay, up first, say we have a question from Michael. My friend recently sent me an article
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.560]   saying that young people shouldn't save money. The argument is based on the life cycle model.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.960]   He argues that in order to maximize happiness out of your income every year, and to avoid
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.360]   changes in standard of living throughout life, high income earners should not save at a young
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.680]   age. And instead, it should be made up in the middle ages. Some context not to brag,
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.080]   I count my blessings for the position I'm in. I'm 24 single and making $252,000 a year.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.200]   I've been stocking away. Yeah, not, not bad. I've been stocking away all my money in S&P
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.680]   index funds with some money saved on the side for potential real estate investments. Should
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.600]   I start saving less and enjoy the money in my youth more? I would love to buy a Porsche.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.960]   But it seems irresponsible given the power of compound interest. Notice I said Porsche.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.000]   That's the right way to say it, even though I feel awful every time I say it.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.840]   Yeah, I refuse. I say Porsche. This is just a question that's tailor made for me. I just
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.360]   I there's like five different layers going on here. We got like retirement savings, behavioral
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.200]   finance, spending money, striking the right balance between like enjoyment now and comfort
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.080]   in the future. Luxury vehicles. I love this question. Great one, Michael. A lot of people
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.200]   actually sent me the paper he's referencing when it came out. I read it. I don't agree
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.520]   with all the conclusions, but I do kind of appreciate the spicy take the authors take
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.960]   here. Like it's a pretty spicy take. Retirement research papers are generally boring. I'm
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.360]   a person who enjoys this stuff and I find most of them boring. So here's the main crux
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.280]   of the argument. This is from the conclusion of the of the article, because a lot of times
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.760]   you have to like buy these from some financial journal and they just give you the conclusion
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.360]   of the intro. And that's usually enough. So we argue that under realistic assumptions,
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.960]   the life cycle model implies that most young people should not save for retirement. That's
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.280]   the general conclusion. High income workers tend to experience wage growth over their
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.320]   careers for these workers, maintaining a steady standard of living as possible, therefore
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.480]   requires spending all income, all young and only starting to save for retirement during
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.840]   middle age. So I kind of, there are some aspects I kind of agree with here. In theory, in theory,
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.880]   it does make sense that your income should rise over time. Therefore, enjoy your youth,
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.020]   put off saving for another day. That's great. And there probably are a handful of people
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.120]   who are disciplined enough to plan ahead and say, listen, I'm going to make more money
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.520]   in the future. I'll start saving then, you know, I'm going to enjoy myself from my early
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.440]   twenties to my early thirties. And then when I make more money and I'm further on in my
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.440]   career, then I'll start saving. Here's the problem with this idea. It sounds great in
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.160]   a spreadsheet, you know, in a textbook, as your income grows, you begin to spend more
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.640]   money and you get used to a new lifestyle, right? You gain responsibilities as you age.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.780]   Maybe you get used to some of the finer things in life. And I have a hard time believing
[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.880]   that after 10 to 15 years of that, people can all of a sudden flip a switch and just
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.840]   go, okay, now I'm going to save because psychologically those new savings are going to feel like a
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.920]   loss, not a gain at that point. All the behavioral research from Kahneman and all these people
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.960]   says that losses sting twice as bad as gains make us feel good. So even though you'd technically
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.200]   be saving money and putting it aside, taking it out of your income at that point is going
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.480]   to feel like a loss. So it's going to be hard to do. So I think this idea is probably a
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.840]   pipe dream. Uh, now I understand it's not easy to save as a young person, especially
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.120]   when you want to enjoy yourself. I went through this. My first job out of college did not
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.800]   pay very well at all. I still wanted to have some fun and didn't have a ton of discretionary
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.280]   income. So I started small and I, it was like $50 a month into a target date retirement
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.560]   fund. Of course, very prudent. Uh, and I made more money. You said, you said your first
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.200]   investment ever was a CD on animals this week, which just killed me. And number two was a
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.280]   target date fund in my IRA. Sorry, not all of us can be exciting and invest in options
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:19.360]   in YOLO. I've never made a YOLO trade in my life. So $50 a month didn't give me a ton
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.760]   of capital in my account, even after a couple of years. But as I made more money, I would
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.040]   save half my raise and spend the other half so I could give myself a little bit of a bump
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.320]   in standard of living. But the idea was to build up saving habits. And I think those
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.040]   early savings habits can compound just as much as the compound interest. So I think
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.160]   getting into those habits, if you can, that, that, that's very helpful. The thing is for
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.280]   this person, they make a quarter of a million dollars in their twenties. I don't care where
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.760]   you live. That's a lot of money for someone who's 24. So it's not going to be that hard
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.520]   to find spare change. So here's what I'm going to do for this person. I would say, pick a
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.180]   reasonable savings rate. Now I always say I want double digits. So 10 to 20% is fine
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.640]   for this person. If you want to go splurge for the rest, my answer is unequivocally.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.680]   Yes, splurge. You don't know what your future earnings powers are going to be, but if you're
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.180]   making that much money at age 24, you're in a pretty good place. You obviously don't want
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.240]   to go overboard. So I think just make sure you're still saving. Then, you know, for a
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.360]   single person who's young and no responsibilities, you should have plenty of discretionary income,
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:22.160]   even if you save 30% of your income or something. However, I'm not a fan of spending a ton of
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:28.160]   money on a car. So I would, I would, I recommend this person to do is read happy money by Elizabeth
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.000]   Dunn and Michael Norton. Put it up there. Yeah. One of my favorite books, it's all about
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.380]   the science of spending and what actually makes us happy when it comes to expenditure.
[00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.000]   So the book lays out five ways that research has shown that spending money can actually
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.820]   make you happier and not simply give you that short-term dopamine hit. So the five things
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:46.120]   are by experiences, not stuff, right? Make it a treat, which is just don't overindulge,
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.560]   right? It's, it's better when you space things out and don't do them all the time. They say
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.240]   by time, which is basically paying up for convenience. The fourth one is pay now and
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.760]   consume later, which is basically avoiding credit card debt. And the fifth one is invest
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.760]   in others. So charity, picking up tabs for friends, helping others. I think the big one
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.140]   here for some of their twenties is to buy experiences. So their research shows that
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.120]   experiences provide way more happiness than material goods in part, because experiences
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.960]   are more likely to make us feel connected to others. And they have these long lasting
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.120]   memories that also compound over time. So I would say before you buy that Porsche, not
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:23.320]   Porsche Duncan, you know, spend some of that discretionary income on going out more, traveling,
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.160]   go out to eat, do stuff with your friends on nights and weekends, like do stuff, don't
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:32.360]   buy stuff. And you know, when we were young, my wife and I made a concerted effort before
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.120]   having kids to travel as much as we could, because we knew once the kids came around,
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.120]   it would be a lot much harder to do. And it's, it's true. It's money well spent. I'm glad
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.200]   we did it. So I think you get way more bang for your buck by spending on travel and experiences
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:48.240]   than a car. Wait until you go through a midlife crisis, then buy the Porsche. Don't do it
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:53.160]   in your 20s. That that new car smell is going to wear off very quickly when you get stuck
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.080]   in a traffic jam, and you realize it's just another car. So I think the memories you make
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.080]   from going on a bunch of trips in your 20s, traveling, doing stuff with your friends.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.840]   That's the kind of stuff that lasts a lifetime, the the new car smell fades away quicker than
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:10.160]   that. Yeah, and if you are I love cars. I mean, if you are gonna buy a car, get get
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:15.280]   like a Ford GT, or you know, a 1967 GT 40. If you really want to go out, you know, like
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.240]   get something, you can't just get a Porsche. I'm sorry, you know, like Porsches are cool,
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:26.160]   but like, I'd rather get something. Well, yes, at 24, making a huge income. Again, if
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.760]   you you say you can save a decent amount of your money, max out your 401k. And then with
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.880]   the rest of it, sure splurge and have a little bit of fun. This is the you're gonna look
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.760]   back at this time in your life before you have a lot of responsibilities, maybe settle
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:41.280]   down with a family, get married or whatever, own a home, you know, pay for all this boring
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.840]   stuff. Yeah, sure. Have a little fun in your 20s. And if you're still, you know, stocking
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:49.520]   some money away, you're gonna be fine food for thought. What if what if they turn having
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.640]   a fancy sports car into a side hustle and they make money racing it? Maybe they could
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:59.880]   blow it up and turn it into NFT. You never know. Right? Okay. Great question, though.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.080]   If you want to splurge on a car, don't let me hold you back. But I would think twice
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:07.400]   about about doing that. I don't think you're going to look back at buying a Porsche at
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.800]   24 and think that was a good idea. Just what do you think? What do you think they do? That's
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.840]   a pretty, pretty nice salary for a 24 year old. That's got to be software engineer or
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:19.680]   something, right? I'm guessing that's that'd be my guess. They're working for Google or
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.640]   Amazon or some something like that. Right. All right. Let's do another one. Okay. Up
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.280]   next, we have a question from Ed. When was the last time in history people rushed to
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.200]   buy government bonds? What are the chances of this leading to the Fed having to lower
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:36.400]   interest rates and inflation going even higher? All right. So this is this is the fact that
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.520]   the last two weeks we had a little bit of a banking crisis. Interest rates dropped
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.840]   like a rock in some cases. This question is actually relatively easy to answer because
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:48.360]   2022 was the outlier in terms of people not rushing to buy government bonds during a down
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.320]   stock market. I've used this one before, but it's worth revisiting. John, do a chart on.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:58.240]   This is every year where we've had a down year in the S&P 500 since 1928 with a corresponding
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:03.280]   10 year treasury returns in those years. Look at 2008. 10 year treasuries were up 20 percent
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:08.680]   when the stock market got crushed. 2000, 2001, 2002, that was a three year bear market. Every
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:13.080]   single one of those years, treasuries did great. People rushed into that flight to safety
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:18.200]   to buy bonds. 2022, again, is the outlier where you saw bonds actually cause the stock
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:24.440]   market pain. So most of the time when the excrement hits the fan, people rush into the
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.880]   safety of government bonds. And that's kind of what happened in the last couple of weeks
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.940]   with the banking crisis. So it's nothing new to see nervous investors leap into the open
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:35.320]   arms of U.S. government bonds during a crisis. It's just that, yeah, last year was kind of
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:39.520]   an outlier. So the question here is, will the drop in rates from this bank crisis actually
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:44.640]   lead to higher inflation? So the idea here is that for bonds, that the relationship is
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.840]   easy. When bond prices, as rates rise, prices fall. And as rates fall, prices rise. That's
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.320]   the inverse relationship between bonds and prices. But the relationship between rates
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:58.280]   and inflation is not quite so easy. For instance, interest rates went to zero during the 2008
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:02.320]   financial crisis and stayed there for almost a decade. They remained low until basically
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:09.000]   inflation really had these last couple of years. From 2009 to 2019, the 10-year yield
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.600]   averaged 2.5%. John, do a chart on here. The 10-year average 2.5%. Inflation over that
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:20.480]   time was 1.6% per year on average. We had low rates for well over a decade. That didn't
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.920]   cause inflation. So I think a lot of what we're thinking through here is, well, if rates
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.120]   fall, that must mean inflation has to go up. And that's not necessarily how this works.
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.440]   A lot of it depends on why rates are falling. Now, it seems like right now, sometimes you
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.080]   don't really know. It could just be that the bond market is confused. But there's two reasons
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.480]   rates are falling now. One is this banking crisis, right? Because people are worried.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.200]   And the second one is the bond market seems to think that means the Fed is going to have
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:48.480]   to cut interest rates or stop raising them because of this banking crisis. The Fed obviously
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.800]   is not. Yesterday, they still raised rates. The bond market says, "I don't believe you."
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.400]   That's the roundberry. "I don't believe you," right? So I think if the banking crisis leads
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.800]   to slower loan growth and thus slower economic growth, it would make sense for rates to fall.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.600]   But in that case, if economic growth is going to be slower, guess what? Inflation is going
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:09.400]   to come down too. So there is no easy relationship. In the textbooks, this is what I learned in
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:15.200]   economics class, right? If rates fall, inflation should go up. The last 10 or 15 years really
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:20.240]   disproved that. So it's really going to matter why are rates falling. That's going to be
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.120]   the big thing. So maybe the past couple of weeks could change people's spending habits
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:28.560]   and alter the economy. It's a good possibility. I think it's also a confusing time. So I
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.480]   don't think I'd put too much into two weeks worth of bond market moves. Rates could easily
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.200]   go back up. They could go down further. Who knows? But it's important to remember that
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:40.520]   rates falling in and of themselves don't automatically cause inflation. There's a lot more that goes
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:45.000]   into inflation than that. If it was that easy, the Fed would have snuffed inflation out a
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.280]   long time ago. Because as we've seen, just because the Fed is raising rates doesn't mean
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.120]   inflation falls right away either. It's not that easy.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:13:00.920]   Yeah, it looks like I'm doing a poll in the chat. 55% of people are more worried about
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:06.480]   inflation than the other option was banking crisis or not worried. People are still kind
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.040]   of worried about high inflation.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:14.040]   Who knows? Consumers could say, "I don't care that this bank in Silicon Valley failed. I'm
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:19.760]   still going to keep spending money." So we could certainly see that. It's like the bond
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.280]   market versus people in our chat right now. They don't believe it. The bond market seems
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.200]   to think inflation is over based on where rates are headed. We shall see.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.120]   We'll find out.
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.000]   Let's do another one.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.080]   Up next we have a question from Bill. Ben wrote a blog post last week about how so many
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:40.520]   rich clients at SVB, Silicon Valley Bank, neglected to manage their cash properly. I
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:44.000]   have to admit, I've never really given much thought to cash management before the past
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.760]   year or so now that we finally have yields greater than 0%. Here's a cash management
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:53.680]   and tax question wrapped in one. What is the most tax efficient vehicle to part my cash
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:59.720]   in? T-bills, money markets, CDs, munis, that's municipal bonds for those new here, online
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.360]   savings accounts, or anything else I'm missing?
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:08.080]   This is a question from Bill. We only get our answers on tax questions from another
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.840]   Bill. Let's bring in tax expert extraordinaire Bill Sweet.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:17.920]   Gentlemen, coming to you live from Pine Island, New York. I'm on location today.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:22.000]   I noticed. Where's Pine Island, New York? Tell us what's going on here, Bill.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.800]   It's out in the black dirt region in the sticks, but this is where I come from. New York is
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:31.960]   not just about skyscrapers and cities. It's a big place. I'm happy to be here and supporting
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:32.960]   the local business.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.780]   Did your car break down? Why are you outside?
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:41.640]   It did. My turbocharger blew up last week coming back from Chicago. I apologize to the
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.000]   listeners about the wind, but the show must go on, gentlemen. Let's do this.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.600]   All right. Personal finance crisis for Bill. He had a run on his car.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:55.160]   Great name, first off. Ultimately, Ben, I love this question because Bill wraps a lot
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:59.640]   of things in here. Ultimately, we don't eat our after-tax returns. You know this, Ben.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:05.000]   You know this, Duncan. Ordinary income rates are pretty high, too. As high as 37% plus
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   a 4% net investment income tax, and up to 12% for the People's Republic of California
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.680]   if you happen to live out in the West Coast. Brother Bill, do the math. It could be as
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:18.400]   high as a 50% tax rate, meaning that you have to be very careful not to give up half of
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.800]   your interest to taxes.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:25.800]   John, can we chart this on right now? I want to talk about the different flavors of interest
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.960]   income that Bill brings up. Let's start all the way on the left. Let's talk about online
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:35.000]   savings account. Duncan, what was the company that you were in? You were FDIC Insured Savings,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   right?
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   Bernie Madoff Securities.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   They were called INSA.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.520]   Yeah. Ultimately, there are a lot of banks. If they're FDIC Insured, it may be something
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:47.080]   to consider, but they're offering you a pretty high yield. Ultimately, you have to pay tax
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:51.280]   on that. You have to pay federal income tax and state income tax. All the way on the left,
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:56.520]   on the blue, I'm talking about a 4% pre-tax return that gets cut down to about a 2.53%
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:02.240]   after-tax return. That's on your typical, standard, ordinary income interest rate. That's
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:06.400]   option A. It's great news because it's always liquid, but at least tax efficient.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.160]   Bill, can I just stop you for a second?
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.520]   Yes, please. Please do.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.920]   This is the nicest-looking chart we've ever had on Portfolio Rescue. Usually, you have
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:13.920]   these napkin things.
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.040]   Wow. I know. I thought it was going to be a napkin, but I guess it'd be blowing in the
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.040]   wind too much.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.240]   Do you have an intern we don't know about that you're having create things for you now?
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.680]   No. I had a lot of time because I was stuck without a car here all morning.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.640]   Also, it looks like you're getting some of that black dirt in your eyes from the wind.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:27.640]   Are you going to make it?
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.920]   Yeah. I don't know. The storm is coming, so I think we've got to get moving. John, let's
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.960]   bring that chart. Let's focus on the red now. Let's say that you move out to the tax-efficient
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:41.240]   scale. You move to a one-month U.S. Treasury. If you buy a 30-day bond that's U.S. Treasury
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:45.120]   backed, that's not state income taxable, so you get a bit of a tax-efficient boost there
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:51.320]   in that you're not going to remit any taxes to the state's tax agencies. That cuts your
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.240]   4% pre-tax return to about 3%.
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.760]   Then, let's move on to the most tax-efficient vehicle, which is municipal bond interest.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:03.360]   Ultimately, if you're owning a municipal bond in the same state, your pre-tax return is
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.900]   exactly equal to your post-tax return because you're not remitting anything to taxes. Ultimately,
[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:12.000]   take a look at the yields. I think that's really important to focus on, is that the
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.520]   most tax-efficient vehicle, depending on your tax rate, may not give you the best return.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.160]   Ultimately, again, you need to do this math. The second thing, Ben, I want to bring up
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.840]   is liquidity. If you lock your money up in a 30-day U.S. Treasury bond, you don't get
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:29.040]   that money back for 30 days unless it's a marketable security, whereas in an FDIC-insured
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.480]   account, that's pretty liquid. You can trade at any time.
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.000]   I was thinking about this. The different variables you consider for cash management are liquidity,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.800]   ease of access, yield, safety, all that stuff. I think taxes probably do rank pretty low
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:46.120]   in the hierarchy from my perspective. If you want that money to be there, I think you want
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.760]   to make sure you have access to it if you know you're going to be spending it at a certain
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.760]   point.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:55.160]   I would agree 6,000%. One of the things, Ben, that we've observed in our practice is rich
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:59.400]   people hate paying taxes more than they like making money. That's a real thing, but you
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:04.160]   do not want to become blinded. Don't let the tax dog wag the tail or whichever direction
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.000]   we're going in here. I agree with you 100%.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Close enough. All right, Duncan, let's do another one.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.640]   Good advice. Up next, we have a question from Ethan. "I recently heard about Secure Act
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:20.840]   2.0 that allows 529 plans to be converted to Roth IRAs. Not to brag, but I expect our
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:25.960]   daughter's 529 account will be worth about $70,000 when she graduates high school. Not
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:31.400]   Michael Batnick-level 529 money, but respectable. We didn't open an account when my son was
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:36.960]   born in 2020, assuming that we would transfer whatever remained into our son's name from
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:41.280]   our daughter's account. This new law has me thinking about ways to take advantage of opening
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:46.020]   Roth accounts without the headache of finding ways for them to have taxable income. If we
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:50.280]   have enough to cover two conversions, one for each child, can we do it out of the same
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:55.840]   529 account, or do we need to open up a separate 529 for our son?"
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.280]   My favorite comment of the day so far from the people in the chat here, someone said
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.440]   that Bill's on the next season of Last of Us.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:04.120]   I'm out here surviving, guys.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:09.400]   All right, Bill, we've gotten a handful of questions on this from people who pay attention
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.920]   to this kind of thing. So obviously, this is on people's top of mind. I didn't really
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:19.160]   know about this until you brought it up. So my first question is, why don't we just allow
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:23.880]   parents to open a Roth in their child's name? Maybe they don't want that tax handoff to
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:29.040]   richer people, I guess. But what's going on here? Does this make sense to you in terms
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.400]   of the strategy they're taking?
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.840]   Yeah, the first suspicious thing, the last questioner's name was Bill. My oldest brother's
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:39.440]   name is Ethan, so this is getting real familiar here. But no, Ben, you're right. I mean, the
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.800]   answer to why you can't just contribute directly to a Roth IRA is you have to have earned income.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:47.240]   And that's exactly what Ethan is getting at here, is that he's thinking long-term. So
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:52.480]   I give him a lot of credit there. He has one 529 account open, and he's saying, "Hey, I
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.680]   really want to take advantage of this provision. Let's talk about it really quick." The idea
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:01.280]   is if you have money left over in a 529, Ben, I don't have a lot of clients that spend too
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.560]   little on college. Ultimately, college is a very expensive enterprise.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.940]   Yeah, it is funny when people worry about that, that it's pretty rare for that to happen.
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:13.440]   That is a very good problem to have. But I think if you think long-term about this, ultimately,
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:18.080]   it could happen. And I think what Ethan's going is, "Do I want to purposely do this,
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:23.000]   overfund a 529?" That ability to transfer, basically, rollover from a 529 to a child's
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.400]   Roth is super cool. And Ethan gets to the key point, Ben, you brought it up a second
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:31.040]   ago. It avoids the earned income limit, right? And so then he could potentially transfer
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.080]   money from a 529 to a Roth for a teenager, right, that may not be working. Somebody in
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:39.440]   college probably should be focusing on college and not working. And it's a great avenue to
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:44.120]   basically do an effective backdoor Roth. The problem is, that Ethan's getting at, is there
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:49.200]   a couple of contingencies here. Number one, the 529 account needs to be open for 15 years
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:53.040]   for this to happen, right? So if you're opening a 529 account now, yeah, you're looking at
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:58.400]   2037, 2038 being the earliest time that you can conduct this rollover. The second provision,
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:02.520]   Ethan mentioned this is original question, contributions that you roll over need to be
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:06.560]   more than five years old. So ultimately, again, you can't do this instantaneously. You can't
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:10.440]   just open up a 529 and then roll it directly to a Roth. That's not the way it works. And
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.920]   so Ethan's thinking long-term. I think this is great to answer your question directly,
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:18.720]   Ethan, get that 529 open for your son, because that will start that 15 year clock. But I
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:23.440]   give you a lot of credit because thinking on 15 to 20 year timelines, that results in
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.460]   success in investing. And so ultimately, I think this is a great option for an investor.
[00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.920]   We never really know the motivations of politicians, but why do you think they put this in the
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.560]   Secure 2.0 Act in the first place? Who is this helping?
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:38.200]   It's a great question. I think bluntly, it's helping people like you, me and our clients,
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.640]   right, that are thinking on these timelines. But it is a very common question to say, hey,
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.000]   I've been successful, or let's say my child gets a Rhodes Scholarship, or let's say they
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.920]   go to a service academy at USMA or the Naval Academy. These are great things. And if I've
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:54.440]   done everything responsibly, why am I paying a 10% penalty, right? I'm a saver. I'm an
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:58.200]   investor. Why am I paying this penalty? How can I effectively move this forward? I think
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:01.840]   it's a neat provision to have. And the guidelines, furthermore, that they put on this, I think
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.200]   will prevent folks from using this, let's say, to their advantage. Because again, 15
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.560]   years is a long time to plan for. So I think generally it's a good thing then.
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:13.400]   All right. I think we have another question on Roth IRAs, because we have to hit our quota
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.560]   here. That's what I'm here for.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:21.080]   We can never have too many. OK, next we have a question from Jordan. Is there any downside
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:25.880]   to doing a backdoor Roth IRA conversion if you end up under the Roth IRA limit? This
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:31.440]   is the first year I think my wife and I might wind up above the MAGI limit. I'm pronouncing
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:35.400]   it MAGI. I don't know how you say it, but-- Is that like a king, Duncan? What--
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:39.360]   It sounds like a gift to the MAGI, right? Yeah, the gift, yeah.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:44.120]   But with variable comp and deductions, I'm not positive. I'd like to contribute now,
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.520]   so that the money is invested in the market. Is there any reason I shouldn't do my 2023
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:54.680]   Roth IRA contributions via backdoor Roth IRA conversion now, so I'm OK if we end up over
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:23:00.720]   the Roth limit? I don't have any traditional IRA balances, but my wife does. Does her traditional
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:06.480]   IRA impact the pro rata rule for me to do a backdoor Roth conversion? I said this off
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:11.880]   show. These kinds of questions sometimes become word soup to me, and I know that a lot of
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:12.880]   our younger-- That's a lot.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.200]   --and people that are new to investing, I know that they don't get this. Can you also
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.760]   just sum up at the end of this what the main idea is here? What the point of all this is,
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.320]   what they're trying to do? Yeah, before we get into this, Bill, here's
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:26.120]   my-- if I became tax czar one day, or if you did and you're asking me for some advice,
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.680]   we get these questions all the time about people who are close to the limit. Why don't
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:33.440]   we give people a one-year mulligan? One year, you get close, maybe your income goes over
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:38.040]   because you have variable income. Oh, whoops, you were over the limit, but you contributed
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:43.120]   to Roth, one-year mulligan. Yeah, I like this idea. Unfortunately, Ben,
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.880]   you and me are not writing the tax code. They haven't let us do this from Grand Rapids or
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:52.080]   Pine Island or where Duncan is right now. Duncan, let's talk about what you're talking
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:57.280]   about. In order to directly contribute to a Roth IRA, your income cannot exceed $214,000
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:02.200]   joint, right? So these are relatively wealthy people problems. Let's go back to question
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:07.040]   one, or let's start making $200,000 at age 23. That's what this is for. And the idea
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:11.400]   is, hey, you're making too much money, right? We want to take some of the tax benefits away,
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:15.640]   and ultimately, let's reallocate those tax benefits to folks at lower incomes. However,
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:20.720]   due to a quirk in the tax code, you're allowed to circumvent this by a backdoor Roth contribution.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:24.520]   And the idea is there's no income limit to contribute to a traditional IRA, and there's
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:29.240]   no income limit to convert from traditional to Roth IRA. There is a massive catch, but
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.880]   to answer the listener's question directly, if you think you're going to be in that income
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.960]   limit, and Duncan, I think the problem here that the questioner is going through is they
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:39.440]   don't know exactly where last year's income is, right? Maybe they have some expenses that
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:42.640]   they need to deduct. Maybe they haven't sat down to give their shoebox to their accountant
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:46.240]   yet. We don't know what the situation is, but ultimately, they're not sure. And if you're
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:50.800]   not sure, the idea is just do the traditional contribution, and you can backdate that up
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:55.160]   to April 15th into last year. That's the concept. It kind of sounded like an anvil was falling
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:59.400]   from the sky on you. I don't know if you heard that. That was kind of a porky pig, bug's
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:03.960]   bunny. That was the fungus coming to get me. Hey, Bill, we better put an end to this show
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.040]   because I'm pretty sure I see your car up on cement blocks back there. They stole all
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:11.440]   your wheels. That's not me. That's a much nicer ride than I can afford. But ultimately,
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.080]   the idea is backdoor Roth contributions are great, but the big catch that the listener
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:20.940]   gets at is if you do an IRA conversion, you have assets that are in a tax-deferred IRA,
[00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:24.660]   you have to convert as if that's the entire balance. And so ultimately, the problem is
[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:29.320]   you could be paying income tax on the conversion unless you're careful. But to answer the other
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.620]   question, your wife's IRA is not your IRA. So that does not count for the purposes of
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:37.120]   a Roth conversion. You're good to go there. How about one more thing, as Ben being the
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.620]   tax czar, why do we make people go through the process of the backdoor Roth IRA? Is it
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:43.740]   because they don't want people to do it because they make it hard? Can't we just make it easier
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:47.820]   for people? Do we have to go through this whole ordeal? Isn't that kind of ridiculous?
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:52.100]   You're preaching to the choir, Ben. Ultimately, I agree with you. Either have it or take it
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:58.220]   away or don't. Why have all these complicated rules? But nothing in the tax code is direct.
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:02.260]   And ultimately, this is one of many, many very quirks. And I give anybody credit for
[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.900]   looking at ways, how can I save on taxes? This is one of them.
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.180]   Right. Well, job security for you.
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:09.180]   Indeed.
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.220]   Someone has to pay for your car repairs.
[00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:15.100]   Yeah, this ain't cheap. The only thing more expensive than getting your car repaired these
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:18.700]   days is going out to buy a new car. I can't believe it. We haven't got more, you know,
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:20.220]   used auto car prices yet.
[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:23.660]   When they fix this policy, will they call it a front door Roth?
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:28.140]   I'll take it. Turbocharged Roth. That's what I'm after here today.
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:33.100]   All right. Thank you to Bill for calling in from his nearest federal location today on
