[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   What I care about is, do I have the opportunities where I am?
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.480]   Do I have the opportunities right now to make my life something I really like that's really
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.480]   meaningful?
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.000]   And for me, the person speaking in the voice of the person that book, that's probably staying
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.380]   in the Pacific Northwest and finding the right skill set that allows you to not be stressed
[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.280]   about money and to have this flexibility.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.480]   I really think it's the way to go.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.420]   Career serves your life because ultimately your daily experience of your life is what
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.680]   dictates how you feel.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.140]   Life justice or career planning is the natural consequence of that truism.
[00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:39.040]   I'm Cal Newport and this is Deep Questions, episode 210.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.520]   I'm here in my deep work HQ.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.720]   No Jesse today.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.200]   Jesse is on vacation to Scotland.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.420]   I'm jealous of Jesse.
[00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.920]   I have always thought that in another life, Scotland is probably where I belong.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.920]   I mean, think about it.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:04.560]   I'm a pale skinned, don't like being hot intellectual who likes dramatic, quiet, natural
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.640]   landscapes as an inducement to think.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.840]   So imagine an alternative universe in which I live in Edinburgh near the city, little
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.760]   townhouse, the garden out back that I tend to where I can go on my morning walk and see
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.320]   the Edinburgh castle.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:27.540]   But then I also have the small house on some aisle off of the Scottish coast where I go
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.960]   to think and write and walk in the drizzle with my barber jacket as I think deep thoughts.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.640]   I mean, I think this is probably what I'm wired to be doing.
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.240]   So not living in Washington DC in August.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.560]   So Jesse, I'm jealous.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.600]   Look forward though to having you back.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.760]   All right.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.400]   Two quick announcements.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.920]   Announcement number one, last week we released a survey to get your feedback on this show.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.500]   Jesse and I are doing an overhaul of the show this fall to make it even better.
[00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.440]   So we want your feedback.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.040]   Thank you everyone who submitted their thoughts.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.920]   If you haven't already, there will be a link to this survey in this week's episode notes
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.920]   as well.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:14.520]   Announcement number two, I have been told I should do a better job of connecting this
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.920]   somewhat informal deep life media network that I have created.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.640]   We have podcasts and audio, we have video, we have articles and newsletters, and we should
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.700]   probably try to connect it better.
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.800]   So here's my attempt to do a little bit of that.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.480]   If you're a listener of this podcast and you do not subscribe to my newsletter, you should.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.640]   You can do that at calnewport.com.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.360]   Once a week, I write an essay on the types of topics covered here in the show, the theory
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.200]   and practice of living and working deeply.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.960]   Over 70,000 people subscribe, so you can join this crowd.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.440]   I also have plans to improve this newsletter somewhat soon to have a specific day in which
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.960]   my weekly essay returns.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:05.040]   When it falls on, I might add a second message, second email each week so I can have an outlet
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.280]   for all these interesting links and ideas and articles I come across.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.960]   So maybe drop some weekend reading in your inbox as well.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.560]   So it's a good time to sign up for the newsletter.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.400]   Do that at calnewport.com.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.720]   All right, so let me give you the summary of the show ahead of us today.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.680]   There are three segments, three segments in today's episode.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.640]   Segment number one will be a deep dive because Jesse is not here to constrain me.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.280]   I have a relatively geeky deep dive.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.040]   This is me putting on, I guess I would say, the different hats I wear, more my New Yorker
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.940]   hat and I go deep into a theoretical framework for understanding the media economy of the
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.560]   internet.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.160]   Once you understand this framework, it really will help you make sense of the history of
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.280]   the internet, where we're going, why things we're trying right now won't work, what things
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.280]   might work.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.080]   So it's a framework I'm testing out.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.360]   So beware, we have some geekiness ahead of us.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:14.560]   Segment two will be focused on working deeply in an increasingly distracted world of work.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.640]   A good collection of pragmatic questions, real readers, real listeners with real issues
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.000]   trying to be deep in a shallow world.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.140]   We will end that segment two with a new feature, a reader case study.
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:34.600]   So I have a brief case study to read of someone reporting back on successfully deploying one
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.660]   of the ideas we talked about on the show in her own working life.
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.940]   This is something I want to do more of.
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.660]   Jesse is working on the technology infrastructure required to actually do some of these work
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.600]   case studies in the future live.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.820]   So my goal is to eventually be able to have listeners call in live, talk with me back
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.140]   and forth and give us reports on what has been working for them in their life.
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.940]   Segment number three, focus on living deeply.
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.900]   And here we have another new feature to try out.
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.780]   I call it the deep life academy.
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.700]   We will have a listener question, motivate a topic relevant to living deeply in a world
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.580]   that's increasingly shallow and upset and distracted.
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.540]   And then I will give a series of lessons on this skill on this topic.
[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.540]   So I call that deep life academy.
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.280]   All right.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.100]   So without further ado, and I really do mean that because to keep today's recording even
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.120]   more interesting, I'm looking at my watch now.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:41.700]   I have a call with my doctoral student in one hour and eight minutes.
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.540]   So we are going to stay on task.
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.620]   I have no other option.
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.340]   Nothing like having a little bit of motivation to keep moving.
[00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.980]   All right.
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:51.980]   Segment number one, deep dive.
[00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:59.660]   I call this deep dive loops, networks and links.
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.180]   What I'm going to talk about here is something you probably never knew you should care about,
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.620]   which is distributed curation of user generated content online.
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.740]   That is the most boring title you have probably heard.
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.340]   This is why most people don't think about it, but it is actually a subject that is incredibly
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:21.420]   important for understanding the dynamics of the current Internet economy.
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:26.180]   So let me start with the backdrop to this discussion, which is this idea that right
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:33.380]   now, if we look at the Internet economy, there are companies making a huge amount of money
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:41.340]   monetizing content generated by users, largely unpaid users generating content, making lots
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.340]   of money.
[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.860]   And I'm underscoring the word lots here.
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:51.100]   We're talking about some of the biggest corporations in the world right now are using this model.
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:56.700]   So it's not just here's a nice niche where some people made some money monetizing user
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.940]   generated content on the Internet has become a massive industry.
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.540]   Here's the thing that is new.
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:05.580]   That is relatively new.
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.580]   That's less than 20 years old.
[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.580]   This idea that you could make a lot of money off of this type of content.
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:16.940]   So quick beats of the timeline leading up to this current state of our economy before
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:23.340]   the web, for the consumer facing web became available in the 1990s.
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.700]   There was basically no way to make a lot of money off user generated content.
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:33.140]   The model was, if you're a media company, pay a small number of talented people to create
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.380]   content to be consumed by a lot of consumers.
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.940]   It's not user generated content, it's highly paid professional generated content.
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.720]   This created various economies.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.380]   So if you were trying to reach a very broad audience, like you're a national television
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.780]   network, there could be a lot of competition for this talent because you wanted the best
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.260]   television writer, you wanted the best actor and they could be really highly paid.
[00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.780]   But this model didn't require the superstar economics because of localization.
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:03.420]   This is why you had conglomerates like Gannett become really, really big because they found
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.300]   it was a good model to buy up local papers.
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.540]   Local papers used to be a lucrative model.
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:14.220]   You pay people who are as good as anyone else who's writing for your particular market,
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.620]   then you can make money off of everyone who lives in that market.
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:22.500]   All right, web 1.0 comes along, 96, 97, 98.
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:30.340]   Now it is possible for individuals to create content that can be consumed by anyone else.
[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:39.580]   We got to emphasize that this was a major transformation in the history of media production,
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:43.460]   that now anyone could produce content that could be generated by anyone else.
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:47.140]   We're talking, of course, almost primarily about written content here.
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.860]   This did not change the main media economics yet.
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.420]   It was too hard to do.
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.220]   It was technically demanding.
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.140]   You had to hand code HTML often to try to put stuff online.
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.220]   It didn't really look that good.
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:04.900]   Most of the leveraging of the first web revolution was actually by media companies that already
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:09.500]   were using the old model, small number of highly paid writers serving lots of people
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.420]   to reduce distribution costs.
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.260]   So you didn't get brand new creators.
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:21.940]   You got existing creators like Time Magazine realizing if we release on the web, it's cheaper
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.540]   than printing things on paper.
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.540]   Then we get web 2.0.
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:32.900]   This is the major turning point in the economics of content.
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:40.140]   Web 2.0, which happens once we get to the new millennium, is where we made it easier
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.580]   for people to publish information on the web.
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:53.400]   Now instead of hand coding HTML, you can type into a box and click submit or click post.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:58.100]   For the old school web geeks among you, there is small technical innovations that were critical
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:03.100]   here like AJAX, asynchronous JavaScript, that made it possible for you to send information
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:07.300]   from a website to a server, have that server update the website without having to reload
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.300]   the whole page.
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.740]   These are the little innovations that made web 2.0 possible.
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.460]   Now it was easy enough that almost anyone could generate content.
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.580]   This made it possible to generate a ton of content.
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:23.200]   But before we could mine this new resource, this information resource into massive companies
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:28.460]   and into massive monetizations, curation had to be solved.
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:34.780]   And this is what I want to talk about is the evolution of curation once web 2.0 came along.
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:39.300]   Because it turns out having a lot of people generating content does you no good.
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:45.680]   If you're trying to make money, selling content does you no good if you can't select for your
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.960]   audience stuff they actually want to see.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.940]   So this goes back to the title of my deep dive loops, networks and links.
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:11:00.780]   These are the three dominant models of curation of user generated content that emerged.
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.660]   That's in reverse chronological order.
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.580]   This were first then the network model, then the loop model, I want to walk through these
[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:10.220]   three models briefly, how they work and their advantages and disadvantages.
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.900]   And I think this will help clarify a lot of what we see going on.
[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:20.300]   Alright, so the, the first effective model for curating user generated content in the
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:24.820]   web 2.0 era was the link model.
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:28.220]   When I say link, I'm talking about hyperlinks.
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:33.980]   This is how the blogosphere worked during those early years of this content production
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:34.980]   revolution.
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:40.420]   It is a distributed curation method that is very human.
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:45.940]   It is based on human webs of trust that are augmented with digital technology.
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.420]   So here's roughly how it works.
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.980]   If I'm going to enter the world of blogs and websites that are linked to each other, I'm
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.100]   going to enter it in a place where I have a pre established trust relationship.
[00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:01.460]   Okay, I know this person, this person has a foot in traditional media, maybe I've seen
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.380]   their newspaper column, they write books I care about.
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.620]   Friends of mine have really pushed, this is the smart person that you need to read.
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:13.500]   Okay, so I enter into this web of trust relationships through an entryway of pre existing trust.
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:19.620]   I then see who are the people I already trust linking to.
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:24.740]   If sufficient people link to a new source of information, a new blog or a new website,
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:30.820]   and that website has sufficient aesthetic capital, that it's trustworthy, it's not a
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:37.300]   weird gray background website with animated gifs of eagles and what have you, then that
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.780]   will enter into my web of trust.
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.380]   I will trust that too, and I will begin to consume that content.
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:46.500]   Now that new site when it's linking to something else, again, will help convey trust into these
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.620]   new targets and help expand that web.
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:57.460]   So ultimately, this is humans building trust, then using that trust to expand where you
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.780]   get your content from.
[00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:07.140]   This was remarkably effective, it actually works really good at if you actually stick
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:13.620]   with it, excavating really interesting quality sources of information you might not have
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.980]   otherwise had access to, and more importantly, filtering out the weirdness.
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.060]   Because it's very difficult in this model, it's very difficult to get into someone's
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.740]   web of trust.
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:32.140]   So weird conspiratorial work, blatant misinformation, just general emotional outrage and ickiness
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:37.260]   could not gain a lot of traction in the link model of curation, because it would never
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.620]   get the entry point.
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:45.900]   It is very hard in other words to see something like QAnon gain a lot of traction in let's
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:53.500]   say 2006 online ecosystem, because for one of these blogs, if you're one of these initial
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:58.020]   somewhat eccentric QAnon conspiracy theorists, how is that going to get into a web of trust
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.220]   that's going to intersect mine?
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.660]   It probably won't.
[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:01.780]   It probably won't.
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.060]   And so it worked pretty well.
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:09.900]   The disadvantages were two, one, it was hard to monetize this type of world of user generated
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:10.900]   information.
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:16.580]   The blogosphere was famously hard to monetize both for large networks and individual content
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:17.580]   creators.
[00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.620]   There just wasn't the model there.
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:20.620]   So that was an issue.
[00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:24.380]   Yet the individual writers, it was hard to aggregate them.
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.260]   You can look at Nick Denton and Gawker.
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:31.860]   And there's a lot of interesting oral history on trying to make money off that model.
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.140]   It was difficult.
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.560]   And two, it's hard work.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.940]   So if I want to consume content, I have to do a lot of work.
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.700]   You actually have to spend a lot of time online.
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.660]   You have to see, build trust, expand this web of trust.
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.560]   This takes a lot of time surfing, following links, being exposed.
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.340]   So it was biased towards heavy tech users.
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:55.060]   If you wanted to create content, it was even harder.
[00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.700]   It was very difficult to gain a foothold.
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:02.180]   So this was the flip side of the filtering and curation being very effective.
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:06.540]   It allowed a lot more voices than existed in the world of newspapers, TV and radio only.
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:10.060]   But it was really hard if you're starting from scratch to gain access to these webs
[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:11.060]   of trust.
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:16.120]   I mean, I remember in the early days of my blog at calnewport.com, when I used to focus
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:26.060]   only on student advice, I specifically remember being very frustrated when I would see links
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.060]   from more established, trusted blogs.
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:32.420]   Lifehacker was one that comes to mind, to other student advice sources that I thought
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:33.420]   I was better than.
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.260]   It's like, look, I published these books.
[00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:36.380]   My advice is better.
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:37.380]   Why aren't they linking to me?
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.780]   It's because it's a very slow moving system.
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:43.660]   Eventually, I gathered enough trust to get linked to a lot by those types of sources,
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:44.860]   but it could take years.
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.620]   So it was not very exciting for content creators.
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.420]   It was very difficult.
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:50.420]   Very difficult.
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:54.260]   All right, that led to model number two.
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.500]   Call this the network model.
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.660]   Facebook was the innovator here.
[00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:05.500]   They figured out, okay, if we have a social network where we make it easy for anyone to
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:10.660]   create content, so now we can greatly increase the pool of possible content out there by
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.780]   having these very slick web interfaces.
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.580]   So you don't have to worry about what you look like.
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:19.460]   You don't have to worry about doing the hard effort of gaining aesthetic capital to convince
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.140]   people that you're someone legitimate.
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.140]   Everyone looks the same.
[00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.580]   Take that off the table.
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.020]   You don't have to set up a blog WordPress account somewhere.
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.020]   Take that off the table.
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:28.460]   You just sign up for this account, click these buttons.
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:29.940]   It looks great.
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:34.900]   And if we can get people, they realize, to do the work on their own of teaching us who
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:41.460]   their friends are, we can leverage that underlying social graph to do the curation.
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:45.800]   So now instead of people having to do the individual hard work of being on the internet
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:51.180]   a lot and following links and building up this web of trust, you can have a newsfeed.
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.260]   The newsfeed will fill in with what's interesting to you.
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:58.980]   And what Facebook realized is, well, if we see what your self-declared friends are interested
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:02.700]   in, we will guess you're probably interested in that too.
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:06.800]   We can use friend relationships plus a little bit of magic secret sauce and to try to keep
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:13.020]   redundant information, keep things fresh to curate for you stuff based off of your friend
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:14.020]   relationship.
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.020]   And that worked out really well.
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:16.540]   So Facebook innovated that model.
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:19.500]   Instagram followed up that model, but with images.
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.940]   And it was actually really successful.
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:25.980]   So now everyone can be involved in producing content and you can get a pretty well curated
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.500]   stream of stuff that's interesting to you without having to do too much work.
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.500]   So it lowered the bar.
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.620]   Twitter had a twist on this model.
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:37.380]   This is the retweet model.
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:41.020]   Facebook eventually copied this model as well where they added their share button.
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:46.340]   The retweet model says, let's make it really easy for you to share a piece of content with
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.860]   everyone you're directly connected to.
[00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:52.300]   And those people who you're directly connected to that really like the content will do the
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.300]   same thing.
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:59.700]   Now if you model this out mathematically, what you see is that the most compelling content
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:08.020]   on the network at any one point can dramatically, with dramatic speed, spread to huge swaths
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.740]   of the network.
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:15.540]   So this was an even more dynamic and aggressive source of distributed curation.
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.860]   And it became the core of Twitter's success.
[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.780]   You carefully set up who you follow.
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:24.900]   You do the work of propagating stuff you like with this low friction retweet or in Facebook's
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.780]   case share.
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:32.060]   And the resulting fierce viral dynamics will become an incredibly effective distributed
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:35.740]   selection mechanism for things that will engage people.
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.340]   And that's why Twitter became so powerful.
[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.740]   Facebook was interesting to see what your friends are up to and sharing.
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:43.540]   But Twitter, man, it would come out of left field with things.
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:47.420]   It was almost magical in the trends it would unearth.
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.420]   And that was all distributed.
[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.780]   That's not a super clever algorithm.
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:56.980]   That's not Hal 2000 sitting somewhere learning about the human psyche.
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:03.620]   It's 100 million users making hundreds of retweet or not decisions every day.
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.460]   So that's the network model.
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:13.220]   Leverage homogenized interfaces and leverage these networks, these social networks to help
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:17.460]   curate the content created within these closed garden networks.
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.620]   Again, advantages much easier to use.
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.780]   Much more people could be involved.
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.020]   You can make a lot more money off it.
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:27.220]   Very easy to monetize because these networks work within closed gardens.
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:33.300]   Disadvantage, you homogenize all the aesthetics of the content and the curation becomes obfuscated.
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:37.020]   You just get this feed of stuff that's interesting and all looks the same.
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:41.700]   Now suddenly the QAnon, the proverbial QAnon conspiracy theorist who would never be able
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:49.500]   to enter the web of trust in 2005 can easily spread and gain traction in 2015.
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.460]   All content looks the same.
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:52.940]   Curation is happening more behind the scenes.
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:58.700]   It's not based off of these more natural deeply human trust relationships.
[00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:03.420]   Other disadvantage of course is the viral dynamics, especially the retweet share dynamics
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:13.820]   led to a lot of unexpected externalities, tribalism, outrage culture, mob swarms, heavy
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:18.220]   feedback influence on, for example, media outlets where then you have reporters.
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:24.260]   So fearful of the fierce pushback possible that can happen overnight because of these
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:27.620]   fierce dynamics starting to really start to tailor what they say or don't say.
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.420]   Then you get the balkanization of media coverage itself and there's all these externalities
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.060]   that no one could have guessed.
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:42.140]   Twitter was not Dr. No with his cat on his island off of Jamaica with an evil plot to
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:43.140]   bring down democracy.
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.680]   They just wanted people to spend time on their service.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.300]   These were all unexpected side effects.
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:52.020]   All right, moving quickly now, model number three is the loop.
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:56.780]   This is personified I think best by TikTok.
[00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:03.300]   So now what we do with the loop is you basically take the human out of the equation and you
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:08.600]   use simple but devastatingly effective machine learning loops to just select for you as an
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:13.180]   individual from the whole pool of potential content what to show you.
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:17.540]   No shares required, no retweets required, no you going through and telling the network
[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:18.540]   who your friends are.
[00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:19.540]   None of that's required.
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:23.320]   And again, to the technicalities of this, what really happens with these machine learning
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:27.240]   loops is that all of the content is embedded in some sort of multidimensional statistical
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.240]   space.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.340]   It then feeds you items from this space.
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:37.160]   It looks at how long you watch each video to try to assess your preference towards that
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.240]   particular region.
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:42.200]   This gives it some weighted cores in this multidimensional space that it can then weight
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.200]   its selections of future videos by what's going to be closer to one of these cores,
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:50.480]   blah, blah, blah, nerd, nerd, nerd, math, math, math.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.440]   It works eerily well.
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.960]   You start watching videos, scrolling up and down.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:58.560]   It gathers that data, do this for half a day.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:02.220]   And it seems like TikTok knows you better than the people who are closest to you.
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.720]   So it was an incredibly effective way of doing this.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:09.240]   Of course, services like YouTube do something similar, but YouTube is more complicated.
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.600]   It has to serve many different purposes.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:17.280]   It doesn't purify this model nearly as well as TikTok, which is just this model purified.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:21.640]   Videos full screen, swipe when you're done, we'll send you the next.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.640]   That's it.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:26.480]   And when you purify this model, you saw it was probably one of the most effective curation
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.120]   methods we've ever seen.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:33.480]   So again, the advantages, no social graph needed.
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.080]   Anyone can compete in this space.
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:40.640]   You just need a reasonable pool of content and a machine learning loop.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:44.160]   And you can be titillating people in a very effective way.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.920]   Disadvantages, this is like the fentanyl of distraction.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.000]   It's too purified.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.360]   It can take over your whole life.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:56.480]   It is distraction now completely purified by any even attempt to connect it to community
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:00.680]   relationships or being up on the news or exposure to interesting people.
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:07.920]   It is just let's go straight to the brainstem and inject that chemical.
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:12.620]   So it is all humanity is now being stripped out of the curation loop.
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:19.400]   So we started with 2005 rich humanity, but hard to monetize, hard to use.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:26.920]   2015, now you have this sort of we're exploiting human things like our friendship networks
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:30.240]   and our retweet decisions that produce this.
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:34.340]   Let's call this we're gonna use a drug metaphor, kind of cocaine of distraction.
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:35.340]   This is Twitter.
[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:36.340]   This is Facebook.
[00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.340]   This is Instagram.
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:38.340]   This is TikTok.
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:43.140]   And we purify down, get the human out of the loop altogether, purify the curation down
[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.060]   to its strongest form.
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:52.680]   And we are living in a tent city drooling out the side of our mouth, waiting to overdose.
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:24:00.920]   All right, so that is the history of distributed curation of user generated content.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:01.920]   Two takeaways.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:05.280]   Once we understand this, a lot of the recent history of the Internet economy makes sense.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.880]   Like here, for example, is two practical takeaways.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.120]   This framework can help you come up with.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:15.360]   One, we lost something special when we left the link based curation.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:20.720]   Now, I understand we can't go back to a world where the only type of user generated content
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.520]   is curated in a link based manner.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.280]   We can't go back to a pure 2005 blogosphere world.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.960]   But couldn't we add this world back to what we have today?
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:33.560]   Isn't there a market out there for this more human web, a trust based, slower, harder,
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:39.520]   better quality connection, better quality information, really effective filtering of
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:43.440]   the weird and the conspiratorial and the based and loose foundations?
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:50.200]   Isn't there some sort of revivification of the blog that at least the sort of expert
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.040]   class or sub expert class could be participating in?
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.320]   Maybe podcasts are doing this, but there's not a lot of, we don't have the same links.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.480]   Anyways, I think that's interesting.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:03.360]   Two, once you understand distributed curation, you see that it is difficult to fix the
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:10.840]   negative side effects of in particular the network and loop based curation models through
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:14.000]   human intervention.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.480]   It's we're mixing too much two different things here.
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:22.000]   So if you think you can go in and solve the negative of the let's say, Twitter based retweet
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:28.640]   fierce viral dynamics by having humans in the loop, trying to kick people off of Twitter,
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.640]   good luck.
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.440]   These are two completely different types of dynamics going on.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.480]   You're mixing and matching.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.560]   Same thing with TikTok, this fiercely effective machine learning loop.
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:40.000]   What are you going to do when you don't like all the outcomes of that is like have a human
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.040]   come in and try to intervene.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.640]   You're mixing two different modalities.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.640]   It doesn't work.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:46.920]   If you want to get away from the negative side effects of these distributed curation
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:51.320]   models, you have to actually change the cultural zeitgeist to push people onto other sources
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:55.320]   of interaction, other sources of distraction, other sources of engagement.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:26:00.160]   I don't know that you can come in and fix something so cybernetically effective as the
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:05.360]   TikTok machine learning loop or, or Twitter retweets with a board of safety.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:10.000]   What we need to do is convince people that they shouldn't really be on Twitter that much
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   or not.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.080]   But anyways, two takeaways just to show you that once you have these frameworks, you can
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.000]   actually make some useful conclusions.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.840]   All right, well, that's what we get when Jesse's away.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.720]   I geek out longer than I should, but that is my deep dive.
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:30.520]   All right, I want to move on to some pragmatic questions about working deeper.
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:35.760]   First just briefly, let me mention one of our sponsors, a long time sponsor, our good
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.320]   friends at Magic Spoon.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.560]   I grew up with those type of sweet cereals.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.080]   I associate them with my childhood.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.240]   I associate them with escape.
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:52.040]   As a 40 year old man, I can no longer go buy a box of Lucky Charms.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:27:00.200]   That's sad, this is why Magic Spoon has become one of my favorite food based treats.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.360]   So here's the idea about Magic Spoon.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:06.560]   It tastes like those cereals we used to enjoy as kids, but without all the crap.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:11.280]   Magic Spoon cereal has zero grams of sugar, unless you're talking about the honey nut
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:17.720]   flavor, which has one, 13 to 14 grams of protein, only four net grams of carbs in each serving,
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:22.460]   only 140 calories a serving, it's keto friendly, gluten free, grain free, soy free and low
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:23.460]   carb.
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:29.780]   So you can enjoy that type of escape without feeling guilty.
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:33.300]   You can now build your own box, which is what I recommend to do.
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:38.120]   You choose flavors you like and they bundle them together and they send you a bundle of
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.980]   boxes.
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:43.320]   The flavors you can choose from are cocoa, fruity, frosted, peanut butter, cookies and
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:47.420]   cream, maple waffle, blueberry, cinnamon.
[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:51.240]   Just the newly reformulated honey nut flavor.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.240]   I like that a lot.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:56.480]   So I was happy to hear that they have added that to their permanent collection of flavors.
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:02.360]   So go to magic spoon.com/cow to grab a custom bundle of cereal.
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:08.280]   Be sure to use our promo code cow at checkout to save $5 off your order.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.640]   Magic Spoon is backed with a 100% happiness guarantee.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.720]   So if you don't like it for any reason, they will refund your money.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.320]   No questions asked.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:20.960]   Remember, get your next delicious bowl of guilt free cereal at magic spoon.com/cow and
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:26.000]   use the code cow to save $5 off.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   Jesse's not here.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Jesse's a big magic spoon guy.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.960]   He could tell us his favorite flavor.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.800]   That's what we get when he goes on vacation.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:32.800]   All right.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:38.760]   Let me also briefly talk for a moment about the Miracle Brand Comforter.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.160]   I make this point all the time on the show.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.280]   I run hot.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:48.520]   This is why I talked about at the opening of today's episode, why I should live in Scotland.
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.080]   It's not hot there, right?
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.080]   It's cloudy.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.080]   It's drizzly.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.080]   That's what I need.
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:57.400]   I hate being hot and I particularly hate sleeping when it is hot.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:02.880]   On the other hand, I am married to someone who likes to have blankets on regardless of
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.560]   the temperature.
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:08.660]   The Miracle Comforter is what saves us.
[00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:09.660]   So here's how it works.
[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:14.180]   It's designed to be less filling in the middle, which is where we tend to overheat and more
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:17.340]   filling at the top where we tend to get most cold.
[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:23.020]   This helps you keep a perfect temperature all night long with three temperature zones
[00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:27.460]   to distribute heat evenly across your body with the help of fabrics originally designed
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:28.460]   by NASA.
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:32.100]   You can finally say goodbye to the night sweats.
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.340]   It also feels good.
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:40.260]   The Miracle Comforter is made from the highest quality USA grown Supima cotton.
[00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:42.700]   It's also hyper allergenic, super comfortable.
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.220]   I can tell you this from experience.
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:53.060]   It also is self-cleaning in the sense that it has silver infused fabrics, prevents 99.9%
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:57.780]   of bacteria growth, stays fresh three times longer, therefore requires three times less
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:58.780]   laundry.
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:03.040]   Who wouldn't love three times less laundry, a clean smelling bed and sleeping at the perfect
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.780]   temperature all year round.
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:08.700]   This is why they call this comforter the Miracle Brand Comforter.
[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:12.980]   So if you're ready to sleep better through the night and do less laundry and moving to
[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:17.820]   Scotland like Jesse is not an option, then you've got to try the Miracle Brand.
[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:25.700]   Head to trymiracle.com/cal25.
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:31.140]   The name Cal, the number 25 and use that code cal25 to save 25% off.
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:36.400]   They'll also give you three free towels and they are so confident that you'll sleep better
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.920]   that they will offer a 30 day money back guarantee.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:44.560]   So this is basically a risk free trial of a whole new sleep experience.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:54.880]   That's 25% off and three free towels when you head to trymiracle.com/cal25.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.920]   Make sure to use that code cal25.
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:11.040]   All right, let's coffee up here and get to some questions about working deeply.
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:20.480]   First question comes from Newport Novice who asks, can you describe how you manage a semester
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:26.240]   long project using your system, particularly your Trello boards?
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:31.360]   All right, good in the weeds technical question.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:37.880]   Remember I like to think about my quote unquote systems as organizational systems, not productivity
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.600]   systems.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.360]   So I make this distinction because organizational systems mean systems to keep track of and
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:48.400]   schedule the work that you've decided you need to do in such a way that you do it on
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:52.720]   time at a high level quality without unnecessary stress.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:56.840]   The question about what you should be working on, how you decide to work on, how you structure
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:58.640]   your work life and what demands it makes.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:03.160]   Those are these sort of bigger picture questions that all fall under the header of productivity.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.960]   There's a lot of big existential questions about the point of work to answer at the level
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:07.960]   of productivity.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:12.160]   So just to set ourselves into a common conceptual map here for this question, we're honing in
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.480]   on organization.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:19.120]   Once you know what you want to do, what's the right way to organize that work?
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:26.200]   So I want to focus in answering this question on my multi-scale planning approach to organizing
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.400]   work.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:33.840]   This I think is what is most relevant for shepherding a long project through to completion.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:38.160]   All right, so let's start with the quarterly plan, your quarterly plan, or if you're in
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.080]   academic circles, your semester plan.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:43.400]   This is where that project is going to live once you start working on it.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:48.040]   It's where you make a note to yourself, I'm working on this during this quarter.
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:52.400]   Here's where I'm trying to get, here's the milestones I'm trying to hit, any scheduling
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:56.120]   heuristics that are relevant, like, okay, to do this, I need to spend at least two mornings
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.120]   each week.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.960]   So why don't I protect Tuesday and Thursday mornings?
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:03.760]   All of that, what you're working on, where you're trying to get, any heuristics about
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.000]   how you're going to work on it, that all goes in your quarterly plan.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.880]   You look at your quarterly plan at the beginning of each week when you create a weekly plan
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.280]   for that week.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:20.480]   This is where the intention of working on the project gets translated into an actual
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:24.880]   plan for making progress.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:28.880]   So it's here when you look at your quarterly plan and say, oh, my idea is to work on this
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.440]   thing Tuesday and Thursdays every morning, that now you might block out those Tuesdays
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.720]   and Thursdays for the week ahead.
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:39.240]   Or you put your note on the weekly plan about every day, do a little bit of work on this
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.560]   or whatever you need to do, but it's where you actually figure out where this work is
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:42.560]   going to get done.
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:47.280]   So of course, each individual day of your work week, you look at your calendar, you
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:51.640]   look at your weekly plan, you build your time block plan for the day and the actual work
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.960]   gets executed.
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:58.360]   Now how does this intersect with task management systems?
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.840]   You know, I use Trello, other people use other things to manage their tasks.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:05.600]   It depends on the type of project.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:10.940]   If the project generates ongoing tasks and discussions, then using your task management
[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:17.280]   system to keep track of what needs to be done, information relevant to those things, and
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:22.440]   keeping track of, let's say, people you were waiting to hear back from.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:27.320]   This is a really important role for the task management system to play.
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.320]   So I use Trello.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:34.320]   So let's say I'm working on a project that's organizing a conference.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:37.080]   I'm probably going to have a lot of specific tasks related to that.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:41.680]   And if this is a big ongoing project, I'll give it its own column in Trello.
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:47.400]   And each task will have its own card, I can attach relevant files to these cards.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.360]   Oh, here's the contract, here's the notes.
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:55.360]   Here's I typed up notes from the last meeting about sponsors, I can just attach those notes
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.080]   to the card representing the relevant task.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:02.080]   So all your information is in one place, you have clarity about what needs to be done.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.480]   You see that all in your task management system.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:09.920]   I would also in this situation, really heavily lean into the waiting to hear back from column,
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:14.680]   really critical that you don't rely on just seeing an old email in your inbox as a reminder
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:18.680]   here you want to have a card in your system in your Trello system or whatever you use,
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:25.680]   where you keep track of specifically, I am waiting to hear back from Bob about sponsor
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:26.920]   rates for this.
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:30.880]   So it's there, it's not in your head, it's not just in your inbox.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:35.000]   So your task management system is going to help you keep track of all the different information
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.600]   and ongoing work relevant to this project.
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:41.360]   So your multiplayer, multi scale planning, make sure that you don't forget about the
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:45.440]   project that gets scheduled things get executed, your task management system keeps track of
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.400]   the information.
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.440]   Some projects, however, are more uniform in their execution, they don't really require
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.240]   tasks to be tracked separately.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:57.540]   So for example, I'm writing the book right now.
[00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:03.320]   This doesn't generate tasks for the most part, to go into my task management system.
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:06.160]   It's just something I'm working on most days.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:10.240]   So it's obviously a big goal in my semester plan that I see when I make my weekly plan
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.520]   and I make sure I have plenty of time to write and if I maybe I'm losing a morning somewhere
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:16.920]   in my week, I'm going to protect an afternoon somewhere else to catch up on that time.
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:20.360]   So I do a lot of thinking about when am I going to write, but the actual activity is
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.360]   always kind of the same.
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.640]   I'm writing, I know what that means.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.560]   I keep track of my progress in Scrivener.
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:27.640]   It doesn't generate tasks.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:31.520]   So multi scale planning is how you get from conception down to execution.
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:35.920]   Task management systems enter the scene if and when there's details of the execution
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:38.800]   that need to be remembered.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:49.240]   All right, question two, about deep work comes from Aron, who says, I'm curious about how
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:53.960]   you approach budgeting time for email checks.
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:58.280]   I recently read an academic paper that found on average, the optimal number of email checks
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.680]   for mitigating stress is two to four times per day.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:07.320]   I find four leads to too much hyperactive hive minding, but one leads to stress accumulating
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.040]   over how much is waiting.
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.520]   So what is the right number?
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.980]   First, that stress issue is a good one.
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:19.400]   I don't know if this is the paper you're thinking about, but there's a good paper I cite in
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:24.960]   my book, A World Without Email that was written by Gloria Mark, lead authored by Gloria Mark
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:29.960]   of UC Irvine, that studied stress in relationship to email.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:34.600]   They used heart rate monitors and cameras that could look for heat blooms on workers'
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:41.940]   faces and they could cross what we call it, correlate this data with logs that kept track
[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:43.120]   of when people are checking email.
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:46.120]   And they found that, look, if you batch your email, everyone says, check your email once
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:47.120]   a day.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:50.880]   That is really stressful because you know there's stuff building up you're not getting
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:52.320]   to and it's pissing people off.
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.760]   And that makes people stress.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:57.620]   They found that this stress was particularly acute for some people more than others.
[00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:02.940]   If you want to use the big five personality inventory, those who rate high on trait neuroticism
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:05.280]   tend to get very stressed by email batching.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:09.240]   I think it's an important observation because it underscores a point I make in that book
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.880]   again and again.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:16.500]   You do not solve the problems generated by email by having better habits for interacting
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:18.580]   with your inbox.
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:24.640]   You have to stop all those stressful emails from landing in your inbox in the first place.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:29.080]   So I don't really think that much about how many times should you check your email should
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.360]   you batch it.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:34.120]   What I care about is how do you change the role email plays in your work so that no matter
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:37.900]   when you check your email, it's not stressful.
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:39.400]   It's not something you have to do all day.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.640]   It's not something that if you wait to do for most of the day, that it's going to be
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:44.420]   a particular source of anxiety.
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.480]   That actually takes work.
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:52.640]   You have to rethink the role of email in all of your work processes so that you do not
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.400]   have an inbox full of urgent things.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.960]   Two quick heuristics about doing that.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.160]   Again, I wrote a whole book about this.
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:00.040]   Let me just give you two quick heuristics.
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:07.580]   One, remember that the real productivity poison when it comes to email is messages that arrive
[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:12.480]   at unscheduled times and will require your response.
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:16.480]   And figuring out the basic processes you use to execute your work.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.640]   That is what you want to minimize.
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:23.120]   Not complexity, not time required to get something done.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.840]   Number of unscheduled messages that require a response.
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.760]   That is what you want to reduce.
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.920]   That is what creates stress in your inbox.
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:33.800]   Knowing that at any moment, messages could be arriving that require a response sooner
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.180]   being better than later.
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:38.440]   As long as that is largely the reality of how you interact with your inbox, you will
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:42.680]   have to be in there all the time, which is very distracting, or trying to batch and be
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.840]   really stressed about it.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:51.240]   Second heuristic I'll briefly mention for taming your inbox is remembering that email
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:40:00.880]   is best for delivering information, contracts, files, announcements, or non-urgent questions
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:05.160]   that can be answered with one reply.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:11.960]   So if I need to know, can you remind me again when your trip to Georgia is?
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:15.000]   That's a great use of email, I can send it to you.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.880]   It's not stressful when you see that message, you can answer it whenever it's not urgent.
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:23.040]   And that's a much better way for me to get that information than interrupt you or to
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.000]   stop by your office.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.400]   Anything beyond that, and in particular, back and forth conversation, anything that requires
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:33.040]   back and forth conversation, find another place to do it.
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:36.700]   And don't just say Slack because that creates the same problem if I have to keep monitoring
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.640]   Slack to do these back and forth.
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:43.000]   Office hours, like we talked about in episode two of nine, docket clearing meetings with
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:49.480]   your team, informal conversation, I grab you in the hallway when I see you passing by,
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:54.120]   "Hey, quick question, can we figure this out?" or tacking things on to existing meetings.
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:58.400]   "Hey, as long as we're here talking about whatever, let's handle X, Y, and Z real fast
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.400]   as well."
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:03.240]   So, I use email for back and forth conversation.
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.980]   Let me just give a quick vent here.
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:12.240]   I've had this happen twice in the last week, and really, this captures my frustration with
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:14.120]   email, encapsulates it.
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:18.280]   Twice in the past week, this has happened.
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:23.440]   Someone will send an email to me and a couple other people, usually like a scheduling type
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:25.320]   of thing, like, "Hey, when are we going to get together on this?"
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:29.960]   And they'll send this email like in the one case at four o'clock.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.760]   I don't see it because I didn't happen to check email after four o'clock.
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:36.800]   And maybe the next day, I finally get the check in email after I write and it's noon,
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:41.440]   and they have a bunch of back and forth discussion that's ended with like having to call me out
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.440]   specifically.
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:45.520]   "So, Cal, what is your answer here?"
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:49.280]   As if like something weird happened, like I must have somehow missed or ignored their
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:54.360]   thread because I didn't answer it at 4.30 or at 9 a.m. the next morning.
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:58.760]   And whenever I encountered that, and that's happened to me twice, one of them was 4 p.m.
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:02.320]   the message was sent and by like 10 a.m. the next morning, they were repeating it for me.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:03.320]   "Cal, what's your answer here?
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.320]   What's going on?"
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.760]   The other one was on a Saturday.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:08.320]   And by Sunday, this person was saying, "Cal, what's going on?
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:11.420]   What's your answer here?"
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:15.000]   When I see that, I say, "Okay, this is someone who is completely captured in the hyperactive
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   hive mind.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.720]   Your entire work is just doing these back and forth ongoing conversations.
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.960]   And if that's the way you do all of your work, you're dependent on everyone else to do the
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.640]   same thing."
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:25.640]   I refuse to do it.
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:27.720]   I also refuse to apologize.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:31.160]   I answer when I get to it.
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.160]   Just venting there.
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.400]   All right, rolling right along here.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:39.400]   Question number three comes from Fizz.
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:46.560]   Fizz says, "I tried to get my workplace to listen to your podcast and read your books,
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.160]   but they're too busy.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:51.800]   The pause for long enough to actually listen or read them.
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:54.260]   This startup is my first job out of engineering school.
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:43:00.360]   And to me, it seems like my boss is more concerned with looking busy than actual impact.
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:04.200]   I often get requests from my boss at noon for something he wants done by the end of
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.800]   the day.
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:09.320]   Following your advice to build career capital, this means that I usually stay late and work
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.360]   50 hour weeks to meet these short turnaround times.
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:16.440]   How can I push back against this hyperactivity despite not having earned the career capital
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.040]   yet?"
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:23.080]   Well, look, you're new to this workplace.
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:26.120]   You're new to the world of work based on your elaboration.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:30.320]   So it's one of your first jobs and it's at a startup.
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:32.440]   The short answer is you don't push back yet.
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:40.600]   So much as I appreciate the advertising for all of my young listeners out there, all my
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:45.720]   22 year old listeners in their first job, do not push my stuff on people in your office.
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:48.680]   They are not going to like you for it.
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:51.280]   I will become a, that will be a big source of annoyance.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:55.680]   If you say, listen to Cal Newport, they will say, fill the copier, change the copier ink.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.460]   What are you talking about?
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:00.980]   So no, you don't push back.
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:04.880]   What you do is you deliver and you deliver faster than your boss expects at a higher
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:06.800]   level of quality than she expects.
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:09.760]   And you never drop the ball.
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:10.760]   They trust you.
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:12.560]   If they put something on your plate, it's going to get done.
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.080]   If that schedule has to be changed, you'll tell them it has to be changed.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.520]   And you deliver when you said it was going to get it done.
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:24.320]   You become reliable, you become indispensable and you become someone who is known as a producer.
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:29.000]   This is the fastest way to accrue career capital when you are new to a position.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:36.060]   Once you accrue this career capital, then you can start to use this as leverage.
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:40.120]   Then you can get to the place where I was just ranting about, where I said, if you send
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:44.800]   me an email at four and then bother me at 10 the next morning, I'm not apologizing.
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.400]   In fact, I might wait a little bit longer before I respond.
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:48.400]   You got to get to that place.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:52.840]   And the way you get there is at first you deliver, you're indispensable, you produce
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:55.640]   at a high level.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.840]   Once you have established this, they're going to want you to stay.
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.200]   They're going to promote you to new positions.
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:03.480]   It's in that upward movement that you deploy your career capital leverage.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:07.560]   But until then, like, yeah, it's not unreasonable in a startup that this is kind of what you
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:08.560]   do.
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:13.520]   You're the guy who turns the thing around for your boss that he needs in a few hours.
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:14.520]   That's where you start.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:18.000]   The key is that's not where you end.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.120]   You better know where you're trying to head so that as you build this capital, you know
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:28.520]   what to do with it, that you don't just chase what's the next rung of immediate admiration.
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:30.220]   What's the thing that's going to make my boss the happiest?
[00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:32.080]   What's the thing that's going to impress my friends from business school?
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.000]   The most you have to know where you're going so you can deploy this capital when the time
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   comes.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.040]   I talk about this in my book, so good they can't ignore you.
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:41.400]   I call them the autonomy traps.
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:45.640]   Trap number one, which is what you're falling into until you've really earned some career
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:46.640]   capital.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:47.640]   You don't really have much autonomy.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:48.640]   You can't demand much.
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:53.280]   But trap number two, once you have some capital, you're probably so good.
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:57.600]   There will be all the pressure in the world to just move up to the next rank.
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:01.320]   More money, more responsibility, more respect in this very narrow world in which you happen
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:05.340]   to work and not exercise your autonomy at all.
[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:08.240]   Trap hits you on both sides.
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:14.640]   The third segment of the show is I'm going to do a deep life academy segment on lifestyle
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:15.640]   centric career planning.
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:18.640]   So you will get all the lessons you need about how to make sure you have the right vision
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:19.640]   in mind.
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:24.160]   So once you do build up this capital, you'll know where to go and then you can start recommending
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.160]   my books again.
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:27.800]   All right, let's do a new feature.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.240]   Case study, listener case study.
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.360]   I appreciate these.
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.920]   This comes from Diane.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:42.640]   She says, this is not a new question, just a follow up on a question I sent before.
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:47.680]   My question at the time was about the fact that I'm a writer who works at home and seem
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:52.480]   to be able to consistently do whatever I wanted first thing in the morning, but then having
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:57.760]   trouble ever moving on to the second thing I want to do due to the distractions of being
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:00.080]   at home while I worked.
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:07.400]   So update since then, I think I've solved the problem by renting a small office near
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:08.400]   my home.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:13.520]   Now I'm exercising first thing and then I go into the office just like a normal pre-COVID
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.120]   working person and get my writing done.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:19.400]   So it's up to you whether you choose to use my question or not, but I feel like I've solved
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.360]   it myself and I feel good about that.
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.240]   So thank you for all your work.
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:26.400]   Great case study, Diane.
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:27.960]   Work from near home.
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:28.960]   WFNH.
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:31.440]   I think it's a very important trend.
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:33.280]   I've written about this in the New Yorker.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.520]   Diane is a exemplar.
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:40.880]   There are lots of things we freely spend money on without even really thinking about it.
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:46.080]   But for some reason we have this resistance about, I don't want to spend money on a workspace
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:50.000]   if I'm a remote worker, if I don't have to go to an office, I don't want to spend money
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.660]   on a workspace near my home because technically you don't need it.
[00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:57.200]   You have a home office.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:58.200]   Sure.
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:02.920]   But the difference in experience about having a place to go versus not is worth quite a
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:03.920]   bit.
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:08.520]   So let's say, this is a quick thought example building on this case study.
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:12.360]   Let's say you had a traditional office job.
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:13.960]   You live in a relatively expensive place.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:15.960]   You live in suburban Washington, DC.
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:16.960]   All right.
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:21.240]   So in this thought experiment, you live in Kensington, relatively expensive house.
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:22.560]   All right.
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:25.400]   You go permanently remote.
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:29.720]   So you have a home office and your house in Kensington, but your dogs are there and, and
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:32.280]   your kids come home from school and whatever, right?
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:33.520]   Like it's, it's, it's distracting.
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:34.520]   Your laundry is there.
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:40.240]   The TV is always playing and you find yourself really distracted.
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:46.480]   If you could have a office to go to near your house, your productivity, happiness, sustainability
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:47.640]   of your work might be much better.
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:49.840]   Now let's say you're spending all your money.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:50.840]   Kensington's expensive.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:55.180]   Well, now that you're really remote, you move out of Kensington.
[00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:58.680]   You move for whatever reason, you've always had this dream of having land.
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:06.200]   So you move to a farm in Westminster.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.880]   My local listeners know who I'm talking about here.
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:11.760]   This is actually a real person we know who's doing this and you have some land and a barn
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:15.740]   and, and, and you know, it's cheaper to live there.
[00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:20.080]   And then you can, you go and rent a little bit of office space in the nearby downtown
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:21.720]   and it's still cheaper than where you live before.
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:24.740]   You kind of live in this cool place and you have this land and it's cheaper to live.
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:27.960]   So you can spend some of that money you save into an office.
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:30.240]   That's what you should do because you know what, if you can go to that office to work,
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.440]   that works can be much more effective.
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:34.420]   You'll have much clearer separation between work and home.
[00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:35.420]   What a great investment in your money.
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:38.360]   So what I'm trying to say here is what Diane did is great.
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:42.720]   If it is all possible to find a way to invest money in a dedicated working space, that's
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:47.840]   not your house, but convenient to your house, do it.
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.800]   And I think maybe we should see more of this.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:53.960]   If I'm remote, I'm going to move somewhere cheaper.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:58.160]   We claim 50% of that savings invested in a place to work.
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:59.160]   All right.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:01.800]   So we have one more new feature to do.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:07.100]   I want to wrap up the show with a deep life Academy feature.
[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:12.000]   We go through some lessons about a core idea for living the deep life.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:19.720]   I got a first briefly mentioned ZocDoc.com.
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:21.400]   One of our sponsors.
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:25.000]   This is one of these sponsors that just makes sense that the service exists.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:30.140]   If you're going to go to a restaurant, you're going to look up reviews.
[00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:31.760]   What restaurants are nearby?
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:34.560]   Which ones get real reviews from real patrons?
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:38.300]   Why don't we do the same thing with dentists, with primary care physicians, with specialists?
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:40.200]   Why don't we say, okay, who's nearby?
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.200]   Who takes my insurance?
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.280]   And what do people actually think?
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:43.480]   What do patients actually think?
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:44.660]   It makes a lot of sense.
[00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:47.400]   This is the service ZocDoc provides.
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:48.980]   You find what doctors are nearby.
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:53.600]   You find what doctors are in your insurance network and you read real reviews from real
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:55.800]   patients to see, is this a good doctor?
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:57.880]   Do they run their offices well?
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:00.360]   What's it like to actually go and see them?
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:07.080]   To make things even better, they then provide software to simplify the paperwork.
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:08.240]   Got to fill out these forms.
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:09.680]   You can do it online.
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:11.280]   You can do an advance to showing up in the office.
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:17.560]   I now have two different medical care providers who use ZocDoc, my primary care physician
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:19.960]   and my dentist, so I know this service well.
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:23.760]   I love the ability to fill out forms way in advance.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:25.320]   I get automated text messages.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:26.880]   I go to the website, I fill them out in advance.
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:28.840]   When I show up, they have what they need.
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:33.520]   ZocDoc is one of these services that just makes a lot of sense.
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:38.520]   Free app, shows you doctors, patient reviews, which ones take your insurance, everything
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:40.520]   you need.
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:45.320]   So go to ZocDoc.com/deep and download the ZocDoc app for free.
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:49.040]   Then start your search for a top rated doctor today, many available within 24 hours.
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:55.400]   That's ZocDoc.com/deep.
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:59.520]   Say it three times fast and they'll give you a discount.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:00.520]   I made that last part up.
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:05.240]   I also want to talk about ladder.
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:09.800]   If you do not have life insurance, but you have people who depend on you and you don't
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:13.360]   have a huge pile of cash sitting in the bank somewhere, you need life insurance.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:20.260]   Most people know this, but most people are stymied by the logistical challenge of how
[00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:22.340]   do I even get started?
[00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:26.120]   Where do I go if I need to get life insurance?
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:30.020]   This is where ladder enters the scene.
[00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:38.740]   It is a 100% digital, no doctors, no needles, no paperwork way to find good life insurance
[00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:40.680]   coverage.
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:43.600]   So if that coverage is $3 million or less, that's where you need no doctors, no needles,
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:44.600]   no paperwork.
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:48.320]   You just answer a few questions about your health in an online application.
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:50.600]   Ladder can work in just minutes.
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.200]   You apply on your phone or your laptop.
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:56.200]   It's algorithms work in real time to find out if you're instantly improved.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:59.680]   No hidden fees, cancel anytime, get a free refund if you change your mind in the first
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:00.680]   30 days.
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:03.180]   It's an insurance broker.
[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:06.200]   So they're not just trying, they're not selling you their insurance.
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:11.700]   They are finding you policies that match what you need from insurers with long proven histories
[00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:14.620]   of pain claims.
[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:19.160]   They have 4.8 out of 5 stars on Trustpilot.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:20.920]   Ladder is now the way to get life insurance.
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:22.440]   I'm using ladder.
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:24.480]   It's on my to-do list for the week.
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:26.240]   This episode is coming out.
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:28.780]   Last week we met with our financial advisor.
[00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:30.360]   So we need to up our life insurance.
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:31.360]   I know exactly what I'm going to do.
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:32.360]   I'm going to go to ladderlife.com.
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:33.360]   Give me a couple minutes.
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:34.360]   Boom, done.
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:39.280]   It's going to make that element of my to-do list easy.
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:42.380]   So I am literally using this service next week.
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:47.040]   So go to ladderlife.com/deep today to see if you're instantly improved.
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:51.360]   That's LADDERLIFE.COM/DEEP.
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:52.360]   Ladderlife.com/deep.
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:57.440]   All right, segment three, the deep life.
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:58.440]   Let's go to the deep life academy.
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:04.160]   So what we're going to do here is we're going to start with a question and use this question
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:09.440]   to motivate a deeper look at a key idea in the deep life universe.
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:14.520]   All right, so our motivating question comes from Anon.
[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:20.320]   How do you go about figuring out the lifestyle you want to have and the career you want to
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:21.320]   pursue?
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:22.560]   You talk about lifestyle-centric career planning.
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:26.880]   And while I love your idea, I am still unable to put it into practice.
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:32.800]   I work in IT as a data engineer, and I'm trying to think about what next, which is where your
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:35.360]   advice seemed relevant.
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:39.240]   Where can I get inspiration from you to help figure out the type of lifestyle I would like
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:40.760]   to lead?
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:48.040]   All right, this is an opportunity to open up the deep life academy for the topic of
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:52.080]   lifestyle-centric career planning.
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:55.880]   One of my favorite strategies, probably the piece of advice I give most often to young
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:55:00.040]   people trying to figure out their careers.
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:05.000]   So I have, let's see, three, four lessons, four brief lessons.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:09.880]   Lesson number one, what is lifestyle-centric career planning?
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:11.620]   So here's the idea.
[00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:17.680]   When making decisions about what career to follow or what advancement to pursue in your
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:23.600]   current career, you should work backwards from a concrete image of your ideal lifestyle
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:26.860]   that you hope to be living in the near to intermediate future.
[00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:31.160]   This vision, this concrete image should include details about the physical environment where
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:37.120]   you are, the social environment in which you find yourself, the stress pace and general
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:40.000]   atmosphere of your life, your mental and spiritual life.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:47.160]   What are the details there and what your time outside of work is occupied with.
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:53.160]   So you're building a concrete image that has all of these things in it, concrete specific
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:58.640]   imagery, but does not have specifics about what exact career you're doing or what exact
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:55:59.640]   work you're doing.
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:06.120]   So it's all of the elements of your lifestyle, save specifics about I work in UX design at
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:09.160]   a mid-market tech company.
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:11.420]   So that's the exercise.
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:15.600]   You then use this image to help figure out what job you want or what career advancement
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:18.440]   to take, because now you have a simple question.
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:25.240]   Of the things available to me now, what will most effectively move me closer to achieving
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:27.160]   this lifestyle?
[00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:30.180]   So you have a clear target for your decisions.
[00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:36.040]   It gets you away from much more vague approaches to making career decisions, such as a what's
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:43.560]   my passion, what's my true calling possible to answer questions or just what seems most
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:49.560]   respectable or most stable or make my parents happiest.
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:55.320]   This is, I think, a much more effective means of pursuing these questions.
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:58.880]   We'll get to why in a later lesson.
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:04.600]   Lesson number two, and this goes straight to Anand's particular query.
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:07.820]   How do you figure out the answers to those questions?
[00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:14.200]   How do you figure out what your ideal lifestyle should look like?
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.480]   Here you have to trust your gut.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:18.920]   So this is kind of interesting.
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:24.840]   I reject the idea that we have a gut instinct about jobs that is pretty effective, right?
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:29.240]   This idea that we have a passion, we're wired for this particular job and we'll know it
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:33.440]   when we see it because jobs are weird.
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:36.360]   We don't have a great instinct for what they really mean for our lives.
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:40.820]   We don't have good prediction software on what would that job actually be like.
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:47.920]   I don't trust my gut too much about something as vague as a career in UX design versus a
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:50.060]   career in QA quality insurance.
[00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:51.160]   My mind doesn't know what that means.
[00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:56.140]   My gut's not going to give me interesting reactions about this, but I do trust my gut
[00:57:56.140 --> 00:58:02.440]   when I'm thinking about specific concrete aspects of my lifestyle.
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:09.320]   When I imagine myself going for a long walk among the pine trees in the morning with my
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:14.720]   dog and the sun is filtering through and that really resonates, I want to be doing that
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:15.720]   every day.
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:16.720]   Something about that resonates.
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:21.240]   I trust my gut about that because that's concrete that's specific, specific concrete.
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:23.880]   So you need to see what resonates.
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:26.720]   Where do you find examples to test for resonance?
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:31.840]   Documentaries, movies, magazine profiles, books, YouTube videos, people that you know
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:35.240]   and experience in your life, all these different forms of media, expose yourself.
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:42.280]   Let me watch the thing about Laird Hamilton and his house in Malibu or his house in Hawaii
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:44.800]   and that weird kind of like outdoor exercise focused lifestyle.
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:51.800]   Let me watch something about Steve Jobs and his hard charging style to try to change the
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:52.800]   world.
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:53.800]   Let me watch something about a math genius.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:55.560]   Let me watch something about a guy who shapes surfboards.
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:59.400]   Expose yourself, expose yourself to all sorts of different stories, all sorts of different
[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:02.560]   examples and aspects of life and see what resonates.
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:03.560]   Trust your intuition.
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:08.640]   All right, for lesson number three, let's do a case study.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:12.000]   Let's see this in action.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:21.320]   Using our original question asker as our starting point here, let's go through two possible
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:24.600]   lifestyles that he might come up with.
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:28.720]   So I want to show you an example of what a good concrete lifestyle looks like and then
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:31.920]   discuss how that could impact decisions he makes about his career.
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:34.240]   So let's let's make this tangible with a case study.
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:35.240]   All right.
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:39.240]   So Anand is a data engineer, IT guy.
[00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:40.520]   Let's assume he's early in his career.
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:44.780]   I'm not sure if that's true, but just for the case of our case study, he has a technical
[00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:47.640]   degree working in some sort of data engineering job.
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:48.640]   All right.
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:53.280]   He goes through our exercises here, exposes himself to a lot of media, sees what resonates,
[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:57.200]   come up with a concrete image of his lifestyle that has all details tangible except for the
[00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:59.160]   specifics of his job.
[00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:01.400]   Let's look at two possible visions he might come up with.
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:04.280]   Vision number one.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:11.840]   Maybe the image he creates that resonates is that he's in a house overlooking a sun-drenched
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:12.840]   meadow.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:16.560]   There's kind of land here.
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:19.580]   That evening, friends come over.
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:26.320]   It's like the opening scene in that NBC show Parenthood where there's cafe lights over
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:29.240]   an old picnic table and some Tibetan prayer flags.
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:30.240]   You're sort of outside.
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:36.240]   It's a little bohemian, enjoying some wine from a local vineyard that someone brought,
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:39.180]   just enjoying people's company.
[01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:43.760]   Maybe as part of this vision, Anand is imagining sort of in the late afternoon, sort of as
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.000]   his workday is over.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:51.880]   In his workday, he imagines he's looking out through a picture window over the meadow,
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:56.140]   working generically at a computer screen, but with his tea and it's quiet.
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:01:01.120]   By three, he's done and he has a riding shed at the corner of the property, maybe by a
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:05.720]   garden with a deer fence up that he tends and he's working on a novel, speculative
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:07.580]   fiction novel.
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:16.120]   Not stressed about money, but nothing in this image shows him being particularly rich.
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:20.240]   That's an image with lots of concrete attributes about different aspects of his life.
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:22.920]   Let's say that's what resonates.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:28.800]   What impact might that have on how he advances in his career as a data engineer?
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:34.920]   Well, it might tell him, I need autonomy, so I'm going to move towards highly valuable
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:37.460]   project-based skills.
[01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:42.320]   So skills where you can do a project, applying the skill and it's really valuable, it's really
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.280]   hard one skill.
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:51.080]   This would then give him going forward, a lot of flexibility in where and how he looked.
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:58.400]   So for example, he might follow the path of Lulu from my book, So Good They Can't Ignore
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.600]   You where I discuss these things.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:03.800]   Lulu did database design, so this is very similar.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:07.560]   She got very good at doing a particular type of database design that was relevant for financial
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:13.080]   institutions, left her job and did this freelance.
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:15.960]   Projects took, you know, four or five months.
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:23.420]   So she constructed a life where she worked half the time and then the other half of the
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:26.840]   year would go do adventure to do something else.
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:29.480]   So maybe Anand has this model in place.
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:33.400]   I got to build up some specific skill where I can take on a few projects a year.
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:34.400]   I can do them forever.
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:38.280]   I want to do, I have control over how many I do, but it's lucrative enough that if we
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:41.840]   live someplace that's not super expensive, can have the house in the meadow because,
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:45.200]   you know, we don't need to be in suburban DC.
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:48.160]   So you're looking for that type of skills.
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:51.880]   You're looking for shifting to a position that's more location independent.
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:55.120]   Let me leave this firm where it's all in person to work for this remote firm.
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:58.320]   So now I have more arbitrage over where I live.
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.480]   In fact, if I, let me find a location.
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:04.040]   If I live here, it's actually pretty cheap.
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:08.640]   And so I don't have to get as high up the income possibility salary with my skills before
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:09.640]   I make that move.
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:14.520]   So all these things become relevant once you have the vision.
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:15.520]   Vision number two.
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:21.080]   So let's assume instead of that being the vision, when Anand does lifestyle centric
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:24.200]   career planning, he comes up with the following image.
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:30.320]   He sees himself in a high rise apartment in the city, and he's got a cool view of the
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.400]   buildings and the light at night.
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.480]   He's plugged into the cultural scene of the city.
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.320]   So he's seen like the latest movies and interesting music.
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:42.820]   He's really plugged in, being exposed to the interesting culture.
[01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:46.080]   He has an exciting type of professional life where he's leading a team.
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:51.160]   There's a Steve Jobsian feel to it that they're getting something new off of the ground.
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.360]   He's respected in this world of entrepreneurs.
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:58.240]   There's this sense of like, if this goes right, like we might be wealthy.
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:01.280]   We're making a big play, getting after it.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.880]   Very exciting, very plugged in.
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:07.640]   Maybe Anand came from a quieter background and felt bored and wanted the energy.
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:08.640]   All right.
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:12.360]   So if that's your vision, it would lead to different decisions about what to do with
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:14.520]   your early stage data engineering career.
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:18.600]   Now you might take on a more aggressive path where you're trying to get into team leadership
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:20.900]   positions, take on more responsibilities.
[01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:26.200]   You're not trying to develop a very bespoke skill that you can then trickle out in as
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:27.480]   many projects as you want.
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:32.460]   You instead want to prove yourself as someone who can get things done.
[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:36.640]   Maybe he moves from his company to a company that's in a bigger city and faster growing
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:42.480]   where there's startup capital at play so he can meet investors, meet higher end players,
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:45.760]   be around more skilled people, the people who are going to get the biggest investment
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:51.160]   and make the biggest moves to try to get new companies started.
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:53.920]   Completely different types of decisions will be made if that's the vision.
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:05:01.160]   Same person, different visions, both give you clear images of what to do.
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:02.660]   Final lesson here.
[01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:07.620]   Why does lifestyle centric career planning works?
[01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:13.740]   Because ultimately the daily reality of your lifestyle is what affects your sense of well-being.
[01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:19.220]   The details of your life each day is what is directly acting on your body and your mind
[01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:22.980]   from which your affect is generated.
[01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:27.180]   So working backwards from what are the details that I am going to enjoy, they're going to
[01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:29.500]   be meaningful to me, they're going to be sustainable to me.
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:33.140]   Working backwards from that is the most consistent way you have of getting to a place where you
[01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:37.460]   actually feel good about your life.
[01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:41.700]   To instead focus on your career in isolation.
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:43.960]   Forget all that.
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.980]   What job's my passion?
[01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:47.660]   How can I be as successful as possible?
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:52.980]   And to just hope that after you make those decisions, you can get the rest of your life
[01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:53.980]   to sort of fit.
[01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:57.100]   Get the rest of your life to sort of fix.
[01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:59.820]   You're just rolling the dice.
[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:05.540]   You are very likely to end up in a career path in which things that are really important
[01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:09.520]   to you to enjoy and find meaning in your life are difficult or unavailable.
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:14.220]   You might get lucky, but you probably won't.
[01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:15.940]   I was reading a book the other day.
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:22.020]   I won't mention the specific book, but, but the, the author had moved from the Pacific
[01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:28.900]   Northwest to suburban Washington, DC, and like being outside outdoor activity, exercise,
[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:33.700]   fresh air, the woods, like all of this was really important to her.
[01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:38.500]   And they moved to the suburban DC because this is a better job.
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:42.460]   And if I'm just going to put on my blinkers and say, what do I want to do?
[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:43.460]   What's a good job?
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:44.460]   What's a good opportunity?
[01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:45.460]   I can't pass up a good opportunity.
[01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:48.260]   So they come to the suburban DC, which is not near any nature.
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:50.060]   She was miserable.
[01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:53.420]   Now this book wasn't just about that, but I pulled that thread out of it.
[01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:57.340]   I was thinking, man, if you're a lifestyle, such a career planning, you would say, I could
[01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:05.860]   care less that there is a quote unquote, good opportunity at a think tank in DC.
[01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:09.460]   What I care about is do I have the opportunities where I am?
[01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:12.060]   Do I have the opportunities right now to make my life something I really liked?
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:13.060]   It's really meaningful.
[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:16.620]   And for me, the person speaking in the voice of the person, that book, that's probably
[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:19.780]   staying in the Pacific Northwest and finding the right skillset that allows you to not
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:22.100]   be stressed about money and to have this flexibility.
[01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:25.300]   I really think it's the way to go.
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:30.240]   Career serves your life because ultimately your daily experience of your life is what
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:31.500]   dictates how you feel.
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:37.380]   Life's just a career planning is the natural consequence of that truism.
[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:39.060]   All right.
[01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:44.880]   I have six minutes until my meeting with my doctoral students.
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:46.200]   So let's wrap it up here.
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:48.300]   We made it.
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:51.940]   As Jesse likes to say, one take, Tony is my name today.
[01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:54.620]   We just turned on the camera and rocked and rolled.
[01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:57.500]   Thank you everyone who sent in their questions.
[01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:00.580]   There'll be a new question survey being posted soon.
[01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:03.460]   We just want to get the answers to our feedback survey first before we do it.
[01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:05.300]   So keep an eye open for that.
[01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:10.140]   As I like to say, if you like what you heard, you will like what you see.
[01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:13.220]   Full episodes and highlight clips are available at youtube.com/CalNewportMedia.
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:16.980]   If you like what you heard, you'll also like what you read.
[01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:19.380]   Sign up for my newsletter at calnewport.com.
[01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:22.740]   Be back next week with Jesse in the studio.
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:24.980]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:29.980]   [MUSIC]
