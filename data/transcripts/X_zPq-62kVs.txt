[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   Today, I want to introduce you to a side hustle you might not know exists,
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.560]   but you might need.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.480]   The secret world of finding profitable deals,
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.160]   some of which are repeatable,
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.320]   and that any one of you can use to generate thousands
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.800]   or even tens of thousands of dollars of side income all in your spare time.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.040]   Last year, we made $36,000, along with two and a half million points,
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.880]   just from deals that we did online, spending about 10 to 15 hours per week.
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.080]   The year before, it was $32,000 and a million points.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.520]   Hello, I'm Chris Hutchins.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.120]   This is All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.120]   Today, I'm talking to Kai.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.600]   He is an expert that runs a private Discord and podcast
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.880]   dedicated to finding these repeatable, profitable deals.
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.200]   He's not only going to share how you can do all this too,
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.200]   but also how you can make even more playing in multiplayer mode.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.200]   If you sign up, get $100, and then you refer your spouse,
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.760]   they get $100, but you also get $100 for signing them up.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.640]   So now it becomes $300 instead of just your $100.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.920]   However, it could be also your cousin or your friend.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.840]   So let's learn how to find all these deals.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.440]   And if you enjoy what you hear, please give us a thumbs up,

[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.320]   Kai, thanks for being here.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.680]   Yeah, thanks for having me, man. Been excited to do this.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.920]   So when I first found your content, the thing that really blew my mind
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.840]   was this fundamental shift in the idea that deals could kind of replace income.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.520]   And so I've talked to lots of people about side hustles
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.080]   and starting businesses to make a few thousand dollars a year,
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.920]   even more than that, and grow it into a real thing.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.760]   And I've talked to lots of people about finding the best deals.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.000]   What you've done, and it seems so genius to me,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.360]   is you've actually turned the deals into a side hustle
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.280]   so that you can generate income.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.880]   And from my quick looking, to the tune of like tens of thousands of dollars a year.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.200]   So first off, where did this idea come from?
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.520]   And can you give a little bit of overview of how you think about it?
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.240]   For sure. Yeah, it started during the...
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.880]   Well, it's been a couple of decades of doing this,
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.800]   but primarily really ramped up when my wife and I did the FIRE,
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.560]   the early retirement thing.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.840]   And we wanted a way to kind of supplement our income
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.200]   because you're on a kind of a tighter budget when you do FIRE.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.960]   And so profitable deals sort of just kind of...
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.560]   It's one of those things where you can tackle
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.960]   a whole plethora of things that people often don't think about.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.760]   Credit cards, I think, are the main things people think about
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.120]   when it comes to sign up bonuses.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.240]   But there's this whole avenue of bank bonuses,
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.360]   brokerage bonuses, meal kit that you can do
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.360]   that can really make you a lot of money.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.840]   And that's for us, like in the last couple of years,
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.280]   I think 2023, we made somewhere around, let me see,
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.920]   like $36,000 doing these profitable deals
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.600]   and 2.5 million points.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.520]   The year before it was $32,000 and a million points.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.960]   So it's been slowly kind of climbing up in that sense.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.520]   And I think we're on track to make even more this year.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.440]   Yeah. Look, you write these great summaries each month
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.920]   and you do an episode about them on your podcast, The Daily Churn.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.560]   And this year, I summed up 4 months in,
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.200]   you're already at $32,000 and a million points.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.680]   So you're kind of what you did in 2022,
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.120]   you've now done in 4 months.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.120]   So definitely looks like you're on path to eclipse
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.040]   everything you've done in a year before.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.880]   So my question though is,
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.680]   how much time do you need to be spending per year
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.000]   to have a side hustle of these profitable deals
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.880]   that generate tens of thousands of dollars?
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.640]   Yeah. I think that's kind of the beauty of it
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.240]   is that it's really kind of a choose your own adventure thing.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.640]   How much time you want to dedicate
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.120]   is going to be based on your priorities.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.640]   Because there is, as you said,
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.200]   pretty much an endless stream of these deals
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.960]   ranging from massive things
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.240]   that can give you thousands of dollars
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.520]   to like really small things
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.000]   like you can get a free pack of water.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.920]   So depending on what your goals are,
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.480]   I think it's really important to hone in on
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.960]   is it that you want to fly first class for free
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.280]   and stay at really extravagant hotels?
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.840]   Maybe that's your priority and you can focus on those.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.840]   Or it's like, do you want to have side income
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.560]   that comes in that helps bolster your budget,
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.640]   whether you're doing fire or for other reasons?
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.560]   Or you just want to like save money on groceries.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.560]   So it's really important to like figure out
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.040]   what it is that you actually want to get out of it
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.080]   and then focus on that
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.400]   and then spend an adequate amount of time.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.560]   So for us, an adequate amount of time
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.640]   is like 10 to 15 hours a week
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.600]   is what we do to make $30,000 plus.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.360]   So the sky's your limit though,
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.160]   because I also know people that spend 40, 50,
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.760]   60 plus hours a week doing this
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.240]   and it becomes a full-time job
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.320]   where you could be making six figures
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.560]   easily doing profitable deals.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.320]   But is that what you want to be doing?
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.400]   That's going to vary based on person.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.560]   And for us, it's more of a side hustle
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.760]   versus a full-time job.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.920]   And we're trying very hard to keep it that way
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.760]   because so many of these deals keep coming up
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.360]   and there's always a temptation
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.640]   to do more and more of them.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.760]   Is there a power law in these deals
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.120]   where if you look at last year, $36,000,
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.280]   was it about slowly spending 10 hours a week
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.480]   getting through these deals?
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.920]   Or was it about making sure
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.040]   that when the two or three really big ones happen,
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.600]   that you were aware and ready to go?
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.600]   - Definitely a little bit of both
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.800]   because I think 80/20 rule definitely applies here
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.680]   where doing just 20% of the top deals
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.920]   is going to yield 80% of the income
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.200]   that you're going to get that year.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.720]   But at the same time,
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.880]   if one of your priorities is like,
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.280]   "I want to cut my grocery bill down by 90%,"
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.600]   and that's one of your goals,
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.840]   then doing something like meal kits
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.520]   could be a good thing to pursue.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.680]   Even though it's not the most profitable thing,
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.880]   it meets the goal of like,
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.960]   "Well, I only spend $100 total in a month on food now
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.240]   thanks to one of these things."
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.840]   So it can really vary.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.720]   - And can you maybe give an example
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.560]   of just one or two things
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.400]   to kind of wet the palate of someone listening?
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.320]   We don't have to go into all the details,
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.600]   but just so people get a sense
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.280]   of what some of these deals are.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.040]   Because before we started talking and recording today,
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.200]   we talked about how to even describe
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.440]   the kind of bucket of things you do.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.600]   We came up with this term "profitable deals"
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.440]   because that was the closest thing we could have,
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.960]   but there isn't a perfect descriptor.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.640]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.920]   It's so diverse.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.640]   I think people may think of credit card bonuses.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.000]   That's the first one that comes to mind.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.320]   And I think credit card bonuses are very lucrative.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.920]   And I think even on your show,
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.280]   you've extensively covered the points and miles game.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.600]   But an aspect that people often don't think about
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.720]   that's also very profitable are bank signup bonuses
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.880]   and brokerage signup bonuses.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.080]   Those can yield a lot of just straight cash,
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.920]   liquid cash that you can use
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.080]   as like a buffer for your finances.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.440]   But then there's also like a plethora
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.320]   of other little things.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.880]   Saving money on cell phones.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.000]   I mentioned meal kits.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.760]   You can find ways to try and generate spend
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.040]   for your credit cards
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.520]   so that if you're someone that's not spending
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.920]   a million dollars a year on your credit cards,
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.400]   you can still meet a lot of these signup bonuses
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.640]   and get a lot of points and cash that way.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.640]   There's just so many things.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.640]   There's buying groups you can participate in,
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.760]   reselling gift cards.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.000]   It's hard, I think, to pin it down.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.280]   So I think profitable deals is a good descriptor for it.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.840]   And I think it will be good for us
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.760]   to go into some of the more specific ones
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.120]   if you feel like people will be curious.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.760]   Yeah, let's jump through some of these categories
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.600]   and give people a good understanding
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.200]   of what kinds of deals are out there
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.440]   so they can figure out what might fit their profile.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.280]   And I think starting with banks makes sense.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.360]   We were just talking about it.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.720]   The society we live in is like,
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.280]   these companies always want to attract new customers.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.520]   Capitalism, consumerism,
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.800]   they're always looking for new people
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.440]   to join their bank or institution.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.680]   And so they offer lucrative signup bonuses
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.800]   for you to sign up and deposit money with them.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.080]   And so like in the past,
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.160]   I've done ones where Wells Fargo was offering $2,500
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.680]   to move over to Wells Fargo.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.600]   Right now, Bank of America is offering $1,000
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.920]   if you deposit $30,000 with them
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.240]   and you leave it there for 60 days.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.880]   So just by leaving your money with these banks,
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.000]   they can give you really massive cash bonuses
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.760]   paid out in a few months.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.760]   And that's really the essence of bank bonuses
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.160]   is like, do you value getting cash
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.280]   versus some other things you can spend your time on,
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.880]   you know, like doing credit card bonuses
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.400]   where you get miles and points?
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.960]   Yeah. So I just heard, I'm thinking $1,000
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:36.680]   on $30,000 in 60 days is like 20% interest.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:37.160]   So like...
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.600]   Exactly. Exactly.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.120]   That's better than anything you can get.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.840]   I mean, it's like 5% right now in a CD
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.360]   or high yield savings account.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.240]   20% is about as good as it gets.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.760]   And with a lot of these bank bonuses,
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.560]   I see them all the time.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.400]   I get a letter from Chase that says,
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.480]   you know, open up the checking and savings
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.600]   and combined, you're going to get $900.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.560]   The Wells Fargo one right now,
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.920]   I think there is a Wells Fargo $2,500 one right now still.
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.440]   What are the requirements here?
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.200]   Yeah, it varies based on bank bonuses.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.080]   Usually it requires you opening a new account with the bank
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.440]   and not already having an existing account of that type.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.800]   But the way to get around that
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.120]   is once you do one of these bank bonuses,
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.400]   typically within a year,
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.560]   you want to try and cancel that bank bonus
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.560]   so that you can do it again a couple years later.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.640]   These are very repeatable deals.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.000]   A question I often get is like,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.480]   "Aren't you just going to run out of banks?"
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.600]   And the answer is no,
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.080]   because first off, there's a lot of banks in the US.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.240]   But two, you can keep doing these.
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.640]   They have a limitation and it varies again by bank.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.120]   But typically within 12 months to 24 months,
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.880]   you can do the same bonus again
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.240]   if you close the old account.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.280]   Yeah. And unlike credit cards
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.720]   where you have a credit score
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.960]   and banks, one, every time you apply for a credit card,
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.280]   they're adding an inquiry to your credit.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.560]   Every time you're opening an account,
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.920]   they're checking your credit to see,
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.920]   "Oh, how many cards do you have open?"
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.080]   Do any of those things apply here
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.160]   when it comes to opening up a new bank account?
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.440]   Yeah. So banks also have a checks system,
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.600]   which is like credit scores for banks.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:13.320]   Most banks are pretty lenient with your checks record,
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.960]   especially with the more fintech-y app banks
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.240]   that you see nowadays.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.320]   They don't check your checks score at all.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.680]   But the more traditional banks,
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.920]   like a Bank of America or like a Chase,
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.200]   they will pull it.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.080]   For the most part,
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.960]   unless you're opening 20-plus bank accounts
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.920]   in the period of a year,
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.960]   my success rate is very high.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.320]   I rarely get denied.
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.840]   And I have been opening 20-plus bank accounts in a year.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.200]   Okay. So I'm looking at a Doctor of Credit post right now.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.840]   It's best bank account bonuses for May 2024.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.080]   The list goes down.
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:49.320]   There's easily over 150 banks with bonuses.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.280]   And all the way at the bottom,
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.440]   you're down to $100, $400.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.680]   What would you say on average?
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.040]   You said you've opened about 20.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.160]   What's the average return for opening a new bank account?
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.040]   And what would you say is the average requirements to do it?
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.960]   Yeah. So I think it kind of depends
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.440]   on how much effort you're willing to put in,
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.360]   because there's a lot of really easy ones.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.840]   Like you mentioned at the bottom of the list, $100 ones.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.760]   Sometimes those can be really lucrative
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.840]   because it's an app bank
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.400]   that takes two minutes to open on your phone
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.440]   and you get $100 with very minimal requirements.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.360]   And that could just make sense
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.680]   from just the time value of money standpoint.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.080]   But the bigger ones, typically,
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.080]   I try and shoot for ones that are in the 500-plus range
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.560]   because those are the ones coming from the big banks,
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.120]   like Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase, et cetera.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.760]   And those ones are going to require you to deposit
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.360]   anywhere from like $5,000 to $30,000
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.120]   in order to get that bonus.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.200]   And what about moving over your paycheck?
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.200]   I remember when I was helping our au pair
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.480]   open an account at Chase,
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.840]   part of the bonus required
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.520]   that you got a regular direct deposit.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.640]   So it definitely helps if you have an employer
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.280]   that lets you change direct deposit options easily.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.080]   But even if you don't, there are workarounds for that
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.560]   because when they say direct deposit in the requirements,
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.680]   they prefer it to be employer direct deposit.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.520]   And a couple of banks are pretty strict about that.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.120]   But for the most part,
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.760]   any kind of like ACH direct deposit
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.680]   from another of your bank accounts
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.840]   will trigger a lot of these bank bonuses.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.880]   But it can vary.
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.320]   And so that's where a doctor for credit
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.640]   is really kind of like the Bible for this stuff
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.080]   because people post their comments.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.600]   And in the comments, they're going to be like,
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.440]   "Oh, you know, I just moved over money
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.600]   from my Chase account to my Ally account
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.040]   and I got the bonus."
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.560]   Whereas someone else might've been like,
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.480]   "No, this bank really required
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.440]   an employer direct deposit payroll to come through."
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.040]   And that's kind of your filter for it.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.240]   I'm just doing the quick math.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.800]   You said, you shoot for things that are over $500.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.160]   You did about 20 of them.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.280]   That's about $10,000.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.240]   And it lines up a little bit right now.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.080]   I'm looking 2023 at your total.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.920]   It was about $7,500 between you and your player too.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.480]   So this seems pretty lucrative.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.920]   This is a great, great option.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.360]   And opening these accounts doesn't take that much time.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.160]   I will just mention the one cost
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.040]   is depending on where your money is.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.360]   And I don't know if you factor this into your tracker.
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.280]   If you were earning 5% and you dedicate $30,000
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.840]   to moving into different bank accounts for bonuses,
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.560]   you're not earning that 5% anymore.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.360]   So there is a little bit of cost
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.880]   of whatever interest you would have
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.640]   otherwise earned on that account.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.240]   But like you pointed out,
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:34.200]   if you're earning 20% APY equivalent with these bonuses,
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.560]   it's totally worth it.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.120]   Exactly.
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.200]   And I think it's this transition to this thinking of money
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.680]   in terms of keeping it static in one place
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.040]   where it's earning interest
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.760]   or thinking of the monetary gains
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.800]   from the velocity of money moving to different places.
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.400]   So if you keep that money moving
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.400]   and you keep tackling bank bonuses,
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.040]   you're gonna get much higher yields
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.440]   at the cost of time on your part.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.720]   How much time do you wanna spend
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.000]   versus just leaving it parked at Wealthfront for 5.5%.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.360]   Yeah.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.760]   So I'll link to the Doctor of Credit post.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.760]   There's a website called Bank Bonus
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.920]   that I know the guy who started
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.800]   and he set up a page, allthehacks.com/bankbonus
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.320]   that lists out a bunch of them.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.160]   If you use those links, it supports us.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.200]   So if there's anything there that's as good as other deals,
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.800]   by all means, we'd love you to use them.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.600]   If there's not, go to the Doctor of Credit post,
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.800]   go deep in the forums.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.240]   I want everyone to get the best deal,
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.600]   but I'll just share that.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.960]   They do allow you to sort.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.200]   And sometimes, which is really interesting,
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.400]   sometimes they've managed to negotiate exclusive bonuses
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.200]   just for their site that you won't find in other places.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.440]   And I won't get to the nuance of how they do that,
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.720]   but it's pretty interesting.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.880]   So that's banks.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.000]   What about brokerages?
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.160]   I look at last year and your brokerage total was $23,000.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.000]   So brokerages last year was particularly good
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.280]   for a separate reason,
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.640]   which I think we'll get to as well,
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.240]   which is referrals.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.160]   And I had a lot of brokerage referrals
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.440]   because one of the brokerages
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.840]   was offering some crazy referral bonuses.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.480]   But even outside of the referral aspect,
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.200]   I think it was about 10 grand from brokerages.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.280]   And in my opinion,
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.000]   I think brokerages are like the sleeper profitable deals
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.600]   that everyone should be doing,
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.440]   even above like credit cards and banks.
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.480]   Because with brokerages,
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.240]   they pay you bonuses to transfer your stocks
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.240]   over to their brokerage.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.640]   And the stocks, when you're not selling these,
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.400]   they literally move the stocks over.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.960]   So your stocks are still invested in the market,
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.560]   but then the brokerage pays you a cash bonus on top of that.
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.440]   So you can think of that as just an additional yield
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.560]   on your market returns,
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.600]   which anyone giving you a free percent point or two
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.560]   on your market returns.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:43.640]   I mean, that's a no-brainer, right?
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.640]   Right now, the current bonus that Robinhood is offering
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.040]   is 1%.
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.800]   Unlimited, no cap, anything you transfer over.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.880]   And I've moved some brokerage positions
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.720]   around different institutions,
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.240]   not actually for the bonuses.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.160]   I've moved them in the past to qualify
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.480]   for lower mortgage rates or just to consolidate.
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.480]   But I'm looking at this and I'm like,
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.320]   "Wow, my expectation for what I'll return from the market
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.640]   in a given year is probably about 6%, 7%."
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.000]   Obviously, we've had better runs,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.280]   but 1% would be a massive boost.
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.040]   And you probably know better than I do,
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.600]   you do have to keep your positions there longer
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.440]   than about 60 days, right?
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.000]   Exactly.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.720]   They typically require anywhere from six months
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.320]   to two years.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.440]   I think the most recent Robinhood 3% bonus
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.120]   on your retirement funds required a five-year lockup.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.400]   So holding your retirement funds at Robinhood for five years,
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.320]   but in return, they would give you 3% free
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.000]   immediately after you transfer.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.960]   So if you're someone who moved over $500,000
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.560]   to Robinhood from your traditional IRA,
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.760]   that's $15,000 that Robinhood gave you immediately
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:55.640]   just for doing that.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.640]   And it took literally two, three minutes
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.280]   for us to move all of our retirement funds over.
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.000]   I think the thing with Robinhood is people have mixed opinions,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.120]   obviously, with Robinhood.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.920]   And I think that's probably the main reason
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.680]   that some people haven't done it.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.400]   But from a pure profit perspective,
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.720]   it's such an easy deal.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.920]   And it was so lucrative.
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.600]   Sadly, the 3% is gone,
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:20.280]   but they are now still offering 1% on brokerage transfers,
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:24.040]   as well as traditional IRA, any retirement funds, really.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.600]   And I'm looking right now and I hate to bring up deals
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.840]   that'll probably not be around when we publish this.
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.280]   But just to give people an example,
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.160]   the brokerage platform Webull right now,
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.320]   for the next one day and 15 hours,
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.600]   unless they extend it again,
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:41.800]   is offering you 3.5% on all transfers of retirement accounts.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.400]   So Webull and Robinhood have been going
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.080]   head-to-head with their promotions.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.720]   And that's the beauty of all of these deals, really,
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.880]   is that these companies try and outdo each other.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.040]   And this is why things have been escalating over the years.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.000]   But Webull, their one is better than Robinhood.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.360]   The downside is they were paying that 3.5% out
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.200]   over the course of five years,
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.160]   whereas Robinhood was paying that out immediately.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.200]   Yeah. And then clawing it back in the form of
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.960]   if you tried to withdraw more money,
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:08.920]   they would claw it back.
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:13.480]   Yeah. But this isn't limited just to fintech banks, right?
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.960]   I can imagine some people listening or thinking,
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.280]   "Webull, it's not a public company,
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.400]   not a longstanding company.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.600]   I'm not sure I really trust them
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.520]   with all my retirement savings."
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:27.560]   But even like Schwab City, E-Trade, Tasty Trade,
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.560]   all also have brokerage bonuses.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.880]   And so have you seen good brokerage bonuses
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.560]   outside of the fintechs as well?
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.440]   Yeah. So it depends on how you define good.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.120]   I mean, free money is always good.
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.280]   And they're always offering some amount of free money.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:44.200]   And so the issue with them is like the major institutions,
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.200]   they'll give you a nice juicy bonus
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.920]   for moving over like $5,000 or $10,000.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.680]   They'll give you like $100, $200.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.840]   That's a good return on that 10 grand.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.000]   But once you scale up to higher amounts
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.880]   that you can transfer over like a million dollars,
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.440]   it starts to not look as great.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:04.600]   They'll give you $1,000 or $2,000 for moving over a million.
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.120]   And that's not nearly as good
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.600]   as a percentage-based one like Robinhood.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.760]   However, I think these institutions
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:11.640]   are a bit more trusted.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.280]   And I've also heard that if you call in sometimes
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.960]   and you're saying that I will be willing
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.960]   to move over a million dollars,
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.120]   they will often extend you an offer
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.720]   that isn't publicly available
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.640]   because now you're sort of in their
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.640]   private premium client user base.
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.800]   Yeah, that's super interesting.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.000]   Where would you go online to find people's reports of that
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:31.960]   to kind of get some ideas?
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.400]   Is there a doctor of credit comment forum similar?
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.320]   I think doctor of credit definitely.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.480]   Plus, Boggleheads often has discussions around brokerages
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.720]   and people with high net worth will sometimes comment
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.440]   being like, "I got offered a better one over the phone."
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.760]   They're not really publicly displayed.
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.480]   Some of the more public "private client" ones
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.560]   are ones that you can find online like with Chase.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.480]   They have a private client program.
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.440]   I think that gives you up to $3,500
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.520]   if you move over like a million dollars.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.960]   So definitely in the high net worth kind of a category.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.920]   Yeah, I'm looking at the tasty trade bonus right now.
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:11.080]   And at $100,000 moved over, you're gonna get $2,000.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.080]   So it's still a 2% return.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.160]   It basically looks like it's about 2%
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.680]   up until that threshold.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.280]   And then it scales back down to half a percent.
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.360]   But I don't think you have to leave things there
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.800]   for 2 years like you did for the Robinhood deal, right?
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:29.480]   So is it important to also compare the time horizon?
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.600]   Robinhood might give you 1%.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.240]   Someone else might give you half a percent,
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.600]   but in a shorter period of time.
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.120]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.160]   And I think that, again,
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.040]   comes down to sort of just like where you fall
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.520]   in how hard you want to go with these things.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.880]   Like one of the attractive parts
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.040]   about leaving your money with Robinhood for 5 years
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.200]   is you don't have to tackle any other brokerage bonuses
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:48.920]   for 5 years.
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.280]   They pay it up immediately
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.200]   and you don't have to worry about it.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.320]   Whereas if you're someone who wants to maximize things,
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.680]   yeah, it's gonna be more profitable
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.400]   to move over every 6 months, every year
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.560]   to a different brokerage and get another bonus.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.400]   And you may, over the course of 5 years,
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.360]   end up making more than what Robinhood's 3%
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.400]   was gonna pay you.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.640]   But that requires you to do that work
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.560]   and that takes time and energy.
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.120]   And maybe that's for you and maybe it isn't.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.920]   Yeah. I'm looking right now at this tasty trade one.
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.840]   If you could find 5 brokerages
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.760]   that would offer you $2,000 to transfer over $100,000,
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.800]   over 5 years, you'd make $10,000.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.840]   Whereas in Robinhood, you might only make $3,500.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.160]   But you don't have to think about it.
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.600]   Exactly. Exactly.
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.040]   And yeah, everything just comes down
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.400]   to how much effort you want to put in
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.640]   because there's literally an endless supply
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.080]   of these profitable deals.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.680]   And so it's so important going in
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.600]   to figure out what are my goals here?
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.720]   How much money do I need to make from this
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.520]   for me to feel good about it as a side hustle
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.920]   or for me to book this vacation that I want to do
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.080]   or whatever your scenario is.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:53.960]   Yeah. I love it.
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.120]   So okay. So if you have money,
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.480]   obviously one of the challenges here
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.200]   is if you don't have a huge portfolio of stocks,
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.320]   it's really hard to take advantage
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.600]   of these brokerage bonuses.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.240]   On the bank bonus side, for the most part,
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.080]   you mentioned some up to $30,000
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.560]   but there are plenty of bank bonuses under there.
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.680]   Let's move out of the deposit accounts,
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.280]   banks and brokerages and talk about
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.760]   other profitable deals you can find.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.160]   And I think a fun one is talking about meal kits.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.080]   Yeah. Meal kits.
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:25.560]   I stumbled into this during the pandemic, basically,
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.320]   because we're all getting our food delivered.
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:30.760]   And it turns out there's a lot of meal kit companies.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.480]   And these meal kit companies are fighting really hard
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.040]   for you to use their meal kit service.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.800]   And for you to do that,
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:38.680]   they're trying to attract you
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.360]   with these promotions of,
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.880]   "Hey, come join us and we'll give you the first box free
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.200]   and a discount on later boxes."
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.160]   I think the mistake people make with meal kits is that,
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.120]   because I think at this point,
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.280]   we've pretty much all tried a meal kit.
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.080]   But the mistake is that you keep the meal kit
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.920]   past the first box.
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.640]   And what I mean by that is the first box discount
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.600]   is usually the box that you're going to get for free.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.120]   All the other discounts,
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.480]   sometimes you'll see blue apron,
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.440]   here's $200 off the next eight boxes.
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.680]   The discount keeps scaling down and down
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.120]   as these boxes progress.
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.360]   The first box though, is typically free.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.600]   And so you want to just join for the first box
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.640]   and then cancel.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.840]   And then once you cancel,
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.240]   they start sending you mailers being like,
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.440]   "Hey, come back."
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.080]   And the mailers are often also quite lucrative.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.720]   So it's this cycle where you need to do the first box,
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.320]   cancel and just repeat that
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.680]   and keep doing the signup offers
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.960]   that they keep sending you
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.960]   and spread that across different meal kits.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.160]   And next thing you know,
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.800]   you could just live off of meal kits entirely,
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:38.680]   which is what we did.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.160]   I think we did over a thousand meal kit meals
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.600]   over the course of like three years during COVID.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.200]   And paid about how much of them?
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.560]   I think typically,
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.280]   sometimes they'll charge you a shipping fee of like $10,
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.280]   but sometimes they even waive that.
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.640]   So for the most part,
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.600]   they were free or $10 per box.
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:57.720]   Wow.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.280]   Okay, so you've saved a ton of money on groceries.
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:02.040]   Any favorites in the meal kit camp?
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.640]   Absolutely.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.240]   We've tried pretty much all of them
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.280]   under the sun at this point.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.400]   HelloFresh.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.760]   I think has the best offers to taste ratio.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.040]   They have pretty decent like meals that you can pick
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.320]   and their offers are really good.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.480]   Their comeback offers are particularly good.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.000]   Green Chef as well.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.600]   I think they're owned by the same company.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.120]   If you like more vegan food,
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.120]   Green Chef has amazing meals.
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.360]   They're a little pricier than HelloFresh,
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.320]   but it doesn't really matter if your first box is free.
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.160]   And then the most recent one
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.040]   that we've kind of stumbled on is Marley Spoon,
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.720]   which is I believe being sponsored by Martha Stewart.
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.800]   The meals are really, really good.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.040]   It's like equivalent to going to a farmer's market
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.200]   and buying a box of food,
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.480]   like box of like potatoes
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.240]   and all of this like fresh ingredients
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.200]   that comes in the box.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.960]   They're not even individually packaged.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.320]   It's literally just a box of like vegetables and meat.
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.440]   And then you cook the recipes
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.880]   and they're like Martha Stewart quality.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.160]   You know, they're really good.
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:57.640]   I love it.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.160]   Yeah, so I'm one of the people
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.760]   who did not do the proposed path you chose.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.040]   We signed up for Green Chef
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:07.000]   and we've just been paying full price each week.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   Now I will say it's so easy
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.240]   that each week three of our meals come in the mail.
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.440]   We never have to think about it.
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.840]   Some weeks we don't even pick the meals
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.320]   and like their default selection has been good
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.680]   for people who've listened for a while.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.760]   You know, we partnered with Green Chef for a while.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:25.640]   We still to this day get a Green Chef box each week.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.920]   But what we're not doing well is trying other things out,
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:32.520]   you know, and seeing what kinds of better deals we can get.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:33.400]   So what I'm going to do,
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.600]   I'm going to get you to share whatever the best deals are
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.680]   out there right now for new customers.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.520]   And I'll just find a link for each of those
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:41.800]   and put them in the show notes
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.560]   so people can go and get started.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.200]   And then it's on you guys to do the retention offers
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.360]   and kind of cancel and wait and see what they mail you.
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:52.360]   So I love that you've cooked a thousand meals
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.080]   for what I'm going to say is probably pennies per meal.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:59.320]   Yeah, it's like sometimes I read the lean fire forums
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.560]   where people make fun of lean fire,
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.880]   like, you know, retiring early with a limited budget
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.800]   because you're like, you're going to just be eating
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.080]   rice and beans and all this stuff.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.680]   And I'm like, yeah, that's true.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.080]   If you haven't discovered deals,
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.160]   you know, you could be traveling extravagantly.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.960]   You can be eating meals that as good as restaurant quality.
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.560]   You just have to cook them yourself
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.320]   for less than a dollar per meal.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.400]   So there's just so many hacks that you can do
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.560]   to kind of supplement your income that way.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.120]   Love it.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.160]   What about cell phones?
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.000]   Yeah, cell phones.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.280]   Cell phones is an interesting one
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.040]   because I feel like a lot of us
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:33.240]   have this weird preference for like Verizon,
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.880]   AT&T is like the big carriers
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.480]   and they've really sold us on the idea
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:41.240]   that like it's worth paying $150 or $200
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.480]   for two people per month on one of these carriers.
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:44.280]   And we were those people.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.080]   We were paying almost $200 a month on Verizon
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.200]   because we'd grandfathered
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.280]   into their like unlimited data plan
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.480]   and I didn't want to get rid of it.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.280]   Cause I'm like, what if I needed unlimited 5G data,
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.720]   which I never did.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.960]   And eventually we were like, you know,
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.960]   let's try some of these smaller carriers,
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.320]   these MVNOs, you know,
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.080]   these sub-carriers to the big carriers
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.240]   like Mint and Visible.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.240]   And they have amazing deals,
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.840]   particularly during Black Friday
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.160]   where you can get cell phone service
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:14.280]   for as low as like $10 a person.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:17.800]   And you also get deals on the cell phones themselves.
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.400]   So with these cell phone deals,
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.600]   it's kind of twofold.
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:24.680]   Like, are you looking to get a brand new iPhone 15 Pro
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.040]   for basically free?
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.720]   Like you just want to upgrade your phone
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.600]   or do you want to save money on your cell phone plan?
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.600]   Like literally save thousands of dollars a year
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.640]   on your cell phone plan.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.160]   You can do both or either.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.600]   And the kind of deal you tackle
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.600]   depends on what's your priority there.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.480]   Yeah. So for anyone not familiar,
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.280]   so one, I did an episode 138 on cell phone plans.
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.920]   I went pretty deep on some kind of some nerdy stuff,
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.680]   but also how a lot of this works.
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.160]   And all these MVNOs are just the same carrier, right?
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.280]   So if you're on Mint Mobile,
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.560]   you're just using T-Mobile's network.
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.960]   If you're on Visible, you're using Verizon's network.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.800]   There's some nuance to how you're,
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.640]   you might not have the same priority
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.800]   if you're kind of at a major sporting event
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.480]   or concert or something like that.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:07.000]   But for the most part, it's pretty comparable.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.120]   What are some of the requirements here
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.480]   that people should be thinking about?
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.320]   Is it wait till November?
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.480]   Can you do this throughout the year?
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.120]   Are there, you know,
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.560]   what if you need a cell phone right now
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:18.680]   and you're under contract?
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:19.640]   What are some of the options?
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.920]   Yeah. So Black Friday definitely
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.720]   is gonna be the best time for you to
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:29.160]   either buy a new cell phone or switch cell phone plans.
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.000]   You can do it at other times during the year.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.040]   You can also time it with when a new iPhone is released.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.800]   Typically, everyone does sales
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.240]   when a new iPhone is released.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.400]   But that also typically lines up with Black Friday
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.600]   'cause Apple usually does iPhone releases in September.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:46.920]   So I would wait would be my advice there.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.280]   You can do some deals where like,
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:54.040]   for example, Costco used to have a T-Mobile stand
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:57.000]   where you could get $800 back
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.560]   if you buy an iPhone and sign up
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.400]   at the Costco stand with T-Mobile.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.720]   And T-Mobile doesn't have any contracts.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.440]   So you could just sign up, buy the iPhone,
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.360]   get $800 back from T-Mobile,
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.560]   which takes two, three months.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.400]   You're paying two, three months of T-Mobile.
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.760]   And then you just cancel T-Mobile
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.600]   and move to whichever carrier you want.
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.960]   And they've basically given you $800 for free.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.760]   If cell phone service is the cheaper thing,
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:24.360]   then Mint, I think they do a buy three months,
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.600]   get three months free around Black Friday.
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.760]   But even without that, if you pay for a year,
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:33.000]   I think it is like $10 per line for five gigabytes of data,
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.120]   $15 per line, I think for 15 gigabytes of data.
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.640]   So that's the difference too,
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.840]   is that it's not like the shift is away
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:44.680]   from "unlimited data" with Verizon.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.600]   But if you just examine your cell phone bill,
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.760]   I think it's going to be pretty surprising
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.600]   how little data you actually use
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.360]   compared to how much you think you might need
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.720]   from an unlimited plan.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.280]   So just gearing towards a data allotment
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.800]   that makes sense for you and your family,
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:01.080]   I think is a better approach than paying $100
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.200]   for an unlimited plan
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.920]   that you're not really fully maximizing anyway.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.480]   And as someone who had one of those overpriced,
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.320]   kind of big carrier unlimited plans,
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:12.600]   where are you now in terms of which carrier?
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.200]   And what are you seeing?
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.840]   Are you noticing any difference in quality?
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.080]   - Yeah, so we're with Mint.
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.400]   I love Mint, by the way, because it's so cheap
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.680]   and it's part of T-Mobile
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.160]   and T-Mobile in our area works quite well.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.440]   The only complaints really,
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.520]   I think you mentioned this earlier with MVMNOs,
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.920]   is if you're in a big city with a lot of congestion
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.440]   or you're going to these events,
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.200]   that's when you have lower data priority
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.200]   and it kind of affects how quickly
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.880]   you can pull up websites.
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:41.320]   But outside of that, it really has made
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.360]   no noticeable impact on my life to be on Mint
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.680]   versus being on a premium Verizon plan.
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.640]   - I love it.
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:52.200]   Yeah, I mean, we switched some lines to Mint
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.880]   and some lines to T-Mobile.
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.560]   And it's been fantastic.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.800]   T-Mobile, I would say has the better
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.680]   bring a line over and get a cheap phone.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.360]   And Mint has the better pricing.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.680]   And so we partnered with Mint on the show.
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.200]   So if you're going to switch to Mint,
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.800]   allthehacks.com/mintmobile.
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.760]   Are there any requirements for some of these carriers
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.240]   that have these great deals to get new phones
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.000]   that might be relevant,
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.440]   things people need to do in advance?
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:21.000]   - Yeah, often they will require you to port over a number
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.080]   from a "real carrier".
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.640]   They don't want to see you port over a number
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.160]   from like Google Voice.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.800]   But a real carrier where you're paying a monthly bill,
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.480]   if you port a number over,
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:34.040]   that's how you're eligible for some of the free phone deals,
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.480]   like on Visible, for example.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.680]   But it's pretty easy to just get a free number
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.080]   if you don't want to move over your main line.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.760]   If your goal is just to get an iPhone
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.040]   and you're pretty happy with,
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.720]   let's say being on Verizon,
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.040]   but you really want to do this Visible deal
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.960]   that gives you a bunch of money off an iPhone
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.840]   and they require you to port over a number,
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.920]   what you could do is you could just go to Target
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.880]   and buy a SIM card for like $1, $5.
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:01.400]   And that will get you on a "real cell phone plan".
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.000]   And then you just port that over to Visible
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.120]   to get the offer so that you can get the cheaper iPhone.
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.600]   And you never have to leave your main carrier.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.600]   So for those that are concerned about like,
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.680]   "This is the line I use for everything.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.760]   I don't want to be moving that constantly."
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.760]   You don't have to do these deals,
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.240]   but you do have to do an extra step in that process
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.240]   to activate some of these workarounds.
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.080]   I love that you can save on cell phones.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.240]   I went deep on that episode a few months back.
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.440]   What about other kinds of discounts and freebies?
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.840]   Yeah, that's a big category actually each month
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:35.320]   because I'm a person that likes scrolling slick deals.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.920]   So if you use slick deals,
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.200]   there is an infinite supply of discounts and freebies
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.720]   every month that you can do.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.520]   And I wouldn't recommend people necessarily go do that.
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.680]   It's more if you're already inclined to be like,
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.360]   "Hey, it'd be cool to get a free burger."
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:51.240]   Or like, "I want to know that Starbucks on some Fridays,
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.880]   you can get a free Starbucks if you buy one of their drinks."
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.880]   You know, those are the kind of like the scale
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.160]   of some of those deals.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.600]   But on a bigger scale,
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.520]   I think something that everyone should do
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.040]   with discounts and freebies
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:06.600]   is at least download and use a cashback portal extension.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.960]   A really easy one, a very reliable one is Rakuten.
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.640]   Just install that on your browser
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.080]   and you will get cash back
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.760]   when you're just shopping organically.
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.760]   There's no additional effort needed.
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:20.360]   And Rakuten constantly runs sales during holiday weekends
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.120]   where they increase the cashback amount.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.040]   So Memorial Day just passed.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.600]   Every Memorial Day, they increase the cashback for everything.
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:30.040]   So like PetSmart, where we buy all of our pet food,
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.920]   they were going up to 20% cashback,
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:36.600]   which is 20% back basically on all the pet food you buy.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:40.920]   And you can buy PetSmart gift cards at a 10% discount elsewhere.
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.800]   And PetSmart has like an auto ship program
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:46.760]   where they'll give you 20 bucks off of your auto ship.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:50.600]   And so you end up saving over 50% on anything you buy at PetSmart.
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.680]   And that's just an example of one retailer,
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:55.080]   but it applies across many different ones
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:58.280]   where Rakuten really just juices up the returns
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.600]   on things that you're going to shop for anyway.
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.240]   Yeah. And there's kind of 2 double bonuses
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.360]   I'll mention on Rakuten.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:07.000]   One, if you get a referral,
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.760]   depending on the time of the year,
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.920]   they always switch their referral program.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:13.400]   Sometimes it's $30, sometimes it's an extra 10%,
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.000]   and sometimes it's $40.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.680]   And so you'll get a $40 referral and someone else
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.440]   and whoever referred you will.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:25.960]   And so right now, I'm not sure what the referee gets right now,
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.880]   but I just looked at my referral link
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.840]   and you get an extra 10% cash back right now.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:34.120]   But I would say if you can sign up during one of those windows
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:37.720]   where it's an extra $40, it's an awesome boost.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:38.120]   So...
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.440]   Exactly. Those windows happen all the time.
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:41.480]   All the time. Yeah.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.360]   Usually, whenever there's a $40 boost,
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.800]   I'll put it in the newsletter.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.400]   So keep an eye out there
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:51.560]   or just keep refreshing allthehacks.com/rakuten,
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:52.840]   which is just my referral link.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.600]   And you'll see when that happens.
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.560]   The other thing is if you do have an Amex account,
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:00.520]   you can link Rakuten with your Membership Rewards account.
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:05.080]   And instead of earning $10 cash back, you'll earn 1000 points.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:08.280]   And so depending on how you value Amex points,
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:11.560]   hopefully it's more than a penny a point,
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:15.080]   then you'll actually be getting an even better return from Rakuten
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.200]   because you can earn points.
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.280]   Exactly. Exactly.
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.400]   And we like to get cash back just because one of our priorities
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:25.560]   is to have more of a financial cash buffer for the fire thing.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:30.600]   But I know a lot of people that go the Amex route instead with their points.
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:34.520]   Well, I mentioned in a points versus cash back episode,
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:38.840]   were you to open the Schwab Platinum card,
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:43.160]   then you could still convert those points to cash back for a bonus 10%.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.280]   Exactly.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.000]   Because they're worthwhile.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.440]   I've just been stuck in Amex pop-up jail on that card for a long time
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.680]   where they don't give you the signup bonus for it
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.640]   because I've opened too many Amex cards with them.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.560]   But if you're willing to forego that bonus,
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:01.960]   you can still get past the pop-up and still get the 1.1%.
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.160]   So that is on my list to do.
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.360]   That's a good reminder.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:04.860]   Yeah.
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.560]   What are some other fun discounts and freebies?
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.880]   I know for the last almost 2 months,
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.640]   there's been a great Shake Shack deal
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.640]   where you could get free food every once a week.
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:15.000]   Exactly.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.320]   And even just like this weekend,
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.240]   we went and got free burgers at Wendy's
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.400]   because it was National Hamburger Day.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.560]   And before that, it was National Cheeseburger Day.
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.240]   And then Shake Shack was doing some...
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.000]   I think March Madness promo.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.720]   I mean, literally every week, every day,
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:32.360]   there's something in the discounts and freebies land
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.720]   if you just go on Slick Deals.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.520]   I mean, guaranteed, even if you just go right now,
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:38.440]   you're going to see something that you can get for free.
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:43.080]   And I went to Slick Deals and I just went to it right now.
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.760]   And there's just so much stuff that I don't need.
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:50.200]   It just seems like you could get lost scrolling indefinitely.
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:55.400]   I just scrolled like 7 pages down and I'm barely through today.
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:37:01.240]   Yeah, that is the curse, I think, of this endeavor
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:03.720]   is that there's this constant FOMO of things
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.520]   that you could be doing because there are so many things.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:09.080]   And then it's like, how do you filter out the ones that matter to you?
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.240]   At least with Slick Deals, you can set up alerts.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:13.080]   So I would definitely recommend doing that.
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.120]   On my end, both my wife and I,
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:17.960]   instead of scrolling social media,
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:19.720]   going on Instagram and scrolling that,
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:23.240]   we get our dopamine hits scrolling Slick Deals and Doctor of Credit.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:27.080]   That's sort of like my bathroom activity is I just scroll that.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:29.720]   For me, it's like the same kind of dopamine.
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:32.120]   You're scrolling a thing, you get the same reward system,
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:35.560]   but you also have the potential of making money through discounts
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:38.200]   or with Doctor of Credit, just far bigger deals.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:45.560]   And so, yeah, it's just my substitute for playing crosswords is I scroll deals
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:48.840]   and then I record a podcast episode on the deals that I do.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.040]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.640]   So here's one thing I'm going to start doing.
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:54.440]   I'm at least going to start scrolling these deals.
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:58.440]   And we sent a newsletter out on Saturdays.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.160]   I'm going to start posting deals that are relevant.
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.160]   We already do this in the newsletter.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.680]   We got a section for latest deals.
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.280]   I'm just going to spend a little bit more time
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.360]   for the next month or two scrolling for deals.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:12.520]   So all the hacks.com/emails, the newsletter, it's free to subscribe.
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:15.000]   I'll start sharing some deals as I find them.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.880]   And let me know if you find that valuable if you're listening.
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.360]   So I think there's a couple categories left.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:26.520]   And one of them, I thought for a moment, I was like, "Let's not go too deep on it."
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:29.960]   It was credit cards because we could talk at length about,
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:33.480]   "Oh, sign up for credit cards, get welcome bonuses, earn points and miles."
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:36.600]   And we've certainly covered that topic on the show.
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:40.680]   But there was one particular thing that you did that made me realize that
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.240]   you're playing this game a little bit differently.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.760]   And you talked about opening up a few US bank credit cards.
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:50.760]   Talk about that and how you generally think about credit cards and earning points.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:55.880]   Yeah, I think the difference, the different way we think about credit card points
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:00.760]   is that a lot of people think of it as what card should I open
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:04.680]   that gives me the best percentage rate on my regular spending?
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.160]   You know, am I getting 3% or 4% back?
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:11.640]   With us, we take a different approach, which is every dollar that we spend,
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:16.280]   ideally, is going to be put on a credit card where we're earning a signup bonus.
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:21.800]   Because the signup bonuses are far, far larger than the percentage that you'd get
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.760]   just through your usual spend without a bonus.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:30.360]   Because these signup bonuses are like, "Hey, spend $5,000, get let's say $500 back."
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:35.720]   That's a 10% return, which is three times higher than any other cashback that you'd get
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:36.760]   just through regular spend.
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:41.640]   And so, we try and focus on opening cards and always having a card open
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:43.960]   that has a minimum spend going on.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:49.480]   And with the U.S. bank cards recently, they increased their signup offers by quite a bit.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:53.160]   And so, I needed more cards to do the minimum spend on.
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:56.040]   And we ended up opening, I think, three of those.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.040]   We applied for three of them in a single day.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.880]   And all three of them ended up getting approved.
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:03.000]   I think you could have actually applied for four of them in a single day.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.760]   I just forgot about one of the cards.
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:07.160]   That's the only reason why we didn't get four at a time.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:09.400]   But yeah, we're constantly opening new credit cards.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:10.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:14.680]   And so, you could take it even further because one of the cool things about
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:18.600]   a lot of these U.S. bank cards was one, they were business cards.
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.520]   So, they don't show up on your credit report.
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:24.600]   So, they're not going to impact your ability to get other cards, at least from other issuers.
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:27.160]   They might impact your ability within U.S. bank.
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:31.400]   And they only hit your credit once for four cards.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:37.160]   So, the only real impact doing four instead of one would potentially have
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:40.280]   is your ability to get another U.S. bank card in the future.
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.160]   Is that probably fair?
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:42.440]   Exactly.
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:45.480]   And even then, they're pretty lenient.
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:49.000]   And again, this varies wildly between different card issuers.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.960]   But U.S. bank will even let you have the same card
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.920]   multiple times and get the same bonus multiple times.
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.520]   They don't necessarily advertise that.
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.240]   But in practice, that is what you can do.
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:03.480]   And yeah, they will combine your hard inquiries into one inquiry,
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.920]   if you do them all on the same day.
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:08.760]   So, the cost of doing four applications versus doing one application,
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:12.680]   there is no cost, other than the fact that now you have four cards
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:17.320]   that you need to meet minimum spend for, which could be challenging
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.960]   if you don't have other ways of generating
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.200]   that amount of spend in the course of three months.
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:25.480]   But what were the bonuses, for example?
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:27.400]   Because I know a lot of times people feel like
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.800]   cashback bonuses aren't that exciting.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.560]   No, they're pretty exciting.
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:39.720]   I think the U.S. bank leverage card was $900 for spending $7,500 in three or four months.
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:42.760]   So, U.S. bank actually gives you a longer time frame, depending on the card.
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:44.840]   It goes from three, four, five, even six months.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:52.360]   Triple cash, I think, gave $600 for spending $4,500 in four months.
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:56.280]   I may be butchering the time frames, but you kind of get the rough idea where
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:00.520]   it's at least a 10% spend to bonus ratio.
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:03.960]   Yeah. And so opening four cards and hitting the minimum spend
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:05.960]   probably netted you a few thousand dollars.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.480]   Yeah, it was about $2,000.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:14.760]   Just over $2,000 worth of bonuses, provided I could spend about $20,000.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:18.760]   We'll come back to the "spend $20,000" because
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:21.400]   I know that as someone in the middle of financial independence,
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:25.080]   you're not just spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a year
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:27.400]   of your own money and buying things you don't need.
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:32.120]   But I know a fear a lot of people have is just opening up too many cards.
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.120]   It just doesn't work and now you're stuck.
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:36.840]   And then you actually find a card you want and you can't get it.
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:40.680]   How many cards would you say you've opened up in the last 12 months?
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.000]   Yeah, let's see here.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.240]   I think I tallied it before.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:47.160]   It was definitely over 30.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:50.680]   I think around 35 cards between myself and my wife.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:56.920]   And after 30, you were still getting approved for those other five.
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:59.560]   So I think a common misconception is that
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:03.960]   there's a cap that is much smaller than most people
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:06.040]   think about the number of cards they can open.
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.600]   So I think this could be a whole episode.
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:09.560]   And so I'm actually...
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:12.360]   Maybe you can come back and we could do it together.
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:16.440]   But thinking about what are all the card application rules?
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:20.120]   How do you want to sequence things if you want to open up multiple cards?
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.840]   And then the follow-up, which we can talk a little bit about today,
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:28.600]   is how do you generate the spend so that you're not stuck having to spend the money?
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:28.840]   Right?
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:30.680]   If you opened up 35 cards,
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:37.480]   let's say on average, they had a $7,000 minimum spend to get the bonus.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:39.080]   We're talking about $245,000.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:42.920]   I know that you don't spend $245,000 a year
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.720]   because we've talked about your fire lifestyle.
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:47.800]   It's probably a fraction of that.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:49.160]   How do you think about that?
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.800]   Yeah, I think that's what trips a lot of people up to
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.320]   when they're pursuing these cards,
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:58.280]   is they feel like it's limited by how much income and how much expenses they have.
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:04.600]   There are so many avenues for just generating that spend to meet the bonuses
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:08.840]   that you may not initially think of, but are pretty obvious in hindsight.
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:11.240]   Let's just go through them at a high level right now,
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:16.920]   just because I think it's really important for people to understand where this comes from.
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:20.360]   And then I think it would make sense to do a deeper dive on the topic.
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:23.560]   So stay tuned for an episode on a much deeper dive
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.960]   on welcome bonuses and meeting minimum spend.
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:31.240]   So the high level ways, I think the most obvious one,
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:32.600]   let's start with paying taxes,
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:34.840]   because I think you've mentioned that before as well in your show,
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:39.080]   where you can pay your taxes using a credit card at the cost of,
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:43.880]   I believe it's like 1.8% to use one of their credit card processors.
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.360]   And so if you have taxes to pay,
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:47.880]   definitely should be putting it on the credit card
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:53.560]   because the 1.8% cost is a fraction of the 10% or 20% return
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.880]   you're getting through the signup bonuses.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:58.280]   Yeah, I think that's something that was interesting
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:01.240]   as I was talking about paying taxes on a credit card in the past was,
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:05.240]   if you look at it through the perspective of using a credit card
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:09.640]   and paying taxes to earn points, not a welcome bonus,
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:13.240]   you're like, "Well, VentureX card is going to give you 2x points,
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:16.920]   but you're going to pay 1.8 cents for every point you earn.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.480]   So maybe if you get enough value from your points,
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:22.760]   you're earning on the margin, but is that really great?"
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:26.760]   When I looked at the top welcome bonuses a few weeks ago
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.320]   for the points versus cash back episode,
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:32.920]   the average return was 16 points per dollar.
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:38.840]   So if you're earning 16 points per dollar and paying 1.8 cents for them,
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:44.040]   or like you've done with some of these earning 10% or 15% cash back,
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:47.240]   paying 1.8 cents for every 15 cents,
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.720]   well, you could do the math there and say that's a really good deal.
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:53.880]   And so as long as you're paying taxes to earn these welcome bonuses,
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:55.880]   it seems like a no-brainer.
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:46:00.440]   Absolutely. Yeah, it's such an easy thing that anyone can do.
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:04.920]   And the thing with the IRS too is if you end up overpaying your taxes,
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.760]   they will refund you the money.
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.800]   And so keep in mind though, they will be keeping your money
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.720]   until the tax filing deadline.
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:14.920]   But that's also an option too, because you can pay quarterly taxes.
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:17.640]   And I think there's three different processors you can use.
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:20.200]   So you can pay your quarterly taxes through three of them.
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.760]   If you end up overpaying because you need to spend,
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.560]   you'll get the money back during the tax refund season.
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:30.200]   Yeah, you can even go into your employer and potentially reduce your withholdings
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:34.120]   so that you're able to have more money that you put on a card
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:36.440]   that doesn't actually need to be refunded.
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:39.800]   So you actually get more paycheck back each pay period
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.720]   and then make those payments to the IRS.
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:43.240]   Now, you got to keep managing it.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:46.520]   It's going to make your tax filings a little more complicated,
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.040]   but not that much more complicated.
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:51.960]   So taxes is an easy one, as long as you're going for welcome bonuses.
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:54.440]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:57.400]   And then outside of taxes, it's an easy one,
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:02.200]   but it's not my preference because of the 1.8% fee.
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:05.800]   It's a small fee, but I would rather not pay it.
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:07.880]   And so there's other avenues as well.
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:12.840]   The ones that come to the top of my mind are like funding a bank account,
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:14.920]   buying groups, gift card reselling.
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:16.920]   So we can dive into any of those if you'd like.
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:19.720]   Yeah, maybe let's just give a quick overview of a few of them.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:26.120]   The best way to think about a buying group is like a reselling business almost.
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:29.960]   You know, if your friend wants an iPad and you buy the iPad,
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.680]   then you give him the iPad and he pays you for the iPad.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:38.760]   You basically generated $1,000 of spend at no cost to you
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:40.200]   because your friend reimbursed you.
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:42.680]   And so if you scale that higher than just your friend,
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:48.200]   there are companies that just want to buy iPads and other goods from you
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:51.560]   because they're limited to how many of these iPads they can buy.
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:54.520]   Using iPads just as a generic example here,
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:59.400]   but like you typically can't buy more than like four of them at a time on Amazon
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:04.280]   when they get released because Amazon doesn't want to sell directly to these resellers.
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:08.280]   But a reseller might want to ship like a thousand of these iPads to Dubai
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:10.200]   where the iPad hasn't been released yet.
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:14.120]   And so they source people like you and I to buy these iPads for them
[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:15.720]   and they reimburse you for it.
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:19.800]   And the advantage for you is that they're paying usually at cost.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:23.000]   So if the iPad costs $1,000, they'll reimburse you $1,000.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.040]   But if you're putting it on a credit card that earns 4% then or 5% on Amazon,
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:32.440]   you're essentially making a 5% profit on all of the things that you're buying through there.
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:36.200]   Plus, if you're trying to meet a minimum spend, that's even more lucrative on top.
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:40.680]   Yeah. And depending on where you live in the country, this can be an even better deal.
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:45.800]   If you live in states with no sales tax, it can be even more lucrative.
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:50.600]   I had the, I guess, pleasure of going to one of these buyer group warehouses
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:54.280]   from a company called Max Out Deals and I walked through it and it was wild.
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:56.280]   Like if you're watching on YouTube, I'll put a picture up
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:59.720]   or I'll at least link to it in the show notes on the podcast as well.
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:04.600]   It's like you're walking in the storeroom of either like a Best Buy or an Apple store
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:07.960]   and there are just thousands and thousands of products
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:09.880]   that are getting geared up to ship out.
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.760]   And so this warehouse was right next to the LAX airport,
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:15.800]   presumably because it's really easy to ship things out.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:19.720]   It's a low cost industrial part of town with a ridiculous amount of security.
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:22.280]   And so I tried this once, right?
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:24.520]   I went into the buyer's group site.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:26.120]   They were looking for AirPods.
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:28.920]   I bought some AirPods while they were on sale at Costco.
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:32.280]   I shipped them to the buyer's group warehouse.
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:37.000]   And about a couple weeks later, they sent me some money.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.800]   And I didn't make any money, but I didn't lose any money.
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:44.200]   So I think the profit, and if there was a profit, it was like incredibly small.
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:47.000]   But I got all the points from the purchase.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:52.120]   And so especially if you have a card like the Amex Business Gold card,
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:55.800]   where you can get some elevated points from electronic stores, I think.
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:59.720]   Or if you're buying on Amazon, and you're using Amazon Prime card,
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:05.560]   there are some options to get anywhere from 2-4 points and 2-5% cash back,
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:07.800]   and then sell something at cost.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:10.360]   So you're making a little bit of profit and getting all the points.
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:11.800]   Exactly.
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:12.360]   Exactly.
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:16.120]   And even better when you have a minimum spend that you're tackling with a credit card.
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:18.520]   I think one thing I want to caveat to with the buyer's group
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:22.360]   or that comes up when I introduce my friends to the concept
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:26.280]   is the more savvy ones are like, "Do you have to pay taxes on this?
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:29.640]   Because you're buying and they're paying you out money."
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:33.480]   And the short answer, unless you're in a couple of very specific states,
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:38.680]   you don't, because you're not, again, making actual profit on these shipments.
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:41.560]   Because you're shipping direct to the buyer's group.
[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:43.640]   It's not even often coming to your home first.
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.400]   You just enter their address.
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:48.440]   And some of these buyer's group, I think like Buy For Me Retail,
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:49.960]   which is a really popular one.
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:53.400]   They've got like four or five different locations across the U.S.
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:55.080]   in no-sales tax states.
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:57.000]   And you just ship directly over there.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.720]   And you don't owe anything from a tax perspective because you didn't make a profit.
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:04.440]   What you made a profit on were your points.
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:07.720]   And the points, as the IRS have ruled, are not taxable.
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:09.640]   So it doesn't end up impacting you.
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:12.360]   Unless I think you're in like Washington state or some other one
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:15.560]   where they are trying to tax every kind of sale.
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:19.560]   It's a little complicated, but just try not to be in one of those states if you're doing it.
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:22.200]   I was listening to another podcast.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:24.440]   I think it was either Churning Life or Churner's Digest.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:28.360]   And you can see where this goes to an extreme.
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:34.040]   And the host was talking about how he ordered something like 200 Amazon Echo Dots
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:38.200]   and loaded them in his car to try to go take them to the warehouse.
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:42.920]   And I was just like, at some point, it felt to me like maybe this was too far.
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:47.800]   But I think that it's basically his full-time...
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.080]   Felt like it was his full-time job.
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:51.400]   So you can choose how far you want to take this.
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:57.160]   Do you want to get a sign-up bonus around a season where new iPads or iPhones are coming out
[00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:01.240]   and be able to meet that minimum spend easily and do that once or twice a year?
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:06.920]   Or do you want to be driving to a warehouse in Oregon three times a week,
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:14.760]   filling your car with iPads, Echo Dots, Fire Sticks, and whatever other products are hot for resellers?
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:15.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:20.200]   And fundamentally, I think that's sort of just how this whole game is.
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:23.800]   Is that it's a broad spectrum of how much effort you want to put into it.
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:27.320]   And at the high end of the spectrum, where you want to put a lot of effort,
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:31.480]   it really is just a full-time job where you're starting pretty much a real business,
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:33.000]   like a reselling business.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.440]   Legitimately, people start reselling businesses on Amazon,
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:40.520]   not to make money on Amazon, but to just be able to generate spend
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:44.360]   buying the stuff so that they can then resell on Amazon to recoup the cost.
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:49.800]   So it's really just like, how much of an investment do you want to make into your side hustle?
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:52.920]   And do you want it to become a full-time business?
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:53:00.760]   Yeah, I talked to this guy who has a reselling business that he operates at basically no profit.
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:05.960]   So best you could tell, it's an unprofitable, terrible, terrible business.
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:10.600]   However, he puts millions and millions of dollars a year on a credit card.
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:13.000]   And for him, it's focused on living his life.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.520]   So he's earning cash back.
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:18.440]   And I think he was doing it all on the Bank of America Premium Rewards card,
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:21.000]   earning 2.625 cash back on everything.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:27.720]   And if you stacked it all up, I think he said he was doing like $10 million a year.
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:35.080]   And so at 2.625% back, he's earning a couple hundred thousand dollars to live off of that,
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:40.440]   by the way, is tax-free because it's treated as a rebate.
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:46.040]   So it was a really interesting mindset shift of like run an unprofitable business
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:51.880]   so you can generate enough spend so that you can generate credit card rewards
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:54.040]   that would pay your lifestyle.
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:54:00.520]   Which surprisingly, had his business generated $265,000 of profit,
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:02.360]   he would have had to pay taxes on that.
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:07.880]   But had he taken that profit and allowed him to increase volume
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:10.440]   so that he generated more spend, he wouldn't pay taxes.
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:15.800]   So it was really, really interesting to read that story and think about this
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:19.080]   and how it could become more than a side hustle.
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:20.280]   But that's not what you do.
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:22.600]   You're keeping it at 10 to 15 hours a week.
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:23.720]   Trying to, trying to.
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:26.920]   Because a lot of these buying groups and these gift card reselling buying groups,
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:31.480]   they started as that guy that was like, "How do I scale up?"
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:36.520]   And they ended up becoming a broker, essentially, because that's the next level in scale.
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:41.000]   But for us, yeah, we're trying to keep it a little more low key at 10 to 15 hours a week.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:41.400]   Yeah.
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:42.600]   And so you mentioned gift cards.
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:47.560]   My understanding is that similarly, gift cards go on sale all the time, right?
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:49.160]   Every time I'm checking out of the grocery store,
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:52.520]   it seems like there's some deal or coupon in the Safeway app
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:55.720]   for 10% off this one type of gift card.
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:55:01.000]   And so you could just buy gift cards and then sell them to gift card buying groups.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.760]   One of them is Aligned Incentives.
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:04.600]   Is that the general premise there?
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:05.640]   Exactly.
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:10.520]   Kroger will often have a 4x fuel points thing where you get their fuel points,
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:12.040]   which is their reward system.
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:14.520]   And then you buy gift cards and they run that promo all the time,
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:19.080]   which effectively ends up being a 10% to 15% discount on the gift cards.
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:22.680]   And most of these gift card buying groups, like Aligned Incentives,
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:28.440]   they'll pay in that 90% range of how much a gift card's face value is.
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:30.360]   And that can vary based on gift card.
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:33.480]   But the same concept, you buy the gift cards, you send it over.
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:36.040]   And this has been happening a long time.
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:39.400]   This gift card game with Staples and Office Depot.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.400]   And it used to be more physical.
[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:45.160]   You have to go into the store and it can be a pain to go buy the gift cards.
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:46.680]   There's a new app.
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:51.080]   Every year, there's a new app on the block that comes around thanks to VC funding.
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:53.640]   Pepper is the one that everyone's been hammering recently
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:58.120]   because you can buy these gift cards at a 10% discount just on the app.
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:55:59.960]   So you never have to leave your couch.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:04.520]   And then you can send those gift cards over to a buying group who then reimburses you.
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:08.280]   And then you're earning your cash back and your points and your minimum spend.
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:08.840]   I love it.
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:11.560]   And then the last one you mentioned that we can hit on,
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:14.440]   and then we'll wrap up, is on bank funding.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:17.320]   So that's my personal favorite, actually,
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:20.680]   because it's the least amount of effort at zero cost.
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:24.280]   With bank funding, the beauty of bank funding is that
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:27.800]   you can just fund a bank account using your credit card.
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:30.440]   And then that money shows up in your bank account immediately,
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:33.400]   which then you can transfer out to go pay the credit card.
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:38.040]   So it doesn't have this period of time where your money is held up elsewhere.
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:42.520]   And it doesn't have the 1.8% cost because it's usually free to fund your bank account.
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:45.560]   The only friction I think there is that
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:48.840]   there's not many banks that let you fund bank accounts.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:53.640]   Sometimes a unicorn will come around where they allow unlimited credit card funding.
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:55.640]   And that happened earlier this year.
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:57:00.760]   There was a credit union that allowed unlimited Amex credit card funding
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:02.440]   into the bank account directly.
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:05.640]   And as you can imagine, that only stayed alive for about a month or two
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:07.800]   because people started funding.
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:11.640]   I think someone mentioned they put over a million dollars
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:14.680]   funded through a credit card, which they could just then withdraw.
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:16.920]   And so that's the rare scenario.
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:20.680]   And if you come across one of those, definitely go hard and heavy on that.
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:23.320]   But there's also a lot of like more chill ones
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:27.480]   where like right now you can open a US Bank business bank account
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:30.840]   and fund that with $3,000 on your Amex card.
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:32.280]   And anyone can do that.
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:34.200]   You can open a checking and do it, a business checking,
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:36.760]   and open a business saving and do another $3,000.
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:40.520]   So if you just need to like hit $5,000 on an Amex card,
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:42.440]   you could go on US Bank right now and do it.
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:46.040]   But that's the rare one that you got to like find those
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:47.560]   and really scout those out.
[00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:50.040]   And the top ones that allow unlimited ones,
[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:52.360]   those are the ones that people don't really share
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:55.000]   outside of their very small private groups.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.760]   Yes. Yeah. I've been working to try to get into these small private groups.
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:01.640]   They seem tricky, but with huge payoff.
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:03.480]   If you could put a million dollars in,
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:06.280]   you just earned a million Amex points and it cost you nothing
[00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:09.800]   because you fund your account, use that account to pay off the Amex,
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:12.200]   you fund it again, and then you just go through this cycle.
[00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:14.280]   It's pretty wild.
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:18.440]   So stay tuned as I learn for more rabbit holes to go down
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:19.560]   and how to find these things.
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:22.440]   I think I would probably get it shut down if I put it in the newsletter.
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:26.760]   But it's the kind of thing that maybe I'd share with members in all the hacks.
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:28.280]   All right. Thanks for running through a few of those.
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:32.200]   We could probably go really deep on gift cards and other ways to meet minimum spend.
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:34.600]   So stay tuned for an episode on all of that.
[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:38.280]   I do want to come back to the point about doing this with a partner.
[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:40.520]   Because when I looked at your table,
[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:43.880]   it looked like somewhere around a third of all the money you're making
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:47.400]   from all of these deals is from your partner.
[00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:52.520]   And so how do you think about the value of a player 2 in this game?
[00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:56.680]   And how do you think about doing it maybe if your player 2 isn't that excited?
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:59:02.680]   I think getting a player 2 on board is probably the biggest thing you can do
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:08.600]   for tackling profitable deals from just a sheer monetary benefit perspective.
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:14.440]   Because so many deals have referral bonuses where it ends up being a situation
[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:17.880]   where it's not like a 1+1=2 situation.
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:19.800]   It's now 1+1=3.
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:23.160]   And what I mean by that is if you sign up for a bank that has a referral bonus,
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:26.040]   let's say $100, you sign up, you get $100.
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:28.120]   If someone else signs up, they get $100.
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:32.600]   But if you sign up, get $100, and then you refer, let's say, your spouse,
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:36.120]   they get $100, but you also get $100 for signing them up.
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:40.200]   So now it becomes $300 instead of just your $100.
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:42.760]   And that's how you can scale things quite a bit.
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:47.560]   And yeah, I think last year, about a third, over $10,000 was through my P2.
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:52.840]   And the way I do it with my P2 is that she's not very excited about the deals in the way that I am.
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:55.320]   She appreciates all the benefits that come from it,
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:59.240]   but doesn't want to do the management of that, which I totally understand.
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:01.880]   And so I do a lot of these deals for her.
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:06.600]   And you can easily do that if you have access to their address,
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:07.960]   their social security numbers.
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:11.080]   This is where a partner or spouse makes more sense.
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.880]   Because you're just sharing your social security number.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.920]   It's probably not something you should do with random strangers on the internet.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:21.240]   However, it could be also just like your cousin or your friend that you've
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:22.680]   been friends with for a decade.
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:26.600]   There's so many ways to acquire a P2 or a P3 or P4.
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:30.200]   There's some people that I chat with that have 10+ players.
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:35.160]   And for them, it really is a full-scale business where they're managing multiple players,
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.720]   doing multiple bank bonuses, all these bonuses.
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:42.520]   Because if you imagine I'm just making $36,000 between me and my P2.
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:46.040]   If you had 10 players, that's over $150,000.
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:49.320]   And maybe you were working on this 40 hours a week instead of just 10 or 15.
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.240]   So I love this.
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:53.880]   And this is something where like, yes, you could do it with friends.
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:55.160]   You could do it with family.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.240]   I know my parents probably don't want to play this game.
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:59.480]   But maybe I say, "Hey, you know what?
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:03.720]   If my immediate family all lets me manage their deals for the year,
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:06.840]   maybe I'll pay for the vacation we all take."
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:09.320]   Which might come from a fraction of that cost.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.440]   So that'd be really, really cool.
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:15.080]   Especially when it comes to referring for some of these things.
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:16.680]   I know you mentioned $100.
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.880]   But there are a lot of times where whether it's Chase or Amex,
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:22.360]   some of the referral bonuses are just wild.
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:25.000]   So we didn't really talk about referrals above,
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.760]   but maybe highlight a couple of the crazy referral bonuses you've seen.
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:29.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:35.000]   So the one that really paid off last year was the Moomoo brokerage referral bonus
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.760]   because they were giving $300 for each party for bringing someone onto their platform.
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:44.120]   And that person only had to deposit like $1,000 or $5,000.
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.640]   It's like a pretty small amount.
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.720]   And you didn't have to leave the money there or anything.
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:51.640]   It was just like, I think in 30 days, they were going to pay out $300.
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:56.120]   And so on my end, I ended up referring, I think, like 40, 50 people.
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:59.160]   And so that's why my brokerage number is so much higher from last year
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:04.520]   was that I think I made over $10,000 just referring folks on the Moomoo app.
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:10.280]   But I want to say that obviously me having a podcast helped drive a lot of those referrals,
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:12.360]   but you don't have to have that.
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:17.080]   I was making a lot of money even before I started the podcast during the pandemic
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:18.120]   through these referrals.
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:23.000]   And they're going to vary a lot based on the institution offering them.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.040]   The most recent lucrative one that everyone was doing
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:33.000]   was that Amex was offering a 10x boost on your points earning when you spend on dining.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.080]   If you refer someone to an Amex card.
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:37.800]   So if you refer someone, they open an Amex card.
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:43.880]   The card that you referred from gets a 10x boost on dining up to $25,000.
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:47.480]   So if you were able to spend $25,000 on dining,
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:51.080]   Amex was going to give you 250,000 points for free
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:54.200]   just because you referred one person to an Amex card.
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:56.360]   Yeah, it was a shame that didn't stack.
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:59.080]   And you could refer 10 people and get 100x points on dining.
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:02:59.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:02.120]   Yeah, that's amazing.
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:05.720]   And I'm actually going through just as a recap in my mind,
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:08.840]   all these categories as they apply to a P2.
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.200]   When it comes to bank accounts, you might not get a referral,
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:16.040]   but that means for every awesome bank account deal, you can open it twice.
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:21.560]   It means for brokerages, you might have a shared brokerage to transfer your positions,
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:24.600]   but it means double the retirement accounts for those bonuses.
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:28.520]   For meal kits, do the meal kit companies catch on
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:31.160]   to the fact that you have the same address,
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:35.080]   but maybe you and your Player 2 can order meal kits to your home?
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:37.080]   It depends on the meal kit company.
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:39.480]   But for the most part, the meal kit companies,
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:43.160]   I'd say like 95% of them don't have a household restriction.
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.200]   So you can order...
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:50.120]   In theory, you could have as many roommates or pets as you want in your household,
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:51.640]   and you can order meal kits to them.
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.960]   And they don't care that you share the same address.
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:56.840]   The exception to that, I think, is Marley Spoon,
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:01.560]   who does care a little bit about how many people you have living in your home.
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:04.520]   But like HelloFresh, Green Chef, no issues whatsoever.
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:07.320]   So having a P2, having roommates, having pets,
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:10.680]   that really can scale up how many of these things you end up getting.
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:13.160]   Yeah, I will say in the past, I've found that sometimes
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:17.720]   it helps to use a different credit card when you sign up for you and your Player 2.
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:20.360]   So keep that in mind.
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.440]   And another hack that I learned in the past was
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:28.280]   if you're trying to sign up for a deal twice at your same address,
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:32.920]   I just think back to the fact that I used to live at a home where it was...
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:34.920]   It looked like a normal address, not an apartment building,
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.480]   but there was like an apartment 1 and an apartment 2.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:40.680]   So maybe you have three apartments at your home,
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:44.200]   and you just add unit 1, unit 2, unit 3, they're all going to get there.
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.280]   So it's not too big of a deal.
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:50.520]   So those are a couple little tricks to get around some of those restrictions.
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:54.360]   I went through cell phones just means you can get 2 iPhones.
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:59.720]   Discounts means you can get 2x the freebies if you have 2 people.
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:01.080]   2x the burgers. Yeah.
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:02.360]   Yeah. 2x the burgers.
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:06.680]   And then on the credit card stuff, the referrals are really, really lucrative.
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:09.000]   You mentioned 10x points.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.280]   But pretty regularly, there are referrals where you earn
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:16.360]   anywhere from 10 to 40,000 points for referring a partner.
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:19.960]   So I always tell everyone listening, "Look, all the Hacks.com/cards.
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.880]   We have links. They support the show.
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:24.760]   They're how me and Amy are able to do this full time.
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:26.280]   But I want you to get the most points."
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:30.760]   And so if you have a referral link from a partner, use that, get more points.
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.680]   If you don't, we'd love the support.
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:35.800]   But that's true across the board.
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.760]   And finally, while I wouldn't call a business a player 2,
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:41.800]   in the credit card space and in the bank account space,
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:44.840]   if you wanted to earn points from Chase,
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:47.080]   you can do that with a business and without.
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:49.640]   And I just want to flag to a lot of people that
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:54.440]   having a business might be a lot more accessible than you think.
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:58.520]   I know there are a lot of people that think, "Oh, I'm not eligible for a business card
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:01.880]   because I don't have a business that I've registered."
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:04.280]   And I'm like, "Well, have you ever done any consulting?
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:06.120]   Have you ever sold anything on eBay?
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:07.960]   Have you ever started blogging?
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:09.480]   Do you post on social media?"
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:14.600]   Is there a requirement that that business is profitable today?
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.680]   No. It has to be a business.
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:19.480]   So I'm not encouraging people to lie about having a business.
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:21.800]   I just think there are a lot of people that might have a business
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:24.200]   and not really realize it.
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:27.960]   So that business for a lot of people might be creating content online.
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:31.480]   And one day that'll turn into a thing like it has for you and I.
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:34.600]   I don't think you and I started posting things on the internet
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:37.480]   with the intention of it being a business and that just happened.
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:40.040]   And so in those early days, that was a business.
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:45.240]   If you do any kind of 1099 work, that's a business.
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:50.200]   So honestly, if you want to go drive for Uber for one hour a year
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:55.080]   so that you qualify as a business, then that unlocks a ton of deals.
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:56.920]   So I'm curious, actually, right before we wrap,
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:01.640]   how much of the money you make, the $30,000 plus,
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:05.000]   do you think came from business versus personal?
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.440]   And how important do you think it was for you guys to be able to have a business?
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.360]   That's a really great question.
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:13.960]   I don't think I tallied that in my end of year thing.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:18.200]   But if I were to guess, I'd say probably half of it is through businesses
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:23.560]   because the business bonuses are often so much more lucrative than personal bonuses
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.640]   because companies want to attract businesses,
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:28.040]   whether it's through bank accounts or credit cards.
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:33.400]   But on top of that, the business ones don't affect your credit card status.
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:38.040]   So opening these business credit cards means that you're not capped
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.720]   by how many credit cards you open.
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:43.880]   So outside of getting a P2, I think a business is the next one,
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:48.040]   maybe even on par in terms of things you can do to improve
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:51.640]   the amount of profitable deals that you can tackle and how much money you make from them.
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:53.800]   This is amazing.
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:58.040]   We went through so many different ways to get profitable deals
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.960]   and actually build income with it.
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.960]   I think anyone here who's thinking,
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:05.400]   "How do I add a few tens of thousands of dollars to my income each year?"
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:10.360]   can hopefully do that and scale it even further with friends, family, or a business.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:12.360]   And so this has been awesome.
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:16.120]   You have an incredible podcast that opened me to the world of this called The Daily Churn.
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:17.320]   I hope everyone checks it out.
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:19.320]   It's really incredible.
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:20.680]   Anywhere else you want to send people?
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:23.800]   Yeah, I think a couple of the ones we mentioned today
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:26.360]   are going to be really useful if you want to get into the game.
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:30.760]   Doctor of Credit is the Bible of all the deals you could tackle under the sun.
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:34.520]   Slick Deals is great if you're into discounts and freebies.
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:40.360]   Miles Earn and Burn, if you're trying to get into how to generate spend more effectively,
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:41.560]   they kind of focus on that.
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:44.840]   And a couple of podcasts you mentioned, Churning Life and Churner's Digest,
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:47.720]   are great for also the generating spend side of things.
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:50.600]   And of course, my show, The Daily Churn podcast,
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:52.520]   where you can get these monthly recaps.
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:57.880]   I have a live tracker on the website that I update in real time with notes and data points,
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:00.040]   what I'm doing that month.
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:02.200]   And so that way, you don't have to wait for one of those episodes.
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:07.960]   You can find that plus the newsletter, all that stuff from my end on thedailychurnpodcast.com.
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.480]   It's a great listen.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:10.680]   Everybody check it out.
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:12.680]   Kai, thank you so much for being here.
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:13.400]   Thank you, Chris.
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:13.960]   Appreciate it.
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:15.080]   I really enjoyed this.
