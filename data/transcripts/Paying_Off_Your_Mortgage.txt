[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   Hello, everybody, it's Sam and Sydney from the Financial Samurai podcast. And in this episode,
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.040]   we want to talk about how paying off your mortgage may not provide the joy you expect.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.120]   Because I spent hours and hours writing about the top financial moves to make to relieve stress and
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.360]   anxiety. This is what we did over the past, well, a couple decades, actually, but more recently,
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.600]   since the pandemic, to help us alleviate stress because the past three plus years have been
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.720]   stressful. And one of the items that didn't get its specific bullet point was paying off your home.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:42.480]   I did mention paying off your forever home as a paragraph as part of a sub bullet point,
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.320]   but it wasn't a dedicated bullet point paying off your home. And I wanted to discuss why this was,
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.200]   for those of you who are gazelle focused, extremely focused, laser focused on paying
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.520]   off your mortgage debt, ASAP, I think there's going to be a letdown, there's going to be a
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.080]   anti climactic moment once you send off your last mortgage payment. And it's really interesting,
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.320]   because after we had paid off our vacation property rental, I wrote a really bullish
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.360]   positive post called the triple benefits of paying off your mortgage early. And it did very,
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.560]   very well. A lot of people came out to support and comment, Google News picked it up, and it
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.280]   got spread all over the place. And it was interesting that I so quickly forgot that I
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.480]   had written that post. And so quickly, I forgot about the triple benefits of paying off the
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.880]   mortgage early, that I wanted to discuss more in this podcast why this was so. So Sydney,
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.000]   you were in charge of paying off the vacation property mortgage. So what were your thoughts?
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.360]   How did you feel once you finally paid it off? I felt great about it. And that joy has stayed
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.400]   with me. And I think one of the reasons why you kind of forgot about it is because we have a
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:01.440]   separation of tasks per se. This vacation property mortgage was more of my responsibility. You know,
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:08.000]   I deal with all of the management company issues, the guests, you know, when they have issues that
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.040]   come up, the maintenance, the fees and all of that, and the property taxes. So it's, I think
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.400]   it's stuck with me a lot longer, I still feel really proud and, and glad about it. And I do
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.360]   have less stress, there's, there's still the stress of dealing with the management company,
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.600]   there's always stuff that comes up. But I feel really great about having paid it off, I will say
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.480]   that I did. I did have a new unexpected stress. When I sent in the last payment was like, Oh,
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.680]   wait, what happens now? You know, what am I have to make sure I don't forget anything. So I had to
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.720]   remember to call in actually speak with someone to turn off the automatic payment, for example,
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.200]   because there wasn't an easy way to do that online, I had to actually speak with someone
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.320]   did we get the payoff letter? Yes. And that's the other thing I had to make sure that we would get
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.880]   everything you know, that we needed to to make it fully official. So that had a little bit of
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.240]   stress temporarily until all that was sorted out. And it doesn't happen immediately. Like,
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.440]   I had to wait a certain number of weeks for the paperwork to come back to me in the mail. I called
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.360]   the local assessor's office. Yes, assessor's. Yeah, just like make sure I was like, you know,
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.000]   this is what my lender is saying, can you please confirm just to get a little more comfort. And
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.760]   then once all that got taken care of, I felt so happy. Really? Okay, well, that's good. You know,
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.200]   it's interesting, because I wrote about mortgage mortgage payoff procedures to know, and it's not
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.320]   just okay, that's it, you've got to make sure your bank and you are on the same page. And you get that
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.160]   payoff letter amount. Yeah. And then it's recorded at the assessor's office that you paid it off,
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.600]   and you don't have that lien that the bank holds, right? You get the reconveyance letter,
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.320]   it might be a little bit different in every state. But yeah, conveyance letter. But I didn't forget,
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:02.400]   you said I forgot about I didn't forget, forget, but I feel like the emotional aspect, maybe
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.600]   I feel stronger, since I've kind of focused more on this, and you focus more on our primary house.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.920]   So I don't think about that as often. As a result, when did we pay it off? Do you remember?
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:25.680]   I'm pretty sure it was July of 2022. And so here now, May 24, summertime 2023. Do you still feel
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.080]   good about it? Yeah, I won't say that I think about it every day. My mind is cluttered with
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.720]   all kinds of other different things that are on my to do list and whatnot. But if I stop and think
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.000]   about it, like we are in this discussion, I felt I felt really good about it. And it has reduced
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.720]   some of your stress and anxiety, because that was my main point. What are the financial moves
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.560]   to reduce your stress and anxiety? Yeah, because it's one less payment that I have to ensure goes
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.920]   out every month. I mean, most of the time things run smoothly with your bank, it's automatic. But
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:04.480]   you know, if by accident, I didn't, I wouldn't have enough funds in the bank account for that
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.520]   month. And it, you know, things could happen, right? So it's just one less thing to worry about.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.600]   So less financial clutter. Yeah. Well, that's, that's good to know. And I think you're right,
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.920]   that because you were in charge of paying that mortgage. Yeah. And you know, paying the property
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.280]   tax and all that stuff. It's it was more beneficial to you, right? It alleviated you more,
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:31.440]   whereas I didn't really think about it as much, right. So the feedback we got from the commenters
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.920]   was was really great, which is one of the reasons the main reason why we want to do this episode,
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:44.080]   because it made me realize something very important. I did highlight five things as to why
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.360]   paying off your mortgage wasn't a big stress reliever for me. And let me just go through that
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.000]   quickly. And then I'll highlight an epiphany, not really an epiphany, but just a realization,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.800]   thanks to the readers. So first of all, ongoing property taxes, we pay our property taxes twice a
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.240]   year, I mean, it's December 10, in April 10. And every time I have to pay the property tax,
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.760]   it's like, oh, that stinks, right? And we have built a rental property portfolio,
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.320]   real estate portfolio that is large enough where we have hit the limit in terms of our
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.280]   property tax annual payments. And we're talking six figures a year in property tax payments.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.200]   And if you think about that, folks, you know, if you're going to pay 20,000 30,000 50,000 $100,000
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:31.520]   a year in property taxes, that doesn't feel good, especially when you start reading about corruption
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:38.000]   in your city, or inefficiencies. We've asked the city to do things before to fix things that would
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.240]   be good for society, the city, and they just won't fix it. And then you hear about stories about just,
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.320]   just bribing and all that stuff. It's just like, ah, you guys are killing me. And, and by paying
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:56.240]   property taxes, you're just kind of feeding the beast of inefficiency and corruption. Yeah. So
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.440]   number two is ongoing maintenance issues. Doesn't matter if you pay off your mortgage, you're still
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.920]   going to have to change the roof, change the HVAC unit, change the dishwasher. Yeah, you know, we
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:12.080]   bought our house in 2020. And since then, you know, our doorknob stopped working, though, that was
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:18.400]   easy. Try to replace the water heater, replace the water heater, change several rotten wood planks,
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:24.960]   we fixed a leak that went into the chimney when those like the once in a hundred year storm,
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:31.840]   what's going on. So there's always going to be things to do. And therefore there's always going
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:37.840]   to be stress involved. Yeah. Three, we're in a negative real mortgage interest rate environment.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.880]   Inflation is still at about 5%. But I would say 95% of us have refinanced to below 5% or have
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:50.880]   mortgages below 5%. 40% of homeowners supposedly have no mortgage. Anyway, if you have a sub 5%
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:57.360]   mortgage right now, paying off your mortgage now is suboptimal. And it's fine to still pay it off
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:03.840]   because paying off debt is always a good thing, I think, in general. However, when you can now get
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:10.320]   risk-free 5% plus returns and our mortgage, our primary mortgage is 2.125% for another five years,
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:15.840]   four and a half years, it's like, no, it actually feels worse paying off your mortgage when it's
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:23.920]   so low, when you can get more than double risk-free return. Four, what else? Investing FOMO. That's a
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:29.440]   huge one. That's something that I experienced. You don't experience that, do you? Not really.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.880]   You definitely do. I do because I'm in charge of the finances. And I've written before that
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:40.480]   investing is like a part-time job or it could be a full-time job. And we have over 40 financial
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.840]   accounts. You got to track everything. That's why we use Empower. It used to be called personal
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.120]   capital to track everything because it's like going to the grocery store. If you go to the
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.840]   grocery store and you don't have your grocery list, it's stressful. It takes much longer.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.240]   Much longer. You're like, oh, what did I forget? And then you get everything, you go back home.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.840]   You're like, oh, I forgot the eggs or whatever. I forgot the tomato sauce, whatever. I can't make
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:08.800]   the spaghetti no more. And so using an app like personal capital and power now is very helpful
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:15.360]   because it just alleviates that mental load. And so investing FOMO is tough, right? Because
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:20.560]   you want to stay disciplined in your asset allocation, investing, your goals. You know who
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:27.520]   you are. But in 2020, 2021, ridiculous things were booming and you're like, oh, pay down debt.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.560]   But things could be booming. So every year there's some kind of hot new investment, right? And in
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:37.920]   2023 and probably for years and years to come, it's going to be artificial intelligence. And I'm
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.800]   playing around chat, GBT. It's still like, eh, not that great, but it helps build structure.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:49.120]   And it's kind of like a shortcut. And I'm looking for AI investments. I'm like, oh,
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:55.360]   AI investments that could be a hundred baggers, 10 baggers, or pay down your mortgage of 2.125%.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:01.360]   Come on now. And then fifth and finally, the financial winds never really elevate your
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:07.600]   happiness for very long, at least for me, it's hedonic adaptation, right? We quickly revert
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:13.600]   back to our steady state of happiness after achieving any type of success, which is why
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:20.160]   I'm pleased to hear that since July of 2022, since paying off the mortgage, you still feel
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.920]   good about it because I've seen you on the couch when we're watching trash TV on Netflix,
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.840]   you dealing with, um, you know, the property manager, the property manager causes me headaches
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:37.200]   because they're not detailed. And I mean, if, if people are curious, we had, we had one company
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:42.400]   and it got so bad that I was like, we have, well, they weren't happy with us. We weren't happy with
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.720]   them. So we parted ways and we went with a different company that was working out so well
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:52.480]   for, I think it only ended up being about a year because they got acquired by the company that we
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.760]   had left. And I was like, Oh my gosh, are you kidding me? So we're back to square one. You know,
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.000]   there's so much employee turnover. I can never figure out who to contact because the person that
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:09.040]   I did last time is now gone. And you know, they didn't, they didn't do X, Y, and Z right on our
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:15.040]   invoices. And Oh, it's, it's always something. So this is my hesitant when people just hesitancy
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.040]   on hiring a property manager, people always ask me, well, Sam, why don't you just hire a property
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.840]   manager to manage your property? And I always think to myself, well, who's going to manage
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:27.520]   the property manager? Yeah. There's a lot of things they do that are helpful, but it's never
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.200]   a hundred percent smooth sailing. Something will always come up.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:37.040]   Yeah. And I'm just wondering, can you maybe just chunk all the errors that they do for the whole
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.760]   year and then just submit the whole thing at once and say, pay us back? I mean, maybe, but
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:49.040]   I'd rather, I'd rather stay on top of it every month because I don't want to, I don't want to
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:53.360]   have money going out of our pocket that, I mean, who knows what, what if this company ends up being
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:58.160]   acquired and then it'd be even harder to get money back, you know? Right. So anyway, I don't know
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.640]   the property manager solution. You got to get lucky. Just kind of like, you're lucky to get
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:08.000]   a really trustworthy auto mechanic. Who's not going to rip you off or say you, you need $10,000
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.480]   worth of stuff done when you just need $500 worth of stuff done. So yeah, property managers,
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:21.120]   not the silver bullet, but in conclusion, thanks to reader feedback, I learned a couple of things
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:27.280]   about myself and this should help you as well. The first thing is paying off your mortgage
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.880]   is a more powerful stress relief. If that mortgage is your primary residence,
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:39.600]   and if you are paying it every single month, you are responsible for it. If you're responsible for
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:44.400]   it, it's your primary residence, you're enjoying it. Yes. Paying off the mortgage will feel
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.640]   more wonderful. If you're paying off a rental property mortgage,
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:55.280]   it's not as wonderful because it's just more like money, right? You pay it off, your cashflow goes
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:02.080]   up. You have one less thing to do, but it's just money and money itself provides only a certain
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:07.120]   amount of stress relief, but after a while, it just, it's not that big of a deal. And then the
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:13.280]   final realization I had is that the greater the value of the property is as a percentage of your
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:20.560]   net worth, the more stress relief it will provide. So for example, I'd say the typical American
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:26.320]   household has about 80% of their net worth tied up in their primary residence, which I think is
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:32.400]   a no-no. My recommendation is to get that down to about 30% or less. But if you have 80% of your
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:37.440]   net worth in your primary residence and you pay off your mortgage, you're going to feel really good.
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:44.160]   You're gonna be like, yes, 80% of my net worth is safer now. But if on the other hand, your property
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:50.880]   is worth, let's say 10% or 5% or a couple percent of your net worth, you're not going to feel that
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:57.600]   emotional victory as much. So we paid off our vacation property rental and that vacation property
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:03.600]   rental is worth less than 5% of our net worth. So in my mind, I just feel it's not that big of a
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:10.240]   deal. We paid off the last remaining mortgage amount was like 40 to $50,000 in 2022. That's
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.640]   a good amount, but it's not really going to move the needle. What are your thoughts about that?
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:20.800]   I think that makes sense. I mean, yeah, definitely. If you're paying off your primary residence,
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:26.800]   that is a huge bulk of your net worth. It feels more impactful. It makes a lot of sense.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:31.760]   Makes a lot of sense. And also the duration. If you've been paying, let's say 25 years of
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:36.880]   your mortgage and you finally paid off, I think you're going to feel better than if you paid
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:41.520]   it off in three years. But you know what? Actually, I don't think so. Because I also concluded in my
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:49.120]   post, the harder you work for something, once you get that something, the more you kind of miss the
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:55.360]   goal. You might miss the goal or you might say, well, of course I should achieve this goal because
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:00.880]   I worked hard for it. I deserve it. I crushed it. The 25 years of pain and suffering and sacrifice.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:06.960]   This is what I felt after writing "Buy This, Not That" and once it became a Wall Street Journal
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.680]   bestseller. After two and a half years of worrying, writing, editing, marketing,
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:18.240]   when I achieved that result, I was like, well, yeah, you're damn right I achieved that. I worked
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:24.000]   so hard for it. But the reality is less than 0.3% of nonfiction books ever make it on a national
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.480]   bestseller list. It's that competitive. And so what happens is our minds really, we justify
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:36.080]   our achievements because of our work ethic, duration and hard work. But we also forget,
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:42.960]   conveniently forget to put things in perspective. So I would say for all of us, try to put things
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:48.960]   more in perspective. Any of our accomplishments. Write them down. Write them down. Review them.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:55.520]   Show gratitude. Ah, and there's also another way to think about the value of a financial move in
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:03.040]   terms of alleviating stress. And that is perpetual versus temporary or permanence versus temporary.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:07.600]   For example, the greater the permanence of the financial move, the more it will relieve stress
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:13.600]   and anxiety. Let's say you got a revocable living trust or a death file that was in the right hands.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:18.720]   You're going to feel good that there's a permanence involved until you die, that things will be taken
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:23.840]   care of if something were to happen. And so regarding paying off your house, well, if you
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:28.960]   live in your primary residence permanently, and you pay it off, I think you're going to go you'll
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:34.800]   feel you're going to feel better. But if you are a temporary holder of that property, and you plan
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:39.840]   to use it as investment or sell it within several years, paying it off and then selling and getting
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:46.960]   rid of it, it's it's not going to feel as great. And there's a there's a parallel to life insurance,
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:52.080]   because I said life insurance was something that gave me the most amount of stress relief. And that
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:57.360]   is term versus whole, we have a 20 year term policy. And I feel good about that. Because I
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:03.520]   think in 20 years, that our mortgages are all our debts will be paid off. And our children will be
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:10.480]   23 and 26 years old. And they should have the wherewithal, the intelligence to take care of
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:15.280]   themselves and know right from wrong. So I feel good about that 20 year amount. But along the
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:22.240]   lines of permanence, maybe we should have got whole life insurance at around age 3035. So it
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:28.960]   will permanently cover us no matter what happens. Because in 20 years, maybe our kids won't have it
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.440]   together. Maybe they will be spoiled. Maybe they won't understand or maybe there'll be an accident,
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:39.680]   God forbid, right? So we just don't really know anything can happen. So it's good to think about
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:46.080]   permanence and temporary in terms of financial moves you want to make. At the end of the day,
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:52.640]   life is temporary, everything we own, and even our time is temporary, because we will all pass away
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:57.440]   one day. So let's make the most of every single day. Appreciate each other. Appreciate all your
