[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.120]   This morning, I wanna put some energy
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.120]   into doing yet another core idea video.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.320]   Again, we've been racking these up,
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.920]   10 to 15 minute videos where I'm touching on the big ideas
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.080]   I come back to again and again.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.760]   So you have something to reference,
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.920]   to save and to share when you're interested in these ideas.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.540]   So I wanted to do another one of those today.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.600]   This is a core idea on a topic that actually
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.440]   was almost born on this podcast.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.120]   It was born as roughly the same time as this podcast,
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.680]   and that is the deep life.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.800]   So let's go deep about what we mean
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.020]   when we talk about the deep life.
[00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.840]   Now, I wanna start with the background.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.360]   Where did this come from, this terminology come from?
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.800]   It's all about the beginning of the pandemic.
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.140]   It's all about spring of 2020.
[00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.720]   This is when I began first on my email newsletter,
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.700]   and then soon after on this podcast,
[00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.700]   coining the term, the deep life and talking about it.
[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.280]   Now, what was it about that period
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.440]   that made this general type of topic really relevant?
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.680]   There's three things that went on.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.500]   So when the pandemic hit,
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.960]   and there was those stay at home orders,
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.080]   there was definite disruption in people's routines,
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.760]   which is important when you're in a routine,
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.600]   when you're used to going from this to this to this,
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.800]   I'm in this job, I wanna get this promotion,
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.280]   where do we wanna move?
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.640]   What's my next vacation gonna be?
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.640]   It's very difficult to get some distance
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.360]   for critical self-reflection
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.240]   when you're just rolling all systems go.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.040]   So a lot of people, myself included,
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.920]   got interested in notions like the deep life
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.400]   when those routines were disrupted.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.160]   I think the early pandemic also did a good job
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.840]   for a lot of people of highlighting both the negative
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.680]   and the potential positive of their lives.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.560]   It helped highlight, well, what is it that I don't really
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.960]   like, but I've been avoiding?
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.600]   I don't really like this condo I live in,
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.600]   in this sort of annoying neighborhood in this city,
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.120]   and when I'm forced to have to spend all my time here.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.160]   And I didn't have the normal escapes of,
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.040]   let me go to the movies and a bar and weekend trips.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.360]   It really made it clear, I don't really like where I live.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.680]   Or having to spend all this time on Zoom
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.360]   with your colleagues, you're realizing,
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.020]   there's excitement about commuting
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.880]   into my nice building downtown,
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.360]   but I don't really like these people.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.080]   So there's negatives that were highlighted
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.280]   by the disruption of the pandemic.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.240]   There was also positives.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.240]   Being home a lot, being around your family more,
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.120]   being outside more, getting separation
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.560]   from having to drive into your office.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.720]   So people also saw positives they weren't used to before.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.920]   And I think most importantly, things got very disrupted,
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.000]   especially in the coastal places where we had mitigations
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.900]   that lasted for a very long time.
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.440]   Schools were closed,
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.660]   jobs had completely different configurations,
[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.800]   people moved to completely different locations temporarily.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.520]   Like, let me go live with my parents in Colorado
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.000]   instead of being in suburban DC.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.320]   And it showed a lot of people
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.540]   that actually really different stuff is possible.
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.500]   You can do something different than what you have been doing
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.360]   and it's not gonna fall apart.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.120]   It's not as risky or scary as you once thought.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.720]   So we had these forces come together
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.120]   and people were stepping back and saying,
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.760]   I don't know, I wanna rethink my life.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.200]   I don't know that I wanna just get back
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.200]   to what I was doing before as quickly as possible,
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.480]   and let's just keep rolling.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.720]   So that was the context in which we began talking
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.740]   about the deep life.
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.200]   Now, the issue was, once we started talking about it,
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.200]   is that this is a timeless topic and one that is universal.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.960]   Many, many people have these reflections
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.920]   on what a life well-lived is like
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.880]   and what they want out of their life.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.880]   It's one of the oldest, most cliched topics that we have.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.240]   But it's a difficult topic
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.920]   to actually get good pragmatic advice on.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.560]   This is what we quickly realized
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.400]   as we scanned the landscape of pragmatic
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.160]   or aspirational literature on this topic,
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.240]   is that there's three things you would come across.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.240]   One, purely inspirational information.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.120]   Like, here is a story of a person who did something
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.960]   and just something about what they did hits me like,
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.600]   ah, that's cool, I wanna do that.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.680]   You read Will Finnegan's "Barbarian Days",
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.200]   you're like, man, there's just something
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.120]   about him roaming the world, surfing,
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.480]   and just something about that feels interesting and resonant.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.200]   We don't know what it is, it's just generic inspiration.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.400]   The other type of literature that was common
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.840]   addressing this topic would be hyper-focused
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.120]   on one aspect of your life.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.040]   So we've all seen this,
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.680]   you hyper-focus in on one aspect of your life.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.480]   It's gonna be self-acceptance,
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.360]   or it's gonna be intense fitness health routine,
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.960]   or it's gonna be a job,
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.960]   I'm gonna get out of this job and run a company
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.880]   and I want advice specifically about doing it.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.220]   So there's a lot of very specific advice,
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.960]   but it just shoots like a laser beam on just one topic.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.960]   Or we get that genre of book where you have someone
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.400]   who says, okay, I'm gonna try to improve my life
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.360]   and write about it.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.160]   And it's self-deprecating, right?
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.760]   And typically in the genre of books,
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.380]   the person has a child or a wife
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.400]   that's rolling their eyes at his efforts
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.440]   and is kind of bumbling.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.360]   And in the end, he learned some good lessons
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.400]   and makes some small changes,
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.240]   but it's basically back to a same normal life
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.080]   he had before.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.000]   So there's that genre too,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   like I'm gonna go out there and change my life
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.160]   and they try all these things,
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.280]   it's kind of kooky and they meet kooky characters
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.520]   and the main character's wife rolls their eyes
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.400]   at the bumbling guy.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.320]   And in the end, they're like, well, I have a better,
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.480]   in the end, I'm now doing some meditation and I'm a vegan.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.960]   It's like some changes have been made,
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.920]   but they're basically back to where they were before
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.560]   because you don't wanna stick your head out too much
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.240]   'cause people might push back.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.440]   So we didn't have a lot to draw on.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.280]   And so the thought I had at this point early in the pandemic
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.780]   is let's get specific.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.640]   Let's give this aspiration a name,
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.900]   let's give it a definition,
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.000]   let's come up with specific steps you can do
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.400]   to try to achieve it.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.600]   Let's be super specific.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.560]   Let's not just be vaguely inspirational.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.880]   Let's not just hyper-focus on one aspect of your life
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.480]   and let's not do this sort of weak sauce,
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.320]   self-deprecating memoir type thing.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.400]   Let's just get after it.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.880]   Now, of course, this is quixotic.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.040]   There's nothing more complex and ambiguous
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.420]   in trying to build a life of meeting philosophers
[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.640]   and theology have tried to tackle this for centuries.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.700]   So of course, what we're going to do
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.160]   is not gonna be comprehensive,
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.880]   but I have found that's often useful
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.300]   to put a stake in the ground.
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.920]   Let's put a stake in the ground and get specific,
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.960]   something you can go towards,
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.440]   see what works, see what doesn't,
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.900]   and let that be a starting point
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.000]   for trying to get where you wanna go.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.440]   Specificity is useful even when it's not comprehensive.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.900]   That is one of the big guiding lights of my advice.
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.400]   So we introduced this term, the deep life.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.960]   Let's give a name to this generic aspiration
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.880]   a lot of people felt,
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.240]   especially during those early months of the pandemic.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.280]   Then we gave it a definition.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.200]   So what do we mean by the deep life?
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.000]   How about this for a definition?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   It is a life lived in radical alignment with your values.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.920]   Let's be specific about it.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.800]   Radical alignment with your values.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.920]   All of the parts of this definition matter.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.960]   So alignment with your values
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.220]   means you're focusing on things
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.600]   that are very important to you
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.200]   and not wasting too much time on things that aren't.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.720]   Radical means in at least some of these areas,
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.960]   you have made really big head-turning shifts
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.860]   or transformation in your life to pursue those values.
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.280]   So not just small, but big.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.240]   You have to have both parts of those
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.620]   if you wanna capture that thing
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.360]   that we intuitively are attracted to,
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.880]   that intuitive notion of the deep life
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.440]   that we know it when we see it.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.340]   If you just do the alignment with the values part
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.820]   without the radical, what do you end up with?
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.160]   Nothing bad, but also nothing phenomenal.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.000]   What you end up with is,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.460]   you know, hey, I tuned up parts of my life.
[00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.440]   It's like the character at the end
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.200]   of those sort of weak sauce nonfiction memoirs.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.100]   You have like slightly better health habits
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.320]   and you've joined a reading group
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.720]   and you're trying to walk more regularly and you meditate.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.560]   And it's good, right?
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.120]   Like you've added things in your life
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.000]   to be more in alignment with your values.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.240]   If you're not doing that as bad,
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.520]   it's better than doing nothing.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.800]   But you're not going to watch a documentary
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.240]   about someone who has taken up a meditation habit
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.480]   and tries to walk more and be like,
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.720]   man, that's what I want.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.400]   That guy's got it all figured out, right?
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.240]   It's not touching you deep.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.060]   The radical piece is important too,
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.960]   because if you just do the radical
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.840]   without thinking about all the things that are important
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.780]   to you and aligning with things that are important to you,
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.120]   you get this burst of satisfaction
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.200]   because just making disruptive changes
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.400]   is exciting in itself and then it dies off.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.040]   Years ago, I read this book that had a great example of that.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.920]   It was a book that was called "Made by Hand."
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.680]   The author was Mark Frohenfelder.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.680]   Now, Mark Frohenfelder went on to become the editor
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.380]   or co-editor of "Make" magazine.
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:59.380]   So he became a big player in the DIY makerspace movement.
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:00.900]   But he wrote this memoir.
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.120]   And I remember reading it years ago.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:02.960]   And for some reason,
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.400]   I remember being at San Francisco in the airport.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.520]   So I don't know what trip this was.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.760]   But they opened that book with him and his wife,
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.640]   and they had some young kids at the time,
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.160]   doing radical without the alignment of values.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.840]   Like, we just need to do something different, right?
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.720]   We feel this urge to live a deep life.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.980]   And what they did was they moved to an island
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.600]   in the South Pacific, just in the middle of nowhere.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.460]   I think it was like Rotonga or somewhere like this.
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.040]   'Cause they're like, let's just be bold
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.440]   and do something completely new.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.040]   It was miserable.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.120]   Like, it turns out you can't school your kids.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.760]   There's all sorts of insects and things
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.600]   that are stinging you.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.080]   There's very bad medical care.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.520]   And they felt really weird and guilty
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.880]   about being there year round
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.320]   because it's an impoverished place.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.200]   And why were you guys coming here from San Francisco?
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.500]   And they just hated it.
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.560]   And they moved back.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.080]   That was a radical change
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.480]   that wasn't built upon a very clear understanding
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.120]   of promoting things that are very valuable to you.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.540]   So you gotta have both the radical
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.240]   and the alignment with values.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.360]   You do those two things,
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.660]   together you get something like the deep life.
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.920]   So let me give a concrete case study.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.580]   This is someone I know.
[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.960]   I didn't ask him if I could use them as an example.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.640]   So I'm gonna try to be a little bit vague about details.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.580]   And I'm actually changing a few of the details here.
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.500]   But this is roughly a true story,
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.280]   someone I actually know.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.220]   All right, so I have a friend, longtime friends,
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.600]   who until recently,
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.520]   they were living in suburban DC out in Virginia,
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.600]   sort of suburbs of DC outside of the Beltway, right?
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.500]   So kind of relatively far out suburbs.
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.400]   Now, it's a husband and wife with two kids,
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.760]   and they had a third kid around this time.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.600]   He did video production for hire
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.480]   and some of his own projects,
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.040]   and would do some freelance copywriting.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.400]   He's a sort of overly educated guy, good writer,
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.600]   would do freelance copywriting
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.060]   for corporate public relations firms.
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.440]   So writing press releases and stuff like that.
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:05.280]   And then she had a wellness business online,
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.280]   a pretty time consuming.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.400]   This wasn't like goop,
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.560]   like it wasn't gonna be a hundred million dollar whatever,
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.960]   but it brought in good money,
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.680]   but it was also complicated and time consuming.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.400]   And they lived in the suburb out in Virginia
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.080]   where it was like very expensive.
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.000]   They did not particularly like their neighbors,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.980]   they didn't mind them,
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.360]   but these like creative type people,
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.400]   and the neighbors were all just
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.780]   dual income government employees
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:28.820]   who were living in that neighborhood
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.520]   because it clipped like a good school district.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.360]   And just striving,
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.040]   like we just want our kids to like get good grades.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.720]   And just a commuter suburb,
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.280]   everyone's commuting in and out.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.520]   It wasn't that inspiring.
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.440]   He had a WeWork to do his film production.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.360]   All you could afford was like a WeWork space
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.760]   that was shared and you'd kind of drive
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.600]   into the city to do it.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.880]   Like this was their situation.
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:50.960]   And they were living in the suburb
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.940]   because one of their big interests
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.280]   was alternative education,
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.200]   and there was a particular alternative school
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.840]   that was kind of around there.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.240]   So they could send their daughter there
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.240]   and he needed to be near a city.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.400]   And so they were kind of trying to figure this all out.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.160]   Okay, pandemic hits, third kid comes along,
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.320]   they're like, all right, enough of this.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.160]   We want the deep life.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.600]   Like if not now, when?
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.620]   And here's what they did.
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:17.520]   They moved to a plot of land,
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.720]   it was 20 plus acres,
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.640]   near the James River outside of Richmond, Virginia.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:28.640]   So they bought land, has fields, forest, and riverfront.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.800]   Not nice land, right?
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.520]   This is not nice mansions or giant second homes,
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.440]   but there's a modest home there,
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.680]   fields, forest on the river,
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.000]   but also close to Richmond, 20 minute drive.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.360]   Okay, so they go out there, they buy that land.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.160]   It's cheap relative to anything in DC.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.860]   It's cheaper than the starting house
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:49.940]   they could buy anywhere in DC,
[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:50.900]   which they were also looking at.
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.480]   So this is not, oh, we have a lot of money.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.080]   This is actually much cheaper to buy land
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.640]   outside of Virginia than to buy a house in the DC area.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.240]   They just had their third kid.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.920]   He stopped doing the copywriting.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.400]   She put that company on hold
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.560]   because it was causing a lot of headaches.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.920]   They're gonna put their energy into their kids.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.400]   They're gonna homeschool their kids.
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.680]   'Cause again, they're really interested
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:10.760]   in alternative education.
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.760]   And they built this whole curriculum surrounding their land.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.200]   And a lot of their kids' experience
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.120]   was gonna be helping to clear this land
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.960]   and they're building these sort of cool
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.480]   yurt style buildings on the land.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.600]   And she got very involved
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.280]   in starting up a homeschooling cooperative.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.400]   So there's these other families
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.120]   that the kids would be doing things with.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.800]   And so they were going all in
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.600]   on being able to build that lifestyle.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.440]   And he rented, because everything's cheap in Richmond
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.000]   compared to DC, this really nice office space
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.040]   in downtown Richmond in the arts district.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.100]   It has like a balcony.
[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.760]   And he brought someone with him from DC.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.000]   And now he sort of can work
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.080]   in this new up and coming district of the city.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.400]   And he does his video production
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.160]   and they live much cheaper here in Richmond.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.400]   So they can kind of afford to not bring as much money.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.800]   And they built this whole different life.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.540]   That's very intentional and it's deep.
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.960]   There's a radical component to it.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.360]   They're living in the woods on land
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.240]   and homeschooling their kids.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.680]   But it's all coming from alignment with things
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.880]   that are really important to them.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.000]   Slowing down, alternative education,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.640]   being around their family,
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.160]   outside of like normal rat race, suburban type of living.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.120]   But also connection to arts and the cities and creativity,
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.900]   which he has with what he's doing.
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.520]   In the arts district, they shifted towards a deep life.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.180]   That is that definition in action.
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.640]   So how do you do this yourself?
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.720]   Well, over the months,
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.400]   we worked out some specific strategies you could try.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.280]   And most of the strategies that I talk about
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.840]   with the deep life start with,
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.240]   identify the different areas of your life
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.560]   that are important to you.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.440]   The deep life does not work
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.800]   if you neglect parts of your own existence
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.640]   that are important.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.700]   You get too myopic.
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.380]   It's all about my work.
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.280]   It's all about my religion.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.980]   It's all about my family.
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.820]   You get too myopic, it doesn't work.
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:14:59.660]   So you have to identify,
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:00.900]   let's start with just listing out
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.460]   what the different areas are.
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.320]   For whatever reason,
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.660]   when we began talking about this on the podcast,
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.740]   we began to use the terminology buckets
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:09.880]   to describe these areas.
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.520]   We say, what are the deep life buckets?
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.320]   What are the areas of your life that are important to you?
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.160]   This list should be personalized.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.760]   But as a starting point,
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.840]   we often talk about, for sake of example,
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.220]   we'll talk about craft being one of these buckets.
[00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.500]   So that's the things you produce, so your work,
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.800]   but also other types of high quality leisure type activities
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.560]   where you literally create things in the world.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.640]   Community, it's your family, that's your friends,
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.920]   and that's the people that live around you.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.060]   Dedication to that.
[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:39.240]   Constitution, that's your health, that's your fitness.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.000]   Contemplation, that's philosophy, ethics, and theology.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.900]   So the part of that Aristotelian deep thinking
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.080]   about what makes humans humans and the life well lived,
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.400]   that's a key part for most people.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.640]   We sometimes add a fifth bucket in these discussions,
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:56.080]   which we, to be alliterative, would call celebration,
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.900]   which is that commitment to, with presence and gratitude,
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.140]   just enjoying things about the world.
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.760]   You're really into craft beer
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.500]   and being able to be at that craft brewery,
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.960]   overlooking the valley, enjoying a new brew
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.200]   that you really understand why it's really good,
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.160]   and just having deep appreciation of that.
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.000]   You're really into music and being at that show
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.860]   and really just being able to appreciate that artist.
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.540]   So celebration is a big part of it
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:22.460]   for a lot of people as well.
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:25.080]   So you have your buckets, whatever they are.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:25.920]   You have these different buckets,
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.640]   and the deep life has to respect all of them.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.300]   That's step one.
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.980]   Step two, as part of our deep life strategy,
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:37.980]   is let's warm up by developing a keystone habit
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:40.400]   in each of the buckets.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.780]   So something you do every day
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.540]   and you write down that you did it,
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.540]   that is relevant to that bucket and signals to yourself,
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.220]   I take this part of my life seriously,
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:53.860]   and I am willing to do non-required activity
[00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:57.220]   on a daily basis to support this piece of my life.
[00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:00.620]   These should not be completely onerous or complicated
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:01.460]   because you won't do them,
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.720]   but they should also not be trivial.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.580]   You have to walk that line.
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:06.740]   It's tractable, but meaningful.
[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.860]   They're simple, but you do them every day.
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:13.300]   Now, this warmup is about teaching yourself
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:17.340]   that you care about different parts of your life,
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.460]   teaching yourself that you are the type of person
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:23.980]   who does optional activity on a regular basis
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.700]   in pursuit of a greater good in your life.
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:27.940]   A lot of people need that warmup,
[00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.140]   and it's something I think that is missed
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.220]   in a lot of self-help or advice type writing,
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.260]   that we jump right in to just do this, this, and this.
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.660]   Most people don't even have the practice yet
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.740]   with what does it feel like to say,
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.940]   "Shoot, I gotta go do this, and it's kind of a pain,
[00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.040]   "but then I get the satisfaction
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.520]   "knowing that I did this thing anyways,
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.360]   "even though it was a pain."
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.440]   And you say, "Wow, I'm willing to do things
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.060]   "that are a pain if I think they're important to me."
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.260]   And I think that's a key first step.
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.300]   Next, once you have all those keystone habits going,
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.660]   pump is primed, you dedicate four to six weeks
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:55.860]   to each of your buckets.
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.940]   And when it's the turn of a particular bucket,
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:17:59.900]   you spend that time saying,
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.800]   "Now let me do a more significant overhaul
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.000]   "of that part of my life."
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.380]   And this is an alignment overhaul.
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.980]   So what you're trying to do is clear out of your life
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.420]   stuff that's not that valuable, that's related to that topic
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.420]   or that actively gets in the way
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.100]   of the things you care about in that topic
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.500]   while adding in place more things,
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.260]   a small number of things that are very important
[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.980]   or valuable related to that.
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.480]   So when it comes to constitution,
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:24.300]   you're going through and really overhauling how you eat,
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.900]   integrating a fitness habit deeply into your daily routine.
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.340]   Maybe you start training for something.
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.580]   So you take each element.
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:32.860]   So I'm gonna do a real overhaul there.
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.820]   Clear out the distraction,
[00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.580]   pump up the thing that creates the value,
[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.560]   pump up the things that creates the value.
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.180]   Do this for each of the buckets.
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:43.980]   Now, at this point, you're really humming
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:45.380]   because two things have happened.
[00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:48.340]   One, you do really think about yourself
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:51.500]   as someone who can take optional action
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.060]   towards things that are important.
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.320]   And two, you've been doing non-trivial action
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.180]   towards all of these areas of your life that matter.
[00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.860]   And it is in that action that you get the real self insight.
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.980]   It's in the fact that you spent a month
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.740]   focusing on just this part of your life.
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.380]   And now I've lived the next four months
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.180]   with that part of your life being emphasized
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.520]   that you begin to gain real insight
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.740]   about what's important to you and what's not in that area.
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.700]   What matters, what doesn't,
[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.220]   what opportunities out there are lurking.
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.220]   You're not just staring blindly at,
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.220]   I don't know, maybe I should live on a farm.
[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.620]   Maybe I should move to Rotonga.
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.900]   You're starting to figure out what really matters.
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.200]   You get this nuanced understanding of yourself.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.060]   Now we're ready for the final step
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.740]   of the transformation towards the deep life,
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.780]   which is engaging the radical.
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.180]   Now let's make some radical changes.
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.100]   We're leaving that suburb of DC
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.100]   and moving to the James River in Richmond.
[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.500]   Now you're primed for that.
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.020]   If you start with that, you end up on the island
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:48.600]   in the South Pacific, picking lice out of your kid's hair,
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.300]   worried about there being no doctors
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.220]   and say we made a big mistake.
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.820]   But you do the keystone followed by the overhauls.
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:58.140]   Now you're coming from a place of confidence
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.780]   and self-awareness.
[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.380]   And now you say, okay,
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.380]   what can we do that would be a radical shift
[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.300]   that would further align us with these values
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.000]   I now much better understand?
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.420]   And here the best way to do it is lifestyle-centric,
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.620]   work backwards from various visions.
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.660]   You have to iterate through these various visions
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:15.700]   of a lifestyle.
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.540]   Lifestyles that are radically changed
[00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:19.980]   from where you are now.
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.780]   And you have to evaluate these potential new lifestyles
[00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.620]   in terms of their impact on all of the buckets.
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.020]   What you're looking for is a lifestyle
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.340]   that has some sort of radical change that gets you there,
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.660]   but it enhances all of your buckets.
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:34.860]   Not just we're going to an island in the South Pacific
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.220]   'cause it seems big,
[00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:37.320]   but what's it gonna do to community?
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.580]   What's it gonna do to constitution?
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.540]   What's it gonna do to contemplation?
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:41.500]   What's it gonna do to celebration?
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.060]   You think about this whole new lifestyle
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.700]   and you try to find one that, okay, this is tractable,
[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.220]   we can afford this.
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.560]   And if we do this right,
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.060]   this change is going to pump up some of these things
[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.300]   we really care about very clearly into a big level.
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.960]   And it's not gonna get in the way of the other things.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.240]   It's not gonna take one of these away.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.740]   It's not when we move to the South Pacific,
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.820]   mean we never see our friends, we never see our family,
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.020]   we have no connection to our community.
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.460]   It's not gonna get in the way of any of these.
[00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.220]   And that is how you make the decision
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.660]   about doing something radical.
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.360]   So it's after a lot of work and practice and training,
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.800]   then you try to make that shift.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.540]   And then you repeat,
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.340]   and then you do these overhauls again.
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:19.900]   This is an annual thing, probably.
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:20.760]   You go through your buckets.
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:21.600]   How's it going?
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.500]   What do we need to tune up?
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.460]   Every few years, you might step back and say,
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.260]   do we need another type of radical shift here?
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.100]   You're not afraid of it
[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.500]   because now you're not doing it randomly.
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.900]   Now the radical is not reactionary.
[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.300]   It comes from a place of informed self-awareness.
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.760]   It comes from a place of confidence and practice.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.620]   And so that is my attempt to make this vague,
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.400]   but deeply aspirational idea that I want the type of life
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:48.060]   that when someone sees it, they say, whoa, I want that.
[00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:49.180]   I want that in my life,
[00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.820]   and I wanna get there in a way that's systematic.
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:54.240]   And this is the best strategy that at least on this podcast,
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.540]   we've been able to come up with so far.
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:59.180]   Fix the word, fix the definition,
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:00.260]   fix the areas of your life,
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:03.540]   Keystone Habit Overhaul, lifestyle-centric,
[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:06.880]   evaluation of different radical shifts
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:07.960]   to find one that might work,
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.180]   and then take that radical shift.
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:10.460]   That's how you get to the deep life.
[00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:13.020]   It doesn't happen tomorrow, but it doesn't take two years.
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.420]   So if you are feeling that yearning,
