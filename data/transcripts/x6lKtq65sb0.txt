[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:11.440]   (dramatic music)
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:21.640]   - Welcome back to Ask the Compound,
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.120]   where we have a new intro on YouTube.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.320]   Pretty slick production.
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.160]   - Yeah, let us know what you think about it.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.800]   - This is a show that's driven by the audience,
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.000]   audience asks us questions every single week.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.080]   We go by what the audience does.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.960]   We provide some context, some perspective,
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.200]   some charts, some numbers,
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.920]   maybe the correct course of action.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.600]   I'm always impressed by the quality
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.200]   of our audience questions,
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.760]   but also the variety and the diversification,
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.640]   'cause it's always new and interesting stuff.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.560]   So remember, you can email us here,
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.840]   askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.560]   Today's show is sponsored by Rocket Money.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.800]   Duncan, you slacked me this week
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.520]   and said I signed up for Rocket Money.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.720]   What's your initial thoughts?
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.560]   - I love it.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.600]   Yeah, that's why I slacked you, you know,
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.600]   and just said, like, Rocket Money's awesome.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.440]   - It's slick, right?
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.160]   So we've received dozens of emails from our audience
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.520]   in the last couple months or so,
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.000]   because Intuit shut down Mint,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.240]   and a lot of people are saying,
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.280]   "Well, what do I do now?"
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.560]   And I don't know why they did that.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.400]   I have no idea why,
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.400]   but Rocket Money's a pretty darn good option.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.600]   So personal finance app.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.480]   They find and cancel your unwanted subscriptions,
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.000]   monitor your spending, help lower your bills.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.320]   Rocket Money has over five million users,
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.480]   and they've helped save its members
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.360]   on an average $720 a year,
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.760]   with over $500 million in canceled subscriptions.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.200]   That's almost as much money as I save in my cable,
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.080]   by calling in every year.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.080]   But Rocket Money can do it too.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.440]   Stop wasting money on the things you don't use.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.600]   Cancel your unwanted subscriptions
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.200]   by going to rocketmoney.com/atc.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.400]   That's rocketmoney.com/atc.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.600]   Let them negotiate for you.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.440]   It's easy.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.840]   They even let you negotiate with them
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.680]   for how much you pay.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.520]   It's pretty good. - Yeah, you can pick
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.340]   how much you pay, yeah.
[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.180]   - Yeah, rocketmoney.com/atc.
[00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.560]   - And for those that don't quite understand, too,
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.160]   the appeal for me is, like,
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.440]   you can see all of your finances in one place.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.000]   So, like, you link all of your accounts.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.600]   It's pretty useful.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.080]   They give you a summary of your bills each.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.800]   It is, as someone who's a spreadsheet guy,
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.120]   and a lot of people keep emailing and asking,
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.960]   can I see Ben's spreadsheet?
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.800]   Go to Rocket Money instead.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.960]   It's easier.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.800]   - Yep.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.720]   - We still get a lot of those.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.520]   And my spreadsheet will be useless to you.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.800]   All right, let's do a question.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.000]   - Okay.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.980]   Up first today, we have,
[00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.000]   what would be the pros and cons
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.320]   of purchasing weighted amounts
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.000]   of the 11 stock market sectors
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.280]   and rebalancing your portfolio each year,
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.920]   compared to just indexing the total market or the S&P 500?
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.300]   One is obviously much more time-consuming,
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.060]   but could the juice be worth the squeeze?
[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.900]   - It's kind of funny,
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.000]   because this seems like a very specific question,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.280]   but I've received this exact question before multiple times.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.720]   And I think I did the first one on my blog in 2014.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.920]   So I found the old spreadsheet.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.000]   I updated it a little bit.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.960]   The premise makes sense from the perspective of,
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.120]   well, if I'm rebalancing these sectors,
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.940]   obviously there's gonna be winners and losers,
[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.840]   but some of the winners are gonna fall back
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.680]   and beat the losers.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.260]   And if I rebalance constantly,
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.980]   I'm buying into the pain.
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.560]   And that makes sense kind of, I guess, from theory.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.680]   But let's dig into numbers first.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.360]   John, throw up the first chart.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.720]   This is from State Street.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.800]   These are the current sectors
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.580]   for the S&P 500 or the SPI ETF.
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.880]   So if you did an equal weight strategy of the 11,
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.160]   you could see that you're obviously going
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.760]   to be underweight technology, financials, healthcare.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.080]   You're gonna be overweight materials,
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.020]   utilities, real estate, and energy,
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.120]   maybe a little consumer staples,
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.400]   and then industrials, communication services,
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.640]   and consumer discretionary are essentially a push.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.040]   Obviously the sector weightings do change over time,
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.520]   but you'd be adding some real tracking error
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.960]   to the S&P by doing this.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.800]   So the asset allocation quilt
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.000]   is pretty fresh in my mind still.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.720]   John, do a chart off.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.800]   But let's look at the performance numbers
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.440]   of the various sectors.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.440]   And I did these going back to 2008.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.560]   And I did this for a reason
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.720]   'cause I wanted to include a wide range of markets.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.220]   So 2008 was a huge crash.
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.400]   2010s, pretty big bull market.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.800]   2020s has been up, but it's been very volatile.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.820]   Now here's what I did here, and I wanna highlight this.
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.740]   So I highlighted the S&P 500, and then the EW is equal weight.
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.600]   So I did an equal weight of the index,
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.200]   which is essentially just re-weighting each year.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.780]   So it'd be like a rebalance.
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:00.700]   And you can see the equal weight
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.140]   is actually pretty close to the S&P.
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.300]   They're both kind of towards the middle.
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.700]   So not too bad.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.860]   John, you can do a chart off real quick,
[00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.120]   and I'll ask you again for a minute.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.440]   My one problem with this asset allocation quilt
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.760]   is that they've added two sectors in the last few years.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.140]   They added real estate and communication services,
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.380]   and it makes it not look as good anymore.
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.940]   So it's not a perfect quilt.
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.300]   - You should ride them.
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.140]   - So if you eyeball it,
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.340]   John, throw it back up a little bit,
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.980]   you can see the equal weight is pretty close.
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.400]   So it looks like the S&P has outperformed in,
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.300]   this is 2008 to 2023.
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.840]   The S&P has outperformed an equal weight
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.420]   of all the sectors in nine out of 16 years.
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.840]   I still remember how to do math from school.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.340]   So that means seven out of 16 years,
[00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.300]   the equal weight is outperformed.
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.300]   So not bad, it's actually pretty close.
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.340]   If you go all the way from 2008 to 2023,
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.940]   John, I can do a chart off now.
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.420]   We're talking 9.8% per year for the S&P,
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.260]   which is pretty good.
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.820]   Include 2008, you know, a 37% loss in the S&P.
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.180]   We're still up close to 10% per year.
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.140]   The equal weight strategy was up 9.2%.
[00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.460]   So it underperformed.
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.060]   It did have a 10% less volatility, so not too bad.
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.880]   Now, this is interesting.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.460]   From 2008 to 2023, there's three sectors
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.460]   that outperformed the S&P.
[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.340]   Duncan, you gotta be able to guess at least one of them.
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.520]   - The outperformed?
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.140]   - Yeah, sectors that outperformed.
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.520]   Tech was one, healthcare, and consumer discretionary.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.180]   So obviously, underweighting technology was a big pain,
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.740]   and you overweighted energy,
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.700]   which was up 3.5% per year.
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.440]   - So how would you say TQQQ would have done
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.380]   during this period?
[00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.860]   - Probably not so bad.
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.400]   Yeah, it depends when you bought it.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.940]   It did bad after you bought it.
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.980]   So my biggest problem with this strategy,
[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.900]   so it underperformed, but my biggest problem
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.660]   with this strategy is it's just needlessly complex.
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.220]   I prefer simplicity in all things investing.
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.900]   So owning an S&P 500 index fund is simple.
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.440]   They do the rebalancing for you when new companies come in.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.100]   You don't have to worry about holding 11 funds.
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.400]   You don't have to worry about adding a fund
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.980]   if they add another sector for some reason,
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.680]   and maybe they will at some point.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.640]   Even if the Equal Weight Strategy outperformed
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.040]   in a back test, I'm not sure it would be worth the hassle.
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.900]   And if you wanted to break free from market cap weighting
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.540]   for whatever reason, there's already a way to do that
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.220]   in the Equal Weight S&P 500, ticker RSP.
[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.540]   There's an ETF for that.
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:08.880]   So I actually calculated the returns
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.460]   for our Equal Weight Strategy that Sam asked for,
[00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.860]   the S&P 500, and then the Equal Weight S&P 500,
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.460]   which equal weights by stock, not by sector.
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.300]   So John, fill this next chart up.
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.420]   So this is the three various,
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.620]   and I did it over various periods.
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.740]   I did the 2008 to 2023, I did the 2010s,
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.080]   and I did the 2020 to 2023 timeframe.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.940]   And the S&P 500 actually outperformed
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.860]   over all three timeframes.
[00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:32.700]   It was really hard to beat
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.940]   because market cap weighting did so well.
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.500]   The Equal Weighted Sector Strategy
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.380]   actually outperformed in the 2020s,
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.180]   but not the Equal Weight S&P outperformed in the 2010s.
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.940]   So, I don't know, it kind of, I just,
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.940]   there's going to be a time where the S&P 500
[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.260]   underperforms in Equal Weight Strategy
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.780]   because value or high quality or some other sector
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.140]   or some other strategy does well.
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.700]   But I think there's way easier ways
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.220]   to break the market cap structure
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.620]   than trying to equate all the sectors
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.260]   and making your investing strategy needlessly complex.
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.720]   Invest in small caps or value or high quality
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.300]   or dividend stocks or some other non-market cap
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.980]   related to factor strategy.
[00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.180]   And when the S&P underperforms or tech underperforms,
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.380]   it's going to do better.
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.400]   You don't have to go back that far.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.540]   So, John, for the last chart up,
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.540]   this is the early 2000s bull market before the 2008 crash.
[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.060]   Equal Weight outperformed the S&P by quite a bit.
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:33.060]   It was up 97% from when this strategy started in 2003
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.200]   through the end of 2007 versus the 74% gain for the S&P.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.400]   So, the Equal Weight Strategy
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.340]   will outperform at some point.
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.300]   I just think the proliferation of ETFs
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.100]   makes it easier than ever to gain exposure
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:44.940]   to different types of stocks.
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.660]   So, I don't think you would want to
[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.820]   necessarily try to outdo the S&P 500,
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.700]   which is pretty darn tough to beat as it is.
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.820]   So, I just wouldn't get too cute
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.260]   with these portfolio strategies
[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.560]   and don't make it more complicated than it has to be.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.900]   If you want to break the market cap,
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.860]   do it a simpler way with another ETF,
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.840]   not trying to do it yourself.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.180]   - I feel like a lot of these things, though,
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.780]   to come down to people that just enjoy doing this stuff.
[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.100]   So, the question of like, is the juice worth the squeeze?
[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.060]   Maybe not, but like, if you're just really into the market
[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:15.940]   and you enjoy micromanaging every aspect of your portfolio,
[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.820]   then, you know, okay, that's you do you.
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.860]   But like, yeah, you might not outperform
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.140]   or it might be not enough to really--
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.980]   - Well, at the very least, find a back test that looks good.
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.000]   Most back tests don't look as good in forward tests,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.900]   but at least find a back test that outperforms
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.820]   so you can lie to yourself about the fact
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.100]   that you think it'll outperform in the future.
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.460]   It probably won't, but you can tell yourself it will.
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.780]   - It's true, yeah.
[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.020]   - All right, next question.
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.060]   - Okay, and that question was from Sam, by the way.
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:44.900]   So, up next, we have, let's see, who's this one from?
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.020]   This one's from TJ.
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.000]   I'm thinking about investing in Bitcoin,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.660]   but the more I research it, the more speculative it sounds.
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.260]   Worse, most of the Bitcoin proponents are very evasive
[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.180]   when asked about Bitcoin, what Bitcoin does
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.540]   and what the future holds.
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.420]   People say Bitcoin is a store of value,
[00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.220]   but where does the value come from
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.100]   since the supply is limited and it doesn't produce anything?
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.620]   The only value seems to be,
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:08.820]   and they're using a lot of quotes here
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.420]   for people just listening,
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.780]   the only value seems to be the expanding size of money
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.740]   that more and more people are pulling.
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.020]   Isn't this the same as two-up mania,
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.380]   or is the electricity cost of mining Bitcoin
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:24.460]   every time people transact calculated and added as value?
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.560]   And maybe just explain the two-up mania reference
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.660]   they make there.
[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.180]   - First of all, my six-year-old daughter
[00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.580]   just kind of learned that if you put something in quotes,
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.780]   it means you're being sarcastic,
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.900]   so she does it all the time to me now.
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.040]   She's like the little class clown of the group,
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.300]   and she goes around all the time,
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.580]   oh, it was an accident,
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.500]   and she puts quotes on everything.
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.700]   I don't think she quite gets it all, but.
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.340]   - Good for her, I like that.
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.900]   - Okay, the two-up mania thing was,
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.240]   and a lot of people compared Bitcoin to this,
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.060]   it's just these tulip bulbs in the 1700s
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.340]   in the Netherlands went crazy for some reason,
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.900]   the prices went up and it got to this fever pitch.
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.300]   People tried to debunk that one later,
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.820]   saying it wasn't really as bad as they thought
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.160]   'cause it was in a few of the early bubble books,
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.300]   but it was essentially just like, listen,
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.260]   human psychology and the herd mentality
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.340]   caused this thing that has no intrinsic value
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.700]   to go up a lot, and people compared crypto to it
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.740]   because there's nothing really backing it.
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.260]   I have a love-hate relationship with Bitcoin and crypto.
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.980]   I'll admit, I didn't really pay much attention to it
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.780]   'til 2016, 2017, and it really started
[00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.100]   when everyone else did, kind of.
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:22.940]   I just didn't get it.
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:23.760]   All these people were talking about
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.360]   how it was gonna change the world,
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.620]   but the concept didn't make sense to me.
[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.360]   I read the white paper.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.200]   That didn't help.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.280]   It was frustrating 'cause to me there was no there there.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.860]   Like, why do we need this?
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:33.720]   What's the point?
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.920]   And so I just bought some
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.780]   because I was sick of hearing people talk about how great
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.620]   it was gonna be, and I think I bought it at like,
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.220]   I don't know, $3,000 or $4,000.
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.020]   I wish I could say that it's the best trade I've ever made,
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.300]   but I didn't put nearly enough money in
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.440]   for it to matter that much.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.740]   I put some more money in since then,
[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.860]   and my whole thesis has been I'm gonna buy
[00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.620]   and hold it forever and just leave it alone,
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.880]   or until it hits 150K, then I'll sell, maybe.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.860]   But part of the reason I bought it was curiosity,
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.380]   and part of it was FOMO, and part of it was that
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.180]   all these evangelists for it just were,
[00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.420]   I just didn't want them to get rich and not me.
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.580]   It's the only FOMO trade I've ever really made,
[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.420]   and the strange thing is, all of these evangelists
[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.980]   that started out in 2017 and before then,
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.100]   they were wrong about what they were predicting.
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.940]   They were saying, the only thing they were right about
[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.780]   is the price would go up, but they were saying,
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:25.540]   listen, the Fed, this is a continuation of the 2008 crisis,
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.420]   and we're gonna take down the Fed and the financial system,
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.980]   and Bitcoin's gonna take it over, and the dollar is done,
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.060]   and the government's gonna cause hyperinflation,
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.940]   and then it was more like, I'm bullish on blockchain,
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:35.820]   not Bitcoin, right?
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.920]   We're gonna tokenize the world, tokenize everything,
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:38.760]   everything's gonna be a token.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.580]   - That was the phrase.
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:40.900]   That's what you said if you wanted to sound smart.
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.620]   - Yeah, you tokenize, we're gonna tokenize your house,
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.900]   we're gonna tokenize your shoes and your car,
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.260]   and then it was decentralization,
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.740]   and then it turned into a macro hedge,
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.540]   and it's gonna hedge against hyperinflation
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.660]   and inflation in the Fed, and then it's,
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.100]   crypto's gonna take over the financial system,
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.660]   all the trading and settlement and banking,
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.620]   and now Bitcoin is part of the financial system as an ETF.
[00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:02.220]   So we went from decentralization back to centralization,
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.140]   which kind of was necessary the whole time
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.260]   if it really wanted to get big enough.
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.460]   You can't do this without the finance system.
[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.340]   Now it's more seen as this store of value,
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:10.240]   which TJ is asking about,
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.700]   something akin to millennial or Gen Z gold, right?
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.140]   And I think this is probably actually the best narrative
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.220]   and the one that makes the most sense to me.
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.220]   Honestly, I think the fact that the narratives
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:22.580]   have shifted over time and this asset class won't die
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.820]   is probably one of the biggest and best parts of it.
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.900]   Like, I think that's actually a good thing
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.200]   that it's continued to survive all this stuff.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.500]   So the way to think about the store of value,
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.460]   gold is a store, gold has nothing backing it,
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.460]   it's just a shiny little rock.
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.780]   But the quote I've always heard is that
[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.500]   back when Jesus roamed the earth,
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.580]   you could, for an ounce of gold,
[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.420]   you could buy a fine men's suit.
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.240]   And you can do the same thing today.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.860]   - What did a men's suit look like back then?
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.660]   - It had to be a robe with like a rope tied around it, right?
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.660]   That was a pair of Tevas I think they wore.
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.100]   And I think it's the same thing with Bitcoin.
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.660]   Bitcoin is the digital version of that.
[00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.520]   And the best explanation I heard
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.760]   when I still didn't quite understand it,
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.980]   first of all, Bitcoin or crypto is an incentive system,
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.400]   right, it's incentivizing these people
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.860]   to go on their computers and put these formulas in
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:13.020]   to get paid to keep the system running.
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.720]   But if I handed you, Duncan, a $20 bill,
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.780]   and you took it from me,
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:20.100]   there's no financial intermediary involved
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.100]   in that transaction, right?
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.840]   I can hand you a $20 bill for some reason,
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.820]   just 'cause you're a nice guy.
[00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.140]   Here, Duncan, take this $20 bill,
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.180]   go buy another hat for your collection.
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.300]   Where do you keep 'em all, by the way?
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.580]   Do you have like a whole closet for your hats?
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.620]   - I mean, my wife, it drives her crazy.
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.600]   They're everywhere.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.620]   - Okay, that's me with shoes.
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.460]   But crypto is like the ability
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.740]   to give someone $20 on the internet
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.660]   without having a financial intermediary there.
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:42.740]   And there's kind of an intermediary,
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:44.620]   but not like a bank or financial institution.
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.860]   That's the best explanation I've heard of Bitcoin.
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.980]   So I think in some ways, it's a religion.
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.500]   In some ways, it's a call option on technology in the future
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.240]   and having a digital currency,
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.140]   a digital way to transfer money.
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.540]   There's very few people in the actual crypto space
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.380]   that I would trust.
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.460]   Most of them work for traditional financial institutions.
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.300]   Those are the ones that I trust more.
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.740]   But I mean, the fact that these narratives
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.020]   are constantly evolving, I can see how that's annoying.
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:11.100]   I don't think that's a reason for you
[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.560]   to or to not invest in this.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.260]   I think there's a lot of really,
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.940]   there's a lot of charlatans in the crypto space,
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.740]   but there's also a lot of marketers and evangelists.
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.300]   And I think that's just part of the,
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.780]   and if you think that's annoying, that's fine,
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:24.900]   but it's probably actually a good thing
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.500]   that there's so many people who just will never,
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.780]   literally never sell this asset.
[00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.580]   Do you need Bitcoin or any other crypto asset
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:31.540]   to succeed financially?
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.580]   I don't think so, but can it play a role
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.780]   as this new asset class
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.780]   with different capabilities and parameters?
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.100]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.460]   I just think you have to go into it with your eyes wide open
[00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.780]   and not expect it to be some miracle cure
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:45.680]   as like a macro hedge or a savior to the financial system.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.180]   I do think that millennial gold
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.900]   is probably a good way to think about it.
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.900]   The problem is the emotions in the asset are amplified,
[00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.220]   not only because of the religious aspect,
[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.660]   but it trades 24/7.
[00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.420]   It's super volatile.
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:01.120]   It has a couple of 1987 crashes every year or something,
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.340]   but it also could go up 20% in a day.
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.100]   It has these wild swings.
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.140]   It's not the kind of asset I would ever push on anyone,
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.000]   but I think for certain personality types, it makes sense.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.420]   Probably younger people more than older people, I would say.
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.420]   That may be a stereotype,
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:14.780]   but I think it just depends
[00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.100]   on your emotional makeup as an investor.
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.820]   And I was where TJ is five or six years ago,
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.540]   and I invested in it 'cause I got so annoyed.
[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:24.660]   So I think you have to figure out
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.060]   what's gonna make you regret more.
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.700]   Like this thing goes to 100,000 and you're not in it,
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:30.740]   and you go, I still don't get it,
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.220]   but why is it doubling?
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.660]   Or you put some money in and it goes from 50 to 25,
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:35.540]   and you go, ah, I'm an idiot.
[00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:36.620]   Why don't I believe them?
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.820]   I think that's the regret minimization framework
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:39.660]   you have to think about.
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.380]   And it could do both of those things this year.
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:44.060]   It could go to 100 and back to 25, and who knows?
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.060]   I think those people that you mentioned,
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.460]   kind of charlatans, but also the shameless promoters of it,
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.320]   I think they've done more harm than good
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.020]   to the perception of it, though.
[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.580]   It's immediately, it turns me off
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.700]   as soon as I see a bunch of people
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.700]   pumping Bitcoin, pumping crypto.
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:59.700]   It really kind of turns me off.
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:00.800]   - Those are the people that--
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.140]   - Whereas I'm interested in it by nature.
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.140]   I find it very interesting,
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.420]   but those people really turn me off to it.
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.420]   - Yeah, and those are the people that,
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.380]   those are the reason that when it does crash,
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.220]   people dance on the grave of it all the time
[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.660]   because they don't like the, you know,
[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.140]   have fun staying poor and all that stuff,
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:19.140]   which is, yeah, which is really, hurts the case of it.
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.540]   So I actually think the fact that it's getting
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:23.620]   into the financial, the traditional financial system
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.580]   is probably a good thing.
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.060]   That it's like the adults are here, finally.
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.340]   I think it's a positive, so.
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:30.500]   - I have a question about that.
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.740]   I see everyone talking about,
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.020]   and you and Michael mentioned this
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.060]   on Animal Spirits this week,
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:35.700]   but everyone's talking about like,
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.980]   how is the price not gonna go up
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.140]   when they have to start buying for all these ETFs?
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.940]   I mean, that's a legitimate question, right?
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.120]   How would it not go up because of that?
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.380]   Is there like a case where it doesn't go up?
[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.140]   - Well, if every, I mean, the price has gone up,
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.580]   what, was it up 150% in 2020?
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.020]   - So it's already priced in, basically,
[00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:55.500]   you could, that would be the case.
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.340]   - That'd be the argument.
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.460]   I don't know if it is, but that'd be the argument
[00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.500]   that some people would have to make is,
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.940]   how much do, does the market expect
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:06.300]   there's gonna be $2 billion in this, or 10 billion?
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.620]   Or that's like, does it go over expectation?
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:09.980]   That's how markets work in the short term.
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.140]   Is it better than expected or worse than expected?
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.940]   That's what we have to figure out.
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.700]   - Also, lastly, I'll say, I find the,
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.900]   when people freak out about the security aspect of it,
[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.300]   it kind of makes me laugh because I'm like,
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:21.660]   have you ever heard of cash?
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.020]   Like, that's the whole reason people rob people for cash,
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:24.860]   and that kind of thing. - Yes.
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:27.060]   - Like, cash is kind of no different
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.020]   in that regard, in my opinion, but yeah.
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.020]   - Yes, yeah, the good and bad.
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.160]   Maybe it's easier to be a bad actor with this,
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.940]   but yeah, I think there's gonna be bad actors regardless.
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:35.780]   - Yeah, in some ways, for sure, yeah.
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.700]   - Yeah, all right, next question.
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:41.060]   - Okay, so up next, we have a question from Riley.
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.900]   "I discussed Roth IRA contributions with my CPA,
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:47.760]   "and he mentioned that his firm, which is also an RIA,
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.720]   "could potentially reduce my tax payments
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.940]   "if I transfer my investments to them.
[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.700]   "I'm unsure about having my accountant
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.280]   "handle my investments, as it might seem
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.880]   "like he's taking on too much.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.380]   "I'm questioning whether he can excel
[00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:02.140]   "as both a tax expert and a financial planning expert,
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.500]   "simultaneously.
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.080]   "I don't want to criticize Bill Sweet
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.760]   "if this is a common practice,
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.480]   "but I'm curious about your opinion.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.540]   "Does this raise any concerns?"
[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.740]   - Okay, ask for Bill Sweet by name,
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.780]   and he shall appear like a magic tax genie
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:15.920]   out of a bottle. - Hey, Bill.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.660]   If you say my name three times,
[00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:18.980]   they let me out of my cage.
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.060]   - Oh my God.
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.680]   All right, so Bill, we do have a tax practice
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.520]   at Ritholtz Wealth now.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.720]   We didn't have one before. - We did.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.940]   - We do what most of our clients love,
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.040]   and actually, we mentioned this on Animal Spirits this week.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.580]   We have so much demand from clients
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:31.820]   that we actually need help.
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.380]   So if you're a tax nerd who wants to work
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.980]   with Mr. Bill Sweet, you have to get
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.340]   a Roth tattoo on your back.
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.180]   - It's true.
[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:38.000]   - Not as big as him.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:38.840]   You can get it smaller if you want,
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:39.880]   just your shoulder blade.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.900]   But we are hiring if you're a person
[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.740]   who wants to work on the RIA side of things
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:44.580]   in the tax practice.
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:48.700]   So what do you think, and is there a difference
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.580]   between I have a CPA who says they can manage investments,
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.860]   or I have an RIA who says they also have CPAs?
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:54.700]   Is there a difference there,
[00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.140]   or do you think those are kind of the same thing?
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.940]   And how do you go about evaluating the synergies involved
[00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.580]   in having someone do investments and tax together?
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:02.980]   - Yeah, Riley, great question.
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.020]   I would put Ben, Bill Artzaronian,
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.220]   who's the gentleman who runs RDBM Tax,
[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.740]   or Internal Tax Practice, as the case study
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.260]   of how we can get this right.
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:12.880]   So I would posit him as evidence
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.300]   that a CPA can be a great financial planner.
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.500]   Bill's also a CFP.
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.580]   He's a triple threat, too, 'cause he gets to the hole
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.740]   every time on the basketball court.
[00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.880]   He's got a great drive and rebounds like Robin.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.220]   But I think, like anything else, Ben, it depends.
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.020]   That's a sad and unfortunate answer.
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.620]   And my observation in investments and tax
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.480]   is that people hate paying taxes
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.420]   more than they like making money, right?
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:37.000]   So if you're a financial planner, an advisor, a tax person
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.400]   who can deliver value to your client,
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.040]   above and beyond your average Joe,
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.520]   and you can get them to stick to our portfolio,
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.080]   I think it's perfectly acceptable for your tax gentleman
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.220]   or lady to handle an investment portfolio as well.
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:51.960]   However, where it'd be a concern for me are two areas.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.640]   Number one would be a service model.
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.840]   Is this somebody who's doing tax work primarily
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.480]   and they're trying to bolt on investments
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.720]   or trying to bolt on mutual funds on top of that?
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.100]   That, to me, would probably be no.
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.400]   Is this a serious thing or is it an add-on to the business?
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.860]   And I think, Ben, the way you can tell
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:07.540]   is this a once-a-time meeting
[00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.100]   that we're gonna meet around April 15th or so
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.040]   to talk about taxes and investments together?
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.060]   That's probably an indication you're not gonna get
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.900]   ongoing financial planning investment management services.
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:17.760]   However, Ben, my observation would be
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.560]   if you have an investment person
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.800]   who's gonna meet with you, set up a schedule, 12/4/2,
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.160]   is Ritholtz Wealthway,
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.200]   and we're gonna meet throughout the year
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.840]   and talk about how to practically save me money in taxes,
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.260]   that, to me, reads like somebody
[00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.560]   who can handle their business.
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.000]   And then if they demonstrate a proficiency in tax,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:32.840]   that would be somebody
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.440]   who I'd consider investing in as well.
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.960]   - And the thing we've heard from clients is,
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.760]   listen, I have a great CPA,
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.480]   but they might not understand
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.020]   the rest of my whole financial plan
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:41.860]   and what I'm trying to do
[00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:42.900]   and what's going on in my investments.
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.920]   And they look at this stuff once a year,
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.940]   and that's not good enough to do planning
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:49.120]   and figuring out what should I do throughout the year
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.240]   and what lever should I pull.
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.240]   And that's the idea of the synergies involved here.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.200]   Sorry for the buzzword.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.520]   - Ooh, yeah, that hurts.
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.360]   That stung me.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.320]   But, Ben, I would argue that the difference is,
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.560]   for most of the accounting industry,
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.740]   for most of the tax industry,
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.520]   they are driving, look at the rear view mirror.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.400]   You're meeting them in January, February, March,
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.160]   and they're talking about what happened last year.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.080]   The tell for me is whether your CPA
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.560]   is talking about this year.
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.640]   Hey, let's talk about some charitable planning.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.000]   Let's think about a Roth conversion
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.040]   coming up in the future.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.300]   I noticed that you had a lot of capital gains distribution
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.240]   from this actively traded mutual fund or Oatly stock.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.520]   We've got some capital losses there.
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.920]   Sorry, Duncan, it hurts.
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.600]   Let's loss harvest.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.000]   That, to me, would be the indicator
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:25.960]   that you're dealing with somebody
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.320]   who's gonna handle this correctly.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.040]   - And do you agree with the way that they manage money?
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.800]   Does it make sense to you?
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.760]   Are you comfortable with the way
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.440]   that they manage money and their process?
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.980]   If you're comfortable with them doing your taxes,
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.200]   maybe it makes sense.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.580]   But I would make sure I get a holistic view
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:40.640]   of how are you gonna do this?
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.000]   What's the process look like?
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.240]   What's the communication going to be?
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.620]   But for the right practice,
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.160]   it certainly makes your life easier.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.000]   I think it should.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.600]   - What's the service model, too?
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.160]   Are they getting a commission for a sale?
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.960]   That I would run out the door from.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.560]   Is this an ongoing relationship
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.920]   that they're gonna be managing your assets
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.480]   as an investment fiduciary?
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.460]   Like Ritt Holtz Wealth Management, I'm a company man.
[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:00.520]   That's what I would look for.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.560]   Incentives matter, Ben.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.440]   They drive behavior.
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.040]   And that's what I'd be looking to screen out.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.040]   - But yeah, to your point,
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.080]   if you're someone who's managing a portfolio
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.660]   and you can help people save money in your taxes
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.680]   and you're doing it the right way, that's a client for life.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.520]   - Amen, amen.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:14.960]   - 'Cause people hate the tax stuff.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.800]   They hate it.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.500]   - And so if you can rebound on the basketball court, too,
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.360]   you've got Bill Arts,
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.760]   and you got a job here at Ritt Holtz Wealth.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.240]   So let's do it.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.500]   - But yeah, and I think the first sign
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.360]   is looking at something that is in your financial plan
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:27.880]   or your portfolio or your taxes
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.760]   that there was a mistake on in the past.
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.160]   And that's the kind of stuff that people just love to hear.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.880]   Like, hey, we found that you weren't doing this in the past.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:35.840]   Maybe someone misses.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.280]   That's the kind of stuff that you want to see
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.240]   that's like a positive, what are they called?
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.080]   What's the opposite of a red flag, a green flag?
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.400]   - Yeah, a green flag, yeah.
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.240]   - Checkered flag?
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.040]   - Yeah, yeah, let's go.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.400]   - All right, next question.
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.580]   - Okay, up next we have,
[00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.660]   I've changed my stance on mortgages over time.
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.820]   Before 2022, I was adamant about not paying it off again,
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:54.860]   even telling my friends
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:57.140]   that paying off my previous M was a mistake,
[00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.180]   especially in a low-rate environment.
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.180]   Now that rates have soared, I've had a change of heart.
[00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.260]   The interest payments have become much more significant,
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.420]   and I doubt I can consistently outperform
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.420]   an 8% annual return.
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:09.860]   Living in a high-tax state,
[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:12.460]   I have a relatively straightforward tax situation,
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.740]   which often leads me to choose the standard deduction
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.140]   over itemizing.
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:17.980]   This means the mortgage tax deduction
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.820]   isn't as advantageous anymore.
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.220]   We'll have to wait and see how it plays out
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.940]   in the coming years as it may expire or get extended.
[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:27.140]   I'm interested in hearing Bill's perspective on this.
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:27.980]   - All right, ask for my name again.
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.700]   - Oh, do I see a hand-drawn chart?
[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.620]   - Bill, I think you were the one who guided,
[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:33.740]   did you do another hand-drawn chart?
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:37.340]   - No, I didn't, I didn't, I let him down today.
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:38.740]   - I think you were one of the voices
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:40.540]   that really guided me on this a few years ago.
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.820]   We had a conversation, and you told me,
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.940]   I may never pay off my mortgage.
[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.580]   And I, 'cause I had a 15-year mortgage,
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.700]   and I thought, what am I doing?
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.140]   Why am I doing this, especially with a rate so low?
[00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:54.820]   And I refinanced back to a 30 at a 3% mortgage or whatever.
[00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:56.140]   - You're welcome, by the way.
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:59.020]   - Yes, but it made a lot of sense to me.
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.340]   Like, why the hurry?
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:03.540]   Obviously, I think that calculus changes a bit
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:04.620]   when we're talking about 8%,
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.380]   but how should taxes fit into the equation here,
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.900]   regardless of when you're paying it off?
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.780]   'Cause I do think, yeah, if you have a 3%,
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.700]   if you take inflation away and the tax break,
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:17.620]   I mean, I don't know, you're paying nothing, essentially,
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:20.140]   on your mortgage, after.
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:20.980]   - I wouldn't say nothing.
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:21.820]   Yeah, there's still some frictions,
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.940]   but let's just start with first principles, Ben.
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:26.300]   Like, would it make sense to pay off an 8% mortgage
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.460]   faster than a 3% mortgage?
[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:30.780]   Like, you don't need to have a tax program at your access
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:31.780]   to do the math there.
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.100]   John, can we show-- - Yeah, that's easy.
[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.380]   - Can we show a quick chart?
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:36.900]   Cumulative mortgage payments on a $300,000 loan,
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.460]   which, again, if you're putting 20% down,
[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:41.820]   that's probably a $400,000 house or so.
[00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:45.540]   30-year fixed, you're looking at an extra $300,000
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:46.620]   of mortgage interest.
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.860]   And the way this works, it's inverse compounding, right?
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.620]   That something that is compounding debt,
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.420]   paying it 5% differential, like, that's the gap.
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:57.940]   And it works similarly to compound interest,
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.460]   except it's compound debt, right?
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.500]   So it's the same principle, just in reverse.
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.340]   John, can we take the chart off?
[00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:03.180]   - I know this in theory,
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.340]   but seeing that as a chart is insane.
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:08.620]   - Yes, and that was, you know, December, 2019,
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:11.380]   December, 2012, and then there was another dip,
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:12.420]   Duncan, in 2019.
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:14.020]   But yeah, seeing it in real numbers,
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.380]   that's the difference between a $1,200 mortgage
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:17.900]   and a $2,000 mortgage, right?
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.940]   It's $800 every year for 30 years.
[00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.180]   These things add up on long timeframes, right?
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.180]   So that's the math there.
[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.580]   And yeah, 100%.
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:28.300]   So, but what the listener is getting at
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:29.700]   is for a standard deduction,
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.180]   just to put that into context, guys,
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:34.740]   a standard deduction in 2012 is almost $15,000.
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.300]   And so that means that your mortgage interest,
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:39.420]   real estate taxes, and charitable contributions
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.300]   should have to exceed $15,000 for a single filer,
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.540]   or almost $30,000 joint,
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.100]   in order for you to get a dollar of tax benefits.
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.740]   - Which is probably easier to do at 8%, though,
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:49.580]   than it is at three.
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.980]   - At 8%, it's a little bit easier hurdle to cross.
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.500]   However, again, I think the market
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:54.460]   has a lot to do with this, too.
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:56.460]   Ben, what is the risk-free rate right now?
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.620]   It's somewhere around 5%, right?
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.740]   Maybe 4.5, maybe it's 5.5, somewhere in that neighborhood.
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:01.820]   I haven't checked the US Treasury rates today.
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.940]   But at that rate, yes, you're losing money every year
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.820]   relative to what you can earn in cash.
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.820]   And so I think at an interest rate of that high,
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.020]   7.5, 8%, it makes sense, Ben,
[00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:14.180]   to inverse the thinking that we had back in 2012 to 2019,
[00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:16.260]   which was, hey, this 3% mortgage is an asset,
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:18.540]   I actually wanna hold onto this for longer time periods,
[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:21.220]   because the investment universe has shifted.
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:22.820]   And when rates shift as much as they have
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:24.780]   in the last two years, your thinking should shift, too.
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.660]   - And one of the questions we've been asked from people
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.860]   now that mortgage rates have come off of 8%
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:29.940]   is when do I refinance?
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.340]   So that's something we'll get into in a future show,
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.660]   but people are asking that as well,
[00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:35.740]   'cause you showed the 30-year chart.
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.700]   Hopefully, people that have an 8% mortgage
[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:39.860]   aren't gonna be paying that the rest of their life,
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:40.940]   they'll be able to refinance,
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.220]   and that would be part of the equation, too.
[00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:43.860]   And then maybe you can rethink,
[00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:46.660]   if you're paying extra now for 8%, that's great,
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.380]   but maybe you refinance down to 5% or 6%,
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:50.860]   and then you can rethink this equation.
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:52.620]   - Exactly, and that was the process, Ben,
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.520]   basically for my entire lifetime.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.740]   Ben, quick trivia question, unprompted.
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.460]   What was the all-time mortgage high in the United States
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:59.580]   for a 30-year fixed loan?
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:00.820]   Any idea, guess?
[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:02.500]   - 18, did it get to 18 or so?
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:03.340]   - Duncan, what do you think?
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.820]   What was the high?
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:05.940]   In 1981 or something?
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:06.780]   - 15?
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.500]   - Ben is on freakin' point.
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:11.940]   October 1981, 18.6% was the all-time
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.660]   30-year interest rate high.
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:15.660]   - But houses costed $1,600.
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:17.020]   - Well, they were giving away for free, right,
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.460]   to you guys coming home from the war.
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.820]   But no, from Grenada, I guess, in 1981.
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.860]   But no, but again, yes, it really, really sucks
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.260]   to see that big of a shift, but however,
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.500]   things have been quote-unquote worse in history.
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.240]   Yes, mortgage prices are much lower,
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.900]   but Ben, that was a pretty gnarly inflationary environment
[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:34.180]   coming out of the 1970s.
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:35.420]   Things could always get worse.
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.180]   So if you don't like the current interest rate environment,
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:38.380]   just wait.
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:39.220]   - Yes.
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.620]   - I mean, is there any reason to think
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.380]   that we could never see that again?
[00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.260]   Like, would there be government intervention?
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.340]   Like, would they prevent that from happening?
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:47.180]   - I don't know.
[00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:48.000]   That's a great question.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:48.900]   - The ghost of Paul Volcker comes back,
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.780]   and inflation is at 15%.
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.460]   - Yeah, one thing, if I was an economist
[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:53.540]   and I had some time to write a paper,
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.220]   I would take a look at the relationship
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.140]   between population growth and inflation rates.
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.580]   That's an interesting hypothesis.
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:27:59.820]   But no, if you kind of study Duncan,
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.940]   this stuff over like 6,000 years or human history,
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.900]   I mean, mortgage rates have hovered between 3% to 6%.
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.500]   Right, this is not crazy.
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:07.900]   So would that be low?
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.060]   Yeah, probably.
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.140]   But are we gonna see 18% any time soon?
[00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:11.980]   I really doubt that.
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.500]   - Are Bill and I ever going to get rid of our 3% mortgages?
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:15.340]   No.
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:16.940]   - Well, in 20, 26 and a half years.
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.540]   - I guess if your savings account paid 15%,
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:20.900]   then 18% doesn't sound that bad.
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:21.740]   - And that was the case.
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.220]   Yeah, look at the U.S. Treasury rate in 1981 as well.
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:25.420]   Great question, though.
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.260]   Great topic.
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:27.740]   - Our final question is a challenge
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:29.140]   to Bill Sweet's manhood.
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:29.980]   (laughs)
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:32.580]   - All right, this one's from Scott.
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.260]   I was listening to episode 86.
[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:35.260]   Wow, thanks for listening.
[00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:37.340]   We're now on 106.
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:38.820]   I was listening to episode 86,
[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.260]   and Bill Sweet mentioned the possibility
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:41.580]   of taking early withdrawals
[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:43.500]   from retirement accounts penalty-free
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.980]   if following the 72(t) rules.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:50.620]   One hair to split is that he said you have to be 55.
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.740]   But I didn't think 72(t) had any age restrictions
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.780]   on when you could start taking withdrawals.
[00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.100]   I'd appreciate clarification,
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.020]   because I'm considering an early retirement
[00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:01.620]   within the next few years at around age 50.
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.220]   And I was considering this option.
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.020]   I've never heard of 72(t), so you gotta,
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:06.860]   that sounds like a Star Wars thing.
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:07.700]   - I think Bill talked about it before.
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.100]   No not to brags this week,
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.620]   but we do have a nerd alert question of the week.
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:11.940]   But I think it probably makes sense,
[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:13.500]   'cause we do have a lot of people who ask,
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.260]   people who want to retire in their 50s.
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:16.100]   That is a thing.
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:16.940]   - Yeah.
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:17.780]   - So what do we think, Bill?
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.580]   - Well, I just added Scott to my list.
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.540]   Sam Bankrentfried was at the top.
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:22.580]   Vlad Sheetan is next.
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:25.060]   And Scott, I'm coming for you after him.
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:25.900]   But no, great question.
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.300]   But Scott, you got me.
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.140]   Guilty as charged.
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:30.300]   I was talking a little bit fast and loose with the tax code.
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:35.300]   I inadvertently confused 72(t) with the Rule of 55.
[00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:39.500]   The Rule of 55 kicks in if you retire at 55 or later.
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.180]   The Rule of 72(t) is a slightly different game.
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.980]   And to describe it, guys, for those listening at home,
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:49.580]   72(t) is a separate but equal periodic payments.
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:51.980]   And anybody at any age can turn these things on.
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:53.840]   But there's a huge catch to them.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.140]   That's once you turn on a SEP distribution,
[00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:59.100]   thou shalt not turn it off until age 59 1/2
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.980]   or a minimum of five years, whichever is longer.
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.420]   So if you start these things in your 30s,
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:07.340]   you're signing up for 30 years, 30 years of distributions.
[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:10.660]   The game, the goal, Ben, of 72(t) distribution
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:13.660]   is to avoid the 10% early distribution penalty.
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:14.480]   That's the goal.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.320]   That's what people are trying to achieve.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.660]   - So the whole thing about getting them early is,
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.940]   okay, fine, we're not going to charge you a penalty,
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:22.120]   but you still are going to have to pay the taxes
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.120]   on this stuff. - Pay the tax.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.700]   And then again, you can't turn it off.
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:25.540]   That's the key, right?
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:26.700]   - Right, you have to stay with it.
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.060]   It's almost like an RMD thing that starts early.
[00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.660]   - Exactly, and so if you turn them off at any point,
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.060]   you have to go back and pay the penalty,
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:35.700]   the extra 10% going back to the start.
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.320]   - So Scott's going to retire around 50.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.160]   - Yeah.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.300]   - He follows this rule of 72, which is what?
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.580]   Do you have to fill out some form or something?
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.920]   - 72(t), you basically make an election on a tax form,
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:45.860]   to the best of my understanding.
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.100]   You tell your IRA custodian, hey, this is what I'm doing.
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:49.300]   And then it's up to you to follow up
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.340]   and make that distribution every year.
[00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:54.460]   - But what are the required minimum distributions?
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:55.900]   Is it its own schedule?
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:56.820]   - I'm so glad you asked.
[00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:58.940]   So there's actually three different criteria
[00:30:58.940 --> 00:30:59.780]   to calculate them.
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:01.580]   But just to make it simple for listeners,
[00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:03.740]   it's somewhere between three and 6%
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:05.580]   of distributions at age 50.
[00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:06.780]   So it depends on the age
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.780]   and it depends on the prevailing interest rate.
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:13.460]   Today, the AFR, 130% of midterm AFR is 5.4%.
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.540]   So at that interest rate for Scott at age 50,
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.900]   he could sign up for either $3,000 a year
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:21.780]   or $6,000 a year per $100,000 in an IRA.
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:23.700]   So if we have a small amount of retirement balance,
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.220]   it probably isn't enough to live on, right?
[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:26.940]   $500 a month per 100K.
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:30.580]   But at $1,060,000 a year, that's not nothing, right?
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:33.700]   That's right around the medium income for a household today.
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:34.580]   So that's not terrible.
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:36.140]   It's not a bad option.
[00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:37.780]   And then one quick planning point,
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:40.180]   you can actually change the method once.
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:44.420]   So you can dial down from a $6,000 or $3,000 or three to six.
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:47.140]   There's some really funky complex rules on how that works.
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.140]   But ultimately, it's an interesting option
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.620]   for people looking to access retirement funds early.
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:54.780]   My opinion, not as flexible as rule 55.
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:57.300]   And that's why, again, Brain Soup got him a little bit
[00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:58.180]   confused on the show.
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.580]   Credit to you, Bill, for, yep, he gotcha.
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:02.580]   Hey, when you're wrong, you own it, you fix it,
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:03.660]   you move on down the road.
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:05.140]   Well, it's part of the fun of all this tax stuff.
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.420]   You know, they keep it convoluted,
[00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:07.220]   so it's kind of like a game.
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:08.540]   There's a lot of numbers involved.
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:09.620]   And it changes every year, yeah.
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:12.220]   So back to hiring, for me, the type of person
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:13.700]   that this work appeals to, people
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.420]   who like solving complex puzzles,
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.840]   except every once in a while, the IRS, the SEC, whoever,
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.540]   they just come and they shake the whole board up, right?
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:21.140]   So you have to start all over again,
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:21.980]   and they change the picture.
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:22.900]   Got to keep it fresh.
[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.020]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:25.460]   But it is a challenge, it's a fun,
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:27.580]   and I'm glad to be working with you guys.
[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:29.980]   I think it is kind of funny, though.
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:31.900]   Retiring in your 50s now seems early.
[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:33.020]   I feel like our kids are going to live
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.220]   till they're 100 or something.
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.740]   So I feel like retiring in your 60s
[00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:37.140]   is going to be considered early at some point.
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:37.580]   It's going to shift.
[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:38.180]   Is that the Rick Edelman thing?
[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:39.300]   People are going to go back to school,
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:41.800]   like in their 50s and 60s, and kind of reboot their career?
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.180]   That's why they need Bitcoin.
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:44.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:46.140]   Because they're going to wish to be 100.
[00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:47.860]   This is not investment advice, do you know that?
[00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:50.100]   Not investment advice, a jerk.
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:51.380]   All right.
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:52.460]   Yeah, thanks, Tim.
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.860]   The Bitcoin explainer, yeah, that was a wild--
[00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:57.580]   I do have a follow-up on that, Ben, I meant to ask you.
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:00.340]   Are you really still holding from $3,000?
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:02.780]   Yes, but again, I didn't put that much money in then.
[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:03.820]   I mean, you're a hodler.
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:06.300]   I haven't sold-- anything I put in, I haven't sold.
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.420]   I don't know if you knew that, but you're a hodler.
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:09.300]   You're a hodler, Ben.
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:10.060]   I guess so.
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:12.180]   Diamond eyes or diamond hands, something like that?
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:14.620]   I sold too much in the $20,000 range.
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:17.900]   Listen, I probably should have sold before and rebalanced it
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:18.460]   a little bit.
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:20.540]   But I did so much tax-loss harvesting
[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:23.460]   when it was at $14 or $15, now that I'm sitting on huge gains,
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.660]   so now I don't want to sell.
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:25.380]   I'm still laughing from the--
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:26.260]   Because it's in a taxable account.
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:27.880]   I'm still laughing from the free show,
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.460]   Duncan leaving his Oatly stock to Ben at his own timely
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:31.340]   passing.
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:32.860]   Yeah, well, it's not happening now.
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:33.420]   Maybe Ben can leave you.
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:34.620]   I know it's not safe with Ben.
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:35.740]   Bill's going to write a will out,
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:38.180]   and we're going to have you sign it or-- yeah.
[00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:40.300]   Cost bases step up on death, but I don't
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:41.540]   wish that for any of you guys.
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:43.760]   So let's keep this man together.
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:46.560]   All right, so last week, we tried to record early
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.180]   and put a different time.
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:48.020]   We didn't like it.
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:49.860]   Now we're going at a different time for production schedule
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:50.100]   wise.
[00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.580]   We're going 50 minutes early, so thanks to everyone
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.420]   who showed up live, as always.
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:56.520]   We'll be going 115 Eastern to mix it up with the regulars.
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.520]   If anyone wants to hop in here in the live chat,
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.980]   we'd appreciate it.
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:01.380]   Yep, keep sending those questions.

[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:10.500]   I'll take you off my list, Scott.
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.220]   See you, everyone.
