[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880]   When you're doing that kind of back and forth on a topic like the economy, which you have,
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:13.320]   to me, perhaps I'm naive, but it seems both incredible and incredibly complex.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.720]   The economy, the trading, the transactions, that these transactions between two individuals
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.520]   somehow add up to this giant mechanism.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:29.080]   You've put out a 30 minute video, you have a lot of incredible videos online that people
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.600]   should definitely watch on YouTube, but you've put out this 30 minute video titled How the
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.800]   Economic Machine Works.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.760]   That is probably one of the best, if not the best video I've seen on the internet in terms
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.520]   of educational videos.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.260]   So people should definitely watch it, especially because it's not that the individual components
[00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.080]   of the video are somehow revolutionary, but the simplicity and the clarity of the different
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.280]   components just makes you ... There's a few light bulb moments there about how the economy
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.040]   works as a machine.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.200]   So as you described, there's three main forces that drive the economy, productivity growth,
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.360]   short term debt cycle, long term debt cycle.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:19.040]   The former productivity growth is how much value people create, valuable things people
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.040]   create.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.620]   The latter is people borrowing from their future selves to hopefully create those valuable
[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.360]   things faster.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.720]   So this is an incredible system to me.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.200]   Maybe we can linger on it a little bit, but you've also said what most people think about
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.000]   as money is actually credit.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.840]   Total amount of credit in the US is $50 trillion.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.320]   Total amount of money is $3 trillion.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.280]   That's just crazy to me.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.120]   Maybe I'm silly, maybe you can educate me, but that seems crazy.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.340]   It gives me just pause that human civilization has been able to create a system that has
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.240]   so much credit.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:07.300]   So that's a long way to ask, do you think credit is good or bad for society?
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.140]   That system that's so fundamentally based on credit.
[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.860]   I think credit is great, even though people often overdo it.
[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:26.780]   Credit is that somebody has earned money and what happens is they lend it to somebody else
[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.380]   who's got better ideas and they cut a deal and then that person with the better ideas
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.620]   is going to pay it back.
[00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:40.220]   And if it works well, it helps resource allocations go well, providing people like the entrepreneurs
[00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.580]   and all of those, they need capital.
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.260]   They don't have capital themselves.
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.900]   And so somebody is going to give them capital and they'll give them credit along those lines.
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.980]   Then what happens is it's not managed well in a variety of ways.
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.780]   So I did another book on principles, principles of big debt crises that go into that.
[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.980]   And it's free by the way, I put it free online as a PDF.
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.140]   So if you go online and you look principles for big debt crisis is under my name, you
[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.980]   can download it in a PDF or you can buy a print book of it and it goes through that
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.140]   particular process.
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.060]   And so you always have it overdone in always the same way.
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.180]   Everything by the way, almost everything happens over and over again for the same reasons.
[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.180]   So these debt crises all happen over and over again for the same reasons.
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.620]   They get it overdone.
[00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.180]   In the book it explains how you identify whether it's overdone or not.
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.180]   They get it overdone and then you go through the process of making the adjustments according
[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.460]   that and then, and it explains how they can use the levers and so on.
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:53.000]   If you didn't have credit, then you would be sort of, everybody sort of be stuck.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.300]   So credit is a good thing, but it can easily be overdone.
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.980]   So now we get into the question, what is money?
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:02.980]   What is credit?
[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.980]   Okay.
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.380]   You get into money and credit.
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.340]   So if you're holding credit and you think that's worthwhile, keep in mind that the central
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.660]   bank, let's say it can print the money.
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.300]   What does that prompt?
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.740]   You have an IOU and the IOU says you're going to get a certain number of dollars, let's
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.420]   say, or yen or euros.
[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.820]   And that is what the IOU is.
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.020]   And so the question is, will you get that money and what will it be worth?
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.340]   And then also you have a government, which is a participant in that process because they
[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.620]   want, they are on the hook, they owe money.
[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.060]   And then will they print the money to make it easy for everybody to pay?
[00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.060]   So you have to pay attention to those two.
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.220]   I would suggest like you, you recommend to other people, just take that 30 minutes and
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.700]   it, and it, and it comes across pretty clearly.
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.500]   But my conclusion is that of course you want it.
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:04.660]   And even if you understand it and the cycles well, you can benefit from those cycles rather
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.860]   than to be hurt by those cycles.
[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.700]   Because I don't know the way the cycle works is somebody gets over indebted, they have
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.100]   to sell an asset.
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.100]   Okay.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.840]   Then I don't know, maybe that's when assets become cheaper.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.560]   How do you acquire the asset?
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.500]   It's a whole process.
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.500]   Okay.
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.500]   Thank you.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.500]   [inaudible]
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.500]   [inaudible]
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.500]   [inaudible]
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.500]   [inaudible]
