[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.720]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.860]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.240]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.440]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.400]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.040]   My guest today is Dr. Victor Karian.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.840]   Dr. Victor Karian is a professor
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.880]   and the vice chair of psychiatry and behavioral sciences
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.240]   at Stanford University School of Medicine.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.100]   He is one of the world's foremost experts
[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.040]   on post-traumatic stress disorder,
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.420]   in particular, the treatment
[00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.040]   of post-traumatic stress disorder
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.660]   in children and adolescents.
[00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.680]   Although his knowledge and today's discussion
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.920]   certainly extends to adult PTSD as well.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.760]   Dr. Karian is also the director
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.840]   of the Stanford Early Life Stress and Resilience Program.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.680]   And today's discussion focuses on the psychological
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.800]   and the neurobiological underpinnings of PTSD,
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.380]   and which treatments are most effective for PTSD.
[00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.260]   We focus heavily on a particular therapy
[00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.620]   called Q-centered therapy
[00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.060]   that was developed by Dr. Karian and colleagues,
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.660]   that has been shown to offset the triggering
[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.300]   by words or events or memories
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.620]   that often are the precursors to PTSD episodes.
[00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.820]   And this has been shown to be effective
[00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.960]   in both children and adults.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.800]   Today's discussion explores the difference
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.700]   between anxiety, stress, and trauma.
[00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.920]   We talk about how those things of course are related,
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.700]   but how they can be separated out to better understand
[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.340]   if indeed somebody has trauma
[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.220]   and how to best approach the treatment of that trauma.
[00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.260]   As you'll soon see what makes Dr. Karian's work
[00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.140]   so unique is that it combines the psychological,
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.000]   the neurobiological, but also practical tools,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.460]   such as mindfulness.
[00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.060]   It relates mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy
[00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.340]   to the underlying biology and what's known
[00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.780]   about the psychiatry and psychology of PTSD
[00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.140]   at its different stages,
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.740]   depending on the trauma, the age of the person, et cetera.
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.420]   Today, Dr. Karian clearly explains all of that
[00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.400]   so that by the end of today's conversation,
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.980]   you'll really understand what PTSD is and is not.
[00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.400]   And of course, the best ways to treat it.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.220]   Before you begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.140]   that this podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.740]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.900]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.500]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.160]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.260]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.860]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.780]   Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.460]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.100]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.140]   Now I've spoken many times before on this podcast
[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.260]   about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.820]   of quality sleep each night.
[00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.940]   That's truly the foundation of all mental health,
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.540]   physical health, and performance.
[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.780]   And one of the best ways to ensure
[00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.100]   that you get a great night's sleep
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.620]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.900]   And that's because in order to fall
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.360]   and stay deeply asleep,
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.140]   your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.680]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.180]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.120]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.700]   about one to three degrees.
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.280]   Eight Sleep makes it incredibly easy
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.500]   to control the temperature of your sleeping environment
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.060]   by allowing you to control the temperature
[00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.180]   of your mattress cover at the beginning, middle,
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.380]   and end of the night.
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.020]   And it turns out the ability to do so
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.520]   allows you to get the maximum amount of deep sleep,
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.920]   slow wave sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.900]   at the different stages of the night.
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.560]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.820]   for nearly four years now,
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.660]   and it has completely transformed
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.240]   and improved the quality of my sleep.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.380]   Eight Sleep has now launched their newest generation
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.020]   of the pod cover, the Pod4 Ultra.
[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.180]   The Pod4 Ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity,
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.380]   higher fidelity sleep tracking technology,
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.840]   and even has snoring detection
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.140]   that will automatically lift your head a few degrees
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.520]   to improve your airflow and stop your snoring.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.660]   If you'd like to try an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.060]   go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.620]   to save up to $350 off their Pod4 Ultra.
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.180]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.720]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.840]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.980]   Today's episode is also brought to us by BetterHelp.
[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.780]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.740]   with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online.
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.620]   I've been doing weekly therapy for well over 30 years.
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.820]   Initially, I didn't have a choice.
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.080]   It was the condition of being allowed to stay in school,
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.100]   but pretty soon I realized
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.180]   that doing regular quality therapy
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.840]   is an extremely important component to overall health.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.660]   In fact, I consider doing regular therapy
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.380]   just as important as getting regular physical exercise,
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.220]   including cardiovascular exercise and resistance training,
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.460]   which of course I also do every single week.
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.200]   There are essentially three components to excellent therapy.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.660]   First of all, excellent therapy
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.580]   should provide good rapport with somebody
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.620]   that you can trust and talk to about all issues in your life.
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.480]   Second of all, it should provide support
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.920]   in the form of emotional support
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.700]   or directed guidance or both.
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.220]   And thirdly, expert therapy should provide useful insights,
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.020]   insights that can allow you to do better,
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.500]   not just in your emotional life and relationship life,
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.780]   but of course also your relationship to yourself,
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:36.740]   your professional life,
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.940]   and all of your career and life goals.
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.440]   With BetterHelp, they make it very easy
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.680]   to find an expert therapist
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.260]   with whom you can build all three
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.060]   of these effective components of therapy.
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.480]   If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.180]   you can go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.020]   to get 10% off your first month.
[00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.420]   Again, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.620]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Waking Up.
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.160]   Waking Up is a meditation app
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.620]   that offers hundreds of guided meditation programs,
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.000]   mindfulness trainings, yoga nidra sessions, and more.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.440]   I started practicing meditation
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.280]   when I was about 15 years old
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.920]   and it made a profound impact on my life.
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.280]   And by now there are thousands
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.880]   of quality peer-reviewed studies
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.120]   that emphasize how useful mindfulness meditation can be
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.880]   for improving our focus, managing stress and anxiety,
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.160]   improving our mood, and much more.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.000]   In recent years,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.460]   I started using the Waking Up app for my meditations
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.620]   because I find it to be a terrific resource
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.380]   for allowing me to really be consistent
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.180]   with my meditation practice.
[00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.140]   Many people start a meditation practice
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.580]   and experience some benefits,
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.340]   but many people also have challenges
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.980]   keeping up with that practice.
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.500]   What I and so many other people love
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.540]   about the Waking Up app
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.460]   is that it has a lot of different meditations
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.340]   to choose from.
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.900]   And those meditations are of different durations.
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.020]   So it makes it very easy
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.980]   to keep up with your meditation practice,
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.880]   both from the perspective of novelty.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.580]   You never get tired of those meditations.
[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.160]   There's always something new to explore
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.400]   and to learn about yourself
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.800]   and about the effectiveness of meditation.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.500]   And you can always fit meditation into your schedule,
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.300]   even if you only have two or three minutes per day
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.460]   in which to meditate.
[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.000]   If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.840]   please go to wakingup.com/huberman
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.920]   where you can access a free 30-day trial.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.820]   Again, that's wakingup.com/huberman
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.860]   to access a free 30-day trial.
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.180]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Victor Carreon.
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.220]   Dr. Victor Carreon, welcome.
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.060]   - Thank you.
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.900]   Thank you so much for having me.
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.180]   - I'd like to talk today about PTSD,
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.680]   post-traumatic stress disorder,
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.120]   in particular in young people, but also in adults.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.020]   But before we do that,
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.860]   can you educate us on the definition of stress
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.980]   and maybe distinguish between short-term stress
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.780]   and long-term stress?
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.300]   And then perhaps we can segue into PTSD.
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.660]   - That's a very good way of starting
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.780]   because in reality, my main interest
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.100]   was the role of stress and the role of stressors
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:59.100]   and how stressors really would activate the gene makeup
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.100]   and make us vulnerable to things
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.000]   that we might be vulnerable.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.820]   But at the time when I was training,
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:12.100]   everything psychiatry as a field was very diagnosis-based.
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.140]   So you needed an anchor.
[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.980]   And hence, I used PTSD to communicate
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.340]   what I was really referring to.
[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.360]   But the reality is that the experience of stress,
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.700]   as we now know, is a spectrum
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:31.700]   from beneficial to not beneficial to traumatic.
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.020]   So it really, stress operates in our lives
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.020]   as an inverted U-shaped curve.
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.340]   The more stress we have, the better we perform,
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.180]   the better we do.
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.380]   If we don't care about that exam
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.720]   that we're gonna have tomorrow, we'll probably fail.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.180]   So it's good to be somewhat stressed, right?
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.420]   Vaccines are a stress in the system.
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:58.420]   So we'll talk about this, I hope,
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:03.420]   but I'm very concerned also about the overprotection of kids
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.180]   to protect them from any type of stress
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:09.980]   because it is through this experience of early stress
[00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:14.540]   that of us develop our problem-solving abilities.
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.100]   And we become aware of our coping mechanisms.
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.360]   We become aware of our support system.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.780]   How can I manage that stress?
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.080]   And we can, we can manage stress
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.160]   because in the same way that through the process
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.220]   of homeostasis, we process,
[00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.420]   we have a range of temperatures, right,
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:37.980]   in which we can live, the same thing with stress.
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:42.820]   We can actually cope up to a certain point.
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.180]   After a certain point, it's not homeostasis anymore,
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.480]   and it turns into what we call allostasis,
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.420]   when it really starts having
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.040]   a physiological cost to the body.
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.920]   So in that inverted U-shaped curve,
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.660]   there's that optimal point where your health,
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.260]   your happiness, your performance, everything is better
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.460]   because of the stress you've been having.
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:10.020]   But after that optimal point, all of those outcomes,
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.180]   health, performance, start to decline.
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.260]   Happiness starts to decline.
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.520]   And it is in that second part of the curve
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.140]   where we find traumatic stress.
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.380]   Traumatic stress being a type of stress
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.200]   that is not only something you have to cope with,
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.200]   but it actually puts your physical integrity in jeopardy.
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:37.500]   It's a threat, and you have to manage that.
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.060]   And when you experience traumatic stress,
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.660]   many outcomes are possible.
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.500]   One is that you're resilient,
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.780]   and we'll talk a little bit about that as well, I hope.
[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.940]   But another one is that you may develop symptoms
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.300]   of post-traumatic stress disorder.
[00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.940]   And the reason that I didn't anchor on the diagnosis
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.460]   right away from the outset,
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:03.300]   and I was interested in studying stressors,
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:07.740]   is because many kids, we were seeing many kids
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:12.740]   that had symptoms of PTSD without having the diagnosis
[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:18.020]   that were demonstrating functional impairment.
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.200]   So they were not doing well in school,
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.180]   they were not doing well with their relationships,
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.500]   they were experiencing distress, right?
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.500]   So their function was affected,
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.120]   yet they didn't have the diagnosis.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.540]   So the diagnosis is good in that it's there,
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:39.540]   and it is a behavioral definition that we can anchor in,
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.640]   but there's more nuance to that.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.900]   So then that shows the whole spectrum.
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.020]   And of course, we can come out of PTSD,
[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.860]   and we can go back to that optimal point.
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.140]   So we don't want to get rid of stress,
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:59.580]   but we just want to return to that optimal point.
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.620]   And treatment is available,
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.340]   and people can recover from PTSD,
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.460]   and especially kids can recover from PTSD.
[00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:13.260]   But there's one thing that really gets in the way,
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.780]   and that's something that in my team we call,
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:21.020]   we have a phrase that we say, "PTSD feeds on avoidance."
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.380]   If we pretend that something didn't happen,
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.820]   if we pretend that it will go away,
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.940]   if we pretend that treatment is not necessary,
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.880]   then that's when it gets complicated.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.180]   And it gets complicated with substance abuse,
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.060]   it gets complicated with self-injurious behaviors,
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.620]   and then at that point, it becomes harder to treat.
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.340]   - Is it also possible that PTSD gets worse
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.900]   if we tend to look at it over and over again,
[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.900]   ruminate on it in the absence
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.580]   of any structured clinical support?
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:57.540]   Meaning if people perseverate on their traumas,
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.460]   can the negative impact of those traumas
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.620]   actually root deeper into us?
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.160]   - It's interesting that you use the word perseverate,
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.500]   because one of the characteristics of trauma
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:14.500]   when it affects children is that it robs them from play.
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.960]   Play is something that's essential in development,
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:22.960]   it's how we grow socially, emotionally, physically.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.040]   But when play becomes traumatic play,
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.920]   it becomes non-joyful,
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.360]   but it becomes perseverant and repetitive.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.660]   This is the attempt of the individual
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.960]   to try to make sense of what happened.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:41.960]   And the reason why it's not good to be alone with it
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:47.320]   and kind of perseverate on it by oneself
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.720]   is that we're probably not looking at the right insult.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.320]   So in our experience,
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:59.320]   usually PTSD doesn't result from that one traumatic event.
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.840]   We all carry a backpack,
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.760]   and we can all carry all the stressors
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.340]   that have come our way, like we were saying before.
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.280]   But if you're five, six, seven years old,
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.240]   and that backpack gets really heavy,
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.560]   you can fall backwards.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.440]   And when you fall backwards,
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.680]   that's because you don't have the tools, really,
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.080]   to carry that.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.280]   But what I'm saying is that it is the accumulation
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:30.320]   of stressors, some of which may be traumatic,
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.480]   that cause the symptoms of PTSD.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.780]   So for example, some of us went to Haiti
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.120]   after an earthquake, right?
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.020]   And I was starting my program at that time,
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.520]   I was very young, all ready to talk about earthquakes
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.320]   and know everything about earthquakes.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.720]   It was the last thing they wanted to talk about.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.120]   They saw the earthquake as an opportunity
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.080]   to talk about the violence they had been experiencing,
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.820]   the poverty, the lack of education.
[00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.200]   So they were talking to me about everything
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.140]   they were carrying that led some of them
[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.760]   to develop symptoms of PTSD.
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:05.680]   - I see.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.120]   As you describe these other aspects of one's life
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:14.960]   that can have negative impact, poverty, violence, et cetera,
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.480]   I get the impression that PTSD can be caused
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.360]   by a single event or trauma,
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.040]   but that there's a cumulative aspect to it.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.800]   So is it the case that in children,
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.160]   because their brain is far more plastic, we know this,
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.840]   I mean, brain circuits are modified
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.800]   even by passive experience in childhood,
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.240]   whereas in adulthood it requires focused attention
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.800]   in order to learn, unless it's a negative event,
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:40.840]   for better or worse,
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.160]   that in kids it takes far fewer
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.960]   or less intense negative experiences
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.920]   in order to create PTSD because the brain is so plastic?
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:57.720]   Or is there a similarity between youth and adult PTSD?
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:02.640]   - Epidemiological studies confirm your assertion.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.360]   Children, we think, we usually,
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.280]   you know, one line that I really don't like
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.720]   is children are resilient,
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.480]   because children are really not.
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.400]   They're more vulnerable.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.600]   They have the opportunity to become resilient
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.640]   if we help them and we tell them what tools to use
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.560]   and how to develop and all of that,
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.600]   but they are more vulnerable to PTSD,
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.400]   and part of it might be that neuroplasticity,
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.960]   and this is why we care for them, right?
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.800]   This is why we protect them and give them safety,
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.240]   because they are vulnerable.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:39.880]   By the same token, that neuroplasticity can work both ways,
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.840]   because if PTSD is teaching us
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:47.360]   that the environment can have an impact on biology,
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.880]   that's the only lesson, right?
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.000]   Environment can have an impact on biology.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.280]   In PTSD, it's a negative impact
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:59.560]   because of a negative stress or accumulation of stressors,
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.400]   but that also means that if the impact is positive,
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.120]   as in a good supportive system or as in psychotherapy,
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:12.120]   that recovery can actually happen in an easier way.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.280]   - Before we talk about therapeutic interventions,
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.240]   I'm curious about genetic predisposition,
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.280]   and a topic that comes up a lot
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:26.280]   anytime the letters PTSD are stated in that order
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:30.560]   is transgenerational trauma.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.440]   I can imagine at least two forms
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.200]   of transgenerational trauma.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:39.200]   One is a generation of what are now grandparents
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.720]   or great-grandparents or parents
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.240]   are impacted by some trauma,
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.800]   either in the family or maybe in culture
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.720]   or even broader scale.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:53.360]   And then discussions about that pass through generations,
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:58.360]   impact the children, and therefore their adult life.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.640]   I could also imagine,
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.720]   and I think this is normally what people are referring to
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.640]   when they talk about transgenerational trauma,
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:08.200]   this idea that somehow the genome is modified by the trauma
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.520]   such that even if kids are raised by parents
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.960]   that adopted them or they have no contact
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.920]   with the grandparents or great-grandparents
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.720]   that experienced the trauma,
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.760]   that somehow they are more vulnerable to,
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.520]   or in some cases, the idea has been put forward,
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.360]   carry that trauma, put in air quotes,
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.840]   such that their life is more difficult,
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.280]   even though they never had a direct experience
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.440]   of that trauma.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.280]   What are your thoughts
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.640]   about transgenerational passage of trauma, both forms,
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.520]   both the narrative passage,
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:42.720]   as well as the potential for epigenomic
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.480]   or genomic passage of transgenerational trauma?
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.720]   - No, this is a very interesting subject.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.840]   The jury is still out if genomic changes
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.200]   that result as a consequence of stress
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.400]   can be passed from one generation to the other.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.480]   But certainly the genes that made one generation vulnerable
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.920]   are being passed to the next generation as well,
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.960]   that we know.
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.220]   So it can be passed that way.
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:13.400]   But what happens is that there's also
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.920]   this impact of learning.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.720]   And I have treated kids that come to me
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.720]   with all of the symptoms of PTSD,
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.360]   and there's no trauma.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.920]   I cannot find the trauma,
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.560]   and the parent cannot find the trauma,
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.160]   and the kid doesn't report a trauma.
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.560]   But when I'm talking with the parent,
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.320]   the trauma becomes evident in the history of the parent.
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.840]   So the parent has developed PTSD
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.360]   and behaves in a way that has been learned
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.160]   by the new generation,
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:49.160]   ways like avoidance, or re-experience,
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:54.560]   or hyper-vigilance, or lack of trust, things like that.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.400]   So certainly, there are pathways
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.040]   in which it can go from one generation to the other.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:05.400]   And we know that the battle between nature and nurture
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.880]   is pretty much over, right?
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:11.320]   We know that they both influence vulnerability
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.600]   and that they both interact.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.280]   And I imagine that's what's happening
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.480]   in some of these situations.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.720]   - In terms of stress,
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:26.440]   I always think of stress as both a response within the brain
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.200]   and a response within the body.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.440]   And I'm not alone in that belief, I think.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.360]   We know that adrenaline, epinephrine,
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.880]   is released from the adrenals,
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.960]   but also from areas of the brain like locus coeruleus,
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.120]   so that there's this parallel effect
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.280]   of elevated states of mind, more alert,
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.160]   more focused on narrow locations in space and time.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.760]   And the body is also prepared for action.
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.000]   I think this is what underlies the increased heart rate,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.840]   the, you know, shaking in some cases, sweating.
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.380]   It's essentially a preparation for action.
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:03.800]   With PTSD, I often hear that some of the symptoms
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.560]   are more of the opposite end of the spectrum
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.680]   in terms of autonomic arousal, right?
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:12.720]   Things like dissociation, fatigue,
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:16.640]   kind of checking out, which I realize is dissociation.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.360]   But things that are more akin
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.280]   to kind of parasympathetic, right?
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.120]   For those that don't know,
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.400]   the sympathetic/parasympathetic
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.600]   represents the continuum of autonomic interaction.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.680]   Sympathetic having nothing to do with emotional sympathy.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.700]   It's all about fight or flight type responses.
[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:31.960]   Although at lower levels,
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.320]   it's what's responsible for us being alert here,
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.840]   but not in fight or flight.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:40.060]   And parasympathetic being more of the rest and digest,
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.820]   even leading into sleep type responses.
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:47.820]   - So, you know, if somebody experiences a big stressor,
[00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:51.980]   a trauma, or chronic stress to the point
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.300]   where it becomes PTSD,
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.420]   is there a tendency for them to be more hypervigilant
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.480]   and have a, you know, a startle response,
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:03.380]   to have their head on a swivel all the time,
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:06.900]   looking for danger, or to be more dissociative,
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:11.380]   or can both sets of phenotypes exist in the same person?
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.620]   - Yeah.
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:13.460]   No, this is very interesting.
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.860]   While we're talking about the letters,
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.900]   let me say that a lot of people
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.580]   call post-traumatic stress disorder
[00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.860]   post-traumatic stress injury.
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.060]   Not considering it a disorder,
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.360]   but considering it something
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.700]   that where our fight or flight mechanism,
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.580]   the autonomic nervous system,
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.140]   has been desensitized,
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:35.440]   and we need to regulate it again.
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.700]   And it's gonna hurt.
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:38.580]   It's gonna be painful.
[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.540]   It's just like when you break your arm
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:41.980]   and go to the emergency room,
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:45.300]   and it hurts to be placed back in place,
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.340]   but it's the cure, is what cures it.
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.620]   So a lot of people visualize,
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.820]   and sometimes I do, as an injury,
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.420]   rather than a disorder.
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.180]   - Post-traumatic stress injury.
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.000]   - Injury.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:55.840]   - Interesting.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.260]   - And so what happens?
[00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.060]   So this autonomic system gets activated.
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.620]   We have our fight or flight reaction.
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.380]   But what happens to a young kid?
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:07.380]   Because they're very little, and they cannot fight.
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:11.700]   They're also very dependent, and they cannot flight.
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.060]   So they're stuck.
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.500]   They're stuck there.
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.340]   So they freeze.
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:18.540]   They freeze, and that's dissociation.
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.500]   It's actually, during development,
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:24.580]   a healthy defense mechanism.
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:27.180]   But very much like a white blood cell,
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.500]   that's very helpful,
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.620]   if you have too much of it,
[00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.360]   you develop a leukemia.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.660]   You can develop dissociative disorders
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.160]   if that's the only thing you have.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.660]   But it does help children cope
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.620]   with some of these situations,
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.220]   pretending this is not real,
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.040]   or this is not happening to me.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.120]   It's the only thing they have left.
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:56.540]   And because this arousal system is so key
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:00.300]   in the development of these children,
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.980]   I thought that we should look at the hormone cortisol
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:05.480]   in the kids.
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.660]   And when I started, when I was a fellow
[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:11.180]   doing my child psychiatry fellowship,
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:13.940]   I was seeing all types of kids
[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.400]   with all kinds of issues.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.100]   Some had ADHD, some had OCD,
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.360]   some had PTSD symptoms.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.780]   But I was getting a lot of kids with notes
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:30.140]   from school saying, "This kid has ADHD.
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.900]   "Please place on Ritalin," right?
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.100]   A stimulant medication.
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.500]   And I'm like, "Wow, the diagnosis has been made.
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.120]   "There's already a treatment plan.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.980]   "What am I training here for?" (laughs)
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:45.620]   But in some instances, they were right.
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:46.820]   The kids had ADHD.
[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.860]   But in most cases, what happened is that
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.900]   that hypervigilance that you're talking about
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:56.780]   was being misinterpreted as hyperactivity.
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:01.140]   And the dissociation was being misinterpreted
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.460]   as inattentiveness.
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.540]   So the kids were getting a diagnosis
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:06.700]   that was not correct.
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.700]   Of course, there are other very complex cases
[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.440]   where you have both ADHD and PTSD.
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.960]   Also, ADHD can put you at risk to develop PTSD
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.440]   'cause you're not as attentive
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.840]   as to what's happening in your environment.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.600]   But there are definitely two different conditions.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:27.080]   And it was that clinical observation
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.640]   that made me think, well,
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.440]   people don't know enough about PTSD.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.680]   And certainly they don't know enough
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.880]   about PTSD in children.
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.680]   And we were having some research in adults
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.360]   around that time in terms of cortisol levels.
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.040]   David Spiegel, who you've had here,
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.360]   Rachel Yehuda at the Bronx VA,
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:49.020]   looking at PTSD in adults.
[00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:52.080]   But I said, "But how does PTSD look early on?
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.240]   "What's happening in the hypothalamic
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.180]   "pituitary adrenal axis that is responsible
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:00.480]   "for secreting cortisol and regulate cortisol
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:03.200]   "when these children are young?"
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.520]   Because this is a new axis.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:10.120]   Is it already not working or is it working right?
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.800]   And so we did a number of studies
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.600]   that demonstrated that the normal circadian
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:19.040]   rhythmicity of cortisol was there.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.720]   It was higher early in the morning,
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.680]   which we need to jump out of bed.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.340]   And as the day progresses, it decreases.
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:31.360]   Very helpful, it goes up when we are stressed,
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.320]   like when we have lunch.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.200]   After we have lunch, cortisol goes up, right?
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.800]   So that we can help manage
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.460]   the insult of digestion or whatever.
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:42.240]   And these kids were having those levels.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:46.100]   But something was happening in a number of studies.
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:50.340]   And we noted that the pre-bedtime level was higher.
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:53.040]   We were measuring it at different times.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.240]   In the morning, pre-breakfast, pre-lunch,
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.640]   pre-dinner, pre-bedtime.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.040]   But it was the pre-bedtime level
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:03.680]   that wouldn't come as low as the healthy controls.
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.880]   It would remain high.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.680]   And this was also important clinically
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:12.360]   because many of the symptoms these kids were having
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.440]   were happening at night.
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.680]   Aneurysis, right?
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:20.120]   Bedwetting, nightmares, not sleeping deep enough,
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:24.280]   not sleeping long enough, fears.
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:30.840]   At that point, I felt, well, we don't know anything
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.760]   other than the cortisol pre-bedtime is elevated, right?
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.480]   Maybe they need it to be.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.320]   Who knows?
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:42.160]   But I was concerned about the work by Sapolsky, right?
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.480]   And Bruce McEwen, his mentor,
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.640]   demonstrating the neurotoxicity
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:51.760]   that glucocorticoids can have in key areas of the brain.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.960]   Areas in the limbic system and the cortical system.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.480]   Which, interestingly enough,
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.680]   have a lot of glucocorticoid receptors.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:04.720]   So then we decided to look at brain structure
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:08.920]   and brain function in youth with PTSD symptoms
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:13.280]   and see how this cortisol would relate to that or not.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:17.080]   And we did that through MRI, magnetic resonance imaging.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.720]   - Let's talk about cortisol for a moment.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.520]   It's a topic that has not received enough attention
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.960]   in previous episodes of the podcast.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.880]   I'm just going to summarize a little bit of what you said
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.640]   and you'll tell me where I'm wrong.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.560]   Cortisol starts to rise
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.200]   just before we wake up in the morning,
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.960]   assuming a good night's sleep.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.400]   And peaks maybe, I don't know,
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.260]   30 to 90 minutes after waking.
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:44.600]   For you slow risers like me, probably a little delayed.
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.240]   By the way, the height of that peak
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.640]   and I would say the steepness of the curve
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.940]   can be increased by viewing morning sunlight.
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:54.780]   We know this.
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.080]   Bright light increases that cortisol peak.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.660]   It'll make you a better early riser.
[00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:59.820]   But in any case, typically the pattern then
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.560]   is that it rises through mid morning
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:03.740]   and into the early afternoon
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:06.120]   and then starts to taper off to lower levels.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.200]   And as you mentioned,
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.720]   we'll see bumps in cortisol post meal.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.200]   If there's a stressor, we get a disturbing text,
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.720]   we get a bump in cortisol,
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.360]   but these aren't huge peaks
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.520]   unless it's a big stressor, correct?
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.920]   And then by evening cortisol levels
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.640]   in healthy individuals are typically low
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.600]   and that allows for transition into sleep,
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.020]   among other things allow for transition into sleep.
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:32.180]   But you said in these kids with PTSD,
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:37.020]   cortisol doesn't come down to low levels
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.820]   as much as it does in healthy individuals
[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:41.340]   in the evening and nighttime.
[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:45.340]   And that I imagine would lead to perseverating
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.020]   on stressors from the day.
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:50.300]   This kid was mean, I have a test tomorrow.
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.860]   Maybe any stressor becomes more intense in our mind
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:56.180]   and body, as it were,
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:57.960]   and that perhaps could lead to issues
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.280]   with quality or duration of sleep,
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.740]   which then could perpetuate the cycle.
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:03.740]   Do I have that correct?
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:04.580]   - Correct.
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:08.020]   - Okay, so has the direct intervention
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:11.740]   of just trying to suppress evening cortisol ever been done?
[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:14.180]   I mean, certainly there are drugs that will do this.
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:15.900]   Has that approach ever been taken?
[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:18.540]   - I thought about that when I had those high levels,
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:21.780]   but I felt that we needed to understand better.
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:25.500]   I think yes, that there were some attempts
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:28.660]   with some medications, and I don't think that led
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:32.800]   to anything in terms of helping those kids,
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.820]   or just helping individuals in general
[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:37.380]   that had high levels of cortisol
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:40.340]   because of traumatic stress.
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:43.080]   But nighttime, you're right.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.820]   It is a time when basically we fall asleep
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:48.500]   because we let it go.
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:53.540]   And this kid's hyperarousability does not allow them
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:54.520]   to let it go.
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:30:00.620]   So if these levels are high, as I was finding,
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:05.020]   what impact are they having in brain development?
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:08.480]   And usually the younger you are,
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:12.100]   the more universally distributed receptors are.
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.620]   So glucocorticoid receptors could be anywhere at that point,
[00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:18.260]   but as we age, they become more localized.
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.300]   And the glucocorticoid receptors,
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:23.260]   and cortisol is a type of glucocorticoid,
[00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:28.060]   are more common in areas like the hippocampus
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.980]   and the prefrontal cortex,
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:31.500]   which I also found interesting
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.580]   because these areas relate to the symptoms, right,
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:38.460]   that many individuals with PTSD have.
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:42.900]   - Memory, anticipation of the future, problem-solving,
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:46.020]   context-dependent problem-solving, so on.
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:49.780]   - And even those attention issues that make them overlap
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.360]   with kids that have ADHD as well.
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:56.420]   So this frontal limbic pathway,
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.780]   the prefrontal cortex communicating
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:00.500]   with these emotional areas of the brain,
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:01.920]   including the amygdala,
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.140]   which is very close to the hippocampus,
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:10.740]   needed to be investigated in pediatric PTSD.
[00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:14.660]   And what I sometimes call pediatric PTSS
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:17.860]   because post-traumatic stress symptoms.
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:21.460]   Because, as I mentioned, there's a group of kids
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:23.780]   that have post-traumatic symptoms,
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:28.620]   do not fulfill criteria for DSM-5 PTSD,
[00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.460]   but their function continues to be impaired.
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:35.060]   Sometimes that's because of comorbidity.
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:37.000]   There's a high incidence of comorbidity
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.820]   with anxiety and depression.
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:42.180]   So most of our studies that have looked at PTSD symptoms
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:45.580]   also look at the impact of the interventions
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:48.560]   that we're doing in anxiety and depression as well.
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:49.820]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:52.420]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:55.020]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:58.100]   that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens.
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:31:59.540]   AG1 is designed to cover
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:01.620]   all of your foundational nutritional needs,
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:02.780]   and it tastes great.
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:05.500]   Now I've been drinking AG1 since 2012,
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.960]   and I started doing that at a time
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.460]   when my budget for supplements was really limited.
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.300]   In fact, I only had enough money back then
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:12.620]   to purchase one supplement,
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:15.660]   and I'm so glad that I made that supplement AG1.
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:17.780]   The reason for that is even though I strive
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.780]   to eat most of my foods from whole foods
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.580]   and minimally processed foods,
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:24.300]   it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits, vegetables,
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.220]   vitamins and minerals, micronutrients,
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.460]   and adaptogens from food alone.
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.380]   And I need to do that in order to ensure
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.180]   that I have enough energy throughout the day,
[00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:35.620]   I sleep well at night, and keep my immune system strong.
[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.140]   But when I take AG1 daily,
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.780]   I find that all aspects of my health,
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:40.500]   my physical health, my mental health,
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.580]   and my performance, both cognitive and physical, are better.
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:46.380]   I know that because I've had lapses when I didn't take AG1,
[00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.260]   and I certainly felt the difference.
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.260]   I also notice, and this makes perfect sense
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:52.340]   given the relationship between the gut microbiome
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.860]   and the brain, that when I regularly take AG1,
[00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:57.280]   which for me means a serving in the morning or mid-morning,
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.420]   and again later in the afternoon or evening,
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:02.580]   that I have more mental clarity and more mental energy.
[00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.020]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:07.140]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:08.500]   to claim a special offer.
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.740]   Right now, they're giving away five free travel packs
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.300]   and a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:16.780]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:18.700]   to claim that special offer.
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.940]   - I definitely wanna get into some of those interventions,
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:22.820]   including some of the ones that you've developed
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:27.820]   that are very novel and are being used to great success.
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:30.520]   I want to just circle back for a moment
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:35.520]   on this relationship between PTSD and, in some cases,
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:38.660]   inappropriate diagnosis of ADHD.
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:40.660]   As you mentioned, these two things can coexist
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:42.340]   in the same person.
[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:45.180]   So we don't want anyone who has been told
[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:49.900]   that they have ADHD and PTSD, or even just ADHD,
[00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:52.160]   to immediately assume that that diagnosis is wrong
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.460]   based on what we're gonna talk about.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:58.420]   But it is possible that the ADHD
[00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:03.060]   that a child is told they have is reflective of PTSD.
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:05.280]   And I imagine that if that PTSD arises
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:08.100]   through something in the family structure or dynamic,
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:10.220]   it would be even harder to unmask
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:14.660]   because the parent perhaps would be less motivated
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:16.020]   to try and understand that
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.860]   if they played some sort of role in it.
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:21.780]   So I realize this is a complex problem with a lot of layers.
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:24.500]   But if you were to just throw out a number
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:25.980]   based on your experience,
[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:30.780]   what percentage of pure ADHD diagnosis
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:35.160]   would you like to see explored
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:38.600]   for the possibility of a PTSD influence?
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.960]   Let's just keep it kind of diplomatic that way.
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.960]   As opposed to saying what percentage of ADHD
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.880]   do you think is actually PTSD?
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:49.880]   - I firmly believe that ADHD does exist.
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:53.820]   I'm gonna say two facts that we know in the field.
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:58.480]   One, are kids getting over-medicated?
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.640]   The answer is a clear yes.
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.960]   They're getting more medications that they need.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.200]   - For ADHD.
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:07.680]   - For anything in general, kids.
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:12.680]   Now, in ADHD, they're getting under-medicated.
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.400]   So that's the second fact.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.760]   So the first one is that if we look at kids overall
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:19.360]   in the field of mental health,
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.360]   those that manage to receive treatment,
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.960]   which access is something else we should talk about
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.480]   'cause like 50% of them do not get access
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.020]   to mental health services.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.920]   Those that manage to get it
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:36.920]   may end up with the appropriate treatment, right?
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:40.480]   A medication or a psychotherapy.
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:42.620]   But there's another subset of them
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:47.320]   that will be medicated no matter what they present with
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:51.400]   because they need to be seen fast or it's a fast solution.
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.860]   So there's many reasons for that.
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.680]   But are kids getting over-medicated?
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:55.880]   Yes.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.760]   But within those kids,
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:01.400]   those that truly have attention deficit hyperactivity
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.960]   disorder are getting under-medicated.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.200]   And that's because of that access issue
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:09.520]   because most of them were not identifying.
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:12.740]   And that's a pity because the first line of intervention
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:16.000]   for ADHD is stimulant treatment.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.240]   It does work.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:20.920]   And it works very well for children
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:23.540]   that have the correct diagnosis.
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:25.800]   But the first line of intervention for children
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.800]   that have a history of PTSD, be it acute or chronic,
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.320]   is psychosocial.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.460]   It's a psychosocial intervention.
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:38.460]   So if you give a kid that has PTSD and no ADHD
[00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.840]   a stimulant medication,
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:44.120]   not only is not taking care of ADHD 'cause they don't have it
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:47.560]   but it adds to that hyperarousability
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:50.240]   that is manifested there from before.
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:51.720]   By the way, there are clinical ways
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:56.720]   of separating hyperactivity from this hyperarousability
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.640]   and hypervigilance.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:01.440]   Hyperactivity, if you see a kid that is not medicated
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:05.360]   and has ADHD and they have the hyperactive symptoms
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.880]   and the hyperactive type,
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.220]   they're gonna be hyperactive for most of the time
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:10.700]   that you're with them.
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.280]   The kid that has hyperarousability,
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:16.200]   it will be more of an on and off phenomenon.
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:20.960]   The hypervigilance and hyperarousability comes more
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.280]   when they're presented with a cue
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:27.520]   that consciously or unconsciously reminds their body
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.660]   of the traumatic event or the traumatic experiences.
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:34.640]   What happens though is that usually we don't know
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.000]   what those cues are, right?
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.960]   So we just see a kid that sporadically becomes
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:44.200]   hypervigilant or hyperaroused.
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.880]   And then the other thing is,
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:49.960]   is hypervigilance something that needs to be treated?
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.600]   You know, I learned this from a mother early in my career.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.420]   She's like, I was giving some talk in the community
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:58.440]   and she came to me afterwards and she said,
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:03.120]   "Listen, we live in a street that's very dark
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.700]   "and it's very dangerous.
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:08.780]   "And my kid has to pass through that every day.
[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:11.080]   "I want him to be hypervigilant.
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:14.420]   "And if he has developed this trait of hypervigilance,
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:17.480]   "this is something that could be helpful to him."
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.040]   And I said, "You're right."
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.760]   I said, "You're right, it's not only to him,
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.700]   "to a lot of people, it could become very helpful
[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.440]   "to be hypervigilant to assess the environment
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.880]   "in which they are in."
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:30.600]   So the problem is not the hypervigilance.
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:34.320]   The problem is knowing when to turn it on
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.280]   and when to turn it off.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.800]   Having the cognitive flexibility, right?
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:44.040]   To be able to say, yes, this is a dangerous situation
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:46.360]   and I better respond this way.
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:50.040]   If I can give you an example of a kid, right?
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:53.000]   A kid that experiences domestic violence
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   and has associated that with noise in the house,
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.920]   learns that running and getting into the room
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:02.520]   is a safe thing for them
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.220]   because they're out of the picture, right?
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:06.840]   And they protect themselves in the room.
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.880]   But a year later, they're in the classroom
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.540]   and for some reason the classroom gets this level of noise.
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:16.880]   The body, without him knowing, right?
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:21.600]   The body reacts by the response that was helpful.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.440]   This is classical conditioning, right?
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.040]   So he runs out of the classroom.
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.600]   But he's missing the context.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.440]   The teacher is missing the context.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.520]   When the teacher sends him to the principal's office,
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.640]   the principal doesn't have the context, right?
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.480]   That this response was actually adaptive
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.880]   at one point and helpful at one point
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:44.180]   and the body has had a hard time letting it go.
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:48.960]   To ask that kid to give us the only response that he has
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.880]   is not the way to help him.
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:56.200]   We need to help him develop new competitive responses
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.800]   so that the experience of the other responses
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:02.200]   then extinguishes that response
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:06.080]   that was adaptive at one point but now is maladaptive.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.880]   By the way, if they are in a traumatic situation,
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.920]   again, we still want them to use it, right?
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.400]   We still want them to run and get out of there.
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.160]   It's part of that hypervigilance
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.000]   that's protecting them in a way.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.280]   - It's so interesting.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.960]   You said, if I understood correctly,
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:23.880]   that in kids with genuine ADHD,
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:27.960]   the hyperactivity is fairly persistent across environments
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.520]   and with different people, et cetera.
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.320]   - I'm sorry to interrupt, but if I could add,
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:35.000]   the inattention comes and goes
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.640]   because we all know kids that have ADHD
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:39.040]   that if you give them the right video game,
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.040]   all of a sudden they become attentive, right?
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:42.760]   - This is a very important point.
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.920]   When I did the solo episode on ADHD,
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:48.200]   I was frankly shocked to learn,
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.280]   but it was validated by the literature
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.320]   and certainly by the responses from the audience
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:57.160]   that kids with ADHD and adults with ADHD, for that matter,
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:00.520]   absolutely have the ability to sharply attend to something
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.880]   if it's something that's very engaging to them,
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.160]   really exciting, something that they typically enjoy.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:08.960]   But their ability to direct and maintain attention
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.760]   in other environments that are required
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:12.240]   for normal life progression,
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:14.960]   school, work, relationships, et cetera,
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:19.480]   is very diminished compared to those without ADHD.
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.460]   So what I have in my mind is a step function,
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:26.120]   meaning an increase in a steady state of hyperactivity
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:27.360]   in a kid with ADHD,
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.040]   but then a jagged line beneath that of attention.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.880]   This is, I believe, the picture we're painting here,
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:37.880]   but that in PTSD, the hyperactivity is a jagged line
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:43.120]   and it really needs a cue, as you said, a loud noise,
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:46.440]   or maybe it's the presence of a particular voice.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:49.160]   I once attended a trauma,
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:52.160]   it wasn't trauma release as much as it was genuine
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:55.000]   trauma treatment center out in Florida.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.160]   A friend of mine runs the center
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:59.200]   and I was out there learning about the practices they use
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:03.280]   in order to inform potential experiments
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.920]   for intervention in my lab back at Stanford.
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:09.000]   And he said something really interesting.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.280]   He said, you know, when you bring people in
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.800]   to this sort of environment and they've all had trauma,
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:19.200]   you see a pretty rich array of responses
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.920]   to even just the same conversation.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:25.240]   And then at one point, perhaps because he said that,
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.960]   I noted that a woman raised her hand
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:32.200]   and she said that particular timbres of voices in the room
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:34.200]   were really activating her.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:35.160]   You know, this was important.
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.000]   It wasn't just what was being said.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.680]   It wasn't that people were yelling at each other
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:40.840]   or even the volume of the voices,
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:43.200]   but that even just the frequency,
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.040]   the lowness or the highness of the voice, as it were,
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.800]   was triggering something in her brain
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.720]   that was giving her these bodily sensations.
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:52.760]   And it was a very important insight for her
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:55.880]   to be able to then start to direct interventions.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:00.200]   So I guess we all hear the kind of now stereotypical example
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:03.960]   of, you know, the veteran who experiences combat comes back
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:05.840]   and hears a car backfire and then they hide.
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:08.300]   That's kind of, we read about this and hear about this,
[00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:10.440]   but it seems like it's much more subtle than that,
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:13.600]   that sometimes the cues for this hyperactivity,
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:18.600]   this hypervigilance is very much linked to something
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:22.100]   that sometimes even the person with PTSD doesn't recognize
[00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:24.640]   until they start to be put into that environment
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.720]   again and again, and then they can pinpoint it.
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:30.040]   My question now is if they can pinpoint what the cue is,
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:33.000]   do they stand a better chance of recovery
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.840]   as opposed to somebody that just like,
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.800]   feels like I'm hyperactive, then I'm exhausted,
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:38.940]   I'm wired and tired.
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:41.120]   And now I also imagine that in kids,
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.480]   they don't have necessarily the verbal proficiency
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.640]   to be able to express what's going on for them.
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.660]   And in fact, many adults don't really know
[00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:49.200]   because we don't have a great language
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.360]   for expressing this body-mind thing.
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:53.160]   In any event, a lot of questions there,
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:56.160]   but what are your thoughts about the requirement
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.080]   for being able to understand what the cues,
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:02.080]   what the triggers are in order for a child and or adult
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:06.080]   to be able to start to make inroads into their PTSD?
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.160]   - First, a word on the Vietnam veteran,
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.480]   because there's a very important study
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.420]   that was published years ago that demonstrated
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:18.160]   that those veterans that had a history of child maltreatment
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:22.920]   and went to war had PTSD at higher prevalence
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:25.440]   than the ones that did not have a history
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.840]   of child maltreatment.
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:28.600]   So-- - Child maltreatment.
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:29.440]   - Yeah. - I see.
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:31.800]   So they were traumatized before they went to combat.
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.440]   And maybe they did not develop PTSD,
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:37.480]   but once again, that point of the accumulation, right,
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:39.880]   of the stressors at different times.
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:44.280]   And I'm just mentioning that because you may have a veteran
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:48.460]   and you're waiting to look at the classical cues,
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:51.120]   where in fact, it might be more like a voice,
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:54.360]   like the example that you were giving that triggers them.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:57.120]   What triggers an individual is very personal.
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:00.600]   So cues are usually neutral.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:03.040]   And they're usually related to our senses.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.400]   And I know you like senses a lot.
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:08.000]   So what we see, what we hear, all of these things.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.600]   The senses are really the window
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.640]   to the central nervous system, right?
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:17.040]   This is how we get information the first time.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:20.720]   So in this state of hyperarousability,
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:23.000]   when something traumatizing is happening,
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   our senses are really acutely aware of what's going on.
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:34.160]   And they are making sense of the insult,
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:37.220]   but they also are registering everything
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:39.440]   that's related to that.
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:43.240]   So these cues usually are neutral.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:46.200]   So they're not like a gun, for example,
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:50.280]   because a gun is not a cue, it's a threat, right?
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:52.480]   But it's usually a color.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:55.200]   So there was a red car parked near where they were,
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:59.120]   so the color red may be a cue, may be a trigger.
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:01.400]   It was raining the day that that happened,
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:05.400]   so rain may be a cue, may be a trigger.
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.960]   And to answer your question,
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:10.720]   identifying those cues are important
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:15.720]   because they let you know when your symptoms are coming.
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:20.240]   They let you know that they're not coming out of nowhere.
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.240]   They let you know that you're not a problem
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:25.160]   or that you're crazy or that you're bad,
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:27.480]   which is sometimes the messages that kids get
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:30.840]   when they go to that principal's office, okay?
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:34.960]   But they let you know that they learn themselves,
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:37.440]   this is a normal response, right?
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:40.960]   I've learned through my psychosocial intervention,
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:44.080]   I've learned that this is a cue
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:46.920]   that triggers a response from me,
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:51.320]   triggers a response that was helpful at one time.
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:53.040]   And through classical conditioning,
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:56.240]   and we do teach classical conditioning to the kids,
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:00.400]   those responses then become present,
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.760]   become conditioned, right?
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:05.400]   When the cue is there, when the trigger is there.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.000]   So yes, to answer your question,
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.720]   it is important to know the cues.
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:09.560]   Now, what happens?
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:12.000]   Are we gonna know all the cues to everything,
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.880]   to all of our behaviors and this shift in mood
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:18.040]   that sometimes we have during the day
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:20.160]   and we don't know why, right?
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:24.720]   No, the answer is no, we're not gonna know all the cues.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:29.160]   But the beauty of this is that if we can just learn
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:34.160]   about one or two or three cues, what our response is,
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:37.120]   there's more of a forgiveness to ourselves
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:39.480]   in that when we respond inappropriately,
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:43.360]   we can think, well, maybe I was exposed to a cue, right?
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:44.520]   Because I've learned all of this
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:46.400]   about cues and classical conditioning,
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:49.640]   maybe that's what's happening here.
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:51.040]   - Yeah, I'm thinking again
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:53.320]   about post-traumatic stress injury.
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:55.760]   The reason I like that term,
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:59.480]   even though I realize I'm using it non-clinically,
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:03.960]   is that if we understand that the autonomic nervous system,
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:05.680]   this seesawing back and forth,
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:09.040]   or this push-pull between the sympathetic, fight or flight,
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:13.480]   and parasympathetic, rest and digest, loosely speaking,
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:17.040]   systems are always at play in us.
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:18.800]   When we sleep, more parasympathetic.
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:21.340]   When we're alert and calm, more sympathetic.
[00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:23.840]   And when we're stressed or having a panic attack,
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.360]   extremely sympathetic.
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:29.800]   If we understand that as a biological system,
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:32.060]   which it is, that deploys hormones
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:34.480]   and shapes our patterns of thinking
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:38.160]   and what's available to us in our memory, et cetera,
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:43.160]   then PTSI, post-traumatic stress injury,
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:47.200]   I feel like it liberates us a bit to understand that,
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:51.540]   yeah, this autonomic system has been disrupted in a way.
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:54.420]   And if I think about the autonomic system as a seesaw,
[00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:56.040]   which I often do,
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:49:01.040]   I think about the seesaw having a pivot point with a hinge.
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:03.980]   It's almost like the post-traumatic stress injury
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:08.980]   is to create the tendency for that hinge to be too tight.
[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:13.340]   And sometimes that makes it more dissociative
[00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:15.940]   and we're exhausted and kind of checked out.
[00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:20.100]   And maybe it creates the hinge to be too tight
[00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:23.060]   such that we're more on the sympathetic, excuse me,
[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:25.320]   sympathetic the way I, for those listening,
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:26.180]   I'm using my hands,
[00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:27.900]   but you don't have to see it to understand
[00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:31.260]   that the alertness system is locked in place.
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:32.780]   It's hard to get out of that.
[00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:34.660]   And I almost feel like the injury
[00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:37.140]   that is post-traumatic stress injury
[00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.480]   is a tightening down of the hinge
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:43.700]   with the seesaw tilted too much to one or the other side.
[00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:45.580]   And I, as a biologist,
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:47.500]   I just wish that we understood
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:51.380]   what that dysregulation was or is.
[00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:53.740]   Chances are it's not one location in the brain or body,
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:55.680]   it's gonna be a network phenomenon.
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:58.340]   But I feel like the word disorder,
[00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:00.240]   the D in PTSD is so critical
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:02.280]   because it highlights the importance
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:05.260]   and the pervasiveness of this thing,
[00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:09.540]   but that the I in post-traumatic stress injury
[00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:10.820]   hopefully will give people,
[00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:15.820]   it certainly is giving me some sense of relief
[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:17.180]   or liberty and understanding
[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:19.540]   that these are nervous system injuries
[00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:22.180]   that need treatment
[00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:25.220]   and that there isn't something wrong or crazy with us
[00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:28.860]   because of the fact that we, you know,
[00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:30.940]   suddenly feel like we're having a panic attack.
[00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:33.700]   You know, I've had people I know close to me in my life say,
[00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:35.380]   "I'm having a panic attack."
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:36.200]   I'm like, "What do you mean?
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:37.040]   What happened?"
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:37.940]   They're like, "Nothing happened.
[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:38.780]   That's the point."
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:39.620]   "Well, how'd you sleep?"
[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:40.900]   "Well, it's okay."
[00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:44.100]   You know, and you start doing the curbside diagnosis
[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:47.260]   that neither of us is qualified to do, right?
[00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:49.100]   But this is what we do as caretakers
[00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:50.620]   for each other in our lives.
[00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:53.100]   And it very well could be that their autonomic system
[00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:56.100]   just got, that hinge is just locked in place
[00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:57.140]   for whatever reason.
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:59.140]   Maybe it's one sip too much of coffee.
[00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:00.780]   Maybe it's one sip too little.
[00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:03.800]   It's probably something or a bunch of things.
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:07.500]   I realize I'm getting outside my expertise here
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:08.800]   because I'm not a clinician,
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:13.520]   but I feel like this PTSI thing is sticky and important
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:14.740]   for people to hear about it.
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:17.940]   Certainly changing the way that I think about PTSD.
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:22.300]   - Yes, no, and I like the visualization of your seesaw
[00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:23.820]   and the example of the hinge
[00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:28.380]   because it reminds me of that cognitive flexibility, right?
[00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:29.220]   It's not there.
[00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:30.420]   It's kind of stuck.
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:32.700]   It's kind of tight, too tight.
[00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:35.100]   And in some individuals,
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:37.180]   they just experience the dissociation.
[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.780]   They're like stuck on the bottom, right?
[00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:41.700]   Sitting on the bottom on the seesaw.
[00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:43.140]   Whereas for the other individuals,
[00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:44.700]   they're hyperaroused all the time.
[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:46.540]   Then you have everything in between.
[00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:51.180]   But no, that's a very good representation of it.
[00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:53.260]   - And I feel like a good night's sleep
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:59.540]   allows some recalibration of the tightness of that hinge.
[00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:03.380]   Put differently, anytime we don't sleep well or long enough,
[00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:06.060]   we're not good psychologically.
[00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:08.360]   A good night's sleep is good for everything.
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:10.980]   - We're finally at the point in history
[00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:13.020]   where everyone seems to accept that.
[00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:16.580]   I really have to tip my hat to Dr. Matthew Walker
[00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:18.980]   from UC Berkeley for writing the book, "Why We Sleep."
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:21.740]   You know, it was only a few years ago that book came out
[00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:26.740]   and he deserves such a token of praise for that
[00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:31.260]   because prior to that, there was this,
[00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:33.060]   oh, I'll sleep when I'm dead mentality.
[00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:34.860]   I think people knew sleep was important,
[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:36.420]   but they didn't really understand.
[00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:41.420]   And he had to come out as kind of the downer message,
[00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:44.700]   like, listen, this is serious stuff.
[00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:46.420]   - You better sleep. - You better sleep.
[00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:47.460]   But I think we're there now.
[00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:50.620]   I think in 2024, we're there.
[00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:52.060]   I think people understand.
[00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:53.860]   - And I think people have their own experiences
[00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:54.700]   with sleep, right?
[00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:58.460]   We've all felt that cold that's coming.
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:01.720]   And if we really sleep those eight hours,
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:03.220]   we may be able to fight it
[00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:05.700]   'cause we've strengthened our immune system.
[00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:08.700]   If we don't, we will get sick.
[00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:09.840]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:13.580]   Let's talk about some of the treatments that you use
[00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:17.540]   and have developed for PTSD in young people.
[00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:19.100]   And maybe we should define young people.
[00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:22.300]   Are we talking about the 18 and under
[00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:24.380]   just because that's typically what we think about?
[00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:27.180]   - So in pediatric psychiatry,
[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:28.920]   we have three different populations.
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:32.860]   We have the preschoolers, we have the school age,
[00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:35.180]   and we have the teenagers.
[00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:37.100]   And they're all very different.
[00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:40.260]   They all have responses and defenses
[00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:41.380]   that are very different.
[00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:43.580]   The projects that I'm describing
[00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:47.580]   happen mostly with the school age children.
[00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:49.820]   - So preschoolers are gonna be essentially,
[00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:52.280]   I think of kindergarten starting at five.
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:54.580]   So you're talking about zero more to more or less
[00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:56.460]   five or six years old as the preschoolers,
[00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:58.420]   kindergartners, and then transition point.
[00:53:58.420 --> 00:53:59.620]   - Correct.
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:02.500]   - And then for the kids we're about to talk about,
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:05.300]   we're really talking about what, six years old
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.740]   until about end of adolescence?
[00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:12.580]   - Yeah, 15 and then, yeah, then the teenagers later on.
[00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:13.540]   - Okay, great.
[00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:16.800]   - So I work mostly with the school age kids.
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:19.340]   And like I said, when we started doing
[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:22.320]   magnetic resonance imaging to look at the impact
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:26.060]   of cortisol, we have a number of studies
[00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:28.060]   really demonstrating that those kids
[00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:30.060]   with higher levels of cortisol
[00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:35.060]   had less volume of the hippocampus.
[00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:37.780]   The first study that we did in that was cross-sectional
[00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:39.060]   and there was no difference.
[00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:41.140]   And it gave me a lot of hope that there would be
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:44.580]   a window of opportunity there where we could intervene.
[00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:47.180]   Because what we were seeing in chronic PTSD in adults
[00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:51.180]   was that there was smaller volumes of the hippocampus
[00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:53.500]   which help us process memories
[00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:57.100]   and have strong connections with the emotional center
[00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:58.460]   of the brain, the amygdala,
[00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:01.000]   and also with the prefrontal cortex.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   And what we found was that cross-sectionally
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.180]   there was not this difference,
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:12.420]   but we also follow a small sample longitudinally.
[00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:14.580]   And there we saw a correlation
[00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:17.420]   between that higher pre-bedtime cortisol
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:19.600]   and the smaller hippocampal volume.
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:24.540]   More impactful was a functional imaging study,
[00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:26.620]   as many of your audience members know,
[00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:28.340]   with magnetic resonance imaging
[00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:30.480]   we not only can look at the structure,
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:34.420]   but we can also give tasks of memory, for example,
[00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:37.840]   or of executive function and different tasks
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:42.280]   that tap at the areas that we are interested in looking.
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:45.340]   So when we look, when we give a memory task
[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:48.100]   and we looked at how children
[00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:51.360]   with post-traumatic stress symptoms were behaving
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:54.700]   compared to kids that do not have symptoms
[00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:56.940]   or other psychiatry diagnosis,
[00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:59.620]   we were seeing that the healthy kids
[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:02.900]   were activating a lot of more voxels
[00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:07.740]   or units of the imaging of the hippocampus.
[00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:10.700]   So there was concern here that yes,
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:13.340]   that plasticity that you talked at the beginning
[00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:16.060]   was really affecting the development
[00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:17.700]   of the brain of the kids.
[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:19.720]   And then with the prefrontal cortex
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:24.720]   we saw something similar in the ventromedial area
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:27.740]   of the prefrontal cortex.
[00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:30.080]   So, but with other tasks, right?
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:35.080]   With tasks of executive function or tasks of emotion,
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:41.560]   looking at faces, for example, emotional faces.
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:46.120]   All of this to say that they probably have
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:51.120]   a malfunctioning frontostriatal pathway and frontolimbic.
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:54.280]   So, frontolimbic, I'm sorry.
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:59.280]   So if we think of the amygdala, for example,
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:04.960]   in close proximity to the hippocampus,
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:07.080]   being involved in this hypervigilance
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.960]   and we have some data to show
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:11.440]   that the amygdala becomes active very quickly
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:15.300]   when you present emotional faces to young kids.
[00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:19.620]   And that that hyperactive amygdala
[00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:22.500]   needs a break of some sort.
[00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:24.860]   That break comes from the prefrontal cortex.
[00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:26.980]   But if you have a prefrontal cortex
[00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:29.420]   that's not working that well either,
[00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:32.940]   then your break is not working, right?
[00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:35.440]   So then the issue came here.
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.940]   Well, this is important information
[00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:40.920]   to know what we need to target with treatment.
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:44.340]   And can we target this with psychosocial interventions
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:47.820]   and the way that we provide treatment?
[00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:51.380]   And we decided to begin with what we discussed earlier,
[00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:53.860]   with the cues, right?
[00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:58.860]   And teaching and having kids understand what cues are,
[00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:01.820]   what classical conditioning is,
[00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:07.540]   talking to them about the impact of trauma,
[00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:11.420]   talking to them about the impact of treatment
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:14.940]   and how recovery is possible, right?
[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:18.740]   So an educational piece.
[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:22.780]   And something that I never thought I would end up doing
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:24.400]   was developing a treatment, right?
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:26.620]   I felt I'm here to investigate
[00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:29.060]   and use the treatments that we have.
[00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:31.260]   But it became very clear to me
[00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:33.860]   that there were a population of kids
[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:35.780]   that still needed a form of treatment
[00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:37.700]   that was not out there.
[00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:40.520]   So most treatments out there for trauma
[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:43.620]   were targeting one traumatic event
[00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:47.500]   and not targeting that backpack, that allostatic load.
[00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:50.780]   Also, and rightfully so, most treatments
[00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:55.780]   were requiring that the parents
[00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:59.820]   were involved in treatment as well.
[00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:01.640]   - I could see where that might be problematic
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:04.900]   when the parents perhaps were the source of the trauma.
[00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:07.500]   - And also when there's avoidance, right?
[00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:09.480]   And also when there's practicalities
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:11.460]   that if they lose one day from work
[00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:12.740]   they're gonna get fired.
[00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:15.620]   So sometimes the parents are just not available
[00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:18.740]   and the kids are totally ready to begin and do the work.
[00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:21.260]   So I wanted them to be able to do so.
[00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:25.620]   So how can we devise a treatment that is hybrid,
[00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:27.940]   and by that I mean multi-modal,
[00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:30.900]   that is not only cognitive behavioral therapy
[00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:34.620]   but that it brings other elements that are important
[00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:39.620]   like self-efficacy, empowerment, insight-oriented work,
[00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:45.760]   and give it a structure that can be tested.
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:51.800]   And that's how we created Q-Center, Q being C-U-E,
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:56.720]   Q-Center Therapy for kids that have PTSD.
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:58.480]   And we've had a number of trials with them
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:02.760]   and it helps decrease symptoms of anxiety,
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:07.120]   symptoms of depression, and symptoms of PTSD.
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:12.120]   And not only as scored by the student
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:16.040]   but also scored by observers, by the parents.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.440]   And in one of the trials where we measure actually
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:19.720]   how the parents were doing,
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:22.380]   parents that were not participating in treatment,
[01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:25.320]   their own anxiety was decreasing as well.
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.800]   And that's easy to understand, right?
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:27.960]   If your kid is doing better,
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:30.040]   you're gonna do better as well.
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:34.320]   So that was very, very good to see.
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:36.920]   But then we wanted to see that plasticity too.
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:40.880]   Is this doing something to the activation of the brain?
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.040]   And that's when we brought functional
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:46.920]   near-infrared spectroscopy into the picture
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:48.760]   because it's cheaper than MRI
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:51.640]   and it's more portable and it's easier to do.
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:53.440]   It only gives you cortical information.
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:56.480]   It doesn't get into those interesting limbic structures.
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:59.680]   - So it's, just to highlight for a second,
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:03.200]   the fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.200]   is wonderful because it allows a lot of
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:10.160]   imaging both on the superficial outer parts of the brain
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.080]   but also deep into the brain.
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.960]   My understanding is that,
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:16.200]   and perhaps this has changed in recent years,
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:19.280]   that the spatial resolution can be very good.
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.800]   You can pinpoint very small areas
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.940]   if you have a powerful enough machine, magnet.
[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:28.560]   The temporal resolution, the ability to see changes
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:32.840]   in the neural circuit activation and deactivation over time
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.240]   at one point was somewhat limited,
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:36.840]   but now some of those limitations have been overcome.
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:38.240]   But then what you're talking about,
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:42.560]   near-infrared spectroscopy is excellent
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:45.760]   because it can be taken to a school, right?
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:46.840]   You don't have to,
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:49.300]   you couldn't bring an fMRI machine to a school
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:52.360]   unless it's a medical school where there's the machine.
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.240]   It's much less expensive.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.440]   The downside is, oh, excuse me.
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:58.720]   And my understanding is that the spatial resolution
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.660]   isn't quite as high as MRI,
[01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:03.160]   but the temporal resolution is very high,
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.120]   which is a huge advantage.
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.940]   And then there's this one disadvantage
[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:09.900]   that you can only really image
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:11.240]   the outer portions of the brain,
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.600]   but nonetheless, there's a lot of information there, right?
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:15.000]   So a little technical lesson.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.840]   - And these outside areas of the brain,
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:19.460]   the cortical area and the prefrontal area,
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:24.280]   we're helping predict which kids would do better,
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:27.460]   only for those kids that were having Q-center therapy
[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:31.060]   and another gold standard treatment called trauma-focused
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:33.020]   cognitive behavioral therapy,
[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:37.860]   when they were both compared to treatment as usual.
[01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:39.220]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:41.920]   and thank one of our sponsors, Function.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:43.560]   I recently became a Function member
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.840]   after searching for the most comprehensive approach
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:46.860]   to lab testing.
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:48.780]   While I've long been a fan of blood testing,
[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:50.740]   I really wanted to find a more in-depth program
[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:53.380]   for analyzing blood, urine, and saliva
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:55.260]   to get a full picture of my heart health,
[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:58.020]   my hormone status, my immune system regulation,
[01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:01.300]   my metabolic function, my vitamin and mineral status,
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:04.720]   and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.460]   Function not only provides testing
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:07.900]   of over a hundred biomarkers
[01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:09.580]   key to physical and mental health,
[01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:11.420]   but it also analyzes these results
[01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:14.980]   and provides insights from top doctors on your results.
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:17.840]   For example, in one of my first tests with Function,
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:20.980]   I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood.
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:22.260]   This was totally surprising to me.
[01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:25.080]   I had no idea prior to taking the test.
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:26.940]   Function not only helped me detect this,
[01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:29.420]   but offered medical doctor-informed insights
[01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:32.120]   on how to best reduce those mercury levels,
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.420]   which included limiting my tuna consumption
[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:36.180]   because I had been eating a lot of tuna,
[01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:38.540]   while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens
[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:41.460]   and supplementing with NAC and acetylcysteine,
[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:43.500]   both of which can support glutathione production
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:47.260]   and detoxification and worked to reduce my mercury levels.
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:48.820]   Comprehensive lab testing like this
[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:50.240]   is so important for health.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:52.020]   And while I've been doing it for years,
[01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:54.960]   I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive.
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.440]   I've been so impressed by Function,
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:58.340]   both at the level of ease of use,
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:03:59.860]   that is getting the tests done,
[01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:01.580]   as well as how comprehensive
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:03.940]   and how actionable the tests are,
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.180]   that I recently joined their advisory board
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:08.420]   and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:09.740]   If you'd like to try Function,
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:13.020]   go to functionhealth.com/huberman.
[01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:16.620]   Function currently has a wait list of over 250,000 people,
[01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:19.460]   but they're offering early access to Huberman Lab listeners.
[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:22.740]   Again, that's functionhealth.com/huberman
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:25.100]   to get early access to Function.
[01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:27.460]   I want to get into the Q-centered therapy
[01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:29.580]   versus cognitive behavioral,
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:33.440]   versus the no therapy conditions you just described.
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.540]   But before we do that,
[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:36.980]   I just want to have a brief discussion
[01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:38.460]   about some of the neuroscience you mentioned,
[01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:41.140]   because I think people will find this very interesting
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:45.300]   and certainly not just a listing off of names of structures.
[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:49.380]   You said that the frontolimbic pathway is important here,
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:51.220]   the limbic pathway, including the amygdala,
[01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:52.660]   but other structures as well.
[01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:54.220]   And my understanding,
[01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:56.020]   and I think the generally accepted understanding
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:57.180]   about these limbic pathways,
[01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:00.700]   is that they create a response state,
[01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:03.440]   a state of alertness, a state of relaxation,
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:06.780]   that they translate certain information
[01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:10.900]   that impinges on them into a level of reactivity,
[01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:13.020]   either low, medium, or very high.
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:14.100]   When I say reactivity,
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:17.020]   a tendency to move toward or away from something
[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:20.620]   or stay still, put in broadly speaking.
[01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:21.820]   Now, the fronto piece,
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:25.380]   the feeding in of information from the frontal cortex,
[01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:27.860]   where context-dependent decision-making,
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:30.700]   and as you said, executive function takes place,
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:33.280]   is so critical for all of us as we mature.
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:35.260]   Even as a, I would say, if you look at a puppy,
[01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:36.540]   everything's a stimulus.
[01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:38.320]   And then over time,
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:39.860]   they're not going to pick up everything in the room.
[01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:41.380]   That's without question,
[01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:42.740]   largely due to the development
[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:45.100]   of these frontolimbic pathways.
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:48.860]   And in children and in humans, that is, it's the same.
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:50.260]   I can imagine that the signals coming
[01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:52.000]   from the frontal pathway to the limbic system
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.540]   are going to be somewhat cryptic to people
[01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:56.620]   that aren't familiar with psychiatry and neuroscience.
[01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:59.460]   So maybe we could just throw a few of those out there.
[01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:01.460]   Here's an example, tell me if I'm wrong.
[01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:04.140]   But the way I think about this is,
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:09.140]   okay, a kid is in a room and they're hyperactive.
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:11.900]   And, or maybe something set them off
[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:14.780]   and they're particularly vigilant and stressed.
[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:17.060]   They're in the stress response.
[01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:20.100]   The frontal cortex is the pathway
[01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:25.100]   by which an internal dialogue could be delivered
[01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:28.060]   to quiet that limbic pathway.
[01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:30.640]   The message that would perhaps trigger that
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:33.400]   would be the kid recognizing because they learned,
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:39.860]   this is okay, I've had this happen before, it passes.
[01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:44.580]   Or I'm supported, there's Dr. Carrion,
[01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:46.580]   there's my mom, there's my dad, there's my teacher,
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:48.420]   there's my friend, I'm supported
[01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:50.380]   because we know social support is important.
[01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:54.220]   Or it's normal to feel stress every once in a while.
[01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:57.020]   So these kinds of thoughts or these internal dialogues
[01:06:57.020 --> 01:06:59.220]   that we're told that we should do for ourselves
[01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:02.420]   when we're stressed, I think we can be pretty certain
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:03.940]   that that's the kind of information
[01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:06.380]   that would trigger this frontal to limbic suppression.
[01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:07.940]   - And can I comment on that dialogue
[01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:10.020]   because all of those are examples
[01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:12.380]   of positive thoughts, right?
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:14.340]   Positive thoughts that are good,
[01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:18.860]   but they're not automatic thoughts.
[01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:23.300]   They are thoughts that need to be practiced, right?
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:25.660]   Negative thoughts, unfortunately,
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:29.860]   that reside in our reptile brain are automatic.
[01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:34.860]   So that hyper response, I'm in danger type of situation,
[01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:40.500]   when we evolved, right, is responsible for our survival.
[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:43.300]   So we learn the negative thoughts very well.
[01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:44.820]   I'm in danger, I have to run,
[01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:46.620]   I have to get on top of this tree,
[01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:48.460]   the lion might come, whatever.
[01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:52.420]   So only 50 million years ago,
[01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:54.940]   when we developed the frontal cortex more,
[01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:58.140]   positive thoughts came into the picture.
[01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:00.580]   And they're very helpful
[01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:03.300]   for all the reasons you're mentioning,
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:06.540]   but they're not automatic like the negative ones are.
[01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:08.220]   Hopefully they will become.
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:10.900]   So what I tell the kids is if they don't play guitar,
[01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:12.860]   if I give you a guitar right now,
[01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:14.380]   would you be able to play me a song?
[01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:15.220]   - Absolutely not.
[01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:19.140]   I have absolutely zero minus one musical ability,
[01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:20.580]   but I love music.
[01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:25.340]   - But if I gave you a guitar with guitar lessons
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:27.020]   and you practice,
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:30.380]   you probably will be able to play a song a year from now.
[01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:32.820]   - Well, me with some degree of proficiency,
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:33.660]   but not much. - With a lot of help.
[01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:35.380]   - But everybody else, yes.
[01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:36.380]   - A support system.
[01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:37.980]   - A support system, that's right.
[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:39.500]   And with enough practice hours
[01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:41.540]   and enough focus and determination,
[01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:45.300]   I'm convinced I could become at least proficient
[01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:48.660]   even at 49 years of age.
[01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:50.220]   - So we have a slogan in my team,
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:52.660]   which is practice positive thoughts.
[01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:55.500]   All the thoughts you were mentioning are good ones
[01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.820]   and we have to practice them, right?
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:08:59.220]   This is what I'm learning.
[01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:00.780]   No, I'm not bad.
[01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:03.420]   This is happening because of the cue.
[01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:05.860]   - Even when the limbic system is not active,
[01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:07.660]   do you encourage your patients
[01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:08.860]   to practice positive thinking?
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:09.700]   - All the time.
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:11.460]   - Even when they're not in the stress response?
[01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:12.300]   - All the time.
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:13.140]   - Interesting.
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:14.900]   - It's like, it's learning a tool.
[01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:16.900]   So in this Q-Center therapy,
[01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:20.380]   one of the lessons is that they have an empty toolbox
[01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:25.380]   and this toolbox gets filled with tools that they learn.
[01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:27.940]   I'm practicing positive thoughts,
[01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:30.780]   deep breathing, mindfulness,
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:34.940]   all of this muscle relaxations are tools that we teach them,
[01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:38.540]   but they decide and here's where the empowerment comes in.
[01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:41.460]   They decide what the cues are.
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:43.060]   They decide what tools
[01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:45.340]   they're gonna put into their toolbox
[01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:48.180]   or they're not going to put in the toolbox.
[01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:51.940]   And by far, whatever tools they develop
[01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:54.300]   that have not been taught by me or anybody else
[01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:59.060]   work better when they develop it themselves.
[01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:00.100]   - Interesting.
[01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:04.140]   - And you know, I had this case once
[01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:06.060]   and it got illustrated really well.
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:08.940]   When I was in one of the sessions,
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:13.140]   you teach them breathing exercises, muscle relaxation,
[01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:14.340]   things that we know help
[01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:15.540]   and I'll talk a little bit more
[01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:17.460]   about how we know that they help.
[01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:21.140]   And then they have like a week to practice
[01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:22.340]   and then they come the next week
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:23.380]   and we see where they are
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:25.740]   and what's in the toolbox and things like that.
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:29.380]   And the next week when she came,
[01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:32.380]   she was much, much better, you know?
[01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:34.180]   And I said, I was very proud.
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:36.500]   I'm like, oh, you've been practicing the tools, right?
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:37.740]   That we discussed last week.
[01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:39.020]   And she's like, no,
[01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:42.980]   I actually don't remember anything you said last time.
[01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:45.860]   But I came up with this thing that when I feel bad,
[01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:49.700]   I'm drinking a glass of orange juice every time.
[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:53.460]   And at that moment, I knew I could go both ways.
[01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:56.620]   I could go, no, no, you must practice my tools.
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:59.220]   Or I could say, how wonderful.
[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:01.940]   You've identified a tool that helps you
[01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:04.020]   to drink a glass of orange juice,
[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:05.700]   which obviously is what I did.
[01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:09.340]   And then she was able to have that in her toolbox.
[01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:11.460]   And we have multiple examples like this.
[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:13.620]   - So she would drink a glass of orange juice
[01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:15.420]   in order to quell her anxiety?
[01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:17.180]   - Yeah, if she felt bad.
[01:11:17.180 --> 01:11:19.300]   - And is this something that she would do
[01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:21.580]   even when she wasn't feeling stressed?
[01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:22.660]   I mean, it's kind of interesting,
[01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:25.300]   but it suggests and it completely squares
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:26.380]   with everything I understand
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:29.740]   about prefrontal cortical limbic pathways,
[01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:31.740]   which is that they're highly subject
[01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:33.660]   to contextual learning, right?
[01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:35.740]   If anything, the frontal cortex
[01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:38.260]   is this incredible feat of evolution
[01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:42.420]   that allows us to link essentially any stimulus
[01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:47.420]   with any non-learned response in the body, right?
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:50.420]   I mean, this is what allows soldiers
[01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:52.620]   to learn to overcome their fear of bomb blasts
[01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:55.100]   and run toward them if necessary.
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:57.580]   I mean, it can come both ways, of course.
[01:11:57.580 --> 01:12:01.260]   - But for me, and this still needs to be tested,
[01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:03.300]   is nothing necessarily about the glass
[01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:05.980]   or even the orange or the vitamin C or anything like that.
[01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:10.020]   It's about the fact that she has this message.
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:13.140]   She has sent a message to herself.
[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:15.380]   I can take care of myself
[01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:20.380]   because the best tool that I have is me, is my own body.
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:22.860]   Whatever these kids go in the future,
[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:25.300]   there's something that's always gonna be there with them,
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:26.560]   which is themselves.
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:30.260]   So they, as themselves, is the best tool they can have.
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:32.420]   You know, their body, the way they think,
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:33.900]   all of these things.
[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:35.860]   - Do you think this is why we hear
[01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:37.740]   the kind of classic anecdote
[01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:40.740]   about the patient who has anxiety attacks
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:44.740]   whose psychiatrist gives them a couple of pills
[01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:47.020]   of medication that can help reduce anxiety,
[01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:49.800]   and they decide to keep those pills in their pocket
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:51.500]   should they have an anxiety attack.
[01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:54.140]   And knowing they have those pills in their pocket
[01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:57.620]   allows them to control their anxiety.
[01:12:57.620 --> 01:13:01.460]   - Yes, because it gives them a sense of control, right?
[01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:03.860]   And they have control over this.
[01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:06.580]   And some people may choose to leave them in the fridge,
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:08.980]   and some people may choose to put them elsewhere,
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:10.420]   but it's what they decide.
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:12.900]   It's that decision they're making
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:16.320]   that gives them a sense of control.
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:17.420]   That's important.
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:19.840]   - It's so interesting, the sense of agency and control
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:23.700]   over the non-negotiable stress response.
[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:28.700]   You know, I sometimes, unfortunately, get, in my opinion,
[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:34.020]   incorrectly attached to ice baths.
[01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:36.380]   We've talked about cold water exposure on this podcast.
[01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:37.460]   Our colleague Craig Heller
[01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:39.340]   at Stanford Department of Biology,
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:41.020]   phenomenal scientist, was on this podcast.
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:43.940]   We talked about some of the beneficial uses
[01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:46.140]   of deliberate cold exposure.
[01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:47.180]   There are a lot of arguments.
[01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:48.580]   Does it increase metabolism?
[01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:50.160]   Doesn't seem like it does very much.
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.360]   Is it useful for inflammation?
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:55.280]   Perhaps, but the one thing that everyone agrees
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.720]   is that being in uncomfortably cold water
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:01.760]   makes you breathe faster, excuse me, and stress a bit.
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:03.600]   In other words, it kind of sucks.
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:05.080]   It's uncomfortable.
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:09.300]   And I think one non-negotiable fact
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:11.380]   about deliberate cold exposure
[01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:13.520]   is that it gives people an opportunity
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:16.140]   to explore their own stress response
[01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:17.740]   if they're going to do it safely, right?
[01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:19.600]   You take a cold shower, you have some control.
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.680]   You can get out immediately, obviously.
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:22.600]   You don't want it so cold
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.480]   that you give yourself cardiac arrest.
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:25.320]   You know, you have to be careful
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:26.460]   with deliberate cold exposure.
[01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:30.320]   But the adrenaline response to uncomfortable cold
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:31.720]   is non-negotiable.
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.960]   And I believe that whether or not somebody decides
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:38.000]   to recite the alphabet or think about how cold it is
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.200]   or whatever it is, what they're doing
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:42.880]   is they are practicing this frontal control
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:44.640]   over the limbic pathways.
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:47.420]   It's just sort of a general exercise
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:51.020]   for controlling the limbic system through thought.
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:54.980]   But as our colleague David Spiegel has said to me many times,
[01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:59.300]   he says, you know, it's not just the state that you're in.
[01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:01.500]   Here, we're talking about stress as the state.
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:03.940]   It's how you got there.
[01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:07.160]   And in particular, did you have any control
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:10.460]   over how you got there and whether or not you can get out?
[01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:11.800]   And I think that the kind of stress
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:14.580]   that you're talking about in post-traumatic stress disorder
[01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:17.080]   or in post-traumatic stress injury
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:20.620]   is typically of the sort that people didn't have a choice.
[01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:22.340]   Certainly, these kids didn't have a choice
[01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:26.080]   about the initial exposure to the trauma or stressors,
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:29.160]   but that also the stress is showing up
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.060]   when they would least want it to appear
[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:33.360]   or when it's very inconvenient to appear.
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:38.360]   - So this narrative is an important part of recovery,
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:43.900]   but we feel that it needs to come after the education piece
[01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:49.060]   and after learning a toolbox, having defenses,
[01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:52.440]   because sometimes it can get very charged
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:53.860]   when you go through the narrative
[01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:57.100]   and you want to assess many things during the narrative.
[01:15:57.100 --> 01:15:59.140]   You want to assess gaps of memory.
[01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:01.680]   You want to assess potential cues.
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:05.060]   You want to assess the emotions that are present.
[01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:08.340]   So, and the narrative should be one
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:11.100]   that covers not only negative events,
[01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:15.060]   but also neutral ones and also positive events.
[01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:16.740]   And it sounds like a lot, right?
[01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:18.040]   But when you're talking about kids
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.920]   that have 10, 11, 12 years, it is doable.
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:23.520]   You know, you can really manage it.
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:24.860]   By the way, with the cold showers,
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:28.140]   I think you're getting to the hinge of that see-saw.
[01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:31.340]   I think the cold shower probably does,
[01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:32.980]   not the cold shower, what do you call it?
[01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:33.800]   - Deliberate cold.
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:35.180]   It could be from a cold shower.
[01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:37.660]   I always say that because oftentimes people think,
[01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:40.140]   oh, you know, they're just trying to sell cold plunges.
[01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:41.660]   And the truth is you don't need that.
[01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:43.420]   I mean, the fact of the matter is
[01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:45.140]   it's independent of income.
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:46.920]   Actually, a cold shower will save you money
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:47.900]   on your heating bill.
[01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:49.660]   I'm not saying everyone should take a cold shower.
[01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:52.260]   I love a nice warm or hot shower.
[01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:54.260]   I sometimes use the cold shower as a stimulus
[01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:55.980]   and I hate it every time,
[01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:59.460]   but I always learn something each time.
[01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:01.480]   By the way, it feels great when you get out.
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:02.340]   So that's nice.
[01:17:02.340 --> 01:17:03.740]   And it does for many hours,
[01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:05.900]   especially if you end it with some warm water.
[01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:10.860]   But the learning I believe is in recognizing
[01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:14.080]   just how destabilized our patterns of thinking get
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:15.580]   when we have adrenaline in our body,
[01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:18.060]   which is what uncomfortable cold does.
[01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:21.000]   And it deploys that adrenaline in the brain and body.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.920]   And it also is a great learning
[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:25.140]   in seeing the return to a baseline,
[01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:27.460]   just seeing how that affects our psychology.
[01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:32.340]   And to my mind, I can think of no other zero cost
[01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:35.780]   or even negative cost, meaning saves money,
[01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:39.200]   approach that works the first time in every time,
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:42.420]   that is safe enough, right?
[01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:43.860]   I mean, I'm not interested in anything
[01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:45.620]   that has to do with snakes, for instance.
[01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:46.620]   I don't mind spiders.
[01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:47.580]   I'll pick them up with my hands
[01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:49.180]   as long as it's not a black widow
[01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:51.500]   or a particularly large spider and I'll put it outside.
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.020]   But I don't like snakes.
[01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:53.900]   I don't like thinking about them.
[01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:55.020]   I don't like being near them.
[01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:57.820]   So, you know, there are other stressors that one could use,
[01:17:57.820 --> 01:17:59.420]   but it's so individual.
[01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:01.420]   Whereas cold water seems to be
[01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:02.940]   pretty uncomfortable for everybody.
[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:04.740]   - I think you need some exposure of snakes
[01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:05.900]   when you're cold.
[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:07.220]   (laughing)
[01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:08.100]   - No interest.
[01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:08.940]   It's so interesting.
[01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:10.580]   You know, these things get so firmly rooted,
[01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:13.500]   but I'd love to talk about this toolbox
[01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:18.660]   because first of all, it's according to your work,
[01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:21.980]   and this has been done repeatedly, it's very effective.
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:24.940]   And I love the idea that it can be customized.
[01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:28.540]   So the words that come to mind is a customized toolbox
[01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:31.460]   for combating stress and PTSD.
[01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:34.660]   And the fact that it can be customized
[01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:35.860]   and maybe even covert,
[01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:37.580]   like we can have these tools inside us.
[01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:39.060]   We don't need to share them with anybody
[01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:42.020]   if we don't want to, but that they are very effective.
[01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:44.260]   I think that those are very compelling reasons
[01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:48.140]   for exploring the toolbox approach a bit more here.
[01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:50.940]   So you mentioned one way to go about this
[01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:54.500]   is to think about or to have in mind some negative,
[01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:57.780]   some neutral and some positive experiences.
[01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:59.500]   And then to think about the different tools
[01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:02.180]   that one would deploy under those different conditions.
[01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:03.020]   - Correct.
[01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:06.340]   So the exercise of the events is a lifeline
[01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:08.180]   that we do separate from the toolbox.
[01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:10.820]   We actually work on the toolbox first
[01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:15.820]   to identify coping mechanisms and coping tools that help.
[01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:17.940]   - So what would that look like?
[01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:20.540]   Let's say I'm a nine-year-old, I come into your clinic
[01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:23.540]   and I meet the criteria for PTSI or PTSD.
[01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:28.420]   What sorts of questions would you ask?
[01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:30.660]   - Yes, so the first thing I would say,
[01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:34.220]   when you're feeling a certain way,
[01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:36.180]   whatever way we're talking about, right?
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:38.380]   - Anxious. - Agitated, anxious.
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:39.220]   - Nervous.
[01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:40.980]   - Is there anything that makes you feel better?
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:43.660]   Because the experience of having something
[01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:46.440]   and they bringing something is important too.
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:49.220]   And sometimes they do, they say, I listen to music
[01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:53.060]   or I play the guitar or I go to play or--
[01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:53.900]   - My friends.
[01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:58.020]   - Or my friends or my teammates mostly, actually.
[01:19:58.020 --> 01:19:58.940]   - They say teammates?
[01:19:58.940 --> 01:20:00.420]   - Teammates is pretty popular.
[01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:01.260]   - I love that.
[01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:03.300]   - Yeah, there's something about sports.
[01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:06.380]   And sports is something that comes up a lot
[01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:07.780]   when we do the toolbox.
[01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:10.740]   People put in their sports they're doing
[01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:14.100]   or talking to their coach or talking to their teammates
[01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:16.800]   or learning a new sport.
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:20.500]   Sports are big, so that's an example that they give.
[01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:23.100]   Talking to friends,
[01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:28.240]   planning a sleepover,
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:30.220]   listening to music,
[01:20:30.220 --> 01:20:33.860]   different things like this.
[01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:35.340]   - Are there any particular tools
[01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:40.340]   for when kids are stuck in a stress response?
[01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:41.260]   - Yes.
[01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:45.860]   - Because I, myself, am familiar with the toolkits
[01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:48.900]   that I use, certainly teammates is one of them.
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:51.240]   And I have others, including long exhale breathing,
[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:53.380]   physiological size, these things will be familiar
[01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:55.460]   to some of the listeners.
[01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:59.260]   But certainly there are times when we're stressed
[01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:01.840]   about something and we don't want to be
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:05.260]   and we have a hard time pulling our thoughts
[01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:09.300]   and our emotions and the stress response out.
[01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:11.500]   - So the ones I just mentioned are some ideas
[01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:12.900]   that the kids bring with them.
[01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:17.460]   What we always try to do is we teach them
[01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:19.600]   exercises of relaxation.
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:21.620]   We have to be very careful with this
[01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:25.540]   because, like you say, it's good to be personalized, right?
[01:21:25.540 --> 01:21:29.220]   It's good that it's adapted to the kid.
[01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:32.700]   And that's why we don't tell them put this in your toolbox.
[01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:35.740]   We tell them learn it and if it helps you,
[01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:38.940]   you decide if you put it in the toolbox or not.
[01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:41.340]   So when I talk about the treatment being not so much
[01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:44.060]   about the what, because there's many components here
[01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:48.820]   like education, narrative, that are common, right?
[01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:51.500]   Exposure, we can talk about.
[01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:54.100]   It's not so much about the what, but it's about the how.
[01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:57.820]   It's about empowering kids to identify those cues,
[01:21:57.820 --> 01:22:00.620]   to say if a tool works or doesn't work,
[01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:02.740]   to develop their own tools.
[01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:05.600]   So, but sometimes they're very stuck, right?
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:07.340]   And they need a little bit of help.
[01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:10.020]   So we teach them breathing exercises
[01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:11.360]   and we have a script for that.
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:14.620]   We teach them muscle relaxation
[01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:17.120]   and we have something for that.
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:20.240]   We teach them the positive thinking, for example.
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:23.080]   So that's a cognitive type of tool.
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:29.540]   And we teach them mindfulness because of our other work
[01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:32.820]   in prevention that we can talk about later
[01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:37.820]   in which mindfulness has been helpful.
[01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:42.620]   And also yoga, very simple yoga exercises.
[01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:44.820]   So nothing too complicated.
[01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:47.940]   Things like the mountain pose, for example,
[01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:50.560]   can be quite helpful for some kids.
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:55.560]   If anything, it helps them reassess the moment and stop.
[01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:58.760]   And if we're gonna think about it
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:01.000]   in cognitive behavioral terms,
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.240]   kind of break that chain of negative thoughts
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:06.600]   that happen one after the other,
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:08.760]   which can lead to a panic attack, right?
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:12.320]   That's many times how a panic attack can start.
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:13.520]   - Well, what's so interesting to me
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:16.720]   about the stress response is that while it's quick to start,
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:19.620]   it's slow to shut off for logical reasons
[01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:23.800]   related to our evolutionary trajectory, right?
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:26.420]   Wouldn't it be wonderful if you could stress when needed
[01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:27.820]   and then it would turn off when needed?
[01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:29.500]   But what we're really talking about here
[01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:31.860]   is intervening in the stress response
[01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:33.680]   either before or as it's happening,
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:35.420]   but then also making sure that the tail
[01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:37.340]   of that stress response isn't too long.
[01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:40.300]   - We're also talking about eradicating stress
[01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:42.300]   that causes discomfort, right?
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:45.840]   And this causes distress,
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:49.200]   not necessarily to live a life without stress
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:51.920]   or to get rid completely of stress
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:53.960]   'cause that would be impossible.
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:58.600]   - In certain cultures, there are accepted practices
[01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:01.880]   that adults use to deal with stress,
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:03.680]   things like worry beads.
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:05.680]   And a few years back, there were those,
[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:07.920]   what are those, what were the little spinner things
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:08.780]   that kids had?
[01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:12.580]   When those were popular, maybe they're still popular,
[01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:16.020]   did you observe any reductions in stress?
[01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:17.300]   You know, kids have a lot of energy.
[01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:20.860]   Like sometimes I think we confuse energy and stress.
[01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:22.540]   Wouldn't we all love to have the kind of energy
[01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:23.860]   that we had in childhood?
[01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:27.260]   I was observing this the other day.
[01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:29.820]   You'll see a kid sitting cross-legged, listening in class,
[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:32.180]   and then all of a sudden it's time to move across the room
[01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:34.020]   and they'll just pop up and move across the room.
[01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:35.540]   Like when was the last time any of us
[01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:36.740]   like popped up out of our chairs
[01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:39.980]   unless we were particularly excited or scared as adults?
[01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:42.060]   Just that immediacy to action
[01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:45.880]   implies that there's a lot of energy in the system.
[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:47.940]   So I could imagine that having some ways
[01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:51.300]   to siphon off some of that energy through,
[01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:53.340]   as far as I can tell, you know,
[01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:55.380]   things like worry beads or fidgets
[01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:56.580]   or whatever those are called.
[01:24:56.580 --> 01:24:58.580]   I mean, they might irritate some adults around,
[01:24:58.580 --> 01:24:59.940]   but really they're pretty innocuous
[01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:00.780]   when you think about it.
[01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:04.020]   - I like that you're not calling it nervous energy
[01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:06.380]   because it is just what you said, it's just energy.
[01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:09.740]   It's extra energy that needs to be placed somewhere
[01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:11.540]   and they're trying to find out where to place it.
[01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:13.660]   - I mean, we have colleagues that, not all of them,
[01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:15.980]   this is not a requirement for being a professor at Stanford,
[01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:19.660]   but I've got colleagues that work 80 hours a week.
[01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:23.140]   You could argue that's healthy or unhealthy
[01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:25.940]   depending on the context and their agreements with others,
[01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:28.760]   but, you know, that requires a lot of energy
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:33.060]   and I know they are not particularly happy working less.
[01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:35.760]   So, you know, I think sometimes we are dismissive
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:40.300]   or kind of pejorative about physical energy
[01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:41.640]   and shaking and moving.
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:44.040]   But, you know, I see, I know someone in my life
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:46.060]   who bounces her knee while she works
[01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:48.880]   and it kind of makes me a little bit nervous,
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:52.060]   but boy, does she have a lot of focus and energy.
[01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:54.220]   You know, so, I mean, I think it's wonderful,
[01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:55.060]   in other words.
[01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:56.900]   - Yeah, and some of us, you know,
[01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:59.900]   choose to have meetings while walking
[01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:01.420]   rather than being in an office.
[01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:02.540]   - That's certainly my preference.
[01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:04.700]   - You know, I go for a walk sometimes
[01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:06.140]   when I have a meeting.
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:09.060]   So, yes, so there is increased energy,
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:13.020]   but there's increased energy that of,
[01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:14.540]   I feel like I need to do something
[01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:16.060]   and there's increased energy
[01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:18.000]   that causes a lot of discomfort.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.060]   So, for this kid, kids that experience discomfort,
[01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:25.820]   then they can look at their toolbox and say,
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:27.860]   "Which one I'm gonna use?"
[01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:29.780]   And that gives them also a choice,
[01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:32.940]   which goes back to that sense of control again.
[01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:35.460]   - Earlier, meaning off microphone,
[01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:39.100]   we were talking about the fact that some people,
[01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:41.940]   indeed some kids, have a different tendency
[01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:45.380]   to anchor towards thinking or feeling or action
[01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:46.220]   when under stress.
[01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:49.860]   And you were describing the four quadrant system.
[01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:51.820]   Could you share with us this four quadrant system?
[01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:54.520]   Because I think it's both extremely valuable
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:57.780]   to children and to adults.
[01:26:57.780 --> 01:26:59.100]   It's certainly something that I plan
[01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:01.460]   to incorporate into my life.
[01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:04.460]   - Yes, so we have to be careful
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:07.500]   with structured interventions
[01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:10.740]   because sometimes structured interventions
[01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:14.220]   can break a little bit the fluidity
[01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:18.980]   of the relationship that a therapist and a child may have
[01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:21.420]   or a therapist and a patient.
[01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:24.300]   So, it's better to be semi-structured
[01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:28.860]   and to really be attentive to the temperament
[01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:32.100]   that the kid brings into that relationship
[01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:33.620]   or into that session.
[01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:36.620]   And certainly, with the toolbox, as you mentioned,
[01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:38.500]   we see an example of that.
[01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:43.340]   We also add that in Q-Center therapy
[01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:48.260]   by dissecting and examining a response.
[01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:53.260]   So, for example, a child that breaks windows
[01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:55.840]   or a child that screams
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:59.460]   or a child that leaves the classroom running,
[01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:02.500]   we try to understand what's happening at that moment.
[01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:05.620]   And the way that we do that is by looking at a square.
[01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:09.300]   And a square is composed of four corners.
[01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:13.060]   And the four corners are what you're thinking,
[01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:15.120]   so it's a cognitive side to it,
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:19.660]   what you're feeling emotionally,
[01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:23.300]   what you're feeling physically,
[01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:28.300]   and what you're actually doing, what the action is.
[01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:32.620]   And this is your classical triangle
[01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:34.200]   of cognitive behavioral therapy
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:36.220]   in terms of what you're thinking,
[01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:38.460]   what you're doing, and how you're feeling.
[01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:41.380]   But we felt it was important to add
[01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:44.460]   that somatic physiological component
[01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:46.820]   because for many children,
[01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:49.460]   they don't have the vocabulary to talk about all of this.
[01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:51.060]   They just tell you, "I have a headache,"
[01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:52.580]   or, "I have a stomachache,"
[01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:56.480]   and there's no other medical reason that explains it, right?
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:00.300]   So, depending on the kid that comes,
[01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:03.220]   you're gonna start examining their response
[01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:05.300]   through one of those corners.
[01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:06.980]   So, if the kid is really brainy
[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:09.020]   and likes to think about the things they think
[01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:12.980]   or don't think, you start in the cognitive corner.
[01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:15.460]   Other kids are very attentive to their body
[01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:17.460]   and they say, "I feel my heart racing
[01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:21.820]   when I engage in this behavior or in this response,"
[01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:23.500]   and you start with that corner.
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:26.020]   The beauty of this is that most of the time,
[01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:27.900]   you don't have to work in all of the corners.
[01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:30.100]   By just working in one corner,
[01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:34.460]   all the other corners change and a new response develops.
[01:29:34.460 --> 01:29:38.080]   Okay, so if I'm thinking that I'm not in danger,
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:39.740]   maybe I don't need to leave running.
[01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:42.380]   Maybe I can just tell the teacher
[01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:45.460]   I'm distressed by the amount of noise.
[01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:47.940]   All of a sudden, the kid has created a new square.
[01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:48.860]   That's another square.
[01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:52.020]   So, hopefully we take that one response as a square
[01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:56.660]   and build a cube, right, of many potential responses
[01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:59.140]   so that when the cube happens,
[01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:03.580]   now there's an armamentarium of responses
[01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:08.420]   and if I'm too distressed to think what response to do,
[01:30:08.420 --> 01:30:12.060]   I can bring myself there by using my toolbox.
[01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:15.300]   So, it all kinds of starts tying together
[01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:19.580]   and then as I have more responses, as I understand cues,
[01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:24.580]   I can begin talking about this narrative that I have
[01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:29.660]   where I will fix some cognitive distortions, hopefully,
[01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:34.660]   like it was my fault I made it happen to things like,
[01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:37.140]   no, it wasn't my fault.
[01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:40.660]   Somebody else was responsible and I'm just a survivor,
[01:30:40.660 --> 01:30:41.660]   right, I'm not a victim.
[01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:42.500]   I'm a survivor.
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:44.980]   That's another cognitive distortion that can be fixed.
[01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:49.100]   So, all of that, we've included all of this
[01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:51.540]   in a manual for therapists, right?
[01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:53.220]   So, we have a manual for therapists
[01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:56.620]   that is called Cue Center Therapy for Youth
[01:30:56.620 --> 01:31:00.620]   with Post-Traumatic Symptoms published by Oxford.
[01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:05.620]   But I believe that adults that want to re-examine
[01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:08.380]   their childhood or their history
[01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:10.620]   or want to think about their kids
[01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:13.500]   or are interested in trauma can get a lot
[01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:17.180]   from actually examining this manual and studying this manual
[01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:19.820]   and in fact, I believe in so, so strongly
[01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:24.820]   that we are beginning the first steps of adapting it
[01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:29.340]   not only for youth, but also for adults.
[01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:33.060]   - In this four-corner system, and forgive me
[01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:34.840]   because I called it a four-quadrant system,
[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:37.540]   but in this four corners of the square system,
[01:31:37.540 --> 01:31:39.380]   you said there's thinking, which is cognitive,
[01:31:39.380 --> 01:31:43.280]   there are emotions, then there's feelings,
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:45.900]   which are somatic, physical, and then actions.
[01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:47.340]   So, actions are straightforward.
[01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:50.500]   Thinking would be, for instance,
[01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:52.740]   if I understand correctly, I'm in danger.
[01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:56.300]   Emotions would be, I'm scared.
[01:31:56.300 --> 01:32:00.740]   So, it's a verbal label.
[01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:04.660]   I'm depressed, I'm scared, I'm sad, I'm--
[01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:06.420]   - Yeah, in a way, it's cognitive too, right?
[01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:09.020]   But it carries an emotion with it.
[01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:10.660]   And then, in terms of the physical feeling,
[01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:13.820]   it's of the body, but it could include of the head too.
[01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:17.060]   Like, I have a headache, or my heart is racing,
[01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:20.940]   or I'm, you know, or something of that sort.
[01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:22.980]   And then, actions, of course, is the action that they--
[01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:24.660]   - And action is a really fun one
[01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:27.060]   because you can imagine there are some kids
[01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:29.340]   that are not psychologically minded at all,
[01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:32.020]   and they don't even want to engage in this with me.
[01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:33.980]   And they are like, okay, what is it that I'm doing?
[01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:35.300]   I'll do something different.
[01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:38.300]   So, they'll immediately develop the next square.
[01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:41.700]   So, they cannot talk too much about their emotions
[01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:43.780]   or how they're feeling physically
[01:32:43.780 --> 01:32:46.020]   or look at the negative thought.
[01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:47.940]   But they say, oh, is the problem
[01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:49.820]   that I'm running out of the classroom?
[01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:51.540]   Well, what if I don't?
[01:32:51.540 --> 01:32:53.380]   And they give you another action.
[01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:56.540]   And so, some kids start with that corner.
[01:32:56.540 --> 01:32:59.260]   So, you can really start with any of the corners.
[01:32:59.260 --> 01:33:01.020]   - Yeah, I love that earlier,
[01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:04.140]   you were talking about practicing positive thinking
[01:33:04.140 --> 01:33:06.500]   even when, perhaps especially when,
[01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:09.040]   one is not in the stress response or trauma response,
[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:11.220]   but also, of course, when one is in the trauma response.
[01:33:11.220 --> 01:33:13.720]   I think that's just so vitally important
[01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:16.980]   for people to hear, certainly for me to hear.
[01:33:16.980 --> 01:33:18.820]   I'm not claiming to have PTSD,
[01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:23.100]   but as a novel concept that I've not heard raised before
[01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:26.300]   around these topics.
[01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:29.300]   The other is this four-corner system,
[01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:33.780]   which immediately occurs to me as so powerful
[01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:37.860]   because it breaks down the kind of reflex arc
[01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:40.700]   of the stress response into its component parts, right?
[01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:42.580]   What's of the body, what's of the thinking,
[01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:44.200]   what's of the thinking that's emotional,
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:45.420]   and then what's the action?
[01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:50.420]   And you said as soon as one identifies one of these corners
[01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:53.580]   and starts to kind of look at it differently
[01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:56.020]   and consider some of the optionality that exists,
[01:33:56.020 --> 01:33:58.700]   an alternative, that all these other options
[01:33:58.700 --> 01:33:59.740]   cascade from that.
[01:33:59.740 --> 01:34:01.260]   And I believe that in doing that,
[01:34:01.260 --> 01:34:05.980]   you've described what for thousands of years, really,
[01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:08.340]   but recently we've heard a lot about
[01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:12.940]   in the kind of mindfulness arena as creating space, right?
[01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:15.540]   Like this notion of creating space, not outer space,
[01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:19.960]   but creating space within us to choose better options
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:21.960]   is something that I think until right now,
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:23.020]   as you've described this,
[01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:25.660]   has remained unfortunately very mysterious.
[01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:28.860]   You know, people talk about, okay, you know,
[01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:32.120]   you want to be reactive, excuse me,
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:34.940]   you want to be responsive, not reactive.
[01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:37.700]   Responsive implies some optionality to your responses.
[01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:39.620]   Reactive implies kind of a reflex arc
[01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:42.120]   of just whatever the default was.
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:44.680]   But this notion of space is like too squishy for me
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:48.940]   as a biologist to really be able to latch onto.
[01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:52.340]   And I would argue, given the prevalence of PTSD and stress,
[01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:54.220]   it's probably too squishy for most people.
[01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:57.060]   It hasn't really led anywhere specific.
[01:34:57.060 --> 01:34:58.700]   But I think what you're describing is
[01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:01.580]   the ability to become responsive as opposed to reactive,
[01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:03.860]   assuming that the word responsive
[01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:06.740]   includes like some options within it.
[01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:09.740]   And so this four corner system to me is genius
[01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:12.700]   because it gives us an anchor point to start from.
[01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:14.660]   So could you say that if a child or adult
[01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:17.620]   is uncomfortably stressed, maybe about a trauma,
[01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:20.480]   but just is caught in the stress response,
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:22.500]   that actually pulling out a pen or pencil
[01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:25.500]   or crayon as it were, and drawing a square,
[01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:27.540]   and just really like, what am I thinking?
[01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:31.140]   Like, maybe it's just like, this is terrible.
[01:35:31.140 --> 01:35:32.700]   I don't like it.
[01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:35.700]   Writing down, I'm embarrassed.
[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:38.060]   Like, I'm not with my friends.
[01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:40.300]   Like, I'm like not, you know, I'm flush.
[01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:42.740]   You know, my cheeks are flushing, whatever.
[01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:47.460]   I'm feeling like just weighed down or something.
[01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:49.080]   And then thinking, well, what are the actions?
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:51.780]   I wanna remove myself from the situation.
[01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:54.100]   At that point is the suggestion that one find,
[01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:57.940]   what is the point of entry that feels most accessible?
[01:35:57.940 --> 01:35:59.180]   And to start there?
[01:35:59.180 --> 01:36:01.460]   - Yes, with one caveat.
[01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:06.460]   We usually use Wagner's emotional thermometer
[01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:10.140]   to measure where the kid is at.
[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:13.460]   And it goes from like zero to 10 or one to 10
[01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:16.220]   with different levels of stress.
[01:36:16.220 --> 01:36:19.000]   And it's good to use something concrete
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.140]   because sometimes we think they're at 10
[01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:23.300]   and they're at five or vice versa.
[01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:26.180]   - Yeah, we're very poor at assessing others' internal states.
[01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:27.020]   - We are.
[01:36:27.020 --> 01:36:27.900]   - As our colleague, Karl Deisseroth,
[01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:29.980]   who's also been a guest on this podcast,
[01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:31.860]   I heard him once say this in a very large lecture.
[01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:33.580]   He said, you know, we're terrible,
[01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:36.720]   absolutely dreadful at assessing other people's emotions.
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:38.820]   In fact, most of the time, we don't even know how we feel.
[01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:40.340]   - Yeah, he always says that.
[01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:41.180]   And it's true.
[01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:42.500]   - It's so true. - And it's true.
[01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:46.160]   But I would say if the kid is at 10 at that moment,
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:48.860]   the best thing is to use a tool from the toolbox
[01:36:48.860 --> 01:36:51.380]   and not to engage on the square at that moment
[01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:53.060]   until they come down a little bit
[01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:55.920]   and they can pay attention and they can listen to you.
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:59.700]   Because then they will be letting the information come in.
[01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:02.700]   They're so emotionally charged right at the moment
[01:37:02.700 --> 01:37:04.860]   that that may not be the right time.
[01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:09.620]   Which also, by the way, is the same thing
[01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:11.580]   as when you need to talk to kids
[01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:16.580]   about traumas that are happening in our society, right?
[01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:18.820]   Sometimes you just wanna let them know
[01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:21.780]   that the door is open for communication.
[01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:23.340]   You may wanna talk about it at the moment
[01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:25.080]   where the kid may not be ready.
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:28.260]   But you can let them know, well, when you're ready,
[01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:29.900]   we can talk about it.
[01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:30.940]   Here, the same.
[01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:35.580]   When you're ready, let's go over the square exercise
[01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:38.180]   or the example if the kid is already familiar with it.
[01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:40.820]   Or I have something to show you, right?
[01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:43.380]   And pick his curiosity that way.
[01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:46.620]   But I would say use the thermometer
[01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:48.500]   to see if that's a good time, right?
[01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:51.140]   If it's 10, nine, eight, probably not.
[01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:53.740]   Wait 'til it's like five, four, three.
[01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:55.660]   And then engage in that.
[01:37:55.660 --> 01:37:59.380]   - So the toolbox should be used
[01:37:59.380 --> 01:38:01.020]   essentially under any conditions.
[01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:05.200]   And the kid should generate their own tools
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:09.060]   to add to the toolbox, customize the tools.
[01:38:09.060 --> 01:38:11.600]   And then the square can be used
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:14.300]   when they are at a slightly lower level of stress
[01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:15.660]   because it requires a certain level
[01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:16.900]   of cognitive intervention.
[01:38:16.900 --> 01:38:18.340]   They need to be able to think about
[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:21.020]   and express their own state.
[01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:22.260]   - Correct.
[01:38:22.260 --> 01:38:24.900]   - And is this something that you suggest kids
[01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:26.260]   only do with their therapist
[01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:28.660]   or is this something that they can do on their own as well,
[01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:30.900]   assuming that they're old enough to write
[01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:31.780]   and to think about it?
[01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:34.820]   - Yeah, well, our hope is that after a kid
[01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:36.500]   goes through Q-Center therapy,
[01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:39.500]   that they can internalize a lot of these activities
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:43.420]   and exercises and, like I said, become their own tool.
[01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:47.020]   Take those for life and continue to use them.
[01:38:47.020 --> 01:38:49.340]   - Yeah, I'm certain that many, many adults,
[01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:51.820]   not just children, can benefit from these tools.
[01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:55.820]   I mean, I would argue that most of the bad things
[01:38:55.820 --> 01:38:59.100]   that happen in the world are the consequence
[01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:04.100]   of dysregulated autonomic function, put kind of bluntly.
[01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:06.460]   - Yeah, by directional, right?
[01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:07.740]   Kind of making things worse.
[01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:11.140]   Once they happen, they impact the system even further.
[01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:12.740]   - Yeah, I mean, I think most homicides
[01:39:12.740 --> 01:39:15.620]   are homicides of jealous rage.
[01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:18.920]   From what I have read, I don't know if that's still true.
[01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:21.660]   And, of course, then that is probably also true
[01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:23.940]   for all the things that are not as severe as homicide,
[01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:27.180]   but still dreadfully bad, like assault and things like that.
[01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:29.940]   - And it's interesting that you bring that up
[01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:32.600]   because I often think about,
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:35.580]   we've been talking about how we experience trauma
[01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:37.420]   as individuals, right?
[01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:41.740]   But we experience trauma in our civilization.
[01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:43.820]   We experience trauma in our history.
[01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:46.100]   We experience trauma in our nation
[01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:48.540]   and how does a nation heal?
[01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:50.480]   How does a system heal?
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:53.080]   Well, the steps are not that different.
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:54.860]   - Perhaps this is the appropriate time
[01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:58.000]   to give you the opportunity to editorialize
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.300]   a little bit about social media and online behavior,
[01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:05.020]   setting aside really aggressive online behavior,
[01:40:05.020 --> 01:40:06.240]   bullying and things like that,
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:08.540]   which of course exists and is really serious.
[01:40:08.540 --> 01:40:15.580]   Do you see the behavior of kids and adults online,
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:20.540]   this sort of just maybe even the addiction to online,
[01:40:20.540 --> 01:40:22.160]   commenting and reading of comments
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:24.200]   and the kind of battling of issues back and forth,
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:25.740]   that clearly isn't going anywhere.
[01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:27.480]   Some of it goes someplace functional,
[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:29.320]   but most of it, I would argue,
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:31.320]   especially among the adults, is going nowhere.
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:32.480]   It's just very circular.
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:35.080]   It's my side versus your side, my side versus your side.
[01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:37.700]   And emotions get really stirred on there.
[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:40.400]   Do you think that is reflective
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:44.000]   of a lack of tools for self-regulation?
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.240]   Do you think like what we're seeing
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:50.320]   is the manifestation of just a lot of challenges
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:54.040]   in the world and/or an outlet for people
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:55.720]   to just vent without the need
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:57.560]   to address their own internal state
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:40:59.160]   and what's underlying the venting?
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:03.160]   I know many very, very intelligent adults
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:05.520]   who eventually just had to quit social media
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:08.200]   in order to have any level of functionality in their life.
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:10.500]   - It comes down to that space you were talking about
[01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:14.200]   and building that space and creating that mindfulness,
[01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:16.520]   time that you need, which is also gonna be personalized.
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:19.600]   It's gonna be different for different people.
[01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:23.200]   This spring, I was in Morocco and I visited the Medina.
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:25.100]   I was staying at the Medina.
[01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:30.100]   And I was overstimulated, as you can be, and enjoying it.
[01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:32.560]   But I imagine this is the state
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:35.000]   that teenagers are in all the time
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.780]   when they are with social media,
[01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:39.760]   bringing them information and different tidbits
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:43.440]   and different things that are happening all over the place.
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:46.400]   And very much like I found it restful
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:49.420]   to go to my hotel for a couple of hours before dinner,
[01:41:49.420 --> 01:41:52.560]   people need to build that space.
[01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:55.300]   People need to create that space.
[01:41:55.300 --> 01:42:00.300]   What I tell parents is that it's important to remember
[01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:05.040]   that this was also a very helpful tool for us
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:07.560]   when we were in the pandemic, right?
[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:10.520]   The kids were interacting socially,
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:15.140]   academics, school was happening through technology.
[01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:20.140]   So how can something so good be at times so harmful?
[01:42:20.140 --> 01:42:26.520]   And I remind them about when they brought hammers
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:29.120]   to their house, right?
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:30.480]   And they had little kids.
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:32.820]   They had to teach them how to use them.
[01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:34.680]   This is a very important tool
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:36.680]   when you need to nail something
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:39.000]   or when you need to take a nail out.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.200]   This can be dangerous, right?
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:41.360]   You don't run with scissors.
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:44.800]   You have all these rules around other tools.
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:48.960]   We have to have these rules around social media as well.
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:53.080]   And I think that's what the Surgeon General is getting at
[01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:56.960]   when he talks about we need some regulations around it.
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:01.120]   But at the family level,
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:05.800]   I think parents need to say there are certain boundaries
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:08.760]   that we are going to have.
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:11.240]   So at dinner time, for example,
[01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:15.400]   in this baskets, all the phones go into the basket.
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:17.800]   And that's what we're gonna do from now on.
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:19.360]   But it is very difficult
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:22.200]   because when you establish rules like that,
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:24.820]   kids watch you like a hawk.
[01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:29.820]   So you have to model the behavior you are expecting, right?
[01:43:29.820 --> 01:43:32.320]   The moment that you as a parent decide,
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:34.200]   oh no, I need to go to the basket during dinner
[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:38.040]   'cause I need to check this thing out, then it breaks.
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:39.840]   So that's what I think.
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:41.920]   I think it can be quite helpful.
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:44.860]   And I think that it can be dangerous.
[01:43:44.860 --> 01:43:46.960]   We've seen examples of that.
[01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:51.020]   And it is a tool like any other, like a knife,
[01:43:51.020 --> 01:43:53.160]   that we need to learn how to use it.
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:55.360]   - I think what you're describing to my mind
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:58.720]   is a situation where the tool has become the terrain.
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:01.120]   It's like social media has become the landscape
[01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:05.100]   in which many people live as opposed to the real world.
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.400]   I mean, my original understanding of social media
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:11.260]   is that one would experience and do things in the real world
[01:44:11.260 --> 01:44:12.840]   and then bring those to social media.
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:13.700]   That's certainly what I do.
[01:44:13.700 --> 01:44:14.920]   I teach on social media
[01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:18.200]   and I do the learning for that teaching,
[01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:19.840]   the drawing in some cases,
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:22.880]   the preparation in the quote-unquote real world,
[01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:24.040]   and then bring it to social media.
[01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:27.560]   But I feel like it's almost like the hammer
[01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:31.040]   has become the landscape.
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:31.880]   - The house.
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:33.040]   - Yeah, or something like that.
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:34.100]   The hammer has become the house.
[01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:38.180]   Yes, that's a much more eloquent and appropriate.
[01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:40.020]   Yeah, I feel like with social media,
[01:44:40.020 --> 01:44:42.200]   the tool of social media has become the terrain
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:43.620]   in which people are living in.
[01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:47.320]   So that just feels like a closed loop.
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:51.660]   Use sort of an engineering example.
[01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:53.100]   So it's like, it doesn't go anywhere.
[01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:55.140]   Like you can never actually get the relief
[01:44:55.140 --> 01:44:55.980]   that you're seeking.
[01:44:55.980 --> 01:44:58.780]   And I think we default to descriptions about dopamine
[01:44:58.780 --> 01:45:00.180]   and dopamine hits.
[01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:01.780]   And there's some truth to that.
[01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:04.660]   But the more I look at the literature on brain activation
[01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:06.740]   during social media use,
[01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:08.540]   it doesn't really speak to dopamine
[01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:10.540]   and reward prediction error as much as it does,
[01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:13.500]   just sort of a mindless compulsion
[01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:17.140]   and kind of just passive overuse
[01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:18.340]   as opposed to like rewards,
[01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:19.900]   like, oh, this is so cool and that's so cool.
[01:45:19.900 --> 01:45:21.020]   I mean, it can be.
[01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:22.340]   I mean, I've been watching some of the track
[01:45:22.340 --> 01:45:24.500]   and field races of the Olympics and there's a,
[01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:26.900]   I mean, I was cheering out loud for a few of them,
[01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:31.780]   but it's usually something quite different.
[01:45:31.780 --> 01:45:36.780]   - Yeah, I think if you live in a virtual world all the time,
[01:45:36.780 --> 01:45:40.620]   then you're not living, right?
[01:45:40.620 --> 01:45:42.100]   You're not in the real world.
[01:45:42.100 --> 01:45:44.340]   So it's like, how can you use the virtual?
[01:45:44.340 --> 01:45:46.500]   Are there ways that the virtual world
[01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:51.460]   can help you live the current world in a better way?
[01:45:51.460 --> 01:45:54.360]   Yes, so that's why I think it's helpful.
[01:45:55.420 --> 01:46:00.420]   But if you replace your life with a virtual life,
[01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:01.620]   then that's a pity.
[01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:03.100]   That's very sad.
[01:46:03.100 --> 01:46:06.740]   - I see that in a lot of adults as well as kids.
[01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:08.180]   Let's talk about risk.
[01:46:08.180 --> 01:46:10.020]   You know, up until now we've been envisioning
[01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:12.720]   a treatment situation or a study that you're running
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:15.660]   where a kid and perhaps parents as well
[01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:19.020]   are brought into the laboratory or clinic at Stanford
[01:46:19.020 --> 01:46:20.400]   and you're talking to them, assessing them.
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:22.100]   They're developing a custom toolbox
[01:46:22.100 --> 01:46:25.500]   and that's a wonderful opportunity
[01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:30.500]   for kids who sadly have PTSD or PTSI to be assessed
[01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:34.140]   and to develop tools that can really help them.
[01:46:34.140 --> 01:46:37.420]   That's been proven by the work you and others have done.
[01:46:37.420 --> 01:46:41.560]   But what about the many, many millions of kids and adults
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:45.140]   who are at risk either because of lack of access,
[01:46:45.140 --> 01:46:49.460]   it could be due to finances, geography, poverty,
[01:46:49.460 --> 01:46:51.380]   any number of different things,
[01:46:51.380 --> 01:46:55.700]   or they simply don't even know what PTSD and PTSI are.
[01:46:55.700 --> 01:46:57.740]   Their parents don't know.
[01:46:57.740 --> 01:46:59.740]   What are some of the tools and interventions
[01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:01.540]   that you think could be implemented
[01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:03.180]   at the level of schools, families,
[01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:05.940]   or even individuals that might help them?
[01:47:05.940 --> 01:47:08.460]   - So here we were in my program,
[01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:11.340]   we had created Q-Center Therapy, right?
[01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:14.120]   We developed a training program for it.
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:18.220]   We have a Q-Center Therapy training program.
[01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:21.180]   And I became increasingly concerned
[01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:24.340]   about my own staff and my own team
[01:47:24.340 --> 01:47:26.340]   because this is a team, as you can imagine,
[01:47:26.340 --> 01:47:28.180]   that are seeing trauma every day
[01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:30.780]   and are seeing trauma in kids.
[01:47:30.780 --> 01:47:33.980]   I was worried about vicarious trauma
[01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:37.080]   and the impact that this would have in their health.
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:41.660]   So I remember that when I was doing my residency,
[01:47:41.660 --> 01:47:43.700]   I took a course in hypnosis
[01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:47.860]   and I was really struck by how much control
[01:47:47.860 --> 01:47:49.660]   one has during hypnosis.
[01:47:49.660 --> 01:47:52.220]   So it's nothing like anyone is doing to anybody else.
[01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:57.220]   It's really kind of having the control to relax yourself.
[01:47:57.220 --> 01:47:59.140]   - Self-directed hypnosis.
[01:47:59.140 --> 01:48:02.300]   - Self-directed type of hypnosis.
[01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:05.500]   And I said, "I would like to bring something like that."
[01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:10.500]   And I met a PhD, John Rutger, that was a yoga instructor
[01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:12.980]   and also a mindfulness instructor,
[01:48:12.980 --> 01:48:14.680]   and I brought him to the team.
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:16.860]   And he had other things to do,
[01:48:16.860 --> 01:48:19.460]   but one of the main goals was to take care of the team.
[01:48:19.460 --> 01:48:22.500]   And we started regularly practicing yoga
[01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:24.280]   and practicing mindfulness,
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:25.780]   as we were seeing all these cases
[01:48:25.780 --> 01:48:28.100]   and working with trauma and so forth.
[01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:30.980]   And I was able to see firsthand
[01:48:30.980 --> 01:48:35.460]   how helpful it was for me personally and for my team.
[01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:39.340]   At the time, we were doing some work in Ispalo Alto
[01:48:39.340 --> 01:48:40.860]   in some of the schools.
[01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:42.480]   We were doing some pro bono counseling
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:44.140]   because this is another problem.
[01:48:44.140 --> 01:48:46.800]   Many of the schools have no counselors, right?
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:51.520]   So, but this was a while back, it's like 10 years ago.
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:52.980]   - Yeah, the Ispalo Alto School District,
[01:48:52.980 --> 01:48:56.060]   for those that don't know, Palo Alto,
[01:48:56.060 --> 01:48:57.740]   I guess it could be called West Palo Alto,
[01:48:57.740 --> 01:49:00.580]   is a separate city and county from Ispalo Alto.
[01:49:00.580 --> 01:49:04.700]   Palo Alto is not exclusively, but is known for,
[01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:07.260]   at least nowadays, let's just be frank,
[01:49:07.260 --> 01:49:08.640]   fairly tremendous affluence
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:12.580]   relative to most places in the world, put bluntly.
[01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:15.000]   Ispalo Alto, a separate county,
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.260]   different school district, police system,
[01:49:17.260 --> 01:49:19.940]   has for as long as I can remember,
[01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:23.660]   having grown up in Palo Alto,
[01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:27.740]   has always been stricken with far fewer resources.
[01:49:27.740 --> 01:49:30.880]   And while there've been tremendous efforts
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:34.380]   to improve the situation there,
[01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:38.000]   it is still at a steep disadvantage financially.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:43.060]   But of course, many amazing people working there
[01:49:43.060 --> 01:49:46.540]   and living there, and growing up,
[01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:51.540]   there was some exchange across that Ispalo Alto,
[01:49:51.540 --> 01:49:55.420]   West Palo Alto border, as it were, in the school district,
[01:49:55.420 --> 01:49:57.540]   but they're pretty separate domains
[01:49:57.540 --> 01:49:58.940]   when it comes to resources.
[01:49:58.940 --> 01:50:02.500]   - And it is not now, but many years ago,
[01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:06.440]   it was the number one murder capital in the US.
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:11.300]   It's also the place where Facebook is now.
[01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:14.780]   So, and IKEA, and there's people
[01:50:14.780 --> 01:50:17.700]   that bring some employment to the area,
[01:50:17.700 --> 01:50:20.700]   but also bring some other problems.
[01:50:20.700 --> 01:50:23.700]   - Yeah, that area where IKEA is used to be called,
[01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:25.820]   do you remember it was called Whiskey Gulch?
[01:50:25.820 --> 01:50:26.660]   - Didn't know that.
[01:50:26.660 --> 01:50:28.900]   - For years, kind of terrible name, right?
[01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:30.600]   But it was a stark contrast,
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:32.620]   right as you literally crossed the train tracks
[01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:34.760]   heading towards Highway 101.
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:38.180]   In that case, that portion of Palo Alto, Crescent Park,
[01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:41.940]   an extreme of wealth to an extreme of poverty.
[01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:42.780]   - Yes.
[01:50:42.780 --> 01:50:46.340]   - In literally a distance of 10 meters.
[01:50:46.340 --> 01:50:51.340]   - And of course, there are wonderful families there.
[01:50:51.340 --> 01:50:52.980]   - Of course.
[01:50:52.980 --> 01:50:55.420]   - That support the kids.
[01:50:55.420 --> 01:50:59.020]   There's a Ravenswood, which is also the other name
[01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:01.600]   for Ispalo Alto Family Health Center,
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:07.340]   that really provides a lot of good resources to the area.
[01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:09.460]   And there's a good school district,
[01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:11.660]   but at this time, it was missing counselors.
[01:51:11.660 --> 01:51:13.900]   So we had some presence there.
[01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:16.780]   We decided to bring some of the things
[01:51:16.780 --> 01:51:19.260]   that we were learning in terms of yoga
[01:51:19.260 --> 01:51:23.780]   and in terms of mindfulness to two of the classrooms.
[01:51:23.780 --> 01:51:25.820]   At the end of about three months,
[01:51:25.820 --> 01:51:28.040]   I get called to the principal's office.
[01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:30.180]   I have to go to the principal's office,
[01:51:30.180 --> 01:51:32.500]   because the principal was interested in finding out
[01:51:32.500 --> 01:51:34.220]   what was going on in there,
[01:51:34.220 --> 01:51:37.300]   because none of those kids in those classrooms
[01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:40.080]   had gone to her office in all that time.
[01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:40.920]   - They hadn't gotten in trouble.
[01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:42.820]   - They had not gotten in trouble.
[01:51:42.820 --> 01:51:44.260]   So I explained what it was,
[01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:49.260]   and we decided to do a bigger scale study.
[01:51:49.260 --> 01:51:54.500]   And eventually, we partner with a group called Pure Power,
[01:51:54.500 --> 01:52:01.020]   purepowerinc.org, developing a yoga
[01:52:01.020 --> 01:52:06.260]   and mindfulness curriculum for students at schools.
[01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:11.340]   At that time, we started bringing yoga instructors
[01:52:11.340 --> 01:52:15.140]   into the classroom, but we very quickly learned
[01:52:15.140 --> 01:52:16.780]   that the best approach to this
[01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:18.740]   would be to teach the teachers
[01:52:18.740 --> 01:52:21.180]   and have the teachers teach the students,
[01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:23.660]   because the yoga instructors had no training
[01:52:23.660 --> 01:52:28.120]   on how to control a classroom, and the teachers did.
[01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:30.260]   And some of these poses were so elemental
[01:52:30.260 --> 01:52:34.960]   that it was okay if they were not a yoga instructor.
[01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:38.540]   So anyway, we tested this curriculum,
[01:52:38.540 --> 01:52:42.860]   and there was a piece about it in the "NewsHour."
[01:52:42.860 --> 01:52:45.220]   I think it might still be there.
[01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:50.220]   And I get this wonderful phone call
[01:52:50.220 --> 01:52:55.080]   by this family in New York
[01:52:55.080 --> 01:53:00.080]   that wants to see how they can help me spread this further
[01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:02.740]   into not only the classrooms that I was working,
[01:53:02.740 --> 01:53:07.700]   but into the whole school or the school district.
[01:53:07.700 --> 01:53:11.960]   And I knew at that point that two things were important,
[01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:14.160]   not only that they wanted and I wanted,
[01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:16.980]   but that the school district should want it,
[01:53:16.980 --> 01:53:19.860]   and also that at this time,
[01:53:19.860 --> 01:53:22.620]   we would need to do a very in-depth study
[01:53:22.620 --> 01:53:24.740]   to see what our intervention was
[01:53:24.740 --> 01:53:26.480]   and what the curriculum was,
[01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:29.160]   because mindfulness can be the name
[01:53:29.160 --> 01:53:30.560]   that you give to many different things.
[01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:33.500]   So we wanted to make sure that our intervention
[01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:35.960]   of yoga and mindfulness exercises
[01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:37.980]   that now Pure Power carries
[01:53:37.980 --> 01:53:40.980]   is really what we're being tested.
[01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:45.980]   So they were very, very helpful in helping sponsor
[01:53:45.980 --> 01:53:49.000]   not only the dissemination of this curriculum
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:50.600]   through the school district,
[01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:52.640]   but a randomized controlled trial
[01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:55.200]   where we actually had a whole other district
[01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:56.380]   that would also be trained,
[01:53:56.380 --> 01:53:58.320]   but only after the study was over.
[01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:02.900]   It was a demographically comparison school in San Jose,
[01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:04.540]   in the city of San Jose.
[01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:08.260]   Near enough for us to conduct the study,
[01:54:08.260 --> 01:54:12.020]   but far enough that where there wouldn't be
[01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:15.900]   too much dissemination from one district to the other.
[01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:20.900]   And it was good that we did a district-wide control,
[01:54:20.900 --> 01:54:25.020]   because if we would have done it by classroom or by school,
[01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:26.780]   it wouldn't have worked,
[01:54:26.780 --> 01:54:29.800]   because there was so much diffusion
[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:32.220]   of what the kids were learning
[01:54:32.220 --> 01:54:35.140]   into their friends and their family
[01:54:35.140 --> 01:54:37.980]   and the other classes and the other people
[01:54:37.980 --> 01:54:40.500]   in the community that was beautiful to see,
[01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:43.140]   but it would have ruined a control study.
[01:54:43.140 --> 01:54:45.460]   - So you needed literally physical
[01:54:45.460 --> 01:54:47.660]   and demographic separation.
[01:54:47.660 --> 01:54:50.260]   So you went with what used to be called the peninsula,
[01:54:50.260 --> 01:54:53.700]   the South Bay, East Palo Alto, and then San Jose,
[01:54:53.700 --> 01:54:56.560]   far enough apart that the kids weren't talking enough
[01:54:56.560 --> 01:55:00.220]   to blur the treatment groups.
[01:55:00.220 --> 01:55:01.060]   - Exactly.
[01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:02.660]   So we demonstrated feasibility.
[01:55:02.660 --> 01:55:03.820]   You know, we were able to do it.
[01:55:03.820 --> 01:55:05.780]   We demonstrated acceptability.
[01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:07.400]   The kids liked it.
[01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:08.660]   The kids would do it.
[01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:12.260]   Some schools actually had a room specifically
[01:55:12.260 --> 01:55:14.480]   for them to go and do it,
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:18.340]   even if the teachers were not doing it in the classroom.
[01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:19.340]   And it ranged.
[01:55:19.340 --> 01:55:24.140]   It was like twice to three times a week
[01:55:24.140 --> 01:55:29.140]   for 15 or 50 minutes of this curriculum in the classrooms.
[01:55:29.140 --> 01:55:31.640]   - Can I, sorry to interrupt,
[01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:34.300]   but could I ask you a little bit more about the curriculum?
[01:55:34.300 --> 01:55:38.900]   You said five, you said, or 15 to 50,
[01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:42.860]   five zero minutes, two to three times per week.
[01:55:42.860 --> 01:55:47.260]   And did the kids have to like change over
[01:55:47.260 --> 01:55:49.100]   to their yoga clothes?
[01:55:49.100 --> 01:55:52.900]   The reason I ask is that I could think of a number
[01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:55.100]   of real world barriers to getting something
[01:55:55.100 --> 01:55:56.380]   like this implemented.
[01:55:56.380 --> 01:55:58.940]   I feel like going jogging, usually you get a little sweaty,
[01:55:58.940 --> 01:56:00.740]   you need running shoes, you know,
[01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:03.740]   there are other forms of exercise that require that less.
[01:56:03.740 --> 01:56:07.060]   But these days they're, as far as I know,
[01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:09.280]   not every school requires physical education.
[01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:11.700]   When I was growing up and through high school,
[01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:13.380]   you had to literally suit up.
[01:56:13.380 --> 01:56:16.700]   You had to go in the locker room and put on your PE clothes
[01:56:16.700 --> 01:56:19.980]   as it were, and then you'd run or play volleyball,
[01:56:19.980 --> 01:56:23.460]   whatever the PE teacher told you to do, you had to do,
[01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:25.440]   if you wanted to get a decent grade.
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:29.300]   Is the yoga being done, I mean, you said it could be
[01:56:29.300 --> 01:56:31.300]   in the classroom or at a separate location,
[01:56:31.300 --> 01:56:33.260]   but are the kids basically getting up out of their chairs
[01:56:33.260 --> 01:56:34.940]   and just right in their school clothes,
[01:56:34.940 --> 01:56:37.100]   doing this for 15 to 50 minutes?
[01:56:37.100 --> 01:56:41.940]   - So they stay with the same clothes, but we had mats.
[01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:44.220]   They had mats, every student had a mat.
[01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:45.660]   Then it's interesting that you mentioned PE
[01:56:45.660 --> 01:56:47.780]   because the first suggestion was let's do it
[01:56:47.780 --> 01:56:48.780]   during PE class.
[01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:50.900]   And I'm like, no, that's, you know,
[01:56:50.900 --> 01:56:52.580]   rowing from Paul to get to Peter.
[01:56:52.580 --> 01:56:57.460]   Until I learned that PE, like you said, was not happening.
[01:56:57.460 --> 01:56:59.260]   - So sad. - Which I couldn't believe.
[01:56:59.260 --> 01:57:01.420]   And if anything, I think the study has helped
[01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:03.020]   for them to bring PE back.
[01:57:03.020 --> 01:57:05.940]   And the classes, which are these lessons
[01:57:05.940 --> 01:57:07.900]   and yoga movements and mindfulness,
[01:57:07.900 --> 01:57:11.140]   were really taking place in the classroom
[01:57:11.140 --> 01:57:13.100]   that whatever teacher learned it.
[01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:14.440]   So if it was the math teacher,
[01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:16.680]   she was taking 10 minutes aside to do it.
[01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:19.100]   If it was the PE and PE was not happening there,
[01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:21.580]   they may dedicate the 50 minutes
[01:57:21.580 --> 01:57:24.460]   to do the yoga and the mindfulness.
[01:57:24.460 --> 01:57:29.460]   So we have a number of assessments that we did.
[01:57:29.460 --> 01:57:36.540]   And like I mentioned, yes, it was acceptable
[01:57:36.540 --> 01:57:39.740]   and it improved mood and all of that.
[01:57:39.740 --> 01:57:41.620]   But I think the biggest finding
[01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:43.780]   that we published from that study
[01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:47.700]   was that it increased 73 minutes of sleep.
[01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:51.720]   - 73? - 73 minutes of sleep.
[01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:53.480]   - That's extraordinarily high.
[01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:56.520]   - On average for the students.
[01:57:56.520 --> 01:57:58.560]   And it increased the depth of sleep.
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:00.880]   So something that we did in this study
[01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:03.800]   was that we also did portable polysomnography.
[01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:07.960]   And it was not in a sleep center, it was in their own house.
[01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:11.640]   So collaborating with Ruth O'Hara from the department,
[01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:14.700]   we were able to assess their sleep.
[01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:16.900]   And deep sleep is very important.
[01:58:16.900 --> 01:58:19.980]   That's where you process the events of the day.
[01:58:19.980 --> 01:58:24.540]   So these kids were increasing REM, total sleep,
[01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:27.420]   deep sleep, doing much better.
[01:58:27.420 --> 01:58:30.940]   And then another thing because of our previous studies
[01:58:30.940 --> 01:58:34.020]   that we've talked about in terms of brain function,
[01:58:34.020 --> 01:58:35.140]   this hasn't been published,
[01:58:35.140 --> 01:58:37.700]   but we have some preliminary data demonstrating
[01:58:37.700 --> 01:58:41.060]   that those kids that went through the intervention
[01:58:41.060 --> 01:58:44.340]   before and after the intervention
[01:58:44.340 --> 01:58:48.100]   were able to decrease the activity of their amygdala,
[01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:51.460]   which was very powerful and also very helpful.
[01:58:51.460 --> 01:58:54.460]   So many of these kids adapted this
[01:58:54.460 --> 01:58:56.940]   into their daily practices.
[01:58:56.940 --> 01:59:00.300]   After this study was over, we went to our control group
[01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:03.140]   and we taught those lessons there.
[01:59:03.140 --> 01:59:08.140]   And now it has served to identify even more tools
[01:59:10.620 --> 01:59:13.620]   that we can put in the toolbox of CCT.
[01:59:13.620 --> 01:59:17.180]   So we utilize some of the things there and here.
[01:59:17.180 --> 01:59:20.700]   So Pure Power and our program have been collaborating a lot
[01:59:20.700 --> 01:59:25.220]   because it covers the risk group and the treatment group.
[01:59:25.220 --> 01:59:28.660]   So sometimes when we go to schools and we do trainings,
[01:59:28.660 --> 01:59:31.900]   we partner with them so that we have
[01:59:31.900 --> 01:59:35.940]   the yoga and the mindfulness and the cue center therapy.
[01:59:35.940 --> 01:59:40.140]   And I by no means mean these are the two things
[01:59:40.140 --> 01:59:41.740]   that everybody should be using.
[01:59:41.740 --> 01:59:43.580]   I'm saying these are two more tools.
[01:59:43.580 --> 01:59:46.280]   In fact, I think we need more development,
[01:59:46.280 --> 01:59:47.980]   more development of interventions,
[01:59:47.980 --> 01:59:51.620]   both for treatment and for intervention.
[01:59:51.620 --> 01:59:56.100]   And how do we identify who needs what and how
[01:59:56.100 --> 01:59:58.860]   is where we're moving next.
[01:59:58.860 --> 02:00:00.740]   - Wow, what spectacular results.
[02:00:00.740 --> 02:00:05.740]   I mean, 73 minutes more of sleep is like,
[02:00:05.740 --> 02:00:09.060]   I mean, talk about effective medicine.
[02:00:09.060 --> 02:00:12.140]   You know, I mean, we agreed at the outset
[02:00:12.140 --> 02:00:14.300]   that sleep is the foundation of mental health
[02:00:14.300 --> 02:00:16.620]   and physical health and all forms of cognitive
[02:00:16.620 --> 02:00:17.700]   and physical performance.
[02:00:17.700 --> 02:00:21.180]   I mean, when we know this, the study done at Stanford,
[02:00:21.180 --> 02:00:22.900]   albeit a small one of having athletes
[02:00:22.900 --> 02:00:25.340]   just get a bit more sleep or even just stay in bed
[02:00:25.340 --> 02:00:27.420]   a bit longer and no, not on their phones,
[02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:29.780]   but just lying quietly with eyes closed and resting
[02:00:29.780 --> 02:00:32.900]   or sleeping more improved shot accuracy
[02:00:32.900 --> 02:00:33.820]   in basketball players.
[02:00:33.820 --> 02:00:35.620]   This has been shown in so many domains
[02:00:35.620 --> 02:00:36.820]   of cognitive and physical.
[02:00:36.820 --> 02:00:40.120]   It's like not even worth spooling off all the examples,
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:41.940]   but that is spectacular.
[02:00:41.940 --> 02:00:45.020]   It also makes me think I should start doing some yoga
[02:00:45.020 --> 02:00:50.020]   because I do get enough sleep, but that's significant.
[02:00:50.020 --> 02:00:53.000]   What do you think are the barriers
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:56.180]   to having this sort of thing implemented at national scale?
[02:00:56.180 --> 02:00:57.780]   Now, I always think about this, you know,
[02:00:57.780 --> 02:01:00.380]   okay, so the results are in, maybe it's one study,
[02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:02.540]   maybe it's two, but you're talking about
[02:01:02.540 --> 02:01:06.420]   a basically harmless intervention
[02:01:06.420 --> 02:01:10.040]   and actually it's a very therapeutic intervention.
[02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:11.420]   Sure, there are some people that won't be able
[02:01:11.420 --> 02:01:12.940]   to do all the poses, et cetera,
[02:01:12.940 --> 02:01:16.080]   but there's always something that somebody can do.
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:17.420]   Even people that are immobilized,
[02:01:17.420 --> 02:01:19.960]   there are certain forms of, believe it or not,
[02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:23.860]   cognitive yoga and that friend of mine
[02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:26.820]   who works with people who are quadriplegic,
[02:01:26.820 --> 02:01:28.180]   they can do certain things to keep
[02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:29.880]   nervous system function online.
[02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:34.080]   But, you know, essentially anyone can do this.
[02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:37.200]   What are the barriers from taking it
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:40.320]   from this East Palo Alto school to a study,
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:42.840]   to another study, okay, San Jose school,
[02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:44.780]   now let's say you get all of Santa Clara
[02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:49.480]   or, you know, neighboring counties, you know,
[02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:51.360]   what does it take to get something implemented
[02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:55.360]   at national scale so that the work can really ripple out
[02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:57.320]   and benefit all these kids who are,
[02:01:57.320 --> 02:01:58.880]   of course, are going to become adults?
[02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:01.000]   - Well, we need to prioritize it, right?
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:05.880]   We need to prioritize education for starters, right?
[02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:08.320]   We were talking about classes not even having
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:12.760]   physical education or arts, for example.
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:15.920]   And we need to prioritize mental health
[02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:17.880]   and it needs to start early.
[02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:21.000]   And I think when we work our national budget,
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:25.440]   it needs to be, there needs to be earmarks
[02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:28.760]   for these two areas that should go
[02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:31.040]   to the Department of Education.
[02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:34.280]   The Department of Education should make this a priority.
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:39.080]   Teachers are really, really overworked.
[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:44.080]   They are under-resourced and, like,
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:48.920]   pediatricians many times are responsible
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:50.780]   for doing somebody else's work, right?
[02:02:50.780 --> 02:02:53.120]   Everybody tells them, oh, this will only take a minute
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:54.600]   or this will only take two minutes
[02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:57.840]   or if you make this assessment, you know, you can do that.
[02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:01.480]   But the time is finite, right?
[02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:02.720]   And the space is finite.
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:04.960]   So they need more space, they need more time,
[02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:07.280]   they need more support, teachers.
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:12.520]   And then this needs to be a priority from districts
[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:15.240]   to really implement programs like this.
[02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:18.720]   - So parents and even non-parents
[02:03:18.720 --> 02:03:21.960]   talk to the teachers in the school,
[02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:23.800]   talk to the principals in the school.
[02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:26.600]   And I've been learning about the power of the telephone
[02:03:27.480 --> 02:03:28.600]   for lobbying.
[02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:31.320]   This has been around some things I've been involved with
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:32.940]   with the veterans community.
[02:03:32.940 --> 02:03:36.920]   I mean, the ability to look up and call your congressman
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:40.560]   or congresswoman and tell them that you are
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:44.360]   really concerned about or excited about a particular program
[02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:46.120]   does have impact.
[02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:48.960]   I mean, at first I didn't think this was true,
[02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:52.960]   but I realized that when they start getting 50, 100,
[02:03:52.960 --> 02:03:56.340]   1,000 messages about a particular topic
[02:03:56.340 --> 02:03:59.600]   that people are passionate about, they pay attention.
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:02.080]   Maybe it's because they just want to get reelected.
[02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:05.360]   Maybe it's because they are genuinely concerned
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:06.300]   about helping people.
[02:04:06.300 --> 02:04:07.820]   I like to think it's the latter.
[02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:09.520]   But regardless of which,
[02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:12.920]   they run those messages up the flagpole
[02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:15.500]   when they bring issues.
[02:04:15.500 --> 02:04:17.400]   - So let me tell you what we just started doing
[02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:18.320]   in Puerto Rico.
[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:20.300]   I'm from Puerto Rico.
[02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:23.720]   But Puerto Rico and Puerto Rican students
[02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:27.300]   have gone through a number of natural disasters
[02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:28.840]   that started with Hurricane Maria
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:31.040]   and continue with other hurricanes
[02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:35.640]   and also with earthquakes
[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:38.480]   and this has led to violence
[02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:41.000]   and there's interpersonal violence.
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.840]   So some of the kids in Puerto Rico have gone through a lot.
[02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:47.560]   But also, the whole island of Puerto Rico
[02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:51.040]   is one of the largest school districts in the U.S.
[02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:52.780]   The whole island is one district,
[02:04:52.780 --> 02:04:54.480]   meaning that if you do something,
[02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:56.440]   like a program like the one we're talking about,
[02:04:56.440 --> 02:04:59.160]   you can implement it island wide.
[02:04:59.160 --> 02:05:05.200]   Currently, we are launching a project in Puerto Rico
[02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:08.120]   where all the teachers will be trained
[02:05:08.120 --> 02:05:10.860]   in the yoga and mindfulness curriculum
[02:05:10.860 --> 02:05:13.540]   and all of the counselors will be trained
[02:05:13.540 --> 02:05:15.960]   in Q-Center therapy.
[02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:19.280]   The kids are being assessed at baseline.
[02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:21.880]   Then they go through their yoga and curriculum
[02:05:21.880 --> 02:05:24.240]   and at time two, when they get assessed
[02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:26.040]   to see how they're doing after that,
[02:05:26.040 --> 02:05:30.760]   we also screen those that have PTSS,
[02:05:30.760 --> 02:05:33.600]   post-traumatic stress symptoms that cause impairment.
[02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:37.200]   And then those go through the trained counselors
[02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:41.040]   and then they get assessed again in the latter part.
[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:44.320]   So the goal is for us to,
[02:05:44.320 --> 02:05:46.000]   although we've talked about the two treatments,
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:51.000]   we've never really had both of them happen simultaneously
[02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:53.800]   and we want to do it in a large scale like this
[02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:56.920]   because if this works, if it's sustainable,
[02:05:56.920 --> 02:06:00.080]   if it's feasible, we can actually then bring it
[02:06:00.080 --> 02:06:03.040]   to other large school districts like New York,
[02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:08.040]   like LA, for example, and start disseminating this.
[02:06:08.040 --> 02:06:10.220]   - I'd love your thoughts on something.
[02:06:10.220 --> 02:06:12.680]   I'm so impressed that you were able to bring this
[02:06:12.680 --> 02:06:14.840]   from a study or set of studies
[02:06:14.840 --> 02:06:18.140]   to a much larger scale in Puerto Rico.
[02:06:19.600 --> 02:06:23.200]   I could be wrong here, but I feel like in the United States,
[02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:26.880]   we have such a culture of fame and popularity
[02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:30.520]   and reward around people who are extreme performers.
[02:06:30.520 --> 02:06:33.120]   You know, we hear about these NBA stars
[02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:34.560]   and right now we're seeing a lot
[02:06:34.560 --> 02:06:36.360]   about these incredible track stars
[02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:39.360]   and where we have these tech innovators
[02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:41.180]   that found huge companies.
[02:06:41.180 --> 02:06:42.720]   They used to be called unicorn companies,
[02:06:42.720 --> 02:06:45.280]   but all these incredible successes.
[02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:50.280]   And I wonder sometimes if the hyper-emphasis
[02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:55.120]   on these extreme performers has led to the conclusion
[02:06:55.120 --> 02:06:57.920]   in young people that unless you're going to be
[02:06:57.920 --> 02:07:02.920]   Michael Jordan or LeBron James or Mark Zuckerberg
[02:07:02.920 --> 02:07:07.680]   or Elon Musk or win an Olympic gold medal,
[02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:10.080]   that the practices that feed up
[02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:11.820]   to becoming those sorts of people,
[02:07:11.820 --> 02:07:14.160]   like mindfulness meditation or becoming a yogi
[02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:15.680]   for that matter, you know,
[02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:18.680]   I feel like there's been a push towards hyper-specialization
[02:07:18.680 --> 02:07:22.980]   and performance to the point where people are writing off
[02:07:22.980 --> 02:07:27.980]   the incredible utility of physical activity, mindfulness,
[02:07:27.980 --> 02:07:32.660]   you know, learning math, science, literature, and the arts.
[02:07:32.660 --> 02:07:33.500]   You know, you're talking about the arts.
[02:07:33.500 --> 02:07:34.320]   - Humanities studies.
[02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:35.160]   - Yeah, music, right?
[02:07:35.160 --> 02:07:36.600]   Even for people like me, you know, I mean, sure.
[02:07:36.600 --> 02:07:37.920]   They always gave me the triangle
[02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:39.120]   'cause I could manage that one
[02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:40.640]   and I don't want to insult the triangle players.
[02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:42.740]   I'm sure it's much more complicated
[02:07:42.740 --> 02:07:44.480]   than I'm giving the impression it is.
[02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:47.680]   But the point is that I feel like there's been
[02:07:47.680 --> 02:07:52.240]   a not so gradual disintegration of the idea
[02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:53.860]   that there is utility.
[02:07:53.860 --> 02:07:56.440]   Indeed, there's great benefit to doing things,
[02:07:56.440 --> 02:07:59.280]   not with the intention of becoming a high performer,
[02:07:59.280 --> 02:08:02.560]   but just doing them for sake of how it enriches us
[02:08:02.560 --> 02:08:05.780]   in a number of different ways, including our mental health.
[02:08:05.780 --> 02:08:09.200]   And I wonder whether or not the lack of PE is sort of a,
[02:08:09.200 --> 02:08:11.560]   well, if you're not going to run track
[02:08:11.560 --> 02:08:13.800]   and try and medal or something, you know,
[02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:16.400]   or go to championship meets, then like, what's the point?
[02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:19.520]   But I don't, I certainly don't subscribe to that.
[02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:21.280]   I'm curious what your thoughts are.
[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:25.780]   - Well, I think we need to redefine success
[02:08:25.780 --> 02:08:27.760]   and what it means to be successful.
[02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:31.480]   I think that we're currently describing it
[02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:33.420]   with the examples that you just gave,
[02:08:33.420 --> 02:08:36.520]   which probably was not the way that we were describing it
[02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:38.320]   in the '60s or the '70s.
[02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:45.280]   But it is harming individuals, which is most of us,
[02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:51.760]   that cannot attain that level of proficiency in an area.
[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:55.640]   And in fact, the individuals that are choosing
[02:08:55.640 --> 02:09:00.640]   to have a broader belonging, in a way, are more protected.
[02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:03.120]   I worry about those other individuals, too,
[02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:06.960]   that have that very personalized, not personalized,
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:11.600]   but very individualized, unique component in their life
[02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:14.240]   where they dedicate everything to that one thing.
[02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:18.120]   - Trust me, they often suffer in one or more
[02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:19.520]   of their other domains of life.
[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:22.320]   Some don't, but I would argue most do.
[02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:25.760]   - But the idea of belonging, right, is that you have,
[02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:29.820]   you belong to many different facets of life.
[02:09:29.820 --> 02:09:34.560]   You are a sports person, you're a community person,
[02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:37.360]   you're a student, you're a father,
[02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:40.560]   you're an aunt, you're different things.
[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:46.000]   When you're only one thing and that fails,
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.200]   your whole identity is gone.
[02:09:48.200 --> 02:09:49.840]   It doesn't even have to fail.
[02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:52.000]   You have to perceive that it has failed,
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:55.080]   and that's enough to throw you off course.
[02:09:55.080 --> 02:09:59.000]   And so with the current definition of success,
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.080]   we're not doing a service for those
[02:10:01.080 --> 02:10:03.080]   that attain that definition
[02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:05.440]   and those that do not attain that definition.
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:06.880]   I think it needs to be broader.
[02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:09.280]   I think belonging needs to be included.
[02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:12.480]   I think the way that we care, not only for ourselves,
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:17.240]   but for the rest of our citizens needs to be included.
[02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:18.980]   Citizenship is important.
[02:10:18.980 --> 02:10:22.960]   So it is dynamic.
[02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:26.360]   So far it has been dynamic, how we define success,
[02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:29.040]   and hopefully it will change again.
[02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:31.360]   - All right, I agree wholeheartedly.
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:34.520]   Let's talk about resilience.
[02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:39.200]   Earlier you said, you know, kids are not resilient,
[02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:42.920]   but you also implied, maybe you even stated it outright,
[02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:46.160]   that they can become resilient.
[02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:48.800]   What is resilience
[02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:51.560]   and what are some of the paths to resilience?
[02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:56.120]   - Resilience is a physical term, right?
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:11:00.800]   It means you bounce, the coil bounces back
[02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:04.880]   to where it was originally.
[02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:09.520]   I like to think of the word adaptation
[02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:12.160]   because it means not only you bounce back,
[02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:14.960]   but you bounce back to a better place.
[02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:17.680]   Like I like to think that we adapted
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:20.280]   during the experience of the pandemic
[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:23.080]   other than we were resilient of it.
[02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:27.080]   Yes, we were resilient because we survived it.
[02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:29.640]   Some of us did, not all, right?
[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:31.400]   Some of us have to deal with the grief
[02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:33.260]   of what happened during that time.
[02:11:33.260 --> 02:11:38.480]   But adaptation means that not only we go back
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:40.880]   to where we were before the pandemic,
[02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:43.720]   but that now we've learned from that experience
[02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:46.120]   to be in a better place.
[02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:50.680]   Now, we know very little about resilience
[02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:54.080]   and we definitely know very little biology about resilience.
[02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:57.920]   We know that having a sense of humor is good.
[02:11:57.920 --> 02:12:01.440]   We know that perseverance is good.
[02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:05.160]   We know that the presence of an adult in a child's life
[02:12:05.160 --> 02:12:07.520]   that was there to give them opportunity
[02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:11.160]   or to talk to them about things they were going through,
[02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:15.000]   that's probably the best known resilient factor.
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:21.720]   But what if it's not the presence of that adult,
[02:12:21.720 --> 02:12:24.400]   but there's something in that child
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:27.360]   that makes them seek and maintain
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:30.120]   that type of relationship, right?
[02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:33.640]   So I feel that we need to start looking
[02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:36.680]   at the biology of resilience.
[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:41.100]   And one way that we've done that in my program
[02:12:41.100 --> 02:12:45.040]   is through a collaboration with Alex Urban
[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:47.480]   from our department and from genetics,
[02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:50.560]   and Caroling Pertman, who's in his lab
[02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:52.120]   and one of his postdocs.
[02:12:53.400 --> 02:12:55.240]   They work with organoids,
[02:12:55.240 --> 02:12:57.220]   and I don't know if you've mentioned organoids before
[02:12:57.220 --> 02:12:58.060]   to your audience.
[02:12:58.060 --> 02:13:02.480]   - I have not, but one of my good friends
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:06.120]   and colleagues at Stanford, Sergio Pasca,
[02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:07.840]   is one of the world leaders in organoids,
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:09.520]   and we hope to host him on this podcast soon.
[02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:13.000]   But please educate us on organoids.
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.360]   They are oh so cool and oh so science fictiony,
[02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:17.920]   but they are oh so real as well.
[02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:21.840]   - So we have stem cells that can be converted
[02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:25.520]   to any type of cell under the appropriate nutrients
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:29.800]   and environments that we want to examine.
[02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:31.720]   So for a psychiatrist, of course,
[02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:34.520]   the interest is to turn them into neurons.
[02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:37.840]   And not only they can grow in a Petri dish,
[02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:41.880]   but they grow suspended, so it's almost like a 3D.
[02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:46.120]   And Sergio uses the term asembloid
[02:13:46.120 --> 02:13:49.040]   for when he actually assembles them further
[02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:51.880]   to build more organ-specific--
[02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:53.080]   - Mini brains.
[02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:56.020]   - Mini brains is the term that I like, yes.
[02:13:56.020 --> 02:13:59.600]   So these mini brains are these neurons
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:03.440]   that are growing in a circle like the brain,
[02:14:03.440 --> 02:14:05.560]   and they communicate with each other,
[02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:09.640]   and they are active with each other, and we can study.
[02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:11.360]   So in conversations with Alex,
[02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:13.560]   and now that you all know my previous work
[02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:15.280]   with cortisol and all that,
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:17.960]   I was telling him and Carolyn,
[02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:20.720]   well, why would happen if we expose
[02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:23.880]   some of these organoids to cortisol?
[02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:27.880]   And of course, we needed to come up with,
[02:14:27.880 --> 02:14:32.600]   oh, what would be the right amount that would mimic trauma?
[02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:35.880]   So we also involved Robert Zabolsky
[02:14:35.880 --> 02:14:38.880]   to help us come up with a concentration
[02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:41.120]   that would be trauma mimetic.
[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:44.400]   And so we exposed a number of organoids
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:47.160]   to different levels of cortisol.
[02:14:47.160 --> 02:14:48.640]   For some of them, it was a trauma.
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:50.400]   For others, they were not exposed.
[02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:53.000]   Then half of that amount, or much less of that amount,
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.960]   was a trigger, the cue, right?
[02:14:55.960 --> 02:14:58.120]   So some had the trauma and the cue.
[02:14:58.120 --> 02:15:00.600]   Some had no exposure.
[02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:01.840]   Some only had the cue.
[02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:05.200]   And then we compare what was associated
[02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:11.320]   with really, well, the first thing that they needed to do
[02:15:11.320 --> 02:15:14.040]   was identify that these neurons
[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:18.440]   actually had these glucocorticoid receptors
[02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:19.800]   and that they were active.
[02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:23.440]   And they did have them, and they were active.
[02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:27.320]   So we looked through epigenetic analysis,
[02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:29.080]   I should say, we is the royal we, right?
[02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:31.320]   It's more Alex and Carolyn.
[02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:35.960]   They look at the genes that were changed,
[02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:37.600]   that their activity changed
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:40.160]   because of this cortisol exposure.
[02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:41.880]   And through epigenetic analysis,
[02:15:41.880 --> 02:15:46.040]   which is this space between DNA and RNA,
[02:15:46.040 --> 02:15:50.120]   and there's like methylation patterns and all that,
[02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:53.560]   and some genes activity changes.
[02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:55.640]   Some turn on, some turn off.
[02:15:55.640 --> 02:15:59.800]   So interestingly, the majority of the genes
[02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:03.520]   that we found there were genes that have been addressed
[02:16:03.520 --> 02:16:06.680]   in the literature as potentially being related
[02:16:06.680 --> 02:16:08.600]   to post-traumatic stress disorder.
[02:16:08.600 --> 02:16:11.760]   Things like the glucocorticoid receptor genes
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:14.000]   and things that you would think of.
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.800]   But there was another subset of genes
[02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:19.280]   that we identified that were novel.
[02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:21.440]   And I was very interested in those
[02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:24.680]   because of my interest in accelerated aging
[02:16:24.680 --> 02:16:25.760]   because of stress.
[02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:30.760]   And those were genes that are related to collagen formation.
[02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:33.080]   And we know that atherosclerosis
[02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:36.000]   has been related to stress, for example.
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:40.560]   And we know that accelerated aging, not only in PTSD,
[02:16:40.560 --> 02:16:43.040]   but in mental health conditions overall,
[02:16:43.040 --> 02:16:47.000]   individuals that suffer from severe mental illness
[02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:51.640]   chronically in their life end up dying 25 years younger
[02:16:51.640 --> 02:16:53.080]   than the rest of the population.
[02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:55.360]   That's very significant.
[02:16:55.360 --> 02:17:00.000]   And so stress and accelerated aging, interesting.
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:03.280]   Okay, so these are interesting findings in organoids.
[02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:05.240]   But when you have those,
[02:17:05.240 --> 02:17:09.000]   what you do is you move on to a population study.
[02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:12.600]   So these kids in Puerto Rico
[02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:15.440]   that are going through these interventions,
[02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:17.960]   besides me checking on their PTSD,
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:20.200]   their anxiety, their depression,
[02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:22.960]   they're giving me a vocal swap.
[02:17:22.960 --> 02:17:26.320]   And in the vocal swap, those epithelial cells,
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:29.560]   we can actually take them through epigenetic analysis
[02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:32.880]   and see those kids at time one
[02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:35.800]   that even though they've gone through all this trauma,
[02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:40.800]   may not be faring that much worse as their counterparts
[02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:43.520]   and compare them.
[02:17:43.520 --> 02:17:47.560]   And not only that, we can actually also look at response,
[02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:49.680]   treatment response for the intervention,
[02:17:49.680 --> 02:17:52.760]   for the yoga and mindfulness preventive intervention,
[02:17:52.760 --> 02:17:56.240]   and for the treatment, for the cue center therapy.
[02:17:56.240 --> 02:17:57.360]   So that's the plan.
[02:17:57.360 --> 02:18:00.560]   That's the plan in trying to bring more light
[02:18:00.560 --> 02:18:04.400]   into what is the biology of resilience
[02:18:04.400 --> 02:18:08.200]   and how can we understand resilience better.
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:12.000]   - What a spectacular study, goodness.
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.800]   And if any of you missed some of the underlying mechanics,
[02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:16.380]   I'll just quickly recap.
[02:18:16.380 --> 02:18:21.380]   These organoids are little brains in a dish
[02:18:21.380 --> 02:18:25.880]   that came to be by virtue of taking fibroblasts
[02:18:25.880 --> 02:18:28.240]   or other cells, so skin cells essentially,
[02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:29.960]   put into dishes,
[02:18:29.960 --> 02:18:33.480]   provided for what are called transcription factors.
[02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:35.120]   These are the four transcription factors
[02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:38.120]   that Yamanaka won the Nobel prize for identifying
[02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:40.240]   that reverts those cells into stem cells.
[02:18:40.240 --> 02:18:43.240]   And then a few other goodies, molecular goodies,
[02:18:43.240 --> 02:18:46.160]   that then allow them to become neurons in particular.
[02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:48.320]   Then they grow into little mini brains.
[02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:52.220]   And then as Dr. Carrion was explaining,
[02:18:52.220 --> 02:18:56.500]   are exposed to cortisol at appropriate concentrations
[02:18:56.500 --> 02:19:00.280]   to mimic cortisol exposure in the whole person.
[02:19:00.280 --> 02:19:03.160]   And then from that, the genomes of those cells
[02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:04.840]   and the epigenomes are analyzed
[02:19:04.840 --> 02:19:06.840]   to identify potential targets.
[02:19:06.840 --> 02:19:09.400]   The results are brought back to these kids in Puerto Rico,
[02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:11.880]   such that the genomes of all these kids
[02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:13.840]   experiencing different levels of stress
[02:19:13.840 --> 02:19:16.960]   and yoga, mindfulness interventions, or not,
[02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:18.720]   maybe they're in the control group.
[02:19:18.720 --> 02:19:22.280]   The outcomes can be assessed and then one can address,
[02:19:22.280 --> 02:19:26.040]   hey, what are the genes that are protective against stress?
[02:19:26.040 --> 02:19:28.000]   AKA, what are the genes that are protective
[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.200]   against high levels of cortisol?
[02:19:30.200 --> 02:19:33.840]   And a bunch of other, surely to be very transformative
[02:19:33.840 --> 02:19:36.240]   and important facts about how stress impacts
[02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:40.000]   the young brain to either give rise to PTSD or not.
[02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.120]   I must say, as you described that study,
[02:19:42.120 --> 02:19:43.000]   I had three thoughts.
[02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.680]   One, wow, how awesome is this?
[02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:46.920]   That you can bridge across
[02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:48.680]   so many different levels of analysis.
[02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:51.600]   I mean, because you're talking about molecular genetics
[02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:56.520]   all the way up to yoga in school children in Puerto Rico.
[02:19:56.520 --> 02:20:00.600]   And PTSD, you know, it's just a complex disorder.
[02:20:00.600 --> 02:20:03.320]   I was also thinking to myself, wow,
[02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:05.600]   what an incredible place Stanford is
[02:20:05.600 --> 02:20:07.920]   that such a collaboration is possible, right?
[02:20:07.920 --> 02:20:10.880]   Makes me delight in the fact that colleagues like you exist
[02:20:10.880 --> 02:20:13.440]   and Sergio and forgive me the names of the other colleagues,
[02:20:13.440 --> 02:20:14.280]   I'm not familiar.
[02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:15.920]   - Alex Urban and Carolyn Perlman.
[02:20:15.920 --> 02:20:16.800]   - Thank you.
[02:20:16.800 --> 02:20:20.040]   And the third thing is how important it is to bridge
[02:20:20.040 --> 02:20:21.800]   across these different levels of analysis.
[02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:24.520]   I think this is the first time on this podcast
[02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:26.760]   where somebody has discussed an experiment
[02:20:26.760 --> 02:20:29.280]   that bridges across so many levels of analysis,
[02:20:29.280 --> 02:20:32.000]   literally from fibroblasts, skin cells in a dish,
[02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:35.840]   all the way to a complex psychiatric condition
[02:20:35.840 --> 02:20:39.840]   and in an attempt, excuse me, to create novel therapeutics.
[02:20:39.840 --> 02:20:41.920]   So it's just truly spectacular.
[02:20:41.920 --> 02:20:45.600]   So if people are sensing a even further surge in my energy,
[02:20:45.600 --> 02:20:47.960]   this is the kind of thing that gets me so excited
[02:20:47.960 --> 02:20:50.860]   because in the landscape of science, we often see a study
[02:20:50.860 --> 02:20:52.360]   or we hear about organoids
[02:20:52.360 --> 02:20:53.800]   or we hear about a yoga intervention.
[02:20:53.800 --> 02:20:56.560]   And these things tend to exist in silos, in isolation,
[02:20:56.560 --> 02:20:59.440]   but the ability to bridge across these levels of analysis,
[02:20:59.440 --> 02:21:01.200]   I believe is critical.
[02:21:01.200 --> 02:21:04.340]   And so, yeah, kudos to you
[02:21:04.340 --> 02:21:07.080]   for being a part of this incredible collaboration.
[02:21:07.080 --> 02:21:09.480]   - And collaborations are key, right?
[02:21:09.480 --> 02:21:12.080]   Because the world is so complex now
[02:21:12.080 --> 02:21:14.880]   that there's no way that a single lab
[02:21:14.880 --> 02:21:17.500]   could have all these expertise.
[02:21:17.500 --> 02:21:20.360]   So you're right, a place like Stanford allows
[02:21:20.360 --> 02:21:22.040]   for these communications to happen,
[02:21:22.040 --> 02:21:25.400]   for these collaborations to happen.
[02:21:25.400 --> 02:21:29.400]   In 28 years that I've been there, I have never heard,
[02:21:29.400 --> 02:21:31.480]   no, I'm not interested in that.
[02:21:31.480 --> 02:21:33.800]   - I always say it, at Stanford especially,
[02:21:33.800 --> 02:21:37.160]   if two scientists meet for more than 30 minutes,
[02:21:37.160 --> 02:21:39.200]   what comes out of that is a collaboration.
[02:21:39.200 --> 02:21:41.200]   [laughing]
[02:21:41.200 --> 02:21:42.800]   As a final question,
[02:21:42.800 --> 02:21:46.600]   I'm gonna ask you to limit it to one answer,
[02:21:46.600 --> 02:21:48.640]   but I'm sure that there are many.
[02:21:48.640 --> 02:21:52.480]   The question is, if you had a magic wand
[02:21:52.480 --> 02:21:57.480]   and you could get any message out to the whole world
[02:21:57.480 --> 02:22:02.000]   about PTSD and PTSI,
[02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:06.880]   in particular in kids, in young people, but also in adults,
[02:22:06.880 --> 02:22:08.120]   what is that message?
[02:22:08.120 --> 02:22:09.520]   What do you want people to know
[02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:12.320]   about post-traumatic stress disorder,
[02:22:12.320 --> 02:22:14.920]   stress and post-traumatic stress injury?
[02:22:14.920 --> 02:22:16.280]   - The first thing that comes to mind
[02:22:16.280 --> 02:22:19.680]   is the importance of listening
[02:22:19.680 --> 02:22:23.320]   and listening to what kids and adults have to say
[02:22:23.320 --> 02:22:26.240]   about their experiencing,
[02:22:26.240 --> 02:22:29.360]   and really creating a space for them
[02:22:29.360 --> 02:22:33.200]   where they or us don't feel isolated,
[02:22:33.200 --> 02:22:36.440]   that they feel supported,
[02:22:36.440 --> 02:22:40.960]   and that they feel that they can identify their own strengths
[02:22:42.520 --> 02:22:47.520]   and their own capabilities of making themselves better.
[02:22:47.520 --> 02:22:54.400]   Everyone knows or has heard about psychiatrists
[02:22:54.400 --> 02:22:57.880]   and everybody thinks, "Oh, what would your psychiatry say?"
[02:22:57.880 --> 02:23:01.640]   And psychiatrists have these smart things to say to people
[02:23:01.640 --> 02:23:03.320]   that help them with their life,
[02:23:03.320 --> 02:23:05.680]   but the best psychiatrists that I know
[02:23:05.680 --> 02:23:08.000]   actually say very little. [laughing]
[02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:09.920]   They listen.
[02:23:09.920 --> 02:23:13.240]   So I would say that listening to the experience
[02:23:13.240 --> 02:23:16.600]   that people have is key.
[02:23:16.600 --> 02:23:18.000]   - Well, thank you so much for that.
[02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:22.880]   And Dr. Karyon Victor, thank you so, so much
[02:23:22.880 --> 02:23:23.960]   for the work you do.
[02:23:23.960 --> 02:23:25.320]   - Thank you for having me here.
[02:23:25.320 --> 02:23:29.060]   - It's spectacular work at so many levels.
[02:23:29.060 --> 02:23:30.840]   It's also very bold and brave work
[02:23:30.840 --> 02:23:34.720]   to tackle such a big problem with such focus
[02:23:34.720 --> 02:23:37.920]   and to really give people agency,
[02:23:37.920 --> 02:23:41.240]   this notion of a custom toolbox, I think, is profound,
[02:23:41.240 --> 02:23:43.800]   to give kids and adults, as it were,
[02:23:43.800 --> 02:23:47.200]   agency over their own interventions
[02:23:47.200 --> 02:23:49.440]   in an effort to really help themselves.
[02:23:49.440 --> 02:23:52.580]   I appreciate you coming here today.
[02:23:52.580 --> 02:23:54.260]   More than I can express,
[02:23:54.260 --> 02:23:56.180]   I know the listeners and viewers of this podcast
[02:23:56.180 --> 02:23:58.260]   appreciate it as well.
[02:23:58.260 --> 02:24:00.880]   You are involved with Stanford Clinically,
[02:24:00.880 --> 02:24:02.960]   you're involved running studies,
[02:24:02.960 --> 02:24:05.100]   clinical studies that have great importance.
[02:24:05.100 --> 02:24:08.120]   So for you to take time to educate us with these tools
[02:24:08.120 --> 02:24:11.720]   is absolutely spectacular and is really appreciated.
[02:24:11.720 --> 02:24:13.640]   Please keep us updated on your progress
[02:24:13.640 --> 02:24:17.160]   and please come back and tell us more about that progress
[02:24:17.160 --> 02:24:18.400]   when the time is right.
[02:24:18.400 --> 02:24:19.400]   - Thank you so much.
[02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:21.480]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[02:24:21.480 --> 02:24:23.400]   about post-traumatic stress disorder
[02:24:23.400 --> 02:24:25.800]   and its treatments with Dr. Victor Karyon.

[02:25:00.900 --> 02:25:02.040]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:03.260]   I have a new book coming out.
[02:25:03.260 --> 02:25:04.860]   It's my very first book.
[02:25:04.860 --> 02:25:06.260]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[02:25:06.260 --> 02:25:08.420]   An Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[02:25:08.420 --> 02:25:09.580]   This is a book that I've been working on
[02:25:09.580 --> 02:25:10.740]   for more than five years,
[02:25:10.740 --> 02:25:13.060]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[02:25:13.060 --> 02:25:14.620]   of research and experience.
[02:25:14.620 --> 02:25:17.660]   And it covers protocols for everything from sleep,
[02:25:17.660 --> 02:25:20.160]   to exercise, to stress control,
[02:25:20.160 --> 02:25:22.620]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[02:25:22.620 --> 02:25:25.980]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[02:25:25.980 --> 02:25:28.060]   for the protocols that are included.
[02:25:28.060 --> 02:25:31.960]   The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
[02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:34.340]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[02:25:34.340 --> 02:25:36.100]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[02:25:36.100 --> 02:25:37.060]   Again, the book is called
[02:25:37.060 --> 02:25:40.460]   "Protocols, An Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[02:25:40.460 --> 02:25:42.420]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:25:42.420 --> 02:25:45.400]   I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:25:45.400 --> 02:25:47.980]   So that's Instagram, X, formerly known as Twitter,
[02:25:47.980 --> 02:25:49.860]   Threads, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[02:25:49.860 --> 02:25:51.420]   And on all those platforms,
[02:25:51.420 --> 02:25:53.540]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:25:53.540 --> 02:25:55.020]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:25:55.020 --> 02:25:56.500]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:25:56.500 --> 02:25:58.380]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:25:58.380 --> 02:25:59.580]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:25:59.580 --> 02:26:02.640]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[02:26:02.640 --> 02:26:03.800]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:26:03.800 --> 02:26:05.600]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:07.000]   our Neural Network newsletter
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.020]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[02:26:09.020 --> 02:26:10.560]   that includes podcast summaries,
[02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:12.760]   as well as protocols in the form of brief
[02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:14.520]   one-to-three-page PDFs.
[02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:16.800]   Those protocol PDFs are on things
[02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:18.680]   like neuroplasticity and learning,
[02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:21.240]   optimizing dopamine, improving your sleep,
[02:26:21.240 --> 02:26:23.440]   deliberate cold exposure, deliberate heat exposure.
[02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:25.520]   We have a foundational fitness protocol
[02:26:25.520 --> 02:26:27.680]   that describes a template routine
[02:26:27.680 --> 02:26:29.180]   that includes cardiovascular training
[02:26:29.180 --> 02:26:31.140]   and resistance training with sets and reps,
[02:26:31.140 --> 02:26:32.580]   all backed by science,
[02:26:32.580 --> 02:26:34.980]   and all of which, again, is completely zero cost.
[02:26:34.980 --> 02:26:37.580]   To subscribe, simply go to hubermanlab.com,
[02:26:37.580 --> 02:26:40.200]   go to the menu tab up in the upper right corner,
[02:26:40.200 --> 02:26:42.300]   scroll down a newsletter, and provide your email.
[02:26:42.300 --> 02:26:43.980]   And I should emphasize that we do not share
[02:26:43.980 --> 02:26:45.540]   your email with anybody.
[02:26:45.540 --> 02:26:46.900]   Thank you once again for joining me
[02:26:46.900 --> 02:26:49.460]   for today's discussion with Dr. Victor Karyan.
[02:26:49.460 --> 02:26:51.860]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:26:51.860 --> 02:26:53.940]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:26:53.940 --> 02:26:56.520]   [upbeat music]
[02:26:56.520 --> 02:26:59.100]   (upbeat music)
