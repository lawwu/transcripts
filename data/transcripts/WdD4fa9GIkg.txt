[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500]   [Silence]
[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.980]   Most all of the studies, yes, most all of the studies
[00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.380]   that have explored the relationship between exercise,
[00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.260]   brain health and longevity and performance,
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.460]   find positive effects.
[00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.540]   Now, for some of you who are skeptics,
[00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.940]   you might be thinking, well, great,
[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.860]   so you can do any form of exercise.
[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.660]   Well, in some sense, yes,
[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.060]   I'll actually tell you this right off the bat.
[00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.740]   There are good data showing
[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.260]   that if people do six second sprints,
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.340]   max all out sprints on a stationary bicycle
[00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.340]   followed by one minute rest and repeat that six times,
[00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.860]   you see significant acute effects on brain performance.
[00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.380]   So the brain performance could be a memory task.
[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.820]   Sometimes it is a memory task.
[00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.220]   It could be what's called a Stroop task,
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.740]   which is a cognitive flexibility task
[00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.300]   where you have to distinguish between the colors
[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.700]   that words are written in and the content of the words.
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.860]   Okay, so-called Stroop task.
[00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.220]   I've talked about this on previous podcasts.
[00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.620]   I'll talk about it a little bit more later.
[00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.700]   Regardless of the cognitive test that's used,
[00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.580]   that very short duration, high intensity training
[00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.620]   increases performance significantly.
[00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.020]   As well, 20 or 30 minutes of so-called steady state cardio,
[00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.380]   you know, figuring out how fast you can run or row or swim
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.060]   or stationary bike for 20 to 30 minutes at a steady state.
[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.120]   And then you analyze people's cognitive performance
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.960]   on a memory task.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.060]   It can be a working memory task,
[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.100]   so remembering a short string of numbers,
[00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.260]   or it could be math problems.
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.180]   It could be the Stroop task.
[00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.940]   Any number of different tasks reveal the same thing,
[00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.660]   which is that the longer duration, lower intensity cardio
[00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.700]   also significantly improves performance.
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.460]   Now, does that mean that you can do six rounds
[00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.820]   of six seconds of sprinting with a minute in between
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.620]   or 20 minutes of cardiovascular exercise
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.100]   and get the same effect on brain performance?
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.780]   Well, if you're just looking at overall improvements
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.220]   in performance, so for instance,
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.580]   the percentage of information that you learn
[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.180]   if you do or you don't do the exercise,
[00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.140]   or if you compare those two forms of exercise
[00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.460]   that I just mentioned, in that sense, yes,
[00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.200]   it really doesn't make a difference,
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.560]   which may have you scratching your head.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.220]   But in a few moments, I'll explain why that is.
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.300]   On the other hand, different forms of exercise, of course,
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.940]   impact our bodily health differently.
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.580]   Higher intensity, shorter duration exercise, of course,
[00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.940]   impacts things like VO2 max and which circulating hormones
[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.340]   and neuromodulators are going to be present very differently
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.000]   than longer duration, lower intensity exercise.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.540]   So too, if you have people do single joint isolation
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.980]   resistance training exercises,
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.340]   like a single leg leg extension
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.460]   or both legs leg extension,
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.020]   versus 10 sets of 10 in a squat exercise,
[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.620]   you're going to see very different specific adaptations
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.420]   at the physical level, at the bodily level.
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.100]   But in every case where you explore the acute,
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.300]   the immediate changes that occur in brain output
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.920]   and function, after people do that sort of exercise,
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.000]   you're going to see significant increases.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.980]   When one does physical exercise,
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.380]   short duration, high intensity, cardio,
[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.760]   or higher intensity resistance training,
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.180]   single joint training, compound training,
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.980]   single joint isolation exercises, compound exercises,
[00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.900]   one sees these increases in brain performance,
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.100]   at least acutely in the immediate stage after the training.
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.580]   So we have to ask ourselves, why is it?
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.980]   How is it that all these different forms of exercise
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.640]   are positively impacting brain performance?
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.720]   And the answer is very simple.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.920]   And fortunately, gives us tremendous leverage
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.400]   over our exercise and how to impact our brain health.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.520]   And the answer is arousal.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.640]   However, the answer isn't entirely arousal,
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.280]   meaning not all of the positive effects of exercise
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.400]   on brain health, longevity, and performance
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.160]   can be explained by arousal.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.640]   But when I step back from the literature,
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.240]   again, an enormous literature,
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.100]   tens of thousands of peer-reviewed papers,
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.420]   many of which are done exceptionally well, by the way,
[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.200]   as well as meta-analyses and reviews,
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.280]   I think it's fair to say that probably 60 to 70%
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.040]   of the effects of exercise on brain health,
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.800]   performance, and longevity
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.420]   can be explained by the specific shifts in our physiology,
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.360]   both bodily physiology
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.480]   and directly within the brain's physiology
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.400]   during those bouts of exercise,
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.600]   which is this increase in so-called autonomic arousal,
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.720]   which occurs during the exercise,
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.160]   but also extends into a window
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.320]   after the exercise is completed.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.140]   So we have to talk about this relationship
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.620]   between exercise, arousal, and acute brain performance,
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.120]   meaning the improvements in brain performance
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.720]   that happen immediately after the exercise.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.360]   And then we'll shift our focus to the effects of exercise
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.960]   that occur more chronically.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.320]   That is the effects of exercise on brain health
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.560]   and performance that occur in the hours, days, weeks,
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.520]   and years after we exercise,
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.400]   even if we are continuing to exercise every day
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.080]   or three times a week or whatever the frequency might be.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.640]   But this issue of arousal is extremely important,
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.120]   and I assure you, it's not trivial.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.900]   In fact, it will help you understand a number of things
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.760]   in the domains of deliberate cold exposure, stress, trauma,
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.520]   and most importantly for today's discussion,
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.120]   it will help you design an exercise program
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.600]   that's geared towards giving you
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.120]   the maximum bodily health effects
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.960]   and the maximum brain health effects.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.160]   There are a couple of different ways
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.560]   you can increase so-called autonomic arousal
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.520]   or levels of alertness.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.660]   Sometimes it's called stress,
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.360]   but autonomic arousal is simply an increase
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.680]   in the amount of activity in the so-called sympathetic arm
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.980]   or the autonomic nervous system, which is nerd speak for,
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.200]   more alert, more aroused, wide-eyed, ready to move,
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.880]   higher heart rate, higher blood pressure, more alertness.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.600]   Increasing autonomic arousal improves learning and memory.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.120]   Now, it's also very important to understand
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.320]   that that increase in autonomic arousal
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.040]   can improve learning and memory
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.140]   if the autonomic arousal occurs
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.020]   after the exposure to the material.
[00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.520]   Most people find that a bit surprising.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.440]   I certainly did when I first read this paper.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.680]   It makes sense if you start to think
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.040]   about the persistence of memories
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.640]   for things like traumas or bad events, right?
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.520]   Bad event happens and there's this big spike
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.280]   in cortisol and adrenaline,
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.040]   and those memories are hard to eradicate.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.960]   They're certainly hard to remove the emotional content from.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.440]   And if you think about it, in those instances,
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.920]   the event happens and then comes the big increase
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.240]   in cortisol and adrenaline.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.060]   So that maps very well onto the study
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.720]   that I'm describing here.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.800]   In addition, however, lots of studies have shown
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.760]   that increasing autonomic arousal,
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.720]   as measured by increases in adrenaline or cortisol or both,
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.820]   or any number of different measures of autonomic arousal,
[00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.880]   that occurs during the exposure to the new material.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.960]   Okay, so this isn't trauma.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.440]   This is like new math material, new history material,
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.600]   new music material, new motor skill material
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.480]   that you're trying to learn.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.580]   Increases in autonomic arousal that occur
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.040]   as you're trying to so-called encode the information,
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.980]   you're being exposed to that new information,
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.940]   also significantly improve learning.
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.260]   And it's always through increases in arousal.
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.820]   In other words,
[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.020]   whether or not you're measuring cortisol, adrenaline,
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.820]   heart rate, blood pressure, galvanic skin response,
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.780]   how wide someone's pupils are,
[00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.820]   or small someone's pupils are,
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.660]   or any combination of those things,
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.740]   or any other measures of autonomic arousal,
[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.300]   the consistent takeaway is increases in arousal
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.520]   during or after, in particular after,
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.060]   trying to learn a certain material
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.200]   is going to improve significantly
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.320]   the amount of material that one learns,
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.320]   the details of that material,
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.280]   and the persistence of that learning over time.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.560]   Okay, so now we've established
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.080]   the elevated levels of autonomic arousal
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.480]   either during or after,
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.660]   and indeed also before about of learning,
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.400]   the so-called encoding phase of learning
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.020]   when we're exposed to the new material
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.800]   that we want to learn and remember are all beneficial.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.160]   This is wonderful news.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.640]   When we look out on the whole of the literature
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.760]   on the relationship between exercise
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.400]   and brain health and performance,
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.400]   we see studies that incorporate exercise
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.560]   either before or after about of learning.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.860]   And we also find studies, believe it or not,
[00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.940]   that combine exercise with learning in real time,
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.140]   literally exposing people to new material
[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.760]   that they're expected to learn or trying to learn
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.240]   while they're walking on a treadmill
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.600]   or running on a treadmill or cycling or rowing.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.320]   Yes, those studies have also been done,
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.200]   although for practical reasons,
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.520]   they're not as numerous as the studies
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.360]   exploring the relationship between exercise and learning
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.120]   where the exercise is done before
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.040]   or after the bout of learning.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.000]   Okay, so what this means is wonderful.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.820]   What this means is that if you want to use exercise,
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.040]   not just for enhancing your bodily health,
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.120]   but also for brain health and performance,
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.880]   you can do that exercise before, during,
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.160]   or after bouts of learning.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.400]   That allows you to look at the constraints of your life.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.280]   For instance, are you one of these people
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.800]   that can get up at five or six or 7 a.m.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.020]   and exercise before everyone else gets up
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.840]   or before your workday starts or your school day starts,
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.120]   do a round of exercise
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.000]   and then get into your bouts of learning,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.720]   whatever that material may be?
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.720]   Or are you somebody who has to dive into the workday,
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.080]   school day, family obligations, et cetera,
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.480]   in which case you might only be able
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.340]   to exercise later in the day,
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.500]   but you're probably still somebody
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.100]   who would like to enhance their brain health and performance.
[00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.760]   So in that case, you might organize
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.960]   the thing that you're trying to learn,
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.440]   the encoding or the exposure
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.760]   to the thing that you're trying to learn,
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.400]   either in written forms,
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.000]   you're reading or you're listening to it,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.240]   or you're attending a class or classes,
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.680]   and then exercising after you're exposed to that material
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.840]   in order to get that elevated levels of arousal,
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.800]   not unlike the arrangement of the studies
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.480]   that I was talking about earlier,
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.420]   which use the ice exposure
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.700]   in order to generate increases in arousal
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.600]   and thereby to improve learning and memory.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.000]   So in the show note captions for this episode,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.080]   we've batched a number of different references
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.300]   that have explored the relationship
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.480]   between exercise and cognitive performance.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.120]   And across those studies
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.320]   and the ones that are referenced therein,
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.600]   you'll find studies where the exercise bout was done before,
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.960]   or the exercise bout was done during,
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.320]   or the exercise bout was done after a round of learning
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.360]   or encoding of information.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.760]   And I should mention that different studies
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.200]   focus on different cognitive tasks.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.200]   So exercise and the arousal associated with exercise
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.760]   has been shown to acutely improve recall.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:11.040]   So just raw recall of material, the details in material,
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.560]   it's been shown to improve cognitive flexibility
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.960]   through things like the Stroop task.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.980]   And so in a very convenient way,
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.360]   exercise has been shown to acutely improve performance
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.140]   on all those sorts of brain and memory tasks,
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.400]   which is greatly reassuring to all of us
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.640]   because what it means is that
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:29.880]   it probably doesn't matter so much
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.200]   when you do your exercise
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.920]   or what it is that you're trying to learn.
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.260]   It's going to be beneficial
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.420]   as long as the thing that you're trying to learn
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.800]   and the exercise are positioned fairly closely in time.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.320]   Now, all of this is focused, of course,
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.480]   on the relationship between exercise and brain function
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.380]   at the acute level, the immediate level.
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.760]   It's fair to say that all high intensity exercise
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.840]   and resistance training is going to support brain function
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.960]   in the chronic sense, in the long-term sense.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.720]   In fact, the literature points to that.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.720]   And once again, I've batched the references
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.760]   for this episode so that they're grouped together
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.360]   according to the specific topics and timestamps.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.280]   And the two studies that I recommend you look at
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.860]   if you're interested in this relationship
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.640]   between high intensity training and cognitive function,
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.960]   in particular, executive function,
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.280]   that cognitive flexibility I was talking about earlier,
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.000]   such as in the Stroop task.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.680]   There's a wonderful article entitled
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.640]   "Executive Function After Exhaustive Exercise."
