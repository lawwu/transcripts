[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   Welcome to a new week on the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime author and pastor John Piper.
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.320]   And thank you for listening to the podcast. We appreciate it.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.320]   We begin the week with a short question, but a very good one from a listener named Bryce. He asks, "Pastor John,
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.520]   hello. Can you tell me why did God wait so long in human history,
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.320]   centuries, even millennia, before he finally sent Jesus to earth? Why the long wait for the incarnation?"
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.840]   I don't think that in this life we will have a complete answer to that question.
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.520]   I am going to suggest some pointers, but in the end, I know that even the pointers I'm going to
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.240]   suggest do not completely or
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.760]   satisfyingly answer the question, but they might be helpful.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.480]   They've been helpful to me over the years to think about. In general,
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.360]   the answer is going to be something like,
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:00.680]   given the way God chose to prepare for Christ in the world and to make the gospel
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.200]   clear in the world and
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:10.320]   prepare for the mission of the church to the nations in the light of his design for how to do that,
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.960]   this kind of history for thousands of years leading up to Christ was
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.920]   necessary, was fitting. This length and this kind of history
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.040]   leading up to Christ so that Christ becomes clear and so the gospel can be clear.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.840]   This was the most suitable, the most appropriate, the most effective
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.120]   way to get the world ready for Messiah, for gospel, for mission.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.800]   That's why I think the general answer is God has designed the world and
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.120]   cultures and
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.320]   the nature of humanity so that certain conditions,
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.240]   certain states of affairs,
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.080]   come about in the world gradually. We can always second-guess
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.120]   why God would ordain it to be that way,
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.440]   but he has told us that some things take
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.200]   time,
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.080]   meaning taking all of reality into account, God thought it wise that things would develop the way they do.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.120]   Here's some examples. God tells Abraham in Genesis 15 that there will be four
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.920]   long generations that will elapse
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.040]   before Israelites come back to the Promised Land and take it over.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.120]   God intends for there to be roughly 400 years, and here's the reason he gives.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.000]   "They shall come back here in the fourth generation,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.600]   for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete." Very strange. In other words,
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.960]   God regards it as
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.400]   fitting that there be a certain
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.040]   completeness of
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.080]   corruption and iniquity and depravity in the inhabitants of Canaan,
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.080]   so that when the judgment comes
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.480]   through Israel from God, it will be fitting and
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.680]   proper when Joshua wreaks havoc among the Canaanite generations later.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.640]   So we have roughly 400 year block of time that
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.960]   God deems
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.840]   appropriate, fitting
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.880]   for the completion of the fullness of a state of affairs that needs to be in place for another
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.000]   suitable thing to happen.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.280]   This is an artist, you might say, painting a canvas and saying the reason this color is here is because later
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.920]   I'm gonna add this color and those two colors together make this
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.680]   beautiful whole. So that's the kind of thing that I think is at work in
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.720]   creating the durations that we have in the Old Testament. Here's another
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.600]   example.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:04:00.600]   When God says to Isaiah in Isaiah 6 10 that he's going to preach in such a way that the people are hardened,
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.400]   Isaiah cries out, "How long, O Lord, how long?"
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.080]   To which God answers,
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.080]   "Until cities lie waste without inhabitants and
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.760]   houses without people and the land is desolate waste and the Lord removes the people far away
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:26.120]   and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land." Now that's a lot of events and a lot of time
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.280]   that God says must elapse before his purposes of this kind of preaching are
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:39.640]   finished. And we can think of numbers like 70 years of captivity for the Jews in in Babylon. Why 70?
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.440]   Why not 7 or 700?
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.720]   And God has his reasons based on on the nature of what he's trying to show
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.600]   about his grace, his mercy,
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.840]   the law,
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.400]   disobedience, wrath, judgment, holiness.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:03.800]   Here's one last text and the most important at least as far as I can see in answering this question.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.320]   The thread of Old Testament history runs from creation through fall
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:17.320]   into sin, through election of Israel, through Exodus, through giving of the law, and then a thousand years give or take of
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.640]   the inability of Israel to keep the law. A
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:29.400]   thousand years of covenant breaking over and over again. It is a bleak, bleak history as you read it.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:36.080]   Disobedience followed by punishment, followed by repentance, followed by mercy, followed by disobedience, followed by
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:43.640]   repentance, followed by mercy, followed by more judgment, and on and on it goes. It's just awful to watch the history go.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.200]   Now in Romans
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.920]   chapter 3
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.840]   verses 9 to 18, Paul quotes half a dozen passages from the Old Testament,
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:58.600]   mainly from the Psalms, but he calls them the law. And the point of those passages is to show that everybody's
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.080]   under judgment, everybody, Jew and Gentile, are sinners.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.120]   And then Paul says one of the most important sentences in the Bible
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:13.260]   regarding what God has been up to for these 2,000 years of Jewish history. Verse 19,
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:18.420]   "Now we know that whatever the law says," and he's referring back to those
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:24.720]   statements about the failure of Israel and all people, "what the law says,
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.760]   it speaks to those who are under the law," that's Israel,
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:35.520]   "so that every mouth may be stopped and the whole world may become accountable to God. For
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.600]   by works of the law no human being
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.360]   will be justified in his sight," etc.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.200]   So Paul uses the word law here in its wide reference to the Old Testament,
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:56.760]   and he says that the point of the Old Testament record is that it is addressed first to Jews,
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:03.920]   those who are under the law, so that every mouth, every Jewish mouth, would be stopped. In other words,
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:10.720]   the record of God and what he's required of men and the failure to do it is
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.480]   intended to shut the mouth of every Israelite so they can never
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:23.080]   protest that they've succeeded in obeying in such a way as to be right with God, that they are in desperate need of
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.160]   grace,
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.040]   so they can't have it any other way than by
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.640]   someone else, some
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:39.120]   Savior, some Redeemer, because verse 20 says they'll never have it on the basis of their own good works.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.760]   And then he adds this crucial statement,
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:51.480]   "The reason every Jewish mouth is stopped by the Old Testament record of law and failure to keep law
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.920]   is
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.880]   so that the whole world might be held accountable to God."
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:07.320]   That's really worth thinking about. In other words, the history of the Jewish people and the record of its
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:12.640]   failure to keep the covenant that God made, that
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:20.720]   record not only shows that that Jews will never be able to save themselves, but the whole world is
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:26.360]   held accountable because it too has failed in all of its ways of trying,
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.640]   because if the Jews can't do it with as much special revelation and
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:36.960]   privileges as they've had, how much less will the world be able to work its way into God's favor?
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:45.040]   And then he gives this verse 24, "No human being will be justified in the sight of God."
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:50.600]   Now that, it seems to me, is as close as we get in
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:57.640]   the Bible to an explanation of why such a long and
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.880]   contorted,
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.880]   disappointing, frustrating
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:08.360]   history. God ordained that the history of Israel would develop in such a way that,
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.360]   and as long as it did,
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:20.240]   that Israel would be a lesson book for the nations about the gospel. A lesson book for the nations
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.880]   no one can be justified by
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:29.120]   law-keeping, and evidently God believes that the
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:34.320]   lengthy story of failures under every condition of advantage
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:39.400]   makes the point in the best possible way.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:44.880]   Amen. "When the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son."
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.360]   Thank you, Pastor John, for picking up on those biblical timelines.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.720]   That's very helpful in perspective. Well, for more details about this podcast, or to catch up on past episodes
