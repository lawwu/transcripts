[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.460]   Is your California dream feeling more and more distant?
[00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.260]   You've got countless apps and influencers
[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.380]   telling you how to do it their way.
[00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.660]   And your expert aunt who might be giving
[00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.540]   a bit too much advice.
[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.580]   Tips, hacks, and experts are everywhere these days.
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.380]   But when it comes to real estate,
[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.180]   the question to ask is, who's your realtor?
[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.200]   Because a California realtor is the only person
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.580]   who can bring your dream home.
[00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.540]   Someone who gets that buying a home
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.080]   is one of the most complicated
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.060]   and stressful things you can do,
[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.780]   but can still make it possible on your budget.
[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.820]   A California realtor can read the constantly shifting market
[00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.460]   and they're out in front for all of the tough stuff.
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.140]   So you can get to the good stuff.
[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.780]   So who's your realtor?
[00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.300]   Because no one cares more about helping Californians
[00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.140]   live the California dream than California realtors.
[00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.660]   - The analysis and arguments you're about to hear
[00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.140]   were published in 1997.
[00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.380]   You can judge for yourself the prescience
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.580]   or the myopia of these arguments.
[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.620]   The life and death of the nation state.
[00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.660]   Democracy and nationalism as resource strategies
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.060]   in the age of violence.
[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.460]   Quote, "Most important of all,
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.380]   "success in war depends on having enough money
[00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.540]   "to provide whatever the enterprise needs."
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.580]   Robert de Balzac, 1502.
[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.360]   The rubble of history.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.280]   On November 9 and 10, 1989,
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.180]   television broadcast to the world
[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.500]   scenes of exuberant East Berliners
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.100]   dismantling the Berlin Wall with sledgehammers.
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.020]   Fledgling entrepreneurs among the crowd
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.380]   picked up pieces of the wall
[00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.060]   that were later marketed to capitalists
[00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.740]   far and wide as souvenir paperweights.
[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.380]   A brisk business in these relics
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.280]   was done for years thereafter.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.500]   Even as we write,
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.260]   one can still encounter occasional ads in small magazines
[00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.380]   offering bits of old East German concrete for sale
[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.540]   at prices ordinarily commanded by high grade silver ore.
[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.460]   We believe that those who bought
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.140]   the Berlin Wall paperweights
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.980]   should be in no rush to sell.
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.980]   They hold mementos of something bigger
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.140]   than the collapse of communism.
[00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.700]   We believe that the Berlin Wall
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.300]   became the most important pile of historical rubble
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.480]   since the walls of San Giovanni
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.260]   were blasted to smithereens almost five centuries earlier
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.860]   in February, 1495.
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.660]   The leveling of San Giovanni
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.940]   by the French King Charles VIII
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.120]   was the first blast of the gunpowder revolution.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.300]   It marked the end of the feudal phase of history
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.220]   and the advent of industrialism as we outlined earlier.
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.580]   The destruction of the Berlin Wall
[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.740]   marks another historical watershed,
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.460]   the passage between the industrial age
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.340]   and the new information age.
[00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.820]   Never has there been so great a symbolic triumph
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.340]   of efficiency over power.
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.500]   When the walls of San Giovanni fell,
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.980]   it was a stark demonstration
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.420]   that the economic returns to violence in the world
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.300]   had risen sharply.
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.160]   The fall of the Berlin Wall says something different,
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.300]   namely that returns to violence are now falling.
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.820]   This is something that few have even begun to recognize,
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.860]   but it will have dramatic consequences.
[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.100]   For reasons we explore in this chapter,
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.360]   the Berlin Wall may prove to be far more symbolic
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.420]   of the whole era of the industrial nation state
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.980]   than those in the crowd that night in Berlin
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.380]   or the millions watching from a distance understood.
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.460]   The Berlin Wall was built to a very different purpose
[00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.660]   than the walls of San Giovanni,
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.860]   to prevent people on the inside from escaping
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.740]   rather than to prevent predators on the outside
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.340]   from entering.
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.460]   That fact alone is a telling indicator
[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.560]   of the rise in the power of the state
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.140]   from the 15th to the 20th centuries
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.000]   and in more ways than one.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.780]   For centuries, the nation state
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.780]   made all outward facing walls redundant and unnecessary.
[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.780]   The level of monopoly that the state exercised
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.540]   over coercion in those areas where it first took hold
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.060]   made them both more peaceful internally
[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.740]   and more formidable militarily
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.220]   than any sovereignties the world had seen before.
[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.340]   The state used the resources extracted
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.300]   from a largely disarmed population
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.120]   to crush small scale predators.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.680]   The nation state became history's most successful instrument
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.960]   for seizing resources.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.440]   Its success was based upon its superior ability
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.280]   to extract the wealth of its citizens.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.680]   Quote, MTV is more than a purveyor of music videos
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.280]   and a promotional tool of the recording industry.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.920]   It's the first truly global network,
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.920]   the first network to deliver a single stream of programming
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.160]   in virtually every country in the world.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.840]   In the process, MTV is creating a single sense
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.520]   of shared global reality for its viewers,
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.400]   children and young adults.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.400]   Recent research has found that young people
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.040]   around the planet more and more share
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.240]   not just common pop icons and common tastes,
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.120]   but common expectations for their careers,
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.660]   common sets of values about what is meaningful in life
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.520]   and what there is to be afraid of,
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.240]   a common sense that politics is less important
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.800]   than their own abilities in shaping their futures.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.960]   Jim Taylor and Watts Wacker,
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.420]   the 500 year Delta, what happens after what comes next?
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.800]   Love it or leave it, unless you're rich.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.560]   Before the transition from the nation state
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.680]   to the new sovereignties of the information age is complete,
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.120]   many residents of the largest
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.520]   and most powerful Western nation states,
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.680]   like their counterparts in East Berlin in 1989,
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.940]   will be plotting to find their way out.
[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.980]   For the generations that came of age before World War II,
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.160]   or early in the Cold War,
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.320]   moving across borders is traumatic.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.280]   But for new generations who draw their bearings
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.600]   from a more global perspective,
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.180]   abandoning the country of their birth
[00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.240]   is not the unthinkable decision it would be
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.920]   for older persons who are more deeply inculcated
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.760]   with the ideology of the nation state.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.760]   Jim Taylor and Watts Wacker report the intriguing results
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.980]   of a mass survey of 25,000 middle class high school students
[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.040]   on five continents.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.400]   In a sampling conducted during the 1995-96 school year
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.800]   by Brainwaves Group, a New York consumer research firm,
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.240]   nine of 10 students agreed that, quote,
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.000]   "It's up to me to get what I want of life."
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.640]   More strikingly, quote, "Almost half the teens said
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.600]   they expected to leave the country of their birth
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.680]   in pursuit of their goals."
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.240]   Perhaps because he is tuned in
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.840]   to the attitudes of the MTV generation,
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.240]   as the first presidential candidate to campaign on MTV,
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.680]   Bill Clinton has sought to make it more difficult
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.160]   for Americans to, quote, "Leave the country of their birth
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.560]   in pursuit of their goals."
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.640]   In 1995, at about the same time
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.160]   that the high school students were declaring
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.440]   their intentions to seek independence,
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.800]   the president of the United States proposed the enactment
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.800]   of an exit tax, a Berlin Wall for capital
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.760]   that would require wealthy Americans
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.020]   to pay a substantial ransom to escape
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.760]   with even part of their money.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.880]   Clinton's ransom is not only reminiscent
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.160]   of the late East German state's policy
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.760]   of treating its citizens as assets.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.520]   It also calls to mind the increasingly draconian measures
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.920]   taken to shore up the fiscal position
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.040]   of the Roman Empire in decline.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.840]   This passage from the Cambridge Ancient History
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.800]   tells the story, quote, "Thus began the fierce endeavor
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.000]   of the state to squeeze the population to the last drop.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.080]   Since economic resources fell short of what was needed,
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.800]   the strong fought to secure the chief share for themselves
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.000]   with a violence and unscrupulousness,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.820]   well in keeping with the origin of those in power
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:17.080]   and with a soldiery accustomed to plunder.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.480]   The full rigor of the law was let loose on the population.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.560]   Soldiers acted as bailiffs
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.440]   or wandered as secret police through the land.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.860]   Those who suffered most were, of course,
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.560]   the propertied class.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.720]   It was relatively easy to lay hands on their property.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.760]   And in an emergency, they were the class
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.880]   from whom something could be extorted
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.120]   most frequently and quickly."
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.660]   When failing systems have the power to do so,
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:47.800]   they often impose penal burdens upon those seeking to escape.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.580]   Again, we quote the Cambridge Ancient History, quote,
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.040]   "If the property class buried their money
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.600]   or sacrificed two thirds of their estate
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.680]   to escape from a magistracy,
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.960]   or went so far as to give up their whole property
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.000]   in order to get free of the domain's rent
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.400]   and the non-property class ran away,
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.720]   the state replied by increasing the pressure."
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.520]   This is worth remembering as you plan ahead.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.400]   The twilight of state systems in the past
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.520]   has seldom been a polite, orderly process.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.000]   We mentioned the nasty habits
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.800]   of Roman tax collectors in chapter two.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.520]   The large numbers of agri deserti,
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.000]   or abandoned farms in Western Europe
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.960]   after the collapse of the Roman Empire
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.360]   reflected only a small part of a wider problem.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.280]   In fact, exactions tended to be relatively mild in Gaul
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.720]   and in the frontier areas
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.320]   that comprise current day Luxembourg and Germany.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.760]   In Rome's most fertile region, Egypt,
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.840]   where farming was more productive because of irrigation,
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.400]   desertion by owners was an even bigger problem.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.600]   The question of whether to attempt escape,
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.160]   the ultimum refugium, as it was known in Latin,
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.200]   became the overriding quandary
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.520]   of almost everyone with property.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.680]   Records show that, quote, "Among the common questions
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.720]   which used to be put to an oracle in Egypt,
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.360]   three standard types were, am I to become a beggar?
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.840]   Shall I take to flight?
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.240]   And is my flight to be stopped?"
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.680]   Clinton's proposal says yes.
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.840]   It is an early version of an obstacle to escape
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.440]   that is likely to grow more onerous
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.800]   as the fiscal resources of the nation state slip away.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.280]   Of course, the first US version of an exit barrier
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.120]   is more benign than Erich Honecker's concrete
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.760]   and barbed wire.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.520]   It also involves greater price sensitivity
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.600]   with the burden falling only on,
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.440]   quote, unquote, "Billionaires"
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.880]   with taxable estates over $600,000.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.880]   Nonetheless, it was justified with similar arguments
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.320]   to those once propounded by Honecker
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.600]   in defense of the late German Democratic Republic's
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.880]   most famous public works project.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.000]   Honecker claimed that the East German state
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.400]   had a substantial investment in would-be refugees.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.560]   He pointed out that allowing them to leave freely
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.200]   would create an economic disadvantage for the state,
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.360]   which required their efforts in East Germany.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.720]   If you accept the premise that people are
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.120]   or ought to be assets of the state,
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.800]   Honecker's wall made sense.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.960]   Berlin without a wall was a loophole to the communists,
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.480]   just as escape from US tax jurisdiction
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.280]   was a loophole to Clinton's IRS.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.520]   Clinton's arguments about escaping billionaires,
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.760]   aside from showing a politician's usual disregard
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.640]   for the integrity of numbers,
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.280]   were similar in kind to Honecker's,
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.280]   but somewhat less logical
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.120]   because the US government, in fact,
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.280]   does not have a large economic investment
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.040]   in wealthy citizens who might seek to leave.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.160]   It is not a question of their having been educated
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.520]   at state expense and wanting to slip away
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.680]   and practice law somewhere else.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.280]   The overwhelming majority of those
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.480]   to whom the exit tax would apply
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.040]   have created their wealth by their own efforts
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:08.720]   and in spite of, not because of the US government.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.600]   With the top 1% of taxpayers paying 30.2%
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.520]   of the total income tax in the United States for 1995,
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.280]   it is not a question of the rich failing to repay
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.240]   any genuine investment the state may have made
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.840]   in their education or economic prosperity.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.640]   To the contrary, those who pay most of the bills
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.000]   pay vastly more than the value
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.240]   of any benefits they receive.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.720]   With an average annual tax payment exceeding $125,000,
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.840]   taxes cost the top 1% of American taxpayers
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.560]   far more than they now realize.
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.360]   Assuming they could earn even a 10% return
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.520]   on the excess tax paid by each over a 40-year period,
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.600]   each $5,000 of annual excess tax payment
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.840]   reduced their net worth by $2.2 million.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.120]   At a 20% rate of return,
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:03.120]   each $5,000 of excess tax reduces net worth by $44 million.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.360]   As the millennium approaches,
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.200]   the new mega political conditions of the information age
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.920]   will make it increasingly obvious
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.360]   that the nation state inherited from the industrial era
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.280]   is a predatory institution.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.520]   With each year that passes,
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.120]   it will seem less a boon to prosperity
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.180]   and more an obstacle,
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.760]   one from which the individual will want an escape.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.260]   It is an escape that desperate governments
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.580]   will be loath to allow.
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.820]   The stability and even the survival
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:37.280]   of Western welfare states depends upon their ability
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.680]   to continue extracting a huge fraction
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.980]   of the world's total output for redistribution
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:46.980]   to a subset of voters in the OECD countries.
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.220]   This requires that the taxes imposed
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.620]   upon the most productive citizens
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.300]   of the currently rich countries
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.140]   be priced at super monopoly rates,
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:58.140]   hundreds or even thousands of times higher
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.100]   than the actual cost of the services
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.900]   that governments provide in return.
[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:06.220]   The life and death of the nation state.
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.900]   The fall of the Berlin Wall
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.500]   was more than just a visible symbol
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.300]   of the death of communism.
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.180]   It was a defeat for the entire world system
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:20.180]   of nation states and a triumph of efficiency and markets.
[00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:24.260]   The fulcrum of power underlying history has shifted.
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.980]   We believe that the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.860]   culminates the era of the nation state,
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.020]   a peculiar 200 year phase in history
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.720]   that began with the French Revolution.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.340]   States have existed for 6,000 years,
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.280]   but before the 19th century,
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.420]   they accounted for only a small fraction
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.760]   of the world's sovereignties.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:51.760]   Their ascendancy began and ended in revolution.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.660]   The great events of 1789 launched Europe
[00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.020]   on a course toward truly national governments.
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:02.700]   The great events of 1989 marked the death of communism
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.420]   and an assertion of control by market forces
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.020]   over massed power.
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.540]   Those two revolutions, exactly 200 years apart,
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.020]   define the era in which the nation state
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.580]   predominated in the great power system.
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.900]   The great powers in turn dominated the world,
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.700]   spreading or imposing state systems
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.660]   on even the most remote tribal enclave.
[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.460]   The triumph of the state as the principal vehicle
[00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.620]   for organizing violence in the world
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.440]   was not a matter of ideology.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:38.900]   It was necessitated by the hidden logic of violence.
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:43.460]   It was, as we like to say, a mega political event
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.300]   determined not so much by the wishes of theorists
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:51.460]   and statesmen, or even by the maneuvering of generals,
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:55.700]   as by the hidden leverage of violence,
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.260]   which moved history in the way that Archimedes
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.620]   once dreamt of moving the world.
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:05.140]   States have been the norm for the past 200 years
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.940]   of the modern period.
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:11.140]   But in the longer sweep of history, states have been rare.
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.620]   They have always depended upon extraordinary
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:17.060]   mega political conditions for their viability.
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.980]   Prior to the modern period,
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:22.980]   most states were oriental despotisms.
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.380]   Agricultural societies in deserts
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.660]   depended upon control of irrigation systems
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.420]   for their survival.
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.820]   Even the Roman Empire, through its control of Egypt
[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:37.820]   and North Africa, was indirectly a hydraulic society,
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.100]   but not enough of one to survive.
[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.840]   Rome, like most pre-modern states,
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.540]   ultimately lacked the capacity to compel adherence
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:46.940]   to the monopoly of violence
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.980]   that the ability to starve people provides.
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:52.020]   The Roman state outside of Africa
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.540]   could not cut off water for growing crops
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.460]   by denying unsubmissive people
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.960]   access to the irrigation system.
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.900]   Such hydraulic systems supplied more leverage to violence
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.380]   than any other mega political configuration
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.300]   in the ancient economy.
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.580]   Whoever controlled the water in these societies
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:14.380]   could extract spoils at a level almost comparable
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.160]   to the percentage of total output absorbed
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.260]   by modern nation states.
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.860]   Magnitude over efficiency.
[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:27.560]   Gunpowder enabled states to expand more easily
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.960]   outside the confines of rice paddies
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.480]   and arid river valleys.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.340]   The nature of gunpowder weapons
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.780]   and the character of the industrial economy
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.360]   created great advantages of scale in warfare.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:44.900]   This led to high and rising returns to violence.
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.340]   As historian Charles Tilley put it,
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.780]   "States having the largest coercive means
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:51.500]   "tended to win wars.
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:55.080]   "Efficiency," the ratio of output to input,
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.720]   "came second to effectiveness," total output.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:03.180]   With governments mostly organized on a large scale,
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.620]   even the few small sovereignties that survived,
[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.920]   like Monaco or Andorra,
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.260]   needed the recognition of the larger states
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.360]   to ensure their independence.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:17.100]   Only big governments with ever greater command of resources
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.140]   could compete on the battlefield.
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.900]   The great unanswered question.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.700]   This brings us to one of the great unanswered puzzles
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.540]   of modern history.
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.140]   Why the Cold War that came at the conclusion
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:35.220]   of the great power system pitted as its final contenders,
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:40.220]   communist dictatorships against democratic welfare states.
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.980]   The issue has been so little examined
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.820]   that it actually seemed plausible to many
[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:49.100]   when a State Department analyst, Francis Fukuyama,
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.700]   proclaimed, "The end of history,"
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.100]   after the Berlin Wall fell.
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.060]   The enthusiastic audience his work elicited
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.260]   took too much for granted.
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.120]   Apparently, neither the author nor many others
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.180]   had bothered to ask a fundamental question.
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:09.820]   What common characteristics of state socialism
[00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:12.900]   and welfare state democracies
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:17.400]   led them to be the final contenders for world domination?
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:21.340]   This is an important issue.
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:24.900]   After all, dozens of contending systems of sovereignty
[00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.740]   have come and gone in the past five centuries,
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:31.260]   including absolute monarchies, tribal enclaves,
[00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.980]   prince-bishoprics, direct rule by the Pope,
[00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:37.940]   sultanates, city-states, and Anabaptist colonies.
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.340]   Today, most people would be surprised to learn
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:44.900]   that a hospital management company with its own armed forces
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.400]   could rule a country for centuries.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.620]   Yet, something very like that happened.
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.720]   For 300 years after 1228,
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.540]   the Teutonic Knights of St. Mary's Hospital at Jerusalem,
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.420]   later united with the Knights of the Sword of Livonia,
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:04.500]   ruled East Prussia and various territories in Eastern Europe,
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.780]   including parts of Lithuania and Poland.
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:10.720]   Then came the Gunpowder Revolution.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.200]   Within decades, the Teutonic Knights were expelled
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.620]   as sovereigns of all their territories,
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:20.400]   and their grandmaster was of no more military importance
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.400]   than a chess champion.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.460]   Why?
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.700]   Why did so many other systems of sovereignty
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.740]   dwindle to insignificance,
[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.580]   while the great struggle for world power
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.900]   at the end of the Industrial Age saw mass democracies
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.960]   lined up against state socialist systems?
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.940]   Unimpeded control.
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:43.260]   Our theory of megapolitics points to the answer.
[00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:48.260]   It is rather like asking why sumo wrestlers tend to be fat.
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.800]   The answer is that a lean sumo wrestler,
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.240]   however impressive his ratio of strength to weight,
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:58.640]   cannot compete with another wrestler who is gigantic.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:03.440]   As Tilly suggests, the important issue was effectiveness,
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:08.440]   total output, not efficiency, the ratio of output to input.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.680]   In an increasingly violent world,
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.160]   the systems that predominated
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.400]   through five centuries of competition
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.480]   were necessarily those that facilitated
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.360]   the greatest access to resources needed
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.400]   to make war on a large scale.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.200]   How did this work?
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.280]   In the case of communism, the answer is obvious.
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.560]   Under communism, those who controlled the state
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.120]   controlled almost everything.
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.020]   If you had been a citizen of the Soviet Union
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.200]   during the Cold War, the KGB could have taken
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.960]   your toothbrush if they thought it useful
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.000]   for their purposes to do so.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.320]   They could have taken your teeth.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.760]   According to credible estimates that have become
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.640]   more credible since the opening of
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.640]   former Soviet archives in 1992,
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:54.000]   secret police and other agents of the late Soviet state
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   took the lives of 50 million persons in 74 years of rule.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.920]   The state socialist system was in a position
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.320]   to mobilize anything that existed within its boundaries
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.040]   for its military, with little likelihood
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.320]   that anyone living there would argue.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.120]   In the case of Western democracies,
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.160]   the story is less obvious,
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.520]   partly because we are accustomed to think of democracy
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.360]   in stark contrast to communism.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.480]   In terms of the industrial age,
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.440]   the two systems were indeed great opposites.
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.400]   But seen from the perspective of the information age,
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.880]   the two systems had more in common than you might suspect.
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:36.240]   Both facilitated unimpeded control of resources
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.760]   by government.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.400]   The difference was that the democratic welfare state
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:45.000]   placed even greater resources in the hands of the state
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   than the state socialist systems.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.840]   This is a clear cut example of a rare phenomenon,
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.400]   less being more.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.240]   The state socialist system was predicated upon the doctrine
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.760]   that the state owned everything.
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.120]   The democratic welfare state, by contrast,
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:05.000]   made more modest claims and thereby employed
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.960]   superior incentives to mobilize greater output.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.880]   Instead of laying claim to everything in the beginning,
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.960]   governments in the West allowed individuals
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:17.000]   to own property and accumulate wealth.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.880]   Then after the wealth had been accumulated,
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:23.800]   the Western nation states taxed a large fraction of it away.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.320]   Property taxes, income taxes,
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.560]   and estate taxes at high levels
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.720]   furnished the democratic welfare state
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.340]   with prodigious quantities of resources
[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:34.720]   compared to those available
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.800]   through the state socialist systems.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.040]   Inefficiency where it counted.
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.000]   Compared to communism,
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.540]   the welfare state was indeed a far more efficient system.
[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:49.940]   But compared to other systems for accumulating wealth,
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.980]   such as a genuine laissez-faire enclave
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.860]   like colonial Hong Kong,
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.240]   the welfare state was inefficient.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.520]   Again, less was more.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.800]   It was precisely this inefficiency
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.000]   that made the welfare state supreme
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.640]   during the mega political conditions of the industrial age.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.740]   When you come to understand why,
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.420]   you are much closer to recognizing
[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.200]   what the fall of the Berlin Wall
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.300]   and the death of communism really mean.
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.880]   Far from assuring that the democratic welfare state
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:24.160]   will be a triumphant system, as has been widely assumed,
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:27.000]   it was more like seeing that a fraternal twin
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.180]   has died of old age.
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:34.200]   The same mega political revolution that killed communism
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.300]   is also likely to undermine
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.760]   and destroy democratic welfare states
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.260]   as we have known them in the 20th century.
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:44.740]   Who controls government?
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:49.360]   The key to this unorthodox conclusion lies
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.720]   in recognizing where the control
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.680]   of democratic government is lodged.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.880]   It is an issue that is not as simple as it may seem.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:58.800]   In the modern era,
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.040]   the question of who controls the government
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:06.040]   has almost always been asked as a political question.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.360]   It has had many answers, but almost uniformly,
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.060]   these involved identifying the political party,
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.760]   group, or faction that dominated the control
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:17.880]   of a particular state at a particular moment.
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:21.600]   You have heard of governments controlled by capitalists,
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.840]   governments controlled by labor,
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.680]   governments controlled by Catholics
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.080]   and by Islamic fundamentalists,
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.840]   governments controlled by tribal and racial groups,
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:34.460]   governments controlled by Hutus and governments by whites.
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:36.120]   You have also heard of governments controlled
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.800]   by occupational groups, such as lawyers or bankers.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.240]   You have heard of governments controlled by rural interests,
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.540]   by big city machines and by people living in the suburbs.
[00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.560]   And you have certainly heard of governments controlled
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:52.160]   by political parties, by Democrats, Conservatives,
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.460]   Christian Democrats, liberals, radicals,
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:56.680]   Republicans, and socialists.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.300]   But you probably have not heard much
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:03.980]   about a government controlled by its customers.
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.920]   Economic historian, Frederick Lane laid the basis
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.000]   for a new way of understanding
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.720]   where the control of government lies
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.840]   in some of his lucid essays
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:16.320]   on the economic consequences of violence discussed earlier.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.960]   Thinking about government as an economic unit
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:24.000]   that sells protection led Lane to analyze
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.800]   the control of government in economic
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.120]   rather than political terms.
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.660]   In this view, there are three basic alternatives
[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.300]   in the control of government,
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:36.100]   each of which entails a fundamentally different set
[00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:41.100]   of incentives, proprietors, employees, and customers.
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:46.700]   Proprietors, in rare cases, even today,
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:50.820]   governments are sometimes controlled by a proprietor,
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:54.420]   usually a hereditary leader who for all intents
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.940]   and purposes owns the country.
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.520]   For example, the Sultan of Brunei treats the government
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.360]   of Brunei somewhat like a proprietorship.
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.400]   This was more common among lords of the Middle Ages
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.480]   who treated their fiefs as proprietorships
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.520]   to optimize their incomes.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.560]   Lane described the incentives of the owners
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:15.640]   of the production-producing enterprise as follows.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:19.920]   Quote, "An interest in maximizing profits would lead him,
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.040]   while maintaining prices, to try to reduce his costs.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.680]   He would, like Henry VII of England,
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:30.860]   or Louis XI of France, use inexpensive wiles,
[00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:34.360]   at least as inexpensive devices as possible,
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:38.160]   to affirm his legitimacy, to maintain domestic order,
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.580]   and to distract neighboring princes
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:43.560]   so that his own military expenses would be low.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:47.600]   From lowered costs, or from the increased exactions
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.280]   made possible by the firmness of his monopoly,
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:54.400]   or from a combination, he accumulated a surplus."
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.680]   Governments controlled by proprietors
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.200]   have strong incentives to reduce the costs
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.240]   of providing protection or monopolizing violence
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.840]   in a given area.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:07.040]   But so long as their rule is secure,
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:11.480]   they have little incentive to reduce the price, the tax.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.920]   They charge their customers below the rate
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.140]   that optimizes revenues.
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.000]   The higher the price a monopolist can charge
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.120]   and the lower his actual costs,
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.360]   the greater the profit he will make.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.000]   The ideal fiscal policy for a government
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.320]   controlled by its proprietors would be a huge surplus.
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.880]   When governments can keep their revenues high,
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.240]   but cut their costs, this has a large impact
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.400]   on the use of resources.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.480]   Labor and other valuable inputs
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.240]   that would otherwise be wasted,
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.640]   providing unnecessarily expensive protection,
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:50.080]   become available instead for investment and other purposes.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.800]   The higher the monarch can raise his profit
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:57.200]   by lowering costs, the more resources are freed.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.240]   When these resources are used for investment,
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.800]   they provide a stimulus for growth.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.000]   But even if they are used for conspicuous consumption,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.840]   they help create and feed new markets
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:10.560]   that otherwise would not exist
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.320]   if the resources had been wasted
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.820]   to produce inefficient protection.
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:17.920]   Employees.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:20.040]   It is easy to characterize the incentives
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:24.000]   that prevail for governments controlled by their employees.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.480]   They would be similar incentives
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.800]   in other employee-controlled organizations.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.460]   First and foremost, employee-run organizations
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:34.800]   tend to favor any policy that increases employment
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.080]   and oppose measures which reduce jobs.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.740]   As Lane put it, quote,
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.820]   "When employees as a whole controlled,
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:43.500]   "they had little interest in minimizing
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.720]   "the amounts exacted for protection
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.280]   "and none in minimizing that large part of costs
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:53.000]   "represented by labor costs by their own salaries.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.560]   "Maximizing size was more to their taste also."
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:00.400]   A government controlled by its employees
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.000]   would seldom have incentives
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.760]   to either reduce the costs of government
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.560]   or the price charged to their customers.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:11.760]   However, where conditions impose strong price resistance
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.400]   in the form of opposition to higher taxes,
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.200]   governments controlled by employees
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.020]   would be more likely to let their revenues
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:22.160]   fall below their outlays than to cut their outlays.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:25.000]   In other words, their incentives imply
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.680]   that they may be inclined toward chronic deficits
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.420]   as governments controlled by proprietors would not be.
[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:34.880]   Customers.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.720]   Are there examples of governments
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.900]   controlled by their customers?
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:40.100]   Yes.
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.000]   Lane was inspired to analyze the control of government
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.360]   in economic terms by the example
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.980]   of the medieval merchant republics like Venice.
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.240]   There, a group of wholesale merchants
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.560]   who required protection
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.580]   effectively controlled the government for centuries.
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.700]   They were genuinely customers
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.480]   for the protection service government provided,
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.260]   not proprietors.
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.260]   They paid for the service.
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.300]   They did not seek to profit from their control
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.500]   of government's monopoly of violence.
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.820]   If some did, they were prevented from doing so
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:13.900]   by the other customers for long periods of time.
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:16.480]   Other examples of governments controlled by their customers
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.520]   include democracies and republics with limited franchise,
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.160]   such as the ancient democracies
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:27.120]   or the American Republic in its founding period.
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:31.440]   At that time, only those who paid for the government,
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:35.640]   about 10% of the population, were allowed to vote.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.160]   Governments controlled by their customers,
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.340]   like those of proprietors,
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:43.300]   have incentives to reduce their operating costs
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.160]   as far as possible.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.200]   But unlike governments controlled
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.360]   by either proprietors or employees,
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.280]   governments actually controlled by their customers
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:57.520]   have incentives to hold down the prices they charge.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.080]   Where customers rule,
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:02.800]   governments are lean and generally unobtrusive
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:07.800]   with low operating costs, minimal employment, and low taxes.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:12.000]   A government controlled by its customers sets tax rates
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   not to optimize the amount the government can collect,
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.880]   but rather to optimize the amount
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:20.960]   that the customers can retain.
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:24.100]   Like typical enterprises in competitive markets,
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:26.440]   even a monopoly controlled by its customers
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:29.920]   would be compelled to move toward efficiency.
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.440]   It would not be able to charge a price in the form of taxes
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.660]   that exceeded costs by more than a bare margin.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:43.440]   The role of democracy, voters as employees and customers.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:48.840]   Lane treats democracy in the conventional way,
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.720]   in assuming that it brings violence-using
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.040]   and violence-producing enterprises,
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:58.040]   quote, "increasingly under the control of their customers."
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:02.720]   This is certainly the politically correct conclusion.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.440]   But is it true?
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.840]   We think not.
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:10.360]   Look closely at how modern democracies function.
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.840]   First of all, they have few characteristics
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:16.000]   of those competitive industries where the terms of trade
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.800]   are clearly controlled by their customers.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:21.280]   For one thing, democratic governments
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.960]   typically spend only a bare fraction
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.640]   of their total outlays on the service of protection,
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:30.180]   which is their core activity.
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:31.720]   In the United States, for example,
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:36.720]   state and local governments spend just 3.5%
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:40.080]   of their total outlays on the provision of police,
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.840]   as well as courts and prisons.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:46.040]   Add military spending, and the fraction of revenues
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:50.000]   devoted to protection is still only about 10%.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.820]   Another revealing hint that mass democracy
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:55.140]   is not controlled by its customers
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:58.400]   is the fact that contemporary political culture,
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.580]   inherited from the industrial age,
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:04.140]   would consider it outrageous if policies on crucial issues
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:06.840]   were actually informed by the interests of the people
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.200]   who pay the bills.
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:11.360]   Imagine the uproar if a US president
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.760]   or a British prime minister proposed
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.760]   to allow the group of citizens
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:18.080]   who pay the majority of the taxes
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:21.480]   to determine which programs of government should continue
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:24.860]   and which groups of employees should be fired.
[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:28.080]   This would deeply offend expectations
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.480]   of how government should operate
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.640]   in a way that allowing government employees
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:37.080]   to determine whose taxes should be raised would not.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.040]   Yet, when you think about it,
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.480]   when customers really are in the driver's seat,
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.020]   it would be considered outrageous
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:45.760]   that they should not get what they want.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.440]   If you went into a store to buy furniture
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.440]   and the salespeople took your money,
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.120]   but then proceeded to ignore your requests
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:56.400]   and consult others about how to spend your money,
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.180]   you would quite rightly be upset.
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:02.240]   You would not think it normal or justifiable
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.000]   if the employees of the store argued
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.400]   that you really did not deserve the furniture
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.840]   and that it should be shipped instead
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.700]   to someone whom they found more worthy.
[00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.160]   The fact that something very like this happens
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.520]   in dealings with government
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:19.520]   shows how little control its customers actually have.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.960]   By any measure, the costs of democratic governments
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.160]   have surged out of control,
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.720]   unlike the typical situation
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:30.600]   where customer preferences force vendors to be efficient.
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:34.940]   Most democracies run chronic deficits.
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:36.680]   This is a fiscal policy
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.080]   characteristic of control by employees.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.620]   Governments seem notably resistant
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:45.840]   to reducing the costs of their operations.
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.800]   An almost universal complaint
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.560]   about contemporary government worldwide
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:54.120]   is that political programs, once established,
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.740]   can be curtailed only with great difficulty.
[00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:01.460]   To fire a government employee is all but impossible.
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:03.780]   In fact, one of the principal advantages
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:05.360]   arising from privatization
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:07.060]   of formerly state-owned functions
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:10.800]   is that private control usually makes it far easier
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.780]   to weed out unnecessary employment.
[00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.140]   From Britain to Argentina,
[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:18.820]   it has not been uncommon for the new private managers
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:22.600]   to shed 50 to 95% of former state employees.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.940]   Think as well of the basis
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:26.240]   upon which the fiscal terms
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.980]   of a government's protection service is priced.
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:31.180]   For the most part, you would look in vain
[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:33.820]   for hints of competitive influences on tax rates
[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:36.460]   according to which government services are priced.
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:39.640]   Even the occasional debates about lowering taxes
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.940]   that have interrupted normal political discourse
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.060]   in recent years
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:46.340]   betray how far removed democratic government
[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:50.100]   has normally been from control by its customers.
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.340]   Advocates of lower taxes
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:54.560]   sometimes have argued that government revenues
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:56.060]   would actually increase
[00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:58.460]   because rates previously had been set so high
[00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:01.120]   that they discouraged economic activity.
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:04.780]   The trade-off they normally intended to highlight
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:07.380]   was not competition between jurisdictions,
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:10.060]   but something much more amazing.
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:13.860]   They did not argue that because tax rates in Hong Kong
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.620]   were only 15%,
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:17.460]   rates in the United States or Germany
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:20.060]   must be no higher than 15%.
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:23.540]   To the contrary, tax debates have normally assumed
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:25.780]   that the trade-off facing the taxpayer
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:28.580]   was not between doing business in one jurisdiction
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.300]   or doing it in another,
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.700]   but between doing business at penal rates
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.220]   or taking a holiday.
[00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:37.700]   You were told that productive individuals
[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.700]   subject to predatory taxation
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:41.420]   would walk away from their inboxes
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:44.920]   and go golfing if their tax burdens were not eased.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:48.180]   The fact that such an argument could even arise
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:51.340]   shows how far removed from a competitive footing
[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:53.060]   the protection costs imposed
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:55.860]   by democratic welfare states have been.
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:58.740]   The terms of progressive income taxation,
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:01.780]   which emerged in every democratic welfare state
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.900]   during the course of the 20th century,
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.500]   are dramatically unlike pricing provisions
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.960]   that would be preferred by customers.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.980]   This can easily be seen by comparing taxation imposed
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:14.700]   to support a monopolistic provision of protection
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:17.060]   with tariffs for telephone service,
[00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:20.940]   which until recently was a monopoly in most places.
[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:23.300]   Customers would scream bloody murder
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:26.460]   if a telephone company attempted to charge for calls
[00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:29.820]   on the same basis that income taxes are imposed.
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:32.860]   Suppose the phone company sent a bill for $50,000
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:34.340]   for a call to London
[00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.540]   just because you happened to conclude a deal
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:40.660]   worth $125,000 during a conversation.
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:43.100]   Neither you nor any other customer in his right mind
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.700]   would pay it, but that is exactly the basis
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.860]   upon which income taxes are assessed
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.580]   in every democratic welfare state.
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.420]   When you think closely about the terms
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:55.000]   under which industrial democracies have operated,
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.620]   it is more logical to treat them
[00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:00.260]   as a form of government controlled by their employees.
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:02.460]   Thinking of mass democracy
[00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:05.020]   as government controlled by its employees
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:09.100]   helps explain the difficulty of changing government policy.
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:10.780]   Government, in many respects,
[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:13.740]   appears to be run for the benefit of employees.
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:17.620]   For example, government schools in most democratic countries
[00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:20.100]   seem to malfunction chronically,
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:22.140]   and without remedy.
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:25.100]   If customers truly were in the driver's seat,
[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:28.540]   they would find it easier to set new policy directions.
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:30.420]   Those who pay for democratic government
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:32.880]   seldom set the terms of government spending.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.660]   Instead, government functions as a co-op
[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:38.660]   that is both outside of proprietary control
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:41.480]   and operating as a natural monopoly.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.660]   Prices bear little relation to costs.
[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:46.640]   The quality of service is generally low
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:49.180]   compared to that in private enterprise.
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:51.980]   Customer grievances are hard to remedy.
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:55.380]   In short, mass democracy leads to control of government
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.060]   by its employees.
[00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:02.020]   But wait, you may be saying that in most jurisdictions,
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:03.660]   there are many more voters
[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:06.580]   than there are persons on the government payroll.
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:08.860]   How could it be possible for employees
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:11.180]   to dominate under such conditions?
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:17.100]   The welfare state emerged to answer exactly this quandary.
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:19.620]   Since there were not otherwise enough employees
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:21.800]   to create a working majority,
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.620]   increasing numbers of voters
[00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:25.580]   were effectively put on the payroll
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:28.440]   to receive transfer payments of all kinds.
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.940]   In effect, the recipients of transfer payments and subsidies
[00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:34.860]   became pseudo-employees of government,
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:37.040]   who were able to dispense with the bother
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.360]   of reporting every day to work.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.240]   It was a result dictated by the mega-political logic
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.380]   of the industrial age.
[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:46.260]   When the magnitude of coercive force
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:49.300]   is more important than the efficient deployment of resources,
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:52.080]   as was the case prior to 1989,
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.260]   it is all but impossible for most governments
[00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:56.700]   to be controlled by their customers.
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:00.380]   As the example of the late Soviet Union illustrated so well,
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:01.540]   until a few years ago,
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:04.180]   it was possible for states to exercise great power
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:06.820]   in the world, even while wasting resources
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:08.860]   on a massive scale.
[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:12.380]   When returns to violence are high and rising,
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:15.460]   magnitude means more than efficiency.
[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:19.080]   Larger entities tend to prevail over smaller ones.
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:20.940]   Those governments that are more effective
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:23.300]   in mobilizing military resources,
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.940]   even at the cost of wasting many of them,
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:27.620]   tend to prevail over those
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:29.940]   that utilize resources more efficiently.
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:32.800]   Think what this means.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:36.980]   It inescapably implies that when magnitude
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:39.540]   means more than efficiency,
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:44.260]   governments controlled by their customers cannot prevail,
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:47.780]   and often cannot survive.
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:48.980]   Under such conditions,
[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:52.100]   the entities that will be most effective militarily
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:56.900]   are those that commandeer the most resources for war.
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:59.020]   But governments that are truly controlled
[00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:01.340]   by their customers who pay their bills
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.140]   are unlikely to have carte blanche
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:07.780]   to reach into the pockets of everyone to extract resources.
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:10.820]   Customers normally wish to see the prices they pay
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:13.100]   for any product or service,
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:17.460]   including protection, lowered, and kept under control.
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:20.360]   If the Western democracies had been under customer control
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.780]   during the Cold War,
[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.660]   that fact alone would have made them
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:26.060]   weaker competitors militarily,
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:28.060]   because it would almost certainly have curtailed
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:30.860]   the flow of resources into the government.
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:33.180]   Remember, where customers rule,
[00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:35.660]   both prices and costs should be expected
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:37.660]   to be under tight control.
[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:39.900]   But this is hardly what happened.
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:42.380]   The welfare states were manifestly the winners
[00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:45.300]   of the spending contest during the Cold War,
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:47.620]   commentators of all stripes cited
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:49.580]   as a factor in their triumph,
[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:53.240]   their ability to spend the Soviet Union into bankruptcy.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:56.860]   It is precisely this fact that highlights the way
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:59.300]   in which the inefficiencies of democracy
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:01.220]   made it mega-politically predominant
[00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:04.540]   during a period of rising returns to violence.
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:07.860]   Massive military spending, with all its waste,
[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:10.980]   represents a distinctly suboptimal deployment of capital
[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.780]   for private gain.
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:15.620]   We suggested earlier that while welfare states
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:16.900]   were economically efficient
[00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.380]   as compared to state socialist systems,
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:22.220]   they are far less efficient for the creation of wealth
[00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:25.940]   than laissez-faire enclaves like Hong Kong.
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:27.940]   Ironically, it was this very inefficiency
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:29.780]   of the democratic welfare state
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:32.700]   as compared to a more unencumbered free market system
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:34.240]   that made it successful
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:38.080]   in the mega-political conditions of industrialism.
[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:42.620]   How did inefficiency fostered by democracy
[00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:46.780]   become a factor in its success during the age of violence?
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:49.140]   The key to unraveling this apparent paradox
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:51.500]   lies in recognizing two points.
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:56.740]   One, success for a sovereignty in the modern period
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:58.960]   lay not in creating wealth,
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:03.540]   but in creating a military force capable of deploying
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:07.720]   overpowering violence against any other state.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.980]   Money was needed to do that,
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:13.660]   but money itself could not win a battle.
[00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:15.900]   The challenge was not to create a system
[00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:17.820]   with the most efficient economy
[00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:19.900]   or the most rapid rate of growth,
[00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:23.220]   but to create a system that could extract more resources
[00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:26.580]   and channel them into the military.
[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:29.860]   By its nature, military spending is an area
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:32.420]   where the financial returns per se
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:35.660]   are low or non-existent.
[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:38.920]   Two, the easiest way to obtain permission
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.760]   to invest funds in activities
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:44.280]   with little or no direct financial return,
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.720]   like tax payments,
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.560]   is to ask for permission from someone
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:52.160]   other than the person whose money is coveted.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:53.840]   One of the ways that the Dutch
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:58.040]   were able to purchase Manhattan for $23 worth of beads
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:02.120]   is that the particular Indians to whom they made the offer
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:05.200]   were not the ones who properly owned it.
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:08.340]   Getting to yes, as the marketing people say,
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:12.200]   is much easier under those terms.
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:16.140]   Suppose, for example, that as authors of this book,
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:19.420]   we wanted you to pay not its cover price,
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:23.540]   but 40% of your annual income for a copy.
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:26.640]   We would be far likelier to get permission to do so
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:31.620]   if we asked someone else and did not have to ask you.
[00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:33.860]   In fact, we would be far more persuasive
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:36.340]   if we could rely instead upon the consent
[00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:39.540]   of several people you do not even know.
[00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:42.220]   We could hold an ad hoc election,
[00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:45.740]   what H.L. Mencken described with less exaggeration
[00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:47.520]   than he might have thought as quote,
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:50.980]   "An advanced auction of stolen goods."
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:53.600]   And to make the example more realistic,
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.740]   we would agree to share some of the money
[00:45:55.740 --> 00:46:00.100]   we collected from you with these anonymous bystanders
[00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:02.580]   in exchange for their support.
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:04.020]   That is the role
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:08.020]   the modern democratic welfare state evolved to fulfill.
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:13.020]   It was an unsurpassed system in the industrial age
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:16.980]   because it was both efficient and inefficient
[00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:18.540]   where it counted.
[00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:21.740]   It combined the efficiency of private ownership
[00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:24.320]   and incentives for the creation of wealth
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:26.060]   with a mechanism to facilitate
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:30.460]   essentially unchecked access to that wealth.
[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:34.820]   Democracy kept the pockets of wealth producers open.
[00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:37.780]   It succeeded militarily during the high water period
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:40.500]   of rising returns to violence in the world
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:43.540]   precisely because it made it difficult for customers
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:47.260]   to effectively restrict the taxes the government collected
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:50.420]   or other ways of funding the outlay of resources
[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:53.040]   for the military, such as inflation.
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:57.020]   Why customers could not dominate.
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:02.700]   Those who paid for protection during the modern period
[00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:06.660]   were not in a position to successfully deny resources
[00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:10.580]   to the sovereign, even acting collectively
[00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:13.380]   when doing so would simply have exposed them
[00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:18.380]   to being overpowered by other possibly more hostile states.
[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:23.020]   This was an obvious consideration during the Cold War.
[00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:27.680]   The customers or taxpayers who bore a disproportionate share
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:29.060]   of the cost of government
[00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:32.620]   in the leading Western industrial states
[00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:36.780]   were in no position to refuse to pay hefty taxes.
[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:39.620]   The result would have been to expose themselves
[00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:42.980]   to total confiscation by the Soviet Union
[00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:47.740]   or another aggressive group capable of organizing violence.
[00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:51.900]   Industrialism and democracy.
[00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:57.060]   Taking a longer view, mass democracy may prove
[00:47:57.060 --> 00:48:00.060]   to be an anachronism that will not long survive
[00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:02.300]   the end of the industrial age.
[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:06.300]   Certainly, mass democracy and the nation state emerged
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:08.180]   together with the French revolution
[00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:10.180]   at the end of the 18th century,
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:14.700]   probably as a response to a surge in real income.
[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:16.940]   Incomes had begun to rise significantly
[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:19.460]   in Western Europe about 1750,
[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:22.140]   partly as a result of warmer weather.
[00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:25.060]   This coincided with a period of technological innovation
[00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:27.780]   that displaced skilled jobs of artisans
[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:31.260]   with equipment that could be operated by unskilled workers,
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:33.460]   even women and children.
[00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:35.780]   This new industrial equipment raised earnings
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:37.020]   for unskilled workers,
[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:40.100]   making the income distribution more equal.
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:42.020]   The crucial trigger point of revolution
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:44.840]   may not have been, as is often thought,
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:47.900]   the perverse idea that people tend to revolt
[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:49.720]   when conditions improve.
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:51.940]   More important may be the fact that
[00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:54.900]   when incomes had risen to a certain level,
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:59.420]   it at last became practical for the early modern state
[00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:02.460]   to circumvent the private intermediaries
[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:04.580]   and powerful magnates with whom
[00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:07.460]   they had previously bargained for resources
[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:10.800]   and move to a system of direct rule,
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.220]   in which a national government
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:15.040]   dealt directly with individual citizens,
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:17.580]   taxing them at ever higher rates
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:20.800]   and demanding poorly compensated military service
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:24.500]   in exchange for provision of various benefits.
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:26.460]   Because the emerging middle class
[00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:28.900]   soon had enough money to tax,
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:32.460]   it was no longer essential, as it previously had been,
[00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:35.740]   for rulers to negotiate with powerful landlords
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:37.860]   or great merchants who were,
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:40.860]   as historian Charles Tilley wrote,
[00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:44.620]   "In a position to prevent the creation of a powerful state
[00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:49.620]   that would seize their assets and cramp their transactions."
[00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:54.040]   It is easy to see why governments were more successful
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:56.260]   in extracting resources
[00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:59.700]   when they dealt with millions of citizens individually,
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:02.900]   rather than with a relative handful of lords,
[00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:06.520]   dukes, earls, bishops, contract mercenaries,
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:09.780]   free cities and other semi-sovereign entities
[00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:11.740]   with whom the rulers of European states
[00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:15.260]   were obliged to negotiate prior to the mid 18th century.
[00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:18.660]   Rising real incomes allowed governments
[00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:21.100]   to adopt a strategy that placed more resources
[00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:22.760]   under their control.
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:26.060]   Small sums taken in taxes from millions
[00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:28.580]   could produce more revenue than larger amounts
[00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:31.380]   paid by a few powerful people.
[00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:35.380]   What is more, the many were far easier to deal with
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:37.740]   than the few who were generally unwilling
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:39.100]   to give their money away
[00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:42.260]   and were far better placed to resist.
[00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:46.220]   After all, the typical farmer, small merchant or worker
[00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:48.800]   possessed vanishingly small resources
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.060]   as compared to the state itself.
[00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:52.900]   It was not even remotely possible
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:55.400]   that the typical private individual in Western Europe
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.400]   on the eve of the French Revolution
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:59.700]   could have effectively bargained with the state
[00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:01.500]   to reduce his tax rate
[00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:04.480]   or mounted an effective resistance to government plans
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:07.100]   and policies that threatened his interests.
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:11.060]   But this is precisely what powerful private magnates
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:14.940]   had done for centuries and would continue to do.
[00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:18.160]   They effectively resisted and bargained with rulers,
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:21.020]   restraining their ability to commandeer resources.
[00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:25.020]   Quote, "Going to war accelerated the move
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:27.660]   "from indirect to direct rule.
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:29.480]   "Almost any state that makes war
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.620]   "finds that it cannot pay for the effort
[00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:35.060]   "from its accumulated reserves and current revenues.
[00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:38.700]   "Almost all war-making states borrow extensively,
[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:42.340]   "raise taxes, and seize the means of combat,
[00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:45.220]   "including men, from reluctant citizens
[00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:48.480]   "who have other uses for their resources."
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:49.880]   Charles Tilly.
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:52.920]   The example of Poland in the mid-18th century
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:55.520]   illustrates this perfectly.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:52:00.520]   In 1760, the Polish National Army comprised 18,000 soldiers.
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:05.520]   This was a meager force compared to the armies
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:08.400]   commanded by rulers of neighboring Austria,
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:11.040]   Prussia, and Russia, the least of whom
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:15.160]   could control a standing army of 100,000 soldiers.
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:19.260]   In fact, the Polish National Army in 1760
[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:22.520]   was small even in comparison with other units
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:24.980]   under arms within Poland.
[00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:29.380]   The combined forces of the Polish nobility were 30,000 men.
[00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:33.360]   If the Polish king had been able to interact directly
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:38.100]   with millions of individual Poles and tax them directly,
[00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:41.120]   rather than being limited to extracting resources
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:43.340]   indirectly through the contributions
[00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:45.660]   of the powerful Polish magnates,
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:48.220]   there is little doubt that the Polish central government
[00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:52.080]   would have been in a position to raise far more revenues
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:55.140]   and thus pay for a larger army.
[00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:58.460]   Against ordinary individuals who were not in a position
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:00.020]   to act in concert with millions
[00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:02.100]   of other ordinary individuals,
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:04.100]   the central authorities were to prove
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:06.980]   irresistibly powerful everywhere.
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:09.520]   But the king of Poland lacked the option
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:12.820]   of directly taxing his citizens in 1760.
[00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:15.180]   He had to deal through the lords,
[00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:17.420]   wealthy merchants, and other notables
[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:20.600]   who were a small, cohesive group.
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:23.900]   They could and did act in concert
[00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:26.780]   to keep the king from commandeering their resources
[00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:28.500]   without their consent.
[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:31.500]   Given that the Polish nobility had far more troops
[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:35.740]   than he did, the king was in no position to insist.
[00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:38.940]   As it turned out, the military disadvantage
[00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:41.620]   of failing to circumvent the wealthy and powerful
[00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:46.380]   in gathering resources was decisive in the age of violence.
[00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:49.580]   Within a few years, Poland ceased to exist
[00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:51.220]   as an independent country.
[00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:53.700]   It was conquered by invasions from Austria,
[00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:56.900]   Prussia, and Russia, three countries with armies,
[00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:59.060]   each of which was many times bigger
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:01.240]   than Poland's small force.
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:04.180]   In each of those countries, the rulers had found paths
[00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:07.380]   to circumvent the capacity of the wealthy merchants
[00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:10.300]   and the nobility to limit the commandeering
[00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:14.540]   of their resources after the French Revolution.
[00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:19.520]   The French Revolution resulted in an even greater surge
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:22.460]   in the size of armies, a fact that demonstrated
[00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:24.260]   the strength of the democratic strategy
[00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:26.860]   when returns to violence were rising.
[00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:28.620]   The bargain government struck
[00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:31.400]   from the French Revolution onward
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:35.380]   was to provide an unprecedented degree of involvement
[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:37.940]   in the lives of average people
[00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:41.260]   in exchange for their participation in wars
[00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:45.860]   in place of mercenaries and paying a growing burden of taxes
[00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:48.520]   from their rising incomes.
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:52.420]   As Tilly said, quote, "The state's sphere expanded far
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:55.860]   "beyond its military core, and its citizens began
[00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:59.000]   "to make claims on it for a very wide range
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:03.780]   "of protection, adjudication, production, and distribution.
[00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:07.020]   "As national legislatures extended their own ranges
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:09.520]   "well beyond the approval of taxation,
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:11.320]   "they became the targets of claims
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:13.740]   "from all well-organized groups
[00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:17.920]   "whose interests the state did or could affect.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:21.880]   "Direct rule and mass national politics grew up together
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:24.360]   "and reinforced each other mightily."
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:28.920]   The same logic that was true in the 18th century
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:33.920]   remained true until 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell.
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:37.220]   As the Industrial Age advanced,
[00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:41.100]   incomes for unskilled work continued to rise,
[00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:44.260]   making mass democracy an even more effective method
[00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:47.360]   of optimizing the extraction of resources.
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:50.960]   As a result, government grew and grew,
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:55.720]   adding about 0.5% to its total claims on annual income
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:56:00.260]   in the average industrial country over the 20th century.
[00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:04.040]   During the Industrial Age prior to 1989,
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:05.480]   democracy emerged
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:09.160]   as the most militarily effective form of government,
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:13.600]   precisely because democracy made it difficult or impossible
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:15.240]   to impose effective limits
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:18.360]   on the commandeering of resources by the state.
[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:22.080]   Generous provision of welfare benefits to one and all
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:26.260]   invited a majority of voters to become, in effect,
[00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:28.520]   employees of the government.
[00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:31.040]   This became the predominant political feature
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:33.600]   of all leading industrial countries,
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:36.440]   because voters were in a weak position
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:38.440]   to effectively control the government
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:42.160]   in their role as customers for the service of protection.
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:44.600]   Not only did they face the aggressive menace
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:46.440]   of communist systems,
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:50.320]   which could produce large resources for military purposes
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:53.120]   since the state controlled the entire economy,
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:55.620]   but true taxpayer control of government
[00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:59.140]   was also impractical for another reason.
[00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:01.720]   Millions of average citizens
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:06.040]   cannot work together effectively to protect their interests.
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:09.440]   Because the obstacles to their cooperation are high
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:11.660]   and the return to any individual
[00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:14.400]   for successfully defending the group's common interests
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:15.880]   is minimal,
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:19.380]   millions of ordinary citizens will not be as successful
[00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:22.040]   in withholding their assets from the government,
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:26.120]   as will smaller groups with more favorable incentives.
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:27.740]   Other things being equal, therefore,
[00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:31.000]   you would expect a higher proportion of total resources
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.360]   to be commandeered by government in a mass democracy
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:36.920]   than in an oligarchy
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:39.900]   or in a system of fragmented sovereignty,
[00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:42.280]   where magnates wielded military power
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:44.060]   and fielded their own armies,
[00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:46.840]   as they did everywhere in early modern Europe
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:49.520]   prior to the 18th century.
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:52.200]   Thus, a crucial, though seldom examined,
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:55.280]   reason for the growth of democracy in the Western world
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:58.560]   is the relative importance of negotiation costs
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:02.800]   at a time when returns to violence were rising.
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:06.380]   It was always costlier to draw resources from the few
[00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:08.300]   than from the many.
[00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:11.280]   A relatively small elite group of rich
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:14.560]   represent a more coherent and effective body
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:17.000]   than a large mass of citizens.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.640]   The small group has stronger incentives to work together.
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:23.440]   It will almost inevitably be more effective
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:27.160]   at protecting its interests than will a mass group.
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:29.080]   And even if most members of the group
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:32.160]   choose not to cooperate with any common action,
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:34.360]   a few who are rich may be capable
[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:37.740]   of deploying enough resources to get the job done.
[00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:39.920]   With democratic decision-making,
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:42.040]   the nation state could exercise power
[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:45.120]   much more completely over millions of persons
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:47.100]   who could not easily cooperate
[00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:49.600]   to act collectively in their own behalf
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:52.240]   than it could in dealings with a much smaller number
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:53.720]   who could more easily overcome
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:55.320]   the organizational difficulties
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:58.040]   of defending their concentrated interests.
[00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:00.800]   Democracy had the still more compelling advantage
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:03.400]   of creating a legitimizing decision rule
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:05.480]   that allowed the state to tap the resources
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:08.380]   of the well-to-do without having to bargain directly
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:09.880]   for their permission.
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:13.160]   In short, democracy as a decision mechanism
[00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:15.480]   was well-fitted to the mega-political conditions
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:17.200]   of the industrial age.
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:19.120]   It complemented the nation state
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:22.080]   because it facilitated the concentration of military power
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:23.840]   in the hands of those running it
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:26.400]   at a time when the magnitude of force brought to bear
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:29.080]   was more important than the efficiency
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:31.160]   with which it was mobilized.
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:34.840]   This was demonstrated decisively with the French Revolution,
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:37.100]   which raised the magnitude of military force
[00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:38.560]   on the battlefield.
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:41.520]   Thereafter, other competitive nation states
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:45.860]   had little choice but to converge on a similar organization
[00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:48.040]   with legitimacy ultimately tied
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:50.720]   to democratic decision-making.
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:53.960]   To summarize, the democratic nation state succeeded
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:58.360]   during the past two centuries for these hidden reasons.
[00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:02.400]   One, there were rising returns to violence
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:06.440]   that made magnitude of force more important than efficiency
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.580]   as a governing principle.
[01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:13.440]   Two, incomes rose sufficiently above subsistence
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:15.320]   that it became possible for the state
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:18.380]   to collect large amounts of total resources
[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:21.300]   without having to negotiate with powerful magnates
[01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:22.880]   who were capable of resisting.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:27.560]   Three, democracy proved sufficiently compatible
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.720]   with the operation of free markets
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:31.520]   to be conducive to the generation
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.920]   of increasing amounts of wealth.
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:37.480]   Four, democracy facilitated domination of government
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:39.760]   by its employees,
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.980]   thereby assuring that it would be difficult
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:46.980]   to curtail expenditures, including military expenditures.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.320]   Five, democracy as a decision rule
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.740]   proved to be an effective antidote
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:55.880]   to the ability of the wealthy to act in concert
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:58.400]   to restrict the nation state's ability to tax
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:01.280]   or otherwise protect their assets from invasion.
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:06.160]   Democracy became the militarily winning strategy
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.620]   because it facilitated the gathering of more resources
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:11.700]   into the hands of the state.
[01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:13.780]   Compared to other styles of sovereignty
[01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:17.120]   that depended for their legitimacy on other principles,
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:20.920]   such as the feudal levy, the divine right of kings,
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.620]   corporate religious duty,
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:25.480]   or the voluntary contributions of the rich,
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:29.280]   mass democracy became militarily the most potent
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:32.580]   because it was the surest way to gather resources
[01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:35.180]   in an industrial economy.
[01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:40.500]   Quote, "The nation, as a culturally defined community,
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:44.040]   "is the highest symbolic value of modernity.
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:47.560]   "It has been endowed with a quasi-sacred character
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:49.480]   "equaled only by religion.
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:54.480]   "In fact, this quasi-sacred character derives from religion.
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:57.240]   "In practice, the nation has become either
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:01.000]   "the modern secular substitute of religion
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.860]   "or its most powerful ally.
[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:06.060]   "In modern times, the communal sentiments
[01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:09.200]   "generated by the nation are highly regarded
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:12.860]   "and sought after as the basis for group loyalty.
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:14.960]   "That the modern state is often the beneficiary
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:19.720]   "should hardly be surprising, given its paramount power."
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.640]   Joseph R. Libera.
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:24.220]   Nationalism.
[01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:28.120]   Much the same can be said of nationalism,
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:31.440]   which became a corollary to mass democracy.
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:33.640]   States that could employ nationalism
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:36.200]   found that they could mobilize larger armies
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.040]   at a smaller cost.
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:40.880]   Nationalism was an invention that enabled a state
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:45.240]   to increase the scale at which it was militarily effective.
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.840]   Like politics itself,
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:50.300]   nationalism is mostly a modern invention.
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.880]   As sociologist Joseph Libera has shown
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:56.320]   in his richly documented book on the rise of nationalism,
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:00.120]   the nation is an imagined community
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.040]   that in large measure came into being
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:04.120]   as a way of mobilizing state power
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.240]   during the French Revolution.
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:09.680]   As he puts it, "In the modern sense of the term,
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:12.480]   "national consciousness has only existed
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.340]   "since the French Revolution.
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:17.160]   "Since the time when in 1789,
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:20.360]   "the Constituent Assembly equated the people of France
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:21.820]   "with the French nation."
[01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:25.600]   Nationalism made it easier to mobilize power
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:28.120]   and control large numbers of people.
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.780]   Nation states formed by underlining
[01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:34.600]   and emphasizing characteristics that people held in common,
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.960]   particularly spoken language.
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.380]   This facilitated rule
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:41.540]   without the intervention of intermediaries.
[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:44.760]   It simplified the tasks of bureaucracy.
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:47.920]   Edicts that need only be promulgated in one language
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:49.840]   can be dispatched more quickly
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.540]   and with less confusion than those
[01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:54.960]   that must be translated into a babble of tongues.
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:57.760]   Nationalism therefore tended to lower the cost
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:00.680]   of controlling larger areas.
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:03.480]   Before nationalism, the early modern state
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:07.840]   required the aid of lords, dukes, earls, bishops,
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:11.860]   free cities, and other corporate and ethnic intermediaries,
[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:15.680]   from tax farmers to military contract merchants
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:18.800]   and mercenaries to collect revenues, raise troops,
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:21.400]   and conduct other government functions.
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:24.300]   Nationalism also decisively lowered the costs
[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:26.680]   of mobilizing military personnel
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:29.000]   by encouraging group identification
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.280]   with the interests of the state.
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:34.440]   There was such a substantial advantage
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:38.960]   in harnessing group feeling to the interests of the state
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:40.580]   that most states,
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:44.660]   even the allegedly internationalist Soviet Union,
[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:49.660]   converged on nationalism as a complementary ideology.
[01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:51.940]   Seen in a longer perspective,
[01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:56.880]   nationalism is as much an anomaly as the state itself.
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:00.100]   As historian William McNeill has documented,
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:03.880]   polyethnic sovereignties were the norm in the past.
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:05.800]   In McNeill's words, quote,
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:08.600]   "The idea that a government rightfully should rule
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:10.840]   "over citizens of a single ethnos
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:13.020]   "started to develop in Western Europe
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:15.080]   "towards the end of the Middle Ages."
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:19.600]   An early nationalist entity was the Prussian League,
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:22.800]   Prussischer Bund, which formed in 1440
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:26.620]   in opposition to rule by the Teutonic Order.
[01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:28.460]   Some of the characteristics of the order
[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:31.180]   were highlighted earlier as a polar example
[01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:34.500]   of a sovereignty unlike the nation state.
[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:37.960]   The Teutonic Order was a kind of chartered company,
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:41.220]   almost none of whose members were native to Prussia.
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:43.520]   Its headquarters shifted at various times
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.880]   from Bremen and Lubeck to Jerusalem,
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:50.300]   to Accra, to Venice, and on to Marienburg on the Vistula.
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:52.680]   At one time, it ruled the district
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:55.080]   of Britsenland in Transylvania.
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:57.840]   It is not surprising that a sovereignty
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:01.280]   so unlike a state would become the object
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:04.700]   of one of the early attempts to mobilize national feeling
[01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:07.700]   as a factor in organizing power.
[01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:10.240]   However, as an indication of how different
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.680]   early nationalism was from later varieties,
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:16.960]   the German-speaking nobles of the Prussian League
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.520]   petitioned the King of Poland
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:21.280]   to place Prussia under Polish rule,
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:24.520]   largely because even then, the Polish king
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:26.640]   was a relatively weak monarch
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:29.520]   who was not expected to rule with the same rigor
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.840]   as the Teutonic Order.
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:35.840]   Nationalism in its early incarnations came into play
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:38.960]   just prior to the Gunpowder Revolution.
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:42.020]   It continued to develop as the early modern state developed,
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:44.340]   taking a quantum leap in importance
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:46.800]   at the time of the French Revolution.
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:51.360]   We believe that nationalism as an idea of force
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:53.600]   has already begun to recede.
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:57.240]   It probably reached its heyday with Woodrow Wilson's attempt
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:00.360]   to endow every ethnic group in Europe
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:04.080]   with its own state at the close of World War I.
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:08.080]   It is now a reactionary force inflamed in places
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:12.840]   with falling incomes and declining prospects like Serbia.
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:15.860]   As we explore later, we expect nationalism
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:20.760]   to be a major rallying theme of persons with low skills,
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:24.840]   nostalgic for compulsion as the welfare state
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:28.160]   collapses in the Western democracies.
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:30.880]   You haven't seen anything yet.
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.880]   For most persons in the West,
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:35.080]   the fallout from the death of communism
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:37.740]   has seemed relatively benign.
[01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:40.720]   You have seen a drop in military spending,
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.720]   a plunge in aluminum prices,
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:46.000]   and a new source of hockey players for the NHL.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   That is the good news.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.360]   It is news that most people who came of age
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:52.520]   in the 20th century could applaud,
[01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:54.880]   especially if they are hockey fans.
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:58.280]   Most of the news that is destined to prove less popular
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:07:59.320]   is still to come.
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:03.520]   With the passage of the industrial age,
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:06.480]   the political conditions that democracy satisfied
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:09.460]   are rapidly ceasing to exist.
[01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:13.480]   Therefore, it is doubtful that mass democracy
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:16.320]   and the welfare state will survive long
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:18.600]   in the new, mega-political conditions
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:20.220]   of the information age.
[01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:25.440]   Quote, "Congress was not a temple of democracy.
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:28.800]   "It was a market for bartering laws."
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:31.920]   Alberto Fujimori, President of Peru.
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:36.160]   Indeed, future historians may report
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:40.280]   that we have already seen the first postmodern coup,
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:45.280]   the remarkable padlocking of the Congress in Peru in 1993.
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:47.080]   This was hardly an event
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:49.040]   that attracted much favorable notice
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:51.600]   in the leading industrial democracies,
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:54.800]   but it may turn out to mean more in the fullness of time
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:58.120]   than conventional analysts would suggest.
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.720]   The few who have thought about it
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:02.420]   tend to see it as just another power grab
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:04.960]   of the kind that has become depressingly familiar
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:07.240]   in the history of Latin America.
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:09.320]   But we see it as perhaps the first step
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:12.200]   toward delegitimizing a form of governance
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.680]   whose immediate mega-political reason for being
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:16.000]   has begun to disappear
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.600]   with the transition to the information age.
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.680]   Fujimori's closure of the Congress
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:23.920]   is a symptom of the ultimate devaluation
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:25.900]   of political promises.
[01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:28.320]   A similar fate could await other legislatures
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:30.140]   when their credit is exhausted.
[01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:35.260]   The shift in technology that is eroding industrialism
[01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:37.600]   has trapped many countries with governments
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:41.440]   that no longer work or work badly.
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:43.160]   Legislatures, in particular,
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:46.340]   appear to be increasingly dysfunctional.
[01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:47.560]   They grind out laws
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:50.640]   that might've been merely stupid 50 years ago,
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:53.120]   but are dangerous today.
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:56.800]   This was spectacularly obvious in Peru,
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.020]   where the internal sovereignty of the state
[01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:02.680]   had almost collapsed by 1993.
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:06.800]   Quote, "Attacks, kidnappings, rapes, and murders
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:10.160]   "have coincided with increasingly aggressive driving habits
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:12.520]   "and unsafe streets.
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:15.980]   "The police have gradually lost control of the situation,
[01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:19.000]   "and some of their members have been involved in scandals
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.300]   "and become seasoned criminals.
[01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:23.040]   "People have gradually grown used
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:25.060]   "to living outside the law.
[01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:28.260]   "Theft, illegal seizure, and factory takeovers
[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:31.120]   "have become everyday occurrences."
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:32.420]   Hernando de Soto.
[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:36.040]   Peru in ruins.
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:41.040]   In a sense, Peru was no longer a modern nation state in 1993.
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:44.240]   It still had a flag and an army,
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:47.480]   but most of its institutions lay in ruins.
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:50.520]   Even the prisons had been taken over by the inmates.
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:54.160]   This disintegration could be traced to a number of causes,
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.280]   but most expert attempts to explain it
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:58.080]   miss the real point.
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:01.560]   Peru was an early casualty of the technological change
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:04.160]   that is making closed economies dysfunctional
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:07.460]   and undermining central authority everywhere.
[01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:09.840]   These mega-political stresses are compounded
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:11.600]   because decision-making institutions
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.380]   like the Peruvian Congress
[01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:15.320]   are trapped by perverse incentives
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:17.160]   into aggravating the very problems
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:19.520]   that they most need to solve.
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:21.440]   Representative democracy in Peru
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:23.960]   was like a pair of loaded dice.
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:27.760]   As a decision mechanism for aggrandizing the state,
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:30.120]   it was unsurpassed.
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:34.140]   But when new circumstances called for devolving power,
[01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:37.640]   the inherent biases that made democracy so useful
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:40.160]   under the old mega-political conditions
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:42.720]   made it increasingly dysfunctional.
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:44.600]   The very laws passed by the Congress
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:48.000]   were rapidly destroying any foundation of value
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.260]   or respect for the law.
[01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:52.760]   As de Soto put it in "The Other Path,"
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:56.240]   quote, "Small interest groups fight among themselves,
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:59.640]   "cause bankruptcies, implicate public officials.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.960]   "Governments hand out privileges.
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:04.360]   "The law is used to give and take away
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:07.440]   "far more than morality permits."
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:09.440]   A Congress like that in Peru,
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:12.500]   entirely enthralled to special interest groups,
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:16.260]   has all the moral stature of a gang of fences
[01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:18.640]   auctioning off stolen goods.
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:20.800]   It made the free market illegal
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:24.400]   and consequently made the law ridiculous.
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:27.860]   As de Soto writes at the pre-Fujimori period,
[01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:31.240]   quote, "A complete subversion of ends and means
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:34.980]   "has turned the life of Peruvian society upside down,
[01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:37.440]   "to the point that there are acts which,
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.280]   "although officially criminal,
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:42.640]   "are no longer condemned by the collective consciousness.
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:44.580]   "Smuggling is a case in point.
[01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:46.980]   "Everyone from the aristocratic lady
[01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:50.360]   "to the humblest man acquires smuggled goods.
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:52.340]   "No one has scruples about it.
[01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:54.700]   "On the contrary, it is viewed as a kind of challenge
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:59.700]   "to individual ingenuity or as revenge against the state.
[01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:02.720]   "This infiltration of violence and criminality
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:04.960]   "into everyday life has been accompanied
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:08.340]   "by increasing poverty and deprivation.
[01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:11.880]   "In general terms, Peruvians' real average income
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:14.820]   "had declined steadily over the last 10 years
[01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:17.860]   "and is now at the level of 20 years ago.
[01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:21.000]   "Mountains of garbage pile up on all sides.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.680]   "Night and day, legions of beggars, car washers,
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:29.100]   "and scavengers besiege passers-by asking for money.
[01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:31.840]   "The mentally ill swarm naked in the streets,
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:33.580]   "stinking of urine.
[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:35.880]   "Children, single mothers, and cripples
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:38.460]   "beg for alms on every corner.
[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:40.880]   "The traditional centralism of our society
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:43.660]   "has proved clearly incapable of satisfying
[01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:46.740]   "the manifold needs of a country in transition."
[01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:50.380]   De Soto described the abandonment
[01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:53.160]   of the grotesque legal economy for the black market
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:56.280]   that was underway before Fujimori padlocked the Congress
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:00.160]   as, quote, "an invisible revolution."
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:03.780]   We are positive about the benefits of the free market,
[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:06.640]   but much less positive about the promise of a society
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:11.120]   in which the law is as degraded as the money.
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:15.860]   The world that De Soto described in Peru prior to 1993
[01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:18.520]   was a clockwork orange world
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.360]   where overly centralized
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:23.060]   and dysfunctional government institutions
[01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:26.620]   were literally destroying the civil society.
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:29.840]   This is what Fujimori set out to change.
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.720]   He had slashed inflation
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.000]   by turning off the printing presses.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.920]   He had also managed to fire 50,000 government employees
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:40.320]   and trim some subsidies.
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:43.760]   He had made a start toward balancing the budget.
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:46.960]   His program of reform included comprehensive plans
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:50.400]   to create free markets and privatize industry.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:53.000]   But as in the former Soviet Union,
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.840]   most of the important elements of Fujimori's reform
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:58.600]   were yet to be adopted in 1993,
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:02.220]   including the first round of large-scale privatization
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:05.960]   of state banks, mining companies, and utilities.
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:08.680]   Instead of enacting these necessary proposals,
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:11.460]   Peru's Congress, like the Russian Congress
[01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:14.320]   that challenged Yeltsin's reforms in Moscow,
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:16.320]   sought to move backwards.
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:20.080]   Their plan, restore subsidies from an empty treasury,
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:24.360]   pad the payroll, and protect any and all vested interests,
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:26.800]   especially the bureaucracy.
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:29.000]   Exactly what you would expect of a government
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.360]   controlled by its employees.
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.680]   Fujimori claimed that the Congress of Peru
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:35.720]   was dithering and corrupt,
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:38.200]   a fact with which almost everyone agreed.
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.400]   He further claimed that congressional dithering
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:42.080]   and corruption made it impossible
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:45.100]   to reform Peru's collapsing economy
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:48.600]   or combat a violence assault by narco-terrorists
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:52.740]   and nihilistic sendero luminoso, shining path, guerrillas.
[01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:56.280]   The 70% solution.
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:59.480]   So Fujimori closed the Congress,
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:01.520]   an act that might have indicated
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:04.200]   that he was as authoritarian
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:07.180]   as many earlier Latin American leaders.
[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:09.700]   But we thought, and said so at the time,
[01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:12.520]   that Fujimori had correctly identified
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:15.120]   a fundamental impediment to reform.
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:18.720]   The extravagant official elegies for the Peruvian Congress
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:20.520]   by American editorial writers
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:22.440]   and officials of the State Department
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:25.080]   were not shared by the people of Peru.
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.720]   While North Americans carried on
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:29.200]   as if Peru's Congress were the incarnation
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:33.560]   of freedom and civilization, the Peruvian people cheered.
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:37.000]   President Fujimori's popularity shot up above 70%
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.840]   when he sent the Congress home,
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:42.620]   and he was later reelected to a second term in a landslide.
[01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:45.280]   Most citizens apparently saw their legislature
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:48.440]   more as an obstacle to their well-being
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:51.380]   than as an expression of their rights.
[01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:56.380]   In 1994, real economic growth in Peru reached 12.9%,
[01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:58.280]   the highest on the planet.
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:01.780]   Deflation of political promises.
[01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:05.560]   We saw Peru's turmoil less as a throwback
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:07.700]   to the dictatorships of the past
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:12.420]   than as an early installment of a broader transition crisis.
[01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:15.520]   You can expect to see crises of misgovernment
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:18.480]   in many countries as political promises are deflated
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:20.500]   and governments run out of credit.
[01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:23.460]   Ultimately, new institutional forms will have to emerge
[01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:25.140]   that are capable of preserving freedom
[01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:27.220]   in the new technological conditions,
[01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:29.500]   while at the same time giving expression and life
[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:32.860]   to the common interests that all citizens share.
[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:35.600]   Few have begun to think about the incompatibility
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:39.580]   between some of the institutions of industrial government
[01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:43.740]   and the megapolitics of post-industrial society.
[01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:44.980]   Whether these contradictions
[01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:48.480]   are explicitly acknowledged or not, however,
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:51.780]   their consequences will become increasingly obvious
[01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:55.700]   as examples of political failures compound around the world.
[01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:57.120]   Institutions of government
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.100]   that emerged in the modern period
[01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:00.980]   reflect the megapolitical conditions
[01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:03.400]   of one or more centuries ago.
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:05.960]   The information age will require new mechanisms
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:08.860]   of representation to avoid chronic dysfunction
[01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:11.220]   and even social collapse.
[01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:13.460]   When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989,
[01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:16.100]   it not only signaled the end of the Cold War,
[01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:18.700]   it was also the outer sign of a silent earthquake
[01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:21.480]   in the foundations of power in the world.
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:24.280]   It was the end of the long period
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:27.120]   of rising returns to violence.
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:31.040]   The fall of communism, which we forecast in 1987
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:32.960]   in "Blood in the Streets,"
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:35.340]   and even earlier in our monthly newsletter,
[01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:37.000]   "Strategic Investment,"
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.980]   was not merely the repudiation of an ideology.
[01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:43.240]   It was the outward marker of the most important development
[01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:46.760]   in the history of violence over the past five centuries.
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:49.480]   If our analysis is correct,
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:53.100]   the organization of society is bound to change,
[01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:55.580]   to reflect growing diseconomies of scale
[01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:57.660]   in the employment of violence.
[01:18:57.660 --> 01:19:00.840]   The boundaries within which the future must lie
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:01.980]   have been redrawn.
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:07.940]   Chapter that I have just read you is chapter five
[01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:10.940]   called "The Life and Death of the Nation-State"
[01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:14.260]   from a book titled "The Sovereign Individual,
[01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:17.120]   "Mastering the Transition to the Information Age,"
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:20.800]   by James Dale Davidson and Lord William Rees-Mogg.
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:22.680]   Lord William Rees-Mogg is now deceased.
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:26.120]   James Dale Davidson is not particularly prominent,
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:30.080]   but their book was, at the time,
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:32.940]   considered to be pretty crackpot-ish.
[01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:37.940]   It was revived quite a bit in the 2000s
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:41.660]   by a lot of the tech wonks.
[01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:45.860]   Peter Thiel, among others, has been quite a fan,
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:48.900]   and the Bitcoiners have broadly pushed it
[01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:53.900]   as being enormously influential and farsighted.
[01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:56.460]   I always find it interesting to read books
[01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:57.940]   25 years after they're published,
[01:19:57.940 --> 01:20:00.700]   'cause you can get some sense of what they've gotten right,
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:03.280]   what they've gotten wrong, and adapt from there,
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:05.060]   and you can think about the predictive power
[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:06.200]   of their model.
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:07.580]   If this chapter's been interesting to you,
[01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:08.700]   I hope you'll pick up a copy.
[01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:09.700]   The next chapter is called
[01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:12.200]   "The Megapolitics of the Information Age."
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:14.940]   There are other chapters, "Transcending Locality,"
[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:17.180]   "The Emergence of the Cyber Economy."
[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:20.720]   I would go on and talk about nationalism and reaction
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:23.980]   and the new Luddites, many other elements to the book,
[01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:25.140]   but I hope you'll pick it up.
[01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:28.820]   It's available on audio as well as digital copies
[01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:30.460]   and physical copies, of course.
[01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:31.700]   And I hope that you'll think about
[01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:35.660]   what you might see reflected in our society today.
[01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:37.620]   Look around at the world and ask yourself,
[01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:40.300]   how well has this analysis held up?
[01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:43.260]   Think about countries all around the world.
[01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:44.700]   Obviously, most of my audience
[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:46.540]   is from the United States of America.
[01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:48.820]   We are having our own challenges and issues,
[01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:51.300]   but somewhat insulated from a lot of these things.
[01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:52.140]   Around the world, though,
[01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:54.200]   you can see the impacts a little bit more clearly,
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:57.000]   and you can certainly trace a lot of influence
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.540]   in the United States as well.
[01:20:58.540 --> 01:21:00.120]   I hope that you'll pick up a copy of the book.
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:01.680]   I personally believe that we are living
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:03.260]   in a hinge of history.
[01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:05.220]   I have a hard time predicting the future,
[01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:07.100]   but I certainly want to understand the past
[01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:09.660]   more keenly today than I ever did before.
[01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:10.860]   So check out the book,
[01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:12.820]   and I look forward to continuing our conversation
[01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:13.820]   on it in the future.
[01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:20.880]   - Is your California dream feeling more and more distant?
[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:23.660]   You've got countless apps and influencers
[01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:25.800]   telling you how to do it their way,
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:29.060]   and your expert aunt who might be giving
[01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:30.940]   a bit too much advice.
[01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:35.980]   Tips, hacks, and experts are everywhere these days,
[01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:37.780]   but when it comes to real estate,
[01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:41.580]   the question to ask is, who's your realtor?
[01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:44.620]   Because a California realtor is the only person
[01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:47.000]   who can bring your dream home.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.940]   Someone who gets that buying a home
[01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:51.700]   is one of the most complicated and stressful things
[01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:55.180]   you can do, but can still make it possible on your budget.
[01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:57.180]   A California realtor can read
[01:21:57.180 --> 01:21:59.240]   the constantly shifting market,
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:01.860]   and they're out in front for all of the tough stuff.
[01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:04.540]   So you can get to the good stuff.
[01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:06.180]   So who's your realtor?
[01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:09.720]   Because no one cares more about helping Californians
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:13.560]   live the California dream than California realtors.
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:16.320]   (trombone music)
