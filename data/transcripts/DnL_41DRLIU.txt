[00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.400]   every time you hear about another airline award chart disappearing or hotel program devaluation
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.920]   you might wonder is the points game even worth it anymore so today i'm going to break down exactly
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.200]   why i still believe we are living in the golden age of credit card points and miles i'm going to
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.840]   walk through the different types of points and how to calculate what they're really worth including
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.880]   the biggest mistakes that most people make when doing that math we'll look at where the value is
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.240]   what to avoid and whether you'd actually be better off earning cash back and for some of you i think
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.440]   you might be whether you're just getting started or deep in this game this is everything you need to
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.320]   know to fine-tune how you're playing the points game and whether it's actually going to be worth it for
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.080]   you i'm chris hutchins and if you enjoy this episode and want to keep upgrading your life money and travel

[00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.320]   playing this game given all the times we keep hearing about devaluations and they're not wrong
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.840]   right i feel like most of the news we hear is oh this hotel chain moved their categories up this
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.760]   airline devalued their points it's not always the case sometimes you see jetblue just recently added
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.640]   condor as a way to redeem your points and they recently added japan airline so jetblue points might
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:24.000]   be more valuable and mesa which is a new homeowner's card added some transfer partners like sas which is a
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.040]   airline that we couldn't transfer to from any other currency so things do sometimes sound like they're
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.360]   getting better but most of the news is that points are getting devalued however i want to go back in
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.520]   time to explain why i still think that we're in the golden age of points and miles and i look back at
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.000]   this card that used to be kind of one of the greatest cards the starwood amex card it was the favorite of
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.400]   most management consultants and people who traveled and it was an amazing card at the time and it earned
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:01.440]   one starwood point i believe it had a 25 or 30 000 point welcome bonus when it happened and the really
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.360]   cool thing about this card was you could earn starwood points but starwood points could transfer to airline
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:14.240]   miles and you could transfer 20 000 points to 25 000 airline miles because they added a bonus every 20 000
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.480]   points you transferred so if you did it at those intervals it was effectively a 1.25x on everything
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.920]   card it was amazing now we have 2x on everything cards so you can earn points way faster now i looked
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.080]   back at the original chase sapphire preferred launch it didn't even have 2x categories other than booking in
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.160]   the chase travel portal a couple years later in 2011 they added 2x on travel and then the next year they
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.720]   added 2x on dining it was revolutionary oh my gosh you could earn 2x on travel and dining it was amazing
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:54.320]   now we have cards that earn 5x on flights 4x on hotels 4x on dining things have just gotten so much
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.840]   better in the last 15 to 20 years when it comes to how much you can earn but also if you want to look
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:07.280]   back at what signup bonuses were i looked back and in the early 2000s people wrote articles about 10 20 30 40
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:15.440]   000 point welcome bonuses that was news i've had multiple 200 000 point signup bonuses and some even
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.680]   greater than that it's not even crazy to pass up a hundred thousand point signup bonus right now because
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.560]   they seem to happen so frequently when 10 15 years ago they were unheard of so are miles and points worth
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:36.160]   less now than they were 10 years ago they absolutely are but can you earn them at a way faster rate also yes
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:43.280]   in fact i would wager to say that the average dollar value of a welcome bonus the effective value and the
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.960]   effective return on your spend in terms of what are you getting in terms of points back relative to their
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.240]   value i think both of those have gone up in the past 20 years and it's why i still think that this
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.960]   is the golden age of credit card points and miles and what you can earn and so i am really excited to be
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.000]   diving into the actual value of those points because i think that there's a lot of value to be had here
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.840]   but it's important to know that not all points are the same so as i run through this episode i'm going
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.640]   to highlight the four different types of points so we know what we're talking about the first two are
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.240]   probably the ones almost everyone's familiar with airline and hotel points now one thing to keep in mind
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.360]   airline and hotel points usually aren't very portable hotel points you can usually transfer to other
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.800]   people but airline points i don't think you can in any program some of them do have points pooling so
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.840]   you can kind of book together with a friend and combine those points but most of them do let you
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.440]   book flights for other people so yes you might not be able to transfer your united or delta points to
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.240]   your family members or friends but you could book travel for them so keep that in mind they're not as
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.360]   portable now the third type of point is transferable points and these are my favorite these are the
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.000]   points you get from city capital one amex chase built wells fargo mesa brax us bank supposedly later
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.040]   this year tbd how valuable that will be and the reason i love them is because you just get so many
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:11.600]   options you can transfer those points to airlines and hotel groups you can use them in their travel portal
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.560]   effectively more like cashback some of those programs let you just take it as a statement credit
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.320]   and so there's just so much more flexibility with transferable points that i value them much higher
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.800]   than airline and hotel points it's a little bit strange because at the end of the day i usually use
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.880]   them to transfer to airline and hotel groups so you would argue why would they be worth more if i valued
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:39.440]   a hyatt point at 1.7 cents and i use my chase points for hyatt points by transferring how could my chase
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.520]   points be worth more but you could also ask me would i pay more for a point that could be an airline
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.480]   point at 10 different airlines or five different hotel groups than i would for an individual airline
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.440]   or hotel group and the answer is yes because you don't know where that availability is going to be
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.600]   the trip you want to take to europe or the trip you want to take to asia might be on one carrier that
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.800]   if you only accumulated delta miles you might never be able to book so having transferable points i think is
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:13.040]   way more valuable but also they have transfer bonuses so i went back and i looked historically
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:19.840]   on average amex wins here with 17 transfer bonuses a year on average and i'm looking at kind of year to
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:25.760]   date 2025 and 2024 and what that means is 17 different times throughout the year amex would give you anywhere
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:32.160]   from probably 10 to 30 percent more points when you move them to another airline or hotel group sometimes
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.720]   for hotel groups actually that amount was as much as 50 or even 100 transfer bonuses but for the most part
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:44.960]   with the airline groups that bonus is right around 24 to 27 percent i actually ran all the numbers for
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:52.880]   all of them historically so on airlines 21 to 27 percent on hotels 29 to 65 percent with one exception and
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.640]   that's built now built has had less transfer bonuses over the last few years in total since the beginning of
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:06.560]   2024 it's been 14 but if you have built status those transfer bonuses which always occur on the first of
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:14.720]   the month end up being as high as 100 or i think in some cases 175 percent on hotels that means that if
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.720]   you transfer a hundred thousand points to air canada aero plan there have been days where if you had the
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.920]   highest built status you would have 200 000 aero plan points so one of the reasons i think built points
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:31.360]   are worth more than all other points is that they've had these really lucrative transfer bonuses and even
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:38.400]   if you had the lowest tier of status within built it might only be 125 percent bonus or a 25 bonus where
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:44.400]   you'd get 125 of the points but that's still a meaningfully great bonus obviously if you can spend
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:50.160]   your way to platinum status and you get 100 transfer bonus that's even better so those transfer bonuses
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.680]   also give a little bit of a boost to the value of those transferable points so i love transferable
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.520]   points they're my favorite they're the things i'll talk about the most and then the last type of points
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:05.040]   is what i'll call fake points and they're with programs that might call what you earn points so in
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.920]   the case of bank of america you earn points but you can't really use those points for anything other than
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:16.000]   either booking travel or cashing out as a statement credit or just depositing into a bank account so if
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.080]   you can't transfer those points to airlines and if you can't use those points in an airline or hotel
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.920]   program i'm going to call them fake points i'm not even going to talk about them today i want to be
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.480]   clear that some programs call what you earn points even though you can't really do anything with them
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:33.600]   other than what you could do if they were also earned as cashback so that's the different types of
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.400]   points why is it important to know what they're worth why are we doing this episode today
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:43.520]   and i think there's really two reasons one is so you can compare points amongst themselves
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.240]   that might help you decide which card to open you might see a hundred thousand point sign up bonus for
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.120]   one card and a two hundred thousand point sign up bonus for another card but in the case of hotel
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:59.200]   points if those were hilton choice or ihg points you might not want two hundred thousand of them if you
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.520]   could otherwise have a hundred thousand transferable points and so it's helpful to compare the value of
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:10.080]   points to know which cards to open or which cards to use right some cards especially hotel cards might
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.880]   look like they earn a ton oh i can get 3x on everything with a hilton card but if those hilton
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:20.400]   points are only worth half a cent i'd much rather be earning 2x capital one points with a venture card
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.360]   because i think that's a better earning rate so that's something to keep in mind and then also i think the most important
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:31.920]   most important thing is to decide if this whole game makes sense if we compare earning points to earning
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.560]   cash back and by the way when i say points some programs call them miles we're going to bucket all
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.920]   of those in the same bucket if you compare them to earning cash back you can know if you're actually
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.800]   getting the value so if your points are worth two cents and you have a card that earns 2x points on
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.520]   everything then you're effectively earning four percent so if your best cash back alternative is
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.840]   a two percent card or even a three percent card you'd be way better off with points but if you go
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.920]   through the exercise we'll go through today and you decide that your points are really only worth one
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:05.760]   cent and you have a three percent cash back card well that 2x card is effectively earning you two percent
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.760]   and a three percent cash back card is earning you three percent you would be way better off earning
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.640]   cash back and paying to book all of your travel that said if you're comparing your points to your cash
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:20.000]   back and it's to tie or it's even close i'd always give the edge to cash back because you're not locked
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.080]   into anything right if you earn points and you decide later oh i'm not sure i do value them as
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:29.200]   much as i thought well you have them they're pretty hard to convert to cash in any way that's at least
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:34.720]   legal or by the terms and conditions of most of the programs but with cash back it's cash you can invest
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.760]   it you can earn a return on it you can do all kinds of things so if it's tie if it's close i would always
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:45.920]   err on the side of cash back this episode is brought to you by gelt when it comes to building wealth

[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:33.120]   going to throw a lot at you in this episode and i'm going to do my best to recap and summarize things
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:38.160]   as we go and end with really strong takeaways so that everything makes sense and so here's how we're
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.640]   going to walk through this episode i'll start with some reasonable floor value for points so you understand
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:47.600]   kind of what's the base then we'll look at what most of the experts in this field say how do they value
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:52.560]   points but then we're actually going to dig into the data itself to see how that might change things and
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.640]   it's actually really interesting now i think we have access to data that can give us a better
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.560]   understanding of the value of points and who might get more or less value than other people
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:05.520]   then i'm going to talk about how you kind of need to personalize all this to your particular situation
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:10.080]   i'll talk about how to do that and what kinds of things might change those values and then we'll look
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.960]   at why there might need to be a ceiling or a cap on the value we give points because you can buy these
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:21.280]   points and so if the alternative of accumulating them is accumulating cash back and then buying them
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:26.000]   really we could set a ceiling on their value as to what we could buy them for i'll share where i net
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.880]   out on points and what i think the values are and finally i'm going to walk through all of my learnings
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.600]   looking at the best cashback cards and the best points cards to see if there's actually an easier
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:41.360]   way to approach this question and i think there might be so like i said we'll start with what are the
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:46.720]   floor value of these points if they're transferable points one of the great reasons that i love
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:51.600]   transferable points especially for people who are new to this is that you can often use transferable
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:58.000]   points in the travel portal of the program so if you log into amx you can go book flights or hotels
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.560]   with amx travel now you might only get one cent per point and you might by the end of this episode
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:08.480]   think that's not a lot but when you compare cashback cards to points cards if you guarantee yourself at
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:14.800]   least getting one cent on the points card it's an amazing hedge for not being able to get all the value
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:20.080]   you think booking flights and booking travel some of these programs even let you take statement credits
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:25.200]   so if you're able to take a statement credit for one cent then the floor value of points really should
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:30.240]   be somewhere around one cent because if you could book flights any flight you want in the portal or
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:35.440]   hotels or you could take a statement credit that one cent value is kind of the floor now if you have
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:41.840]   airline and hotel points you usually don't have as many options of how you cash them out however most
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:47.440]   airlines and hotels have two tiers of pricing they have their what i'll call saver pricing or
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:52.480]   standard award pricing which is where you really get outsized value but a lot of programs now have
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:59.120]   moved to this dynamic version of pricing where take united american alaska delta southwest there is some
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:05.360]   value where you can book any flight and that value tends to be around at least one cent so if you just
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:10.000]   need to book a flight on united and there's no saver availability there's no special deals you can still book
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.040]   that flight with your united miles and you'll usually get at least a cent of value so for me i think the
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:20.960]   floor value for transferable points for airline miles is usually around one cent for hotels it's a little
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:26.880]   tricky for reasons i'll explain but their values kind of widely change depending on the program and some
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:32.480]   of them don't have the ability to use them as easily if there aren't those standard awards i've often looked at the
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:40.480]   hilton calendar and seen oh this night it's 120 000 points and this next night it's 975 000 points so it
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:45.280]   can be a little crazy looking at that so i don't have a perfect floor for hotel points but i'm not sure we
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.760]   need one i just thought that was a good place to start now the easiest place to say how much are my
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:54.560]   points worth is to just look at what most of the experts are saying and you can decide whether you want
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:59.920]   to trust their valuations so i'm pulling up this article from the points guy every month they update
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:05.040]   it we're looking at their august 2025 valuations and they say hey what are credit card points and miles
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:11.520]   worth amex membership rewards two cents capital one 1.85 cents then they go down and say what are airline
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:17.120]   points of miles worth and they go through every airline and they give a value like delta sky miles 1.2
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:22.720]   cents they actually clarify that they recently increased this you go down in jet blue 1.45 cents and you can go
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:27.760]   down and see what they value these points are there are a few different people that do it a blog i really
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:32.560]   like one mile at a time does it as well i think they're a little bit more conservative with their point
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:39.200]   values and so here i'm seeing all the transferable points from them are 1.7 cents most of the airlines
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:45.840]   they value at 1.1 to it looks like about 1.5 cents and then on the hotels it's kind of across the board mostly
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:51.920]   because hyatt points and accord points are more valuable than all the others so if you look at all hotel
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:57.600]   points excluding those it's almost always in the 0.3 to 0.7 cents but hyatt points here are one and a
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:03.280]   half cents and accor points are actually at two cents but the devaluation of the us dollar has actually
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:09.200]   made them a little more valuable because accor points are fixed at two euro cents which is now worth about
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:14.320]   i think about 2.3 cents so you could look at the experts and just say what do they think now one of the
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:21.280]   things that's tricky about doing this is that most of these experts are basing it on the type of value that
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:26.400]   they think their readers and they themselves can get so if i look at the points guy valuation they're
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:32.880]   putting built points at 2.2 cents that is true if you take advantage of these transfer bonuses and you
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.280]   know what you're doing and you book flights in the way that a lot of these readers and a lot of the
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:43.520]   people writing these posts do frequent miler which is another blog that i love has a different approach
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:48.240]   they do what's called reasonable redemption values and they say they're looking at midpoint values that
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:54.000]   they think are reasonably easy to achieve so this is another approach and if you're not an expert in
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.480]   the industry and you don't know what you're doing yet this might be a better place to start they're
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:04.960]   going to value most transferable points at 1.3 to 1.55 cents lower than the other two by a pretty big
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:09.840]   margin but because they're saying this is what it's going to be worth if we make it easy if you want to
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:14.480]   get advanced obviously those can go up and so their reasonable redemption values i think are lower than the
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:19.440]   value i might get from points they bring an approach that i think is super helpful especially for people
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:25.120]   early in this but at the end of the day i prefer looking at the data and we have a few excellent
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:31.440]   sources for this so on the flight side there is a tool called points path and i don't have the data
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:36.480]   pulled up but just so people who aren't familiar if you're watching on video which by the way i think
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:41.920]   this episode and the previous episode will now be on video not just on youtube but on spotify i'm looking at
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:46.480]   google flights and what points path does when you search for google flights is they just go out and
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:51.520]   look at the points needed from that program and compare it so i'm looking here and it says oh from
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:20:00.160]   san francisco to jfk there's a jet blue flight it's 31 400 points plus 11 or 462 dollars now every time
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:06.160]   they do that math they save that data point and they have tons and tons of data now you can't access the
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:11.680]   data directly on your own but if you do go to the frequent miler website they've started using that
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:16.080]   data and they've reported on it and they've shared a bunch of it back so as an example if we look at
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:21.760]   some of this points path data i'm looking here for air canada they report a average value and a median
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:26.080]   value and so they're actually quite different and that's because a lot of the flights on the high end
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.920]   skew this data sometimes you'll find a last minute flight that might be a thousand dollars and it's a
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:34.080]   great deal with points but that doesn't mean that's the value you should expect and so there's
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:39.680]   medium values average values but the interesting thing is that they break out economy versus business
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.920]   and then they also break out domestic versus international now another source for this data
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:48.000]   which does a similar breakout is award wallet and award wallet is a tool that you can link a lot of
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.600]   your airline hotel and bank programs to they track the balances of all those programs i will say
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:59.440]   it's not quite as simple as it sounds the refreshing often needs you to have a browser extension installed
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.200]   or sync your email but for every one of their members that books a flight they see that in their
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:09.600]   email they go into a search using i think skyscanner and kiwi to find the cheapest tickets that meet a
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:16.240]   criteria that they've set which is same class of service same calendar day and no more than 20 percent
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:20.160]   longer in terms of travel time so they're going to go price these itineraries and then compare
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:25.440]   them to the number of points that the individual award wallet member used so if you look at the
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:30.240]   points path data it's based on all the flights out there whether someone actually ever booked it or not
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:35.200]   so it includes really bad redemptions that people might never do if you look at the award wallet data
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:40.320]   it's only the redemptions that people do and so you'll see that their average values are a lot higher
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:47.520]   so for example air canada aeroplan points the average value someone has gotten from award wallet is 1.85
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:53.600]   cents whereas the medium combined value of aeroplan points from points path is 1.18 cents so that's a
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:59.600]   pretty wide difference but i think where it gets more interesting is if you start to look at the value
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:06.160]   for domestic versus international economy versus business class so if i look at this for air canada
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:10.880]   for a domestic u.s flight and keep in mind for people thinking well air canada is not in the u.s
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:17.200]   this is people using the air canada program to book domestic u.s flights most likely those flights
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:23.120]   are on united so the median value for an economy domestic ticket is 1.2 cents whereas the median
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:29.520]   value for a domestic business ticket is 2.1 cents similarly on international the median value for an
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:36.080]   economy ticket is 1.08 cents and the median value for business is 1.53 cents and the median value for first
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:42.160]   class is 2.26 cents those averages are even higher so the average value of an international first class
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:47.840]   ticket is 3.67 cents now this is the points path data this is just all the flights that are seen
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:52.800]   if you actually look at what people are booking at least people who use award wallet i'll take air canada
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:57.200]   again but then i'll talk a little bit about alaska because it's just clear to see why alaska points are
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:03.920]   so valuable the average point value for a regional economy flight is 1.21 cents and then for a regional
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:11.200]   first class it goes up to 2.56 cents and then if you look at long haul business or first class 2.63 cents
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:16.640]   so the big takeaway here is that if you're using your miles for short domestic economy flights
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:23.920]   you're going to get less value for per mile than you are using your miles for long haul first or business
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:29.040]   class tickets now if you're doing international or you're doing business class domestic those are
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:34.560]   still more elevated values than domestic economy but the biggest bang for your buck is on long haul
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:39.280]   business this is probably not a surprise to most people listening if you scroll through all of the
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:48.320]   award wallet long haul business class valuations for different programs it's like 4.17 cents 2.39 cents 3.19
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:57.760]   3.92 3.28 almost all of them are one and a half to as high as 5.86 cents that's really high i'm not
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:03.680]   suggesting that everyone should value their points at 3 to 5 cents i'm just saying if you're using your
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:09.520]   points for international business class that's effectively what that value has been shown to be
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:15.200]   so if i'm looking at united i'm seeing united's points path data says that the medium value of economy
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:20.880]   is 1.09 cents but the median value of business class is 1.46 cents and these are tons of data
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:27.280]   points the total number of data points for united that this data is based off is 4.8 million flights
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:31.520]   so there's a lot of stuff going on here but there are two big takeaways for me so one is that huge
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:37.440]   difference you get between domestic and international economy versus business the other big takeaway is that
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:43.280]   some programs have a really wide band of potential point values and others don't at all and that's really
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:49.280]   notable when you're comparing the award wallet values to the points path values if you figure points path
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:55.200]   is everything award wallet is what the experts get and you compare those two you look at something like
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:02.960]   alaska where the experts are getting 2.12 cents and the kind of general data is getting 1.46 cents
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:07.120]   now these are just averages this is not looking at business or economy i took the average numbers
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:13.280]   but then you go down and you look at jet blue and you say wow all jet blue flights the average value is
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:18.880]   1.21 cents the experts the people using award wallet the people like me the average value they're getting
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:25.280]   from jet blue is 1.24 cents and that's because there are a handful of airlines delta southwest jet blue
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:30.320]   where it's just really hard to get outsized value now in the case of jet blue and southwest they're
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:36.160]   mostly a fixed value point it does change dynamically a little bit but i haven't heard of a lot of
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:42.320]   situations where someone booking a flight on jet blue or on southwest or usually on delta has gotten
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:48.160]   two three four five cents with jet blue adding a few transfer partners internationally maybe that's possible
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:54.000]   every now and then you might be wildly lucky and get an international partner booking from delta in
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.480]   business class that's greater than that but looking at delta here the average value that a award wallet
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:07.440]   user is getting is 1.34 cents so yes that's more than the 1.14 cents that most people are getting on
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:13.760]   points path which is just all the flights but honestly that value might come from the fact that i would
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:19.440]   guess most award wallet members have a delta american express card which gets you a 15 discount on your
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:25.440]   delta bookings and that might make up for that delta so when you look at the flight data the big takeaway
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:31.200]   is business class and international flights are going to get you more value and certain programs like
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:37.920]   delta jet blue southwest are going to get you less value or at least less upside in value they might get
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:43.440]   you more consistent value but on the upside it's not going to be there and honestly if my choice was only
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:48.640]   earning points in those programs or cash back i'd probably go for cash back the reason i like points
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:54.160]   is because of the outsized value i can get from all those other programs on the hotel side award wallet
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:59.840]   does actually do the same thing for hotels so we can get the data that they show for hotels there isn't
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:06.800]   the same breakout of what do you get from international versus domestic suites versus not so they just have
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:13.200]   their average value this episode is brought to you by masterclass if i'm trying to rewrite something or do

[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:33.840]   that's all the hacks dot com slash built b-i-l-t make sure to use our url so they know we sent you
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:38.560]   the next tool i want to introduce is called gondola and they have amazing data for hotels and they do
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:43.200]   that because they have this website that allows you to search and compare cash and points booking rates for
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:48.560]   hotels the site's totally free to use they even track your points on hotel side but they also let
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:53.920]   you complete the points bookings on their site which is really cool so instead of using an award search
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:58.480]   tool finding a hotel booking and then going to the hotel website to book it you could do it all on their
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:03.600]   site so definitely check that out there is a referral link if you use someone's referral you get a free
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:08.400]   50 after your first booking mine is at all the hacks dot com slash gondola so if you're going to sign up
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:13.200]   definitely use someone's referral code and every time they see a hotel they cache all of the data and
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:18.640]   they store it and then they let people like me analyze that data and share it with you guys and if i have
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:23.840]   one qualm with the site it's that sometimes on the search results page they will show cash data and then
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:28.720]   when you actually click into the hotel they live refresh it and that points booking might not still be
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.960]   available or the rate might have changed doesn't happen all the time but i understand why they do
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:37.840]   it because it's just too many things to refresh at once so it's a quicker site than some other ones
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:42.800]   because it's getting you all that data right out front but you need to click into the individual hotel
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:47.760]   to refresh the data to make sure that rates there but when it comes to looking at the redemption values
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:53.040]   they have a tool that they've given me to look at so i can see what is the distribution of redemption
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:59.680]   values for hyatt and so here i'm seeing on hyatt 730 000 different options across 1700 properties
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:05.280]   23 brands and they show you the distribution the percentile distribution and they say median value of
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:11.120]   hyatt points is 1.65 cents per point now this is why i love hyatt points they're so much more valuable
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:16.560]   than all other hotel points and they transfer one-to-one from chase it's awesome they also say at the 75th
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:23.680]   percentile you get 2.15 cents per point and at the 90th percentile it's 2.81 cents per point they let
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:28.320]   you go further and say hey because most points bookings are refundable what if we only compare
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:36.080]   to refundable rates and then because one of the hyatt chains mr and mrs smith is just a fixed rate
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:42.080]   redemption there's not a lot of outsized value you can say hey show me only hyatt excluding mr and mrs smith
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:47.840]   now the medium value goes up to 1.89 cents per point when you're looking at refundable bookings
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:54.560]   that aren't mr and mrs smith the 75th percentile goes up to 2.46 cents per point and the 90th percentile
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:32:00.320]   goes up to 3.25 cents per point tldr hyatt points are worth a lot relative to airline points they're
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:06.640]   kind of comparable or even better the tricky thing with hotels is that hotel points are across the board
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:13.040]   if i look quickly at award wallet and the value that most of their members have gotten choice points
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:22.000]   hilton points at about 0.6 cents ihg 0.68 marriott 0.93 so they're kind of around all across the board
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:28.240]   if i look at the data from gondola i think the interesting thing is you can see a couple takeaways
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:36.960]   one if i look at hilton the median value is 0.39 cents however the 75th percentile goes up to 0.46
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:42.720]   and the 90th percentile goes up to 0.57 so if you cherry pick the best redemptions you can get more
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:48.080]   value i think we all know that if you compare it to refundable rates the values go up a little bit but
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:54.320]   you know maybe 10 percent ish but if you look at particular properties and chains you see more
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:33:00.160]   value so with hilton at the 75th percentile points are worth 0.46 cents but if you look at the conrad
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:06.480]   it's 0.56 cents if you look at lxr it's 0.88 cents and if you look at the waldorf it's 0.65 cents so you
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:10.560]   don't need to remember all these numbers so i'm sorry for throwing them all at you but the takeaway
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:16.080]   is at certain chains within the hotel groups you can get more value this is similar to the airline
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:20.480]   example of getting more value from business class if you're booking luxury chains like conrad
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:28.400]   waldorf park hyatt st regis ritz carlton kimpton six senses in those respective chains you find that
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:33.040]   the value of those points are worth more so i think the big two takeaways here from looking at the data
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:38.080]   they apply to hotels and airlines the more premium booking you're doing whether it's premium properties
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:44.160]   premium cabins you get more value and if you compare what the experts are getting from their points
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:51.040]   to what the data shows the average price per point is it's just significantly higher i'll use hilton
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:57.280]   as a great example the median value for all bookings from the gondola data is 0.39 cents
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:03.440]   but if you look at what award wallet users are getting at hilton it's 0.59 cents now those point
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:10.720]   values may seem smaller but keep in mind that earning 0.59 cents instead of 0.39 cents is 50 percent more value
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:15.440]   so again the more you understand how to do this the more you're picking the best redemptions and not
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:19.600]   picking the worst ones the more value you're going to get now if you hear me talking about hotel points
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:24.160]   and you think wow if they're worth so much less than airline points or transferable points why would i want
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:29.760]   them keep in mind two things one oftentimes when you're using a credit card or staying at a hotel you're
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:34.880]   just earning way more points with top tier status at hilton and the top to your credit card i think
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:40.560]   you're earning 34 hilton points per dollar also keep in mind that if you're transferring those points
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:46.640]   from bank programs the transfer ratios are often not just one to one so if you go from amex to hilton
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:52.640]   you're going one amex point to two hilton points if you're going from city to choice privileges you're going
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:59.360]   one to two and so it's not always just a straight one to one transfer that said sometimes it is and
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:04.080]   that's why i never use those points as transfer partners from those programs so if you're transferring
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:08.800]   from chase to marriott you're getting one to one and those merit points are worth a lot less than
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:13.280]   airline points which is why i'm never doing those transfers so keep that in mind so now that we've
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:17.520]   looked at what experts say we've looked at what the data says i'm just going to do a quick kind of min
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:22.640]   max on the values here if i look at airlines and i look at the points path data i look at all the
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:30.320]   experts the minimum value that anyone assigns to airline points is 1.1 cents and the maximum is 1.55
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:37.040]   now award wallet members might be earning a lot more than that but valuation wise that's kind of the
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:43.360]   range 1.1 to 1.55 cents if you're using premium cabins if you're doing what award wallet users say
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:47.360]   then i think it's a little bit different award wallet the minimum is 1.24 and the
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:55.040]   maximum is 3.65 cents so that's something to keep in mind as well on the hotel side generally all of
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:03.920]   those hotel points except for hyatt are in the 0.5 to 0.75 range and then hyatt is in the 1.5 to 1.7 range
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:10.000]   there are other hotel chains preferred leading hotels of the world a core at windham i did not include
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:17.200]   those in this analysis most of them are a bit more fixed rate values so it's not as interesting to think
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:21.600]   about their value and they have a limited number of places you can transfer to but just having
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:27.440]   valuations from data or experts is not really enough because if you're not staying in those luxury hotels
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:32.640]   or flying premium cabins then the values you get might be totally different so the real best answer
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:38.240]   here is to look at your own personal value and on a walk through how to calculate that unfortunately you
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:44.240]   probably don't have a history of every redemption you've done and what the going rates were at the time
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:49.200]   in the past so it's a little bit hard to go back in time but the next time you're planning a trip i'd
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:53.280]   encourage you to go through this process so you can get a sense and if you want right now you could
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:59.520]   even go and plan a hypothetical trip just to see what kind of values you're getting but as i did this
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:04.640]   i realized there's some things that i think most people out there are missing so let's start with just
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:10.640]   a simple example there's a 150 flight it costs 10 000 points and you might say great if i were to book
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:17.280]   that i would get 1.5 cents per point so my point should be worth 1.5 cents right it's not that easy
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:22.720]   so first off there are taxes and fees domestically those taxes and fees are usually five dollars and
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:28.480]   sixty cents so it's a little bit negligible so in that previous example i would just subtract 5.60
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:34.160]   from the cost of the flight which would make the cents per point 1.44 cents per point however
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:38.960]   internationally especially on premium cabins those taxes and fees could be 50 and they could be a
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:44.400]   thousand dollars so i think of this just like an equation you've got the price of the flight equals
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:50.640]   the number of points plus the taxes and fees subtract the taxes and fees from both divide and you get
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:55.200]   the answer to what is the cents per point however you can't always compare the exact flight you're
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:59.920]   taking for a few reasons let's say you're flying from la to new york and the cheapest points ticket is on
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:05.200]   delta but when you look at the cash prices united's flight is half the price if you were booking with
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:11.040]   dollars you weren't going to book that delta flight for 2x the price so i think you need to use a
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:17.840]   reasonable alternative as to whatever you would book with cash and then maybe you need to adjust it for
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:25.280]   some premium cabin for example we might book a flight to europe using 50 000 air france points that
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:29.920]   otherwise was three thousand dollars in business class but would we really pay three thousand dollars
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:35.360]   to fly in business class if you wouldn't then i'm not sure that cent per point value makes sense because
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:41.120]   if you are using it to compare to earning cash back it'll put the favor in the points every time but
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:46.480]   if you wouldn't actually pay for that flight then it's not necessarily a fair comparison but also don't
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:51.280]   just use the economy flight prices because you're getting a way better experience so i'd say look at
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:56.880]   the price of flights and come up with a what is the amount of money i would have spent on this trip and
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:03.360]   compare the number of miles to that and if you are doing this looking at one-way flights keep in mind that
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:10.320]   in some geographies one-way flights are wildly inflated in price if you're booking them with cash so i've
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:15.600]   often looked to europe and found that a three thousand dollar round trip flight to europe might
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:20.720]   be twenty three hundred dollars each way but only three thousand booked as a round trip so when i'm
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:25.440]   really trying to be honest with myself and say what are my points worth on this trip i'll look at the
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:30.000]   round trip flight compared to the round trip points and i'll look at it on flights that i would have
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.920]   reasonably taken not just the flights that i booked with points often you can get really expensive flights
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:39.760]   with your points but there's another flight that wasn't as expensive that you would have been totally
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:44.240]   happy taking if you were paying for it yourself a couple other things to keep in mind if you need to
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:50.960]   buy positioning flights let's say you found a great award but it's from la to paris and you live in san
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:56.240]   francisco we need to factor in the fact that you might have to buy that other flight to get down to la
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:01.040]   but the biggest thing that i see no one doing on the internet when they compare what is the cents per
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:06.640]   point i'm getting on my trips is when you book a paid flight and this includes flights if you book
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:12.480]   them in a travel portal you earn points on those flights now depending on what status you have or
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:18.160]   what program it's in the number of points varies but for most of the u.s domestic airlines it's anywhere
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:24.480]   from 5 to 11 points per dollar and you earn credit card points when you book a cash booking whereas on an
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:29.200]   award booking you're only earning credit card points on those taxes and fees so if you stack those two
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:35.360]   things up that could be somewhere between five to fifteen percent you also don't always earn the
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:41.440]   elite qualifying points that you need on an airline to get status on your award flights and so that has
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:47.840]   to have some value too i went through the math i think that value is roughly around five percent if you
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:52.880]   really care about status on that airline if the only flight you're taking is delta and you never fly delta
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:57.600]   the fact that you're going to earn a marginal amount of elite qualifying miles or medallion qualifying
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:02.800]   dollars in delta's case is negligible so you shouldn't include it so depending on whether you care about
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:08.240]   earning status on the airline i think that the value of all of the points and status you're going to
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:14.800]   earn including your credit card on a paid flight is between 10 and 20 percent which is a meaningful
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:22.000]   change it definitely does make the math hard and so my quick rule of thumb is when i'm looking at a flight
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.640]   i'm booking with points i compare it to the most reasonable alternative that i would have booked as part of a
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:33.360]   round trip and i subtract the taxes and fees or any positioning flight and if i don't have status on
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:38.000]   that airline or care about status on that airline i knock off 10 percent and if i really value the
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.280]   status and i have a high level of status with that airline depending on that status level i'll knock off
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:49.920]   15 to 20 percent so that means that 150 flight that was 10 000 miles could actually end up being closer
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:55.280]   to 1.2 cents per point instead of 1.5 cents per point most the time that bloggers share their cents
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:42:01.280]   per point including me i am guilty of this they don't factor in all this data and so i think the points
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:07.040]   path data above the valuation from experts above it's probably not using this data either so you could
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:14.000]   probably make a case that point values across the board are inflated by 10 to 20 percent that said there is
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.520]   one bonus for points bookings and that is they are often way more flexible back when we were looking
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:25.040]   at hotels when you found that you compared it to refundable rates you found that the hotel value
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:30.880]   per point went up well that's because most points bookings on the hotel side and on the flight side can be
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:35.840]   canceled for a full refund now that's not true across the board so definitely i'll link to an article in
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:41.280]   the show notes from frequent miler that is all about the award cancellation policies per airline
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:48.400]   because they're not all free but for american delta alaska and united and alaska by the way partner
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:53.840]   bookings do have a fee but that gets waived with their new summit card those cancellations are free
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:58.480]   and so there's some value there now if it's an airline you fly a ton and you cancel their flight you
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:03.680]   will get a credit on that airline and if you fly them a ton that might be really easy to use but if you're
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:08.080]   booking a flight to europe which we've done a few times and you have to cancel it and you had done
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:13.440]   that as a paid booking on let's call it luftanza well now you might be stuck with thousands of dollars
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:19.200]   in luftanza credit that i can guarantee you will be way way harder to use than if you just got your miles
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:27.200]   refunded so it's up to you to decide what value that refundability has in my mind anytime i was making
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:33.600]   a cash booking if they were to offer me a 10 premium to make that fare refundable i'd probably always
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:39.360]   take it so yes you could argue points prices are all maybe inflated 10 to 20 percent if you value
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:44.880]   flexibility maybe they're all deflated 10 so maybe it all breaks even there's a lot of ways to look at
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:50.480]   this if you just want to do it on easy mode i would say the easiest thing to do is subtract the taxes and
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:56.560]   fees of a comparable flight and discount 10 and know that going forward when i talk about cents per point
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:02.160]   on future trips i'm going to try to do a better job of calculating this that's a little bit more of a fair
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:07.440]   comparison so that it gives you a better idea of what points are actually worth but two big caveats
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:12.160]   here one just because you got a good redemption once doesn't mean you're going to get it every time
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:17.360]   just because you see a blogger promote hey this time i got 10 cents per point well that's because
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:22.080]   it's a great article title that's because people get excited to read it sometimes i use my delta miles
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:26.800]   and i might only get 1.3 cents per point that's not a fun thing to talk about so it might not make
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:33.200]   headlines but it is true so over time i think as you use your points and your miles and you start to
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:38.320]   look at the value you're getting you'll have a better barometer for what what your value is if you don't
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:42.960]   have that data yet maybe starting with something like the frequent miler reasonable redemption values
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:47.920]   is better because it's a little easier guide if you're a pro you probably already have a good sense
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:53.680]   of what the value is this episode is brought to you by delete me if you prefer not to have your
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:58.960]   identity stolen or your phone number or home address or even email showing up all over the internet then
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:04.400]   you really need to check out delete me unfortunately there are hundreds of data brokers online that are
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:10.400]   constantly sharing and selling your personal info and keeping track of them is like playing whack-a-mole but
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:15.840]   fortunately if you go to them one by one you can remove the data however that process can take
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:21.920]   hours and hours to do yourself i know because two years ago i tried and after 10 plus hours i didn't
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:28.080]   even get close to finishing i gave up and i started using delete me and since then i've now signed up my

[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:40.000]   data broker websites but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up which sadly happens all the
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:46.240]   time and they'll get that removed as well on average they find and remove over 2 000 pieces of personal
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:51.840]   info for a customer in their first two years and to date they've done over 100 million data removals

[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:26.080]   number two while it's super helpful to know how much value you get from your points if you're using that
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:30.800]   value to compare whether points are better than cashback it's really important to recognize that
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:35.760]   sometimes you can buy those points with cashback you've earned so i want to walk through that and
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:40.640]   why that might put a ceiling on the value of points you have so first i'm going to use an example and in
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:47.280]   my last episode i talked about getting a 1500 room at the waldorf historian costa rica for 120 000 hilton
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:53.280]   points so if we take a hundred fifteen hundred dollars divided by 120 000 we get 1.25 cents per
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:58.320]   point now let's be aggressive with our cashback strategy let's say i have the robin hood gold card
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:03.200]   earning three percent back now to get enough cash back to pay for that fifteen hundred dollar room
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:08.960]   i need to spend fifty thousand dollars on that card now most hilton cards out there earn at least
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:14.320]   3x on all your spend so if that fifty thousand dollars weren't in any category bonus i would
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:21.840]   earn 150 000 hilton points so that means that i'd have 30 000 hilton points left so clearly the hilton
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:26.880]   card would be a better deal right well maybe not first as i just talked about earlier that fifteen
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:32.320]   hundred dollars stay is likely to earn a lot of hilton points even with the basic card between that card
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:37.680]   and silver status you're actually going to earn 19 points per dollar so on that stay you would earn
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:42.880]   28 500 points even more if you had diamond status so now it's almost break even right put fifty
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:49.040]   thousand dollars on a hilton card get 150 000 hilton points spend 120 000 on the room have 30 000 hilton
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:54.400]   points left or put fifty thousand dollars on a robin hood card get three percent back which is fifteen
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:48:01.040]   hundred dollars spend that fifteen hundred dollars on the room but also get 28 500 hilton points so we're
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:06.560]   within 1500 hilton points of these being almost identical but neither of those are the best case
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:11.360]   scenario because you could actually use that robin hood card earn your fifteen hundred dollars of cash
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:17.520]   back but then just buy those hilton points and hilton points go on sale all the time for as low as half a
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:22.800]   cent so let's say you took that fifteen hundred dollars you spent six hundred dollars to buy the points you
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:28.640]   need you would have nine hundred dollars left so comparing those three outcomes that's a way better
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:33.840]   outcome but if you want to do it apples to apples because it's hard to compare having cash back left
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:38.560]   over when the other two scenarios didn't have cash let's say you just spend the whole fifteen hundred
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:43.520]   dollars on hilton points you'd end up with three hundred thousand hilton points you'd book your hundred
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:48.400]   twenty thousand point room and instead of having thirty or twenty eight thousand hilton points in the other
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:53.840]   scenarios you'd now have a hundred and eighty thousand points left over so in that comparison
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:59.280]   you would have been much much better off with a cash back card using hilton points that you bought
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:05.520]   to book the room so the price at which you buy those hilton points for kind of creates an effective ceiling
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:10.560]   so as much as you could say that because you got a fifteen hundred dollar room for 120 000 you
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:16.080]   effectively made your hilton points worth 1.25 cents that is true you did get a ton of value from hilton
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:20.880]   points but if you're comparing that 1.25 cents to what you would earn on a cash back card i don't
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:24.960]   think it's a fair comparison because you could have bought those hilton points for half a cent so we
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:31.280]   need to look at the data on what buying points is worth to set a ceiling on what our points are worth
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:35.600]   and by the way in that previous example that doesn't mean i'm moving to team cash back it just means that
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:39.280]   if your only two options are the robin hood card and the hilton card you might not want to use the
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:43.520]   hilton card for your everyday spending so let's quickly run through what the data says about buying
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:48.320]   points so we can figure out what to do with that data so on the hotel side when hotel points are
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:54.960]   not on sale excluding hyatt they typically cost one to 1.25 cents which is about one and a half to
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:59.520]   2x the valuation that most people give them it's pretty awful i would not buy hotel points if they're
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:05.360]   not on sale that said hilton ihg and choice points are always on sale so you're okay they go on sale seven
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:10.960]   to ten times a year so i think it's easy to put a ceiling on hilton and ihg points at a half a cent and on
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:16.640]   choice at about 0.62 cents marriott and hyatt are on sale a little bit less but when they do go on
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:21.920]   sale their sales last as long as two months but their sales prices aren't quite as close to the
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:29.120]   value most people get them for so if you're going to use them marriott points are often on sale for 0.89
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:35.600]   cents and hyatt points are often on sale for 2.8 cents so you could use those ceilings if you want i don't
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:40.080]   think it'll be that valuable but i feel like it's important to talk about airline point values are a
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:45.120]   little bit easier because they're all a little bit more clumped together to recap on the public valuation
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:50.800]   side they range from 1.1 to 1.55 cents but the amount to buy them is all over the board when they're not
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:57.280]   on sale the cheapest airline point you can buy is at 2.3 cents all the way up to 3.8 cents again like
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:04.240]   hotels if points aren't on sale don't buy them when they are on sale they're anywhere from 1.25 to 1.88
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:10.480]   cents except delta which looks like never go on sale so i'm never buying points whether it's airline or
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:15.680]   hotel points if i don't have a redemption in mind and i know how i'm going to use them but the challenge
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:23.120]   here and why i don't know if it's fair to use the exact sale prices as ceilings for airline miles
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:28.240]   is that they're not on sale nearly as often as hotel points the only exception here is avianca life miles
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:34.160]   they went on sale 17 times last year i thought about throwing the dates into chat chapt and if i did i
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:40.480]   probably would have gotten an answer that they were on sale like 340 of 365 days so i would put a ceiling
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:45.280]   on avianca points at 1.3 cents because they're almost always on sale but their program has a lot of
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:50.080]   quirks and i don't think it's a program that someone new to this game should be using and
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:54.080]   honestly i still have a bunch of points there that i haven't used because of all the nuances of the
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:52:00.640]   program that said on any given day at least five or six airlines probably have their points on sale
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:07.680]   somewhere in that 1.2 to 1.88 cents value that i mentioned so i think it would probably be fair to
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:12.960]   put a cap on the value you give your points and miles at two cents per point so i guess the takeaway
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:19.120]   here is that if you're looking at your data and you're ending up with point values that are higher
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:23.760]   than some of these sale values then i would encourage you to bring that number down because
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:28.400]   it's not necessarily a fair comparison it's absolutely fair to say you got that much value from those
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:33.520]   points but if you're trying to compare whether you should be earning cash back or not i would cap your
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:43.040]   airline points at two cents and i would cap your hotel points at 0.5 to 0.62 for most programs 0.9 ish for
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:49.600]   marriott and probably around 2.08 for hyatt so my summary is that i'm not buying points unless i need
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:54.320]   them and i know the program really well and i know how i'm going to use them but i would apply these caps
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:53:01.680]   if i'm doing any calculations as it applies to comparing airline and hotel credit cards to cash
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:05.920]   back cards right obviously it's totally true that you could get two cents of value from your hilton
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:10.720]   points but if you want to compare your hilton card to an equivalent cash back card i would cap the value
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:19.120]   of those hilton points at half a cent same for ihg choice again 0.62 marriott 0.89 hyatt 2.08 on the airline
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:25.360]   side if it's avianca cap it at 1.3 cents for all other airlines i would probably cap it at 2 cents
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:30.720]   just because there are a lot of options but they're not consistent so you probably couldn't come down
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:34.960]   much lower than that now you'll notice all those values we talked about were for airline and hotel
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:39.920]   programs yet i'm constantly talking about how much i love earning transferable points and most of the
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:44.400]   cards i'm spending most of my dollars on are for transferable points because you don't need to commit
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:50.640]   to one program so like i said before if you find a flight on lufthansa you could just transfer points
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:54.560]   to a star alliance airline and assuming that availability is there you could book it whereas
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:58.560]   if you're accruing delta or american miles you'd be out of luck so how do we think about valuing those
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:02.960]   transferable points i think at a minimum they have to be worth the average of all the programs you could
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:07.920]   transfer them to but i'm not transferring them to places with terrible value so you could probably make
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:12.640]   the case that they should be valued at the maximum value of all the airlines and hotels you could transfer
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:16.880]   them to that wouldn't necessarily account for the fact that there are transfer bonuses and you get
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:22.320]   value from flexibility so this is a tough one the points guy errs on the higher side valuing chase amex
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:27.680]   built at two cents per point or more one mile at a time just gives them all 1.7 cents per point
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:32.720]   and frequent miler has them all around 1.5 cents per point keep in mind they're doing these reasonable
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:38.240]   redemption values so they're not trying to target the max value you can get for me i'm almost always
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:43.280]   getting at least one and a half cent per point often it's two cents per point or more i recognize
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:48.640]   i could buy those points so i can't go above that level so i probably lean towards something around
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:54.240]   the one mile at a time perspective of saying i'm going to value all my transferable points at 1.7 cents
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:59.440]   per point now again if you're new to this game if you're flying mostly economy if you're flying mostly
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:05.280]   domestically maybe you're not getting 1.7 cents per point and that's totally fine right the game is not to
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:09.680]   try to get the most value because if you have to take trips you don't otherwise want to take to get
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:14.720]   the most value that doesn't make sense the point of all this is to make sure you're maximizing what
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:20.320]   you earn when you're spending money on a regular basis but one other important consideration here
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:25.520]   is really about your own psychology you might realize that points allow you to take a trip that
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:29.280]   you wouldn't have otherwise taken in the same way that paying down the principle of your mortgage
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:34.640]   forces you to save earning points instead of cash back might force you to travel if you had that
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:39.760]   cash back you might not have made the decision to spend your money on travel but with points you
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:44.560]   really have to travel to get your value out of them which might be a good thing on the flip side the
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:49.120]   overhead of booking a trip with points can be a lot especially if you're new to this it might limit
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:54.480]   where you can go or the dates you travel and the best deals might put you in a situation where they're
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:59.360]   driving the trip instead of where you want to go now i think as you learn this game more you can get
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:04.800]   past that but it's definitely a consideration and i would bump up or down my point value depending on
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:10.080]   how strongly i felt about either of these for me i love the former i love that it forces us to take trips
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:16.880]   i do hate that the process is harder right if i were just sitting here with no points at all and
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:21.280]   we wanted to take a trip i would just find the best deal but i would probably game that out as well
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:25.280]   trying to figure out well what if i fly here and then change planes and go here or book two separate
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:30.160]   flights so that overhead would probably exist for my personality anywhere but it's just something to
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:35.840]   consider and i think for a lot of people might give a slight edge to points so with all that taken into
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:40.480]   account i think the real benefit of having a good framework for valuing points is not just to know how
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:46.800]   much value we're getting it's to give us a good comparison of whether earning points make sense over
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:52.160]   earning cash back unfortunately i will save you a lot of work here because i took a lot of time
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:57.840]   digging through my credit card optimizer tool which i built to really help you compare what value you get
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:02.880]   out of all of the different cards you could spend on but one of the inputs for that tool is what is the
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:08.000]   value of your points so hopefully this episode will help you drive that number if you want to play with
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:13.600]   that tool go to all the hacks.com card tool and you can buy it there or it's free for all the hacks
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:18.960]   members which you can learn more about at all the hacks.com join so my goal was actually to run through
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:22.640]   all the different spending categories and all the different credit cards out there to compare the
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:27.120]   best cashback rates to the best points earning rates because at the end of the day if the place
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:32.640]   you spend the most money on gives you an option of a forex points card or a two percent cash back card
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:37.280]   well then as long as your points are worth half a cent or more then it's a clear decision to go for
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:43.760]   points and so for this episode i ran through all the cards i had but i did not include the earnings on
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:49.440]   cards where they were capped at less than ten thousand dollars of spend a year so there are lots of cards
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:53.600]   that might give you five or six percent on the first hundred or five hundred dollars a month or a
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:59.200]   quarter i excluded all of those cards because i just don't think it's a fair comparison and it just makes
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:04.800]   the math really messy so as i ran through this data i looked at kind of two versions one is assume you have
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:10.000]   all the best cards in all the categories so on the cashback side that means you have the verizon card
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:16.240]   the gemini card the altitude connect on points it means you have cards like the amex business gold card
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:22.000]   or the chase inc cash card that's version one version two was i assumed you had a more limited
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:28.560]   set of cards and it might be one or two cash back cards for catch-alls it might be on points common
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:35.040]   cards like amex gold chase reserve city premier autograph journey and when i ran through it the results
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:42.880]   were surprisingly the same for both of those sets for many categories gas grocery flights hotels dining
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:49.920]   entertainment the points card matched or beat the cash back rate meaning that if you would get three
[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:55.280]   percent cash back you would also get three or more x points on those purchases and so for most of these
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:59:00.880]   categories it makes more sense to go for points if you want to get the maximum value now obviously
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:05.040]   if you're working on a welcome bonus whether it's a cash back or point welcome bonus then none of this
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:09.600]   matters because the earnings of most welcome bonuses take for example a hundred thousand points for six
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:14.640]   thousand dollars of spend you're going to get a better return on that welcome bonus spending than
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:20.080]   you will with any cash back or any points card in almost any category so if you're working on welcome
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:26.240]   bonuses keep going but let's ignore that for a moment and look at the four categories where things were a
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:32.640]   little interesting so the first one is non-flight and hotel travel now the big change here is that the chase
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:38.960]   sapphire reserve used to give 3x travel now it gives 4x on flights and hotels but 1x on all other travel
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:46.160]   there is actually no points card that earns more than 3x points on travel but the altitude connect
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:53.360]   card from us bank actually does earn four percent on all travel and if you have a bank of america premium
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:59.280]   rewards or premium rewards elite card and you have a hundred thousand dollars in a bank of america or merrill lynch
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:07.840]   account you actually earn 3.5 on all travel as well so if the best you can do on non-hotel and flight
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:13.760]   travel is 3x points and the best you could do on cashback is four percent then you really need those
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:20.160]   points to be worth more than about 1.33 cents for that trade-off to make sense and on that point side to
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:26.000]   get that 3x points the only cards still doing that are the autograph card from wells fargo and the amex green
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:32.160]   card which i know are not the most popular cards so i would say if you spend a lot of money on non-flight
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:38.000]   non-hotel travel it might be worth digging into this a little bit more and you might find that a cashback
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.440]   card like the altitude connect is the better card for you next category is amazon this one's really easy
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:47.280]   there's nothing in the points world that i think comes close to earning five percent back on the prime
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:52.960]   visa if you spend a lot on amazon you probably want that card i do not earn points on amazon purchases
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:58.000]   next category is a small one for i think most of us which is streaming but that altitude connect
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.120]   card i mentioned before you get four percent back on streaming the best points cards that i found earn
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:08.160]   3x points so i don't think most people are spending enough on streaming for this to matter but if for
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:12.640]   some reason you're spending a ridiculous amount of money on streaming you know depending on how you
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:18.240]   value your points it might not make sense to be earning points on streaming but the big one here
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:23.680]   is the everything else category it includes all the spending at places that you aren't getting bonuses
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:31.840]   on dining on gas on groceries on travel and this one is really dependent on which cashback card you
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:38.160]   have on the point side there's a bunch of options to get 2x points venture venture x from capital one
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:43.520]   if you have the city strata premier or elite you can get the city double cash there are a bunch of options
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:47.520]   for getting 2x points on everything and on the cashback side there are a lot of options for
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:53.360]   getting 2 cash back and if that's your only option on cash back then again it's a relative do you value
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:59.040]   points more than one cent if so points wins if not then it doesn't make sense however there are cashback
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:04.160]   cards that earn more than two percent cash back and that's where this gets interesting so the first one
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:09.520]   which was a lot more compelling earlier this year was the us bank smartly card now if you have the us bank
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:15.600]   smartly card after it got nerfed this year and you factor in all these new limits what you need the fact
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:20.320]   that in order to get beyond two percent you have to hold cash in an account that earns almost nothing
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:24.960]   i don't think you can make a strong case for this card being any more than a two and a half percent
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:29.360]   cashback card and even that feels like a little bit of a stretch because you still have to keep ten
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:33.520]   thousand dollars in an account earning nothing but let's say that's your primary checking account
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:38.560]   and you already leave that there we'll call this a two and a half percent cash back card well to use
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:43.920]   a 2x points card like the venture venture x cards over a two and a half percent cash back card you
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:49.360]   really need to make sure your point value is above 1.25 cents that's above the floor value so that means
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:54.800]   you need to be comfortable transferring to airlines and hotel groups and booking flights and so at that
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:03:00.320]   point i could say it really depends on you but it's starting to make a case for cash back if you're
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:05.520]   not that experienced or you're not interested in some of the premium travel options that get higher
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:09.920]   value from your points next up is the bank of america setup where you can put a hundred thousand
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:15.120]   dollars in bank of america or merrill lynch and when you do it at merrill lynch it can be stocks so it
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:20.160]   doesn't need to be something that's making you lose interest putting it in an account that earns nothing
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:26.400]   with that card you'd be getting 2.625 on everything you spend on and so comparing that to a 2x points card
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:31.600]   means you need your points to be worth 1.33 cents or more so as that number creeps up you have to ask
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:38.720]   yourself am i really getting enough value for my points to justify getting 2x points versus 2.625
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:43.440]   cash back if you're not in a situation that you could put a hundred thousand dollars of cash or stocks at
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:48.000]   a merrill or bank of america account then it's not an option then finally if you have the robin hood card
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.880]   you could be getting three percent cash back on everything so in that case you'd need your points to be worth
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:58.400]   more than one and a half cents and i would argue that if you're not experienced in this game or using
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:03.520]   premium travel now that you factor in some of the things i've realized like earning points on cash
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:09.040]   bookings i think it's a hard case to make that you're going to consistently earn more than one and
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:14.240]   a half cents on your points obviously if you're working on a welcome bonus it's a no-brainer to spend
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:18.160]   the money on a points card but if you have no welcome bonus and you're debating between a three
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:22.880]   percent cash back card and a 2x points card i don't know it's a tricky comparison especially
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:28.240]   factoring in that that cash back can go straight into a bank account that you can hopefully earn
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:33.360]   four percent back right now in today's environment versus those points are going to sit maybe in a
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:37.520]   transferable points balance but they're not growing over time i thought long and hard about this one for
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:43.840]   myself because i actually think that i could make the case to switch to a card earning three percent cash
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:50.000]   cash back however the robin hood card doesn't consider taxes or business type transactions
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:56.560]   eligible for cash back and if you look at all the spending that we do that is not in all the categories
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:02.160]   that bonus like dining and groceries and travel and then you remove taxes and business transactions
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:08.480]   there's not a lot left so yes i could open that card and i could be getting slightly more value for all
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:13.760]   those everything else purchases however we don't have a lot of purchases in that category so if you're
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:19.200]   doing a ton of spend in the everything else category maybe you're spending a lot on home
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:24.880]   renovations buying furniture in that case i'd actually consider you to go look at the mesa rewards
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:32.560]   card because that card gets 3x on home improvement stores and furniture and home decoration so that one
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:39.280]   actually in that example i'm wrong go look at allthehacks.com/mesa in the other categories i'm not
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:44.640]   sure what it might be maybe you're buying a lot of stationery maybe you're spending a lot on ebay
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:50.480]   just things that don't bonus that maybe aren't considered business type transactions it might make
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:56.240]   sense to look at a cashback card if you value your points anywhere close to or below one and a half cents a
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:03.920]   point so to recap for almost all purchases with most cards if you value your points over one cent then cashback won't be worth it
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:09.360]   however if you spend a lot on amazon i'd get the prime visa if you spend a lot on non-flight hotel
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:14.960]   and travel or streaming and you value your points right around 1.2 1.3 cents i would take a look at
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:20.960]   that altitude connect card and then for all the other spending that's not bonused on any cards it really
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:26.800]   comes down to which cashback card you have and whether you value your points at more than the
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:32.480]   cashback rate of that card divided by two since there are a lot of 2x points cards so if it's two
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:36.960]   and a half percent cash back then you need to be valuing your points at more than 1.25 cents
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:43.360]   now for me i said i value my points at 1.7 cents at least the transferable ones so the only place the
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:48.960]   math gets close is on that everything else category and if there was a card that was an uncapped three percent
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:54.800]   on all my spending i would consider switching my cash back to those purchases if a card comes back
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:59.200]   that's four percent on everything with no caps and no restrictions i would move all my everything else
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:05.200]   spending there unfortunately almost all my everything else spending is in categories that that robin hood
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:11.600]   card excludes and there's not really another option that's uncapped right now but i'll keep my eyes out
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:17.360]   it feels unlikely anyone that does it ends up changing it the coinbase card came out and it seemed like it was
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:22.480]   going to be uncapped four percent now it's capped so i am pessimistic that one of these cards will come
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:27.760]   out but if they do i will gladly switch my everything spending to team cashback and of course if you're
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:32.640]   working on in welcome bonus that's always going to be the better return on your spend so to do the final
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:39.200]   recap transferable points probably have a floor value that's at least one cent and airline points might be
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:45.280]   similar hotel points all have different values but for the most part excluding hyatt i'd say they at least
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:49.680]   have a floor of half a cent when you look at the data you'll see that if you're booking more premium
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:54.240]   flights or hotels your points are going to have more value but you need to adjust all that data for
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:58.800]   your own trips that you actually take to look at what kind of value you're able to get and unfortunately
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:03.520]   there's no one right answer it's all very personal but you also need to factor in some of the things
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:10.640]   that i think this industry as a whole leaves out which is that booking flights and hotels with cash often
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:17.360]   earns a lot more points and status and points on the credit card spend to book them then i think is
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:22.400]   getting factored in here at a range of about 10 to 20 percent so make sure you include that if that's
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:28.000]   important to you and if you value the fact that points force you to travel give the value of your
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.920]   points a bump if you value that points bookings are easily refundable then give that value a bump if
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:39.280]   you hate the overhead of booking travel with points and you are very unflexible and you just want to be able
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:44.480]   to book whatever flight you want maybe bring the value of points down a bit but not lower than that
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:49.520]   one cent value because you could still go book that flight in a travel portal on whatever flight you want
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:54.480]   with almost every transferable currency after looking at all the cards you could likely use for spending
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:59.760]   i think it's really easy to make a case for points for everything as long as you value your points at more
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:04.880]   than one cent and if you've made it this far you probably do with the exception of the categories i
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:11.760]   mentioned which is amazon non-flight and hotel travel streaming and that everything else category
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:16.800]   which really just needs to be compared to whatever the best cashback card you have would be earning
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:22.240]   finally i'm going to push you all to test your convictions in whatever value you think you've come
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:28.160]   to for your points using something i learned from greg at the frequent miler he encourages you to think
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:33.120]   about what you would really pay for these points so if you came to the end of this episode and said i
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:38.560]   think my points are worth one and a half cents and someone actually offered to sell you points in
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:43.840]   whatever transferable currency or airline you want would you really pay one and a half cents for them
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:50.480]   would you really buy another hundred thousand million chase points alaska points for one and a half cents
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:55.600]   if that's the value prescribed and if not if you really wouldn't buy them at that price i'd encourage
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:01.120]   you to think about maybe lowering that valuation okay i know we packed a lot into this episode so if you have any
