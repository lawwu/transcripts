[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.320]   Pastor John, you were recently at a conference where Doug Wilson referred to Jesus' words
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.800]   in Matthew 12, 34, where we read this, "Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks."
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.940]   And you raised the question there about the verse.
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.740]   Would you tell us what you asked and what's the takeaway for us today?
[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.200]   I asked the question, not at all out of disagreement with anything Doug was saying.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.600]   In fact, I was just totally tracking with his message, which I thought was excellent
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.440]   about the mouth and how it speaks in relation to the heart.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.180]   But that text, "Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks," creates a bunch
[00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.520]   of problems for me.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.960]   Doug doesn't create the problems.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.800]   God creates the problems for me because he said it.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.920]   This is the word of Jesus, not the word of any mere man.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.540]   That's one of the scariest verses in the Bible for me, because Jesus also said, "On the day
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.720]   of judgment, people will give an account for every careless word they speak."
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.400]   And I say, "Oh my goodness."
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.400]   So out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth is speaking all these careless words,
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.800]   and I'm going to be judged because those careless words signify what my heart is really like.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.640]   I mean, that's a scary situation that we're in.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.700]   And a related problem, this is the one I raised, is this.
[00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:34.380]   In Psalm 141, verse 3, it says, "Set a guard, O Lord, over my mouth.
[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.720]   Keep watch over the door of my lips."
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.040]   And there are other passages that talk that way.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:52.280]   Now here's the problem. If I'm about to say something hurtful, lewd, unkind, because my
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:00.440]   heart is producing it, and I catch it at my teeth and don't say it like this text seems
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.880]   to say I should, "Keep watch over the door of your lips," so you see it coming up, and
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.640]   you say, "Nope, you don't get out.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.640]   Am I a good person?"
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.640]   I mean, am I a hypocrite?
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.640]   Am I a hypocrite?
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.960]   Like, the heart really did produce that nasty thought, and it was on its way to becoming
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.400]   a word, and I stopped it from becoming a word.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.480]   So my question to Doug was, "Is that a virtue?"
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.440]   Or is that, "Am I just a hypocrite at that moment?"
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.680]   And I thought Doug's answer was exactly right.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:48.800]   He said something like this, "The desire and the ability to stop the unkind or angry word
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:56.160]   or lewd or hurtful word at the teeth before it gets out and does its damage may also be
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.480]   a sign of sanctification, may also be a work of that same heart.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.600]   That heart is not only producing that ugly thought on its way to becoming a word, but
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.280]   that same heart—we only have one heart—is also producing the hatred of what it just
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.280]   produced.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.400]   It's producing a desire that nobody be hurt by that, and it's producing regret that it
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.160]   ever produced such a thought, and therefore it is in fact, or at least can be—I say
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.280]   can be because you might be a pure hypocrite, but you don't have to be—it can be a beautiful
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.280]   sign of sanctification that you have just put the brakes on a thought that you wish
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.840]   you didn't have."
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:52.760]   So of course it would be better if our hearts, for example, never felt any vengeful feelings,
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.800]   for example, never created any vengeful word on the way into being.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.920]   The gospel is designed to change the heart.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.680]   We should obey Jesus, cleanse the inside of the cup so that the outside can be pure as
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.680]   well.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.920]   We shouldn't just focus on what comes through our teeth, but focus on what happens in our
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.920]   hearts.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.440]   We want to be changed at the roots, but what came out of that little interchange for me
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.080]   that's been so helpful is that you fight at two levels.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:33.200]   You fight to transform your heart with biblical gospel truth.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.960]   Just as you have been forgiven by Jesus, you become a tender-hearted, forgiving person.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.400]   That's a heart change that comes through dwelling on the gospel.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:51.520]   But since we're sanctified slowly and progressively, there's another effect that the work of the
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:58.600]   Spirit has in our lives, and that is to help us see when our hearts are failing and to
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.400]   put a check on that so that we stop that.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.080]   And one last thing emerged.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.160]   It seemed to me, I don't know that any of us said that in that moment, but subsequent
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.520]   thinking, it seemed to me if a vine keeps producing or a branch keeps producing bad
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:25.880]   fruit and you chop it off often enough before it matures and poisons anybody, the branch
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.680]   just may get the idea, "Oh, we don't produce that in this heart."
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.320]   And so the secondary means of sanctification also becomes a means to the primary heart
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.320]   change.
