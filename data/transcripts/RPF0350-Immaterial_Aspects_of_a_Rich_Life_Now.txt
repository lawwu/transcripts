[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we talk about living a rich life.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.320]   Here's my question.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:27.240]   What is a rich life?
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.040]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.400]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.400]   Thank you for being with me.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.280]   This is the show where I work hard to provide you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.400]   encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while building a plan
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.080]   for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.640]   Today we tackle that slogan that I've made up.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:59.680]   I begin the process of explaining what I mean and where it came from.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.320]   Throughout the course of Radical Personal Finance, I've looked for a tagline, a slogan
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.320]   for the show.
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.400]   Radical Personal Finance, when I chose the name of the show, I was pretty satisfied with
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.040]   it because I knew it expressed the thought of what I wanted to express.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.240]   But I wanted a way to kind of define it a little bit more.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.000]   And if you're a long-time listener of the show, you'll hear me in different episodes
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.720]   struggling for that tagline.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.360]   I tried all kinds of different things.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.920]   Ultimately, where I settled and I've settled so far, who knows, it may change in the future,
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.280]   but I settled on this concept of a rich life now and financial freedom.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.400]   And I've been using that slogan for a while without ever particularly doing a standalone
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.080]   show on explaining what I mean for – by that.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.440]   What I mean by a rich and meaningful life now and what I mean by a plan for financial
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.520]   freedom and why 10 years or less, I've never really defended those concepts.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.380]   And so today I want to expand on what I mean by those words in hopes that it'll be helpful
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.520]   and useful to you because I do believe that they express my goal, my desire, my heart
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.040]   for how I hope that this content will serve you.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.600]   And I think that that'll be very, very useful.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.080]   Today we're going to talk about what is a rich life.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.760]   And then in a future show, we're going to talk about how to live – because today we're
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.720]   not going to focus on what is a rich life as measured by materialism.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.840]   In a future show, we're going to talk about how to live a materially rich life now because
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.240]   both of those things are important.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.760]   Today we're going to discuss many of the immaterial things, but the material things
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.360]   are also important.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.960]   And then in the future, we'll talk about financial freedom, why I'm choosing that
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.880]   word financial freedom and why 10 years or less.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.000]   Because all of these things are very important to me.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.960]   But today we kick it off by talking about living a rich life, what that means and how
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.000]   to do it.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.300]   Before I get to this topic, the sponsor of today's show is YNAB.
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.300]   You need a budget.
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.400]   This is the budgeting software that I use each and every day.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.720]   A few minutes ago, I just was working on my own budget.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.960]   I keep one budget for my business, one budget for my personal non-business life, and that's
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.960]   it.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.920]   I keep all of my transactions in YNAB.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:13.920]   I have since the third or fourth quarter of 2015 last year and I absolutely am thrilled
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.920]   with the software.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.520]   It makes so many things extremely useful.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.080]   It's the best proactive forward-looking budgeting software that I know of.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.400]   If you run a small business, you can also use it.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.000]   And here I mean a pretty small business, something like I run which is using a cash basis of
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.580]   accounting and you just are keeping a simple number of accounts.
[00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.000]   You can use YNAB for your business software as well.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.480]   That's what I do and I use it for my business budget as well.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.720]   It's not a double entry system.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.200]   So if you need a double entry system because of the size of your business, you need to
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.280]   look elsewhere.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.120]   But if you're just running a side hobby, maybe a simple side hustle of some kind, use
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.760]   YNAB for your business as well.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.240]   You can try a free 30-day trial.

[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:04.120]   YNAB is an acronym which refers to you need a budget, affectionately referred to as YNAB.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.180]   Now let's talk about living a rich life.
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.520]   Many people have a dream of being rich.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.320]   Many people have a dream of being rich but they don't have it – they don't have
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.320]   that as a goal.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.620]   They don't have something clarified of what being rich actually means.
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.780]   Now there are some concepts that if I start going through some of the concepts that most
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:33.000]   of us would agree on, many people have some vision or some impression of material riches
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.240]   depending on where you are in the world and in what stage of economic development.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.280]   Material riches might mean having enough food in your stomach, might mean not having to
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.760]   wonder where your next meal comes from.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.520]   Material riches might mean having – driving a car that doesn't break down on you continually.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.080]   Material riches might mean having a house that has a roof over it that doesn't let
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.480]   the rain through.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.840]   But material riches might also be a shiny black Mercedes-Benz or a house with a pool
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.600]   or a fancy private jet.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.880]   There are all kinds of different definitions of riches, different dreams that people have.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.000]   But most people have this dream of being rich but they've never sat down and thought about
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.180]   what does it actually mean?
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.360]   What does rich mean to me?
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.200]   The dictionary definition of rich is one of those definitions that has many, many entries.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.840]   A dictionary has at least 19 or almost 20 different definitions, some of which apply
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.120]   to wealth, for example, having wealth or great possessions, abundantly supplied with resources,
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.800]   means or funds, wealthy.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:39.880]   Another definition, having wealth or valuable resources, of great value or worth, valuable.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.960]   You talk about rich food or costly, expensively elegant or fine as dress or jewels.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.840]   You can talk about rich as abounding in desirable elements or qualities.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.240]   You can talk about rich as abundant, plentiful or ample.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.800]   There are other aspects of rich as well.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.040]   So it's a word that we use a lot of times but we don't sit down and describe it.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:07.800]   So what I desire for you and also for myself is to live a rich life.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.040]   And in the definition of rich life, I believe we need to talk about the things that are
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.240]   immaterial as well as the things that are material.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.240]   Today we talk about the things that are immaterial because material things come and go and you
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:28.040]   can live a rich life in many ways independent of the expression in the physical world if
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.320]   you're clear on the immaterial aspects of riches.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.840]   So I sat down and I made a list of things that to me are hallmarks of a rich life.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.160]   I don't claim this to be an exhaustive list.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.520]   It's just simply a list I wrote down and I thought had some useful things for you to
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.520]   consider.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:50.440]   So when I make this list, what I want you to think about is does this – do these ideas
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:56.640]   connect with your perception of what it means to be rich?
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.880]   And is there a way that you can move towards a rich life now?
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.320]   So let's talk about the first thing.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:10.720]   To me, one of the biggest aspects of a rich life is to be rich in freedom and independence.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.360]   When generally people think about the idea of being a millionaire, it's not so much
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:21.760]   what their bank statement would look like with a one and six zeros behind it as expressing
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.920]   their net worth.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:29.880]   Generally what people perceive with the idea of being a millionaire is independence, freedom,
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.760]   the ability to live by your own code, the ability to live based upon what you want to
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:44.960]   do, the expression of autonomy and self-direction, your ability to live free of the man telling
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.440]   you when to come and when to go and what to do while you're there.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:55.400]   That's probably an almost universal desire is for us to be able to live as we believe
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.560]   is right and to do as we want to do.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:06.440]   And without financial independence, it is certainly difficult to live a truly free life.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:11.640]   You can gain expressions of it and I don't think you need to wait until you are fully
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:17.320]   financially independent in order to have expressions of freedom and independence.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:22.040]   But without question, financial independence makes it easier.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:28.520]   Financial independence brings with it the ability for you to be truly independent intellectually,
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.720]   truly independent with regard to your opinions and your perspectives and your views on the
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.080]   world.
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:40.680]   Anytime you're accepting money from somebody, it almost always comes with strings attached.
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:44.300]   And so many people would like to be free of those strings.
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:51.480]   The person who gives you money is usually doing it with some strings attached.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.560]   We all know where our bread is buttered and this happens from the micro to the macro.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:59.160]   The simplest one that most of us experience is the idea of employment.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.280]   When your employer writes you a paycheck, it comes with strings attached.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.400]   You're expected to do a certain job.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.880]   You're expected to do it under certain conditions.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.600]   If a condition of your employment is that you're there to open the doors of the shop
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:15.480]   at 9 a.m. to let the customers come in, well, you got to be there at 9 a.m.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.240]   If the condition of your employment is you need to produce work of a certain type or
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.880]   a certain quality, well, you got to get that work out.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.180]   That's the condition of your work.
[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:29.680]   And if you want to continue receiving that money, you've got to have these certain results.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.840]   This goes from the micro to the macro.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.960]   Watch in government circles is probably the easiest things to do.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.960]   What is it?
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:42.280]   How is it that government and politicians hold control over other people?
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.140]   Well, it's based upon the flow of funds, the flow of money.
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.040]   This happens on an international basis.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:53.780]   What is a primary tool of large countries that are seeking to exert their influence
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.960]   and their will all around the world?
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.960]   Money.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:02.880]   The United States does this through the World Bank, through the International Monetary Fund.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.680]   Lending money comes with strings attached.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:10.040]   There's a great book, well worth your time if you're interested in international affairs.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.400]   It was published at least a decade or so ago, John Perkins, Confessions of an International
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.520]   Hitman.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:21.440]   And he talks about his involvement of how the US government specifically exerts its influence
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:29.960]   and control all over the world through money, very euphemistically called foreign aid, control.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.840]   Now we do the same thing from – for example, in the US and I'm sure in most countries
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.040]   and governments around the world, it's practically universal.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.160]   We do the same thing within a country, within a society.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.760]   The federal government exerts its influence over state governments based upon the flow
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.760]   of money.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.640]   What's the proof of this?
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.360]   Well, think about the recent – all of the recent transgender fights going on in the
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.360]   United States.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:57.100]   What's the stick that the federal government is attempting to hold over the states based
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:02.320]   upon their participation or non-participation with the federal mandates?
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.600]   Well, we're going to cut off funding.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.120]   We're going to cut off your education assistance.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.160]   So if your state doesn't step up and do what we think is right, we're going to cut
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.680]   off these billions of dollars and now as a state governor, you're going to have to
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.200]   stand up and tell your citizens, yes.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.240]   We're taking this stand that we believe is right and it's going to cut off the funding.
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.160]   Always comes down to money.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.080]   What was – what's the carrot or the stick that's used?
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.400]   Well, we'll give you money if you participate in it.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.000]   Education, it's easy to see it in there.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.800]   Think about how did the federal government incentivize the various state governments
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.720]   to participate in the common core standards.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:41.960]   Well, if you participate in common core standards, you'll gain access to this funding.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.880]   If you don't, you won't.
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.960]   Same thing with all government programs.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.800]   So we see that on a government basis.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.760]   It's always easy because a lot of that information is public and you can see it working.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.480]   But this happens on a personal basis.
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.920]   Generally when you're given money, it comes with strings attached.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:05.920]   When you work for a company, you have a responsibility to represent that company in a positive light.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:11.280]   You will necessarily censor your opinions and your perspectives to please your employer
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:18.920]   because if you become a liability, political liability, you express opinions that are unpopular,
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.000]   your employment will terminate.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.920]   So without financial independence, it's very difficult to live as truly free.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:34.920]   Now is it possible to ever become truly, absolutely, completely free?
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:40.800]   Personally I doubt it because all of us are responsible to somebody.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:46.760]   For example, I've worked very hard to build this independence into my income stream.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:50.160]   I'm not financially independent to the point where I'm able to live purely off of the income
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.480]   from my investments.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:56.720]   But I am very independent with regard to my business where I've sought and worked very
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:02.080]   hard to build an independence where I don't have a corporate structure over me.
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.640]   I don't have a boss that I have to please other than myself.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.320]   Now does this mean that I'm fully independent?
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.520]   No.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.840]   Because who do I have to please?
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.800]   My customers.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.320]   I have to please you, my listening audience.
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.920]   Now you have to define who are your customers.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.600]   This is one of the challenges with accepting advertising on Radical Personal Finance.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.480]   If I accept advertising, I need to please my advertisers.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.320]   And so I know that comes with a cost.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.320]   I have to please you, my customers.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.680]   This is why I've worked hard to set up the patron program and all of that because I want
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:39.240]   my fundamental allegiance to be serving you.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.100]   But I'm still not fully independent.
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.920]   Even if I were financially independent, I could live off of the income from my investments,
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.520]   would I still truly be free?
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.520]   I don't think so.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.000]   I mean there is a point at which you could get there.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.680]   But at the end of the day, you're still responsible for those investments.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.440]   If I own stock in a company, well, that company has got to please its customers.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:04.280]   If I own real estate, that real estate has to serve the needs of its inhabitants.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:09.040]   So you can move closer and closer towards this type of freedom.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.400]   I think it's probably not fully achievable.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.160]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:19.120]   But at any rate, I believe that we should all seek to live as free as possible of the
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:24.360]   charity or financial input or strings that come from other people.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:29.120]   I don't think this is necessarily right or wrong as far as, well, you're wrong if you
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.120]   take this input.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.320]   You're wrong if you have a job and you have to go and build a business.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.320]   No.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.240]   But it's going to come with a cost.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:39.980]   And if you desire to live a rich life, that rich life can be measured in terms of freedom
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.400]   and independence.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:50.040]   So seek to live rich now with regard to enjoying the maximum amount of freedom and independence
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.440]   that you can build for yourself.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.400]   This is a progressive scale.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:59.320]   But it's not only achieved when you're old and rich and financially independent.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:03.520]   You can move towards it based upon the decisions that you make today.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:09.120]   And the fundamental theme that I desire for you to see throughout radical personal finance
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:14.480]   is that you can make consistent choices that will lead you toward a lifestyle of greater
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:19.280]   freedom, greater autonomy, and greater independence.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:25.400]   And this can be tremendously helpful to you as you develop other things that are important
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.320]   to you.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:33.240]   The next aspect of living a rich life now is living a life that's rich in choices.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.880]   Financial independence gives you choices.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.040]   It gives you options.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:43.100]   You have the choice to get up and go to work or to stay home and read a book.
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:47.080]   Having those choices is incredibly valuable.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.160]   One of the things that causes people to feel a great amount of stress is feeling like they
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.160]   don't have a choice.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:58.440]   If you're doing work that – think about the idea of human slavery, human chattel slavery.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:04.120]   In this idea of slavery, what is so bad about slavery?
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.960]   Is it the actual work that's involved?
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.120]   Well, sometimes it is.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.320]   If you study the history of slavery in some parts of the world or in some slave-owning
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:18.560]   societies historically, whether historical societies or current societies where slavery
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:23.520]   is encouraged, it's deprivation of physical comfort.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:28.040]   Like there's just some serious abuse of people involved in it.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:36.980]   But many times in slavery, in many slave masters, there's been very little actual physical
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.720]   abuse of the slaves.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.400]   But is it still unattractive?
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.640]   Well, most of us would say yes.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.640]   And here I'm not talking about the morality of it.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:51.920]   I'm just talking about the practical expression for the sake of demonstrating the point.
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.280]   It's unattractive because you have no choice.
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.120]   What's so difficult about being a prisoner?
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.000]   It's not the physical conditions.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.760]   Prisoners usually have a bed to sleep in.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.260]   A lot of times they have climate control.
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:05.920]   They can do things in the United States.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.280]   We have pretty comfortable prisons.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.920]   They can have a TV connection, maybe an internet access.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:11.920]   They can read books.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:12.920]   They can learn.
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:13.920]   They have a library.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.480]   They have weightlifting equipment depending on what level of your incarceration.
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:21.480]   But it's that deprivation of choice, that deprivation of freedom that has the biggest
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.520]   impact.
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.640]   Same thing with slavery, the deprivation of choice.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:36.040]   If you have the choice, you might do exactly the same things on a daily basis that a prisoner
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.080]   would do.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:43.300]   And yet you would experience a great deal of fulfillment in those things because you're
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.100]   doing it based upon your own choice.
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:50.040]   You might do exactly the same things that a human slave might do.
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:56.160]   But because you're doing it by choice, you might not sense the negative aspects of it.
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.760]   So you want to live a life that's rich in choices.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:02.080]   Well, financial independence gives you choices, but there are different expressions of that.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.740]   Million bucks in the bank, that gives you choices.
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.740]   But you know what?
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.200]   So does $10,000 in the bank.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:11.560]   Because to a person who doesn't save any money and who's never saved money, $10,000 in the
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:16.720]   bank gives them the option of walking out of one job and walking into another one.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.440]   Gives them the option of picking up, loading up their car and driving from one city to
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.440]   another.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.260]   Gives them the option of changing from one career to another.
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:27.300]   Gives them the option of moving out of a dangerous situation.
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:32.500]   And so to live a rich life, you want to develop for yourself a maximum number of choices.
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.420]   How do you see this theme expressed in radical personal finance?
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.740]   Well, first, again, obviously, constantly we're working towards becoming financially
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:42.540]   independent as defined by being able to live off of the income from your investments.
[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:44.620]   However, I also talk about savings.
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:50.060]   Also talk about low expenses, maintaining expenses at a very low level.
[00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:54.940]   The reality is, and I freely share many of my expenses on the show, not to impress you
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:19:00.100]   with how rich or how poor I am, but to demonstrate and impress upon you the value of having low
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.100]   expenses.
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.980]   If you have low expenses, you have choices.
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:08.860]   I have very few fears of running radical personal finance and starting an entrepreneurial endeavor
[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:12.540]   because I have very low fixed expenses.
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:18.360]   And so I'm willing to run the risk of failure in my own business pursuits because I know
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.500]   there are plenty of jobs that I can go and do.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:25.740]   I can take an entry level job doing manual menial labor and I can support my family such
[00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.940]   that we have a roof over our heads and food that we eat.
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:38.180]   If I make poor investments and we lose all of our money, it's going to be okay.
[00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.740]   Low expenses give you choices.
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:45.300]   So I desire that same sense of freedom for you.
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.620]   I desire for you to have a lot of choices.
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:51.620]   And there are tools and things that we constantly talk about to try to make sure that you know
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.820]   that you have many choices.
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:58.040]   One goal I have is often to profile different people's experiences, people living different
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:02.940]   lifestyles than you so that you recognize that you have a choice about where you live.
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.300]   You have a choice about what you do.
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.260]   You have a choice about how you live.
[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:12.980]   I use the extreme examples to impress that upon you, that you have a choice.
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:18.620]   Now you may continue to choose to live where you live, to do what you do, to live as you
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:24.900]   live, but doing it from a place of choice, having purposefully chosen that, will change
[00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.260]   your experience of it.
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:31.900]   That leads to a rich life.
[00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:37.460]   Another expression of living a rich life is to live a life that's rich in time and time
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.700]   freedom.
[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.660]   In many ways, time is the essence of life.
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.220]   It's how we define life.
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:51.100]   Study of time is a fascinating study philosophically, but I think it's fair to say that time is
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.100]   the stuff of life.
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.140]   What you experience is right now, the present moment.
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:59.860]   In many ways, when I talk and do private coaching with people and talk to them, what I generally
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:05.620]   hear is a desire to have control over time.
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:09.260]   That's what many of us want, is control over our time.
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:14.380]   This ties in with choice, but we want to have the choice of what to do with our time.
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:18.340]   My desire is that you can achieve that quickly.
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.060]   I don't think you need to wait a decade to achieve that.
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.180]   I think you can achieve it in a few months.
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.500]   Switch to a job where you have control over your time.
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:31.140]   Now you also will have responsibilities, but you can gain this control over your time with
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.820]   choices.
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:40.420]   You can also choose to surrender this control over time in order to have other benefits.
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:46.980]   Recently, I did a private consulting call with a listener who is a physician.
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:52.660]   By the way, if you want to do a private consulting call with me, go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/phonecall
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:56.020]   and I do private consulting calls with you if you'd like to consult on your personal
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.020]   situation.
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:03.020]   I was speaking with this listener, and this listener was a physician, a fairly high-earning
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:06.220]   specialty physician making plenty of money.
[00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.660]   As I was speaking with this listener, they expressed that they were thrilled with their
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:10.660]   practice.
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.900]   They were thrilled with their business.
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:17.500]   It was extremely profitable, but they weren't so thrilled with the lack of financial independence.
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.820]   In talking through that situation, I asked this listener, I said, "What is it that bothers
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.600]   you about...
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.940]   Why do you feel like you need to be financially independent?"
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:29.940]   Because from my perception, this person was experiencing all of the freedom.
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:31.280]   They were living a great lifestyle.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.900]   They had a great family life.
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:34.580]   They had a lot of benefits.
[00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.300]   They had a lot of vacation time.
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:38.780]   They had tons of money, et cetera.
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:41.460]   I said, "What's stressing you out?"
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:46.580]   Well, what was stressing out was as a physician, I have to be on call at a certain time.
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:50.140]   I have to be there on these hours and I don't have freedom over it.
[00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:56.300]   Well, my advice to this person was politely get over it in the sense that you have so
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:03.180]   many other benefits and you have so much flexibility of time that your need to be there with a
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:07.500]   patient at 8 o'clock in the morning on a Tuesday morning as they go into surgery, your need
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.500]   to be there with that patient.
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:15.860]   This is a very small price to pay in exchange for everything else that you achieve.
[00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:20.740]   It's a small price to pay in exchange for the money that you earn, which can buy you
[00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:21.740]   additional freedom in the future.
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.700]   It's a small price to pay for the amount of vacation time that you have.
[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.900]   It's a very small price to pay.
[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:32.580]   So here, just simply recognizing that can help you to live a life that's richer.
[00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:38.580]   But having control and having a richness of time, the control over time and choices of
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:43.260]   what to do with your time will help you to experience a rich life.
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:50.260]   This is one of the things that I enjoy the most about my own business pursuits, that
[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.580]   I can choose what I do with my time.
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:56.020]   Now, this is a double-edged sword.
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:57.260]   It comes with a tremendous responsibility.
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:01.920]   It's challenging and I struggle many times with knowing how to handle it.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:05.540]   But one thing that running your own business does give you is it gives you the ability
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:12.780]   and the opportunity to make a choice on a daily basis of what to do with your time.
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:17.740]   When you take the choice of time and mix it with some of the other choices, the financial
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:22.540]   choices like having low expenses, now you have the ability to pursue the things that
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:27.620]   you think are important, whether they're connected to money or not.
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:35.500]   Next aspect of living a rich life is living a life that's rich in relationship value.
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:40.480]   Time is the stuff of life and relationships are the stuff of life.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:45.340]   The quality of your experience of life will in many ways be determined by the quality
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:48.100]   of your relationships.
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:53.020]   This is an area that many of us can make significant improvements by simply recognizing it and
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:55.660]   focusing on it.
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:25:01.140]   I need to do more shows on the topic, but I believe that if it requires money to spend
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:07.100]   on relationships, you probably should do that before you should buy stocks.
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:12.540]   Someone can work a job that the actual functions of it he doesn't necessarily feel all that
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:17.740]   enthusiastic about, but if he's working that job with people that he enjoys being with
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:23.420]   and if his home life is in good repair and in good shape, his experience of life is going
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:26.300]   to be pretty high quality.
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:31.700]   On the same hand, many of us have experienced the joy of doing something that's fun, that
[00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.700]   we like to do, the physical act or the physical work, but when you're doing it with people
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:41.300]   that make you miserable or if you have a miserable home life, your experience of that job is
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.540]   pretty, pretty rough.
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:50.220]   So by investing in the quality of your relationships with your immediate family members, investing
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:53.940]   in the quality of relationships with your coworkers, with your customers, with your
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:26:04.620]   employees, with your friends, this will lead you to the experience of a rich life.
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:11.020]   When you get old, you're going to look back and reflect on your relationships, and based
[00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:19.940]   upon what you do with those relationships, your aging process will be very different.
[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:30.660]   I have no desire to be an old rich person, meaning rich in financial wealth, who has
[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:38.600]   destroyed all the love that others have for me based upon my actions and behavior.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:47.240]   Far better to be completely financially broke but be surrounded by people who love you and
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:54.480]   who care for you than the opposite.
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.820]   Far better to experience that.
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:27:01.700]   It's one of the things where I have a personal real just frustration with how in the US American
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.620]   society we view children.
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:11.820]   I'd rather have children who love me and pour into their lives and take the cost of that
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:18.160]   and get to experience the joy of relationship throughout my entire life than place the priority
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:26.000]   and emphasis on financial gain for myself and wind up without relationship wealth, without
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.900]   relational wealth.
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.860]   Now it's not an either or.
[00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:32.340]   You can only have one or the other.
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:34.400]   I believe you can have both.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:41.060]   But if you have to choose, you can guess where my choice will be.
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:46.300]   I'll pick relationships.
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:52.460]   Living a rich life means that you live a life that's rich in meaning and impact.
[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:58.580]   Man has a deep desire for immortality and impact beyond the grave.
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:05.500]   I think it's very healthy to always recognize that life ends in death and that you and I
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:08.700]   are in the process of dying.
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:13.140]   I always shrink away from people who want to talk about death euphemistically.
[00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:20.180]   I think it's a very bad cultural trend that we don't face death.
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:23.220]   We try to hide death away and not face it head on.
[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.220]   Guess what?
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:29.780]   You're in the process of dying and that should have an impact on you today.
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.980]   It should have an impact on how you live.
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:35.580]   Now you could take that in many different directions.
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.980]   I won't try to decree for you how you should take that at this moment.
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:42.220]   But simply to say that at the end of your life, you're going to be looking back and
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:52.100]   wanting to see a life that had meaning and impact on things that are important to you.
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:29:00.100]   So rich life is one that has meaning and impact that will go beyond your own life.
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:05.640]   A rich life is a life that's rich in experience, especially a life that's rich in a diversity
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.060]   of experience.
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:17.140]   One of the most pleasurable, rich things that you can do in your life is to learn new things.
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:19.620]   Learn and apply new things, new skills.
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:26.420]   It's a great danger in looking to always be entertained because entertainment is generally
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.020]   passive.
[00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:32.260]   But if you can engage in something that's active, you'll get far more appreciation for
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:33.940]   the activity out of it.
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:37.620]   What I encourage is don't just live in one way.
[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:42.740]   Look at diverse experience.
[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:48.400]   One of the challenges of wealth is you often lose appreciation for it.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:52.100]   If you live in a place where lobster is cheap and you eat it all the time, it's no longer
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.100]   a special event.
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:57.780]   Eat enough lobster, I've heard from those who've lived in such places, they say eat
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:00.620]   enough lobster, it tastes like soap.
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.420]   I believe it.
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:06.620]   Because if you do the same thing over and over again, it becomes somewhat boring.
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:07.740]   It becomes somewhat the same.
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.940]   So challenge yourself.
[00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:17.060]   I think we can challenge ourselves and intentionally create a diversity of experience if we focus
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:18.500]   on it.
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:24.060]   If you're used to living in material comfort and material luxury, challenge yourself by
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:27.300]   living without material comfort or without material luxury.
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.620]   It's relatively easy to do.
[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:30.660]   Go camping.
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:34.860]   Make yourself do without material luxury, material comfort.
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:40.400]   When you go home, you'll appreciate your nice soft bed a little bit more.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:44.760]   Or if you're used to living a rough and difficult life, figure out a way that you can treat
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.740]   yourself to some material luxury, material comfort.
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.940]   It's very accessible.
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:55.280]   Many times people spend all their time eating every Wednesday and Friday night at TGI Fridays
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:59.020]   and feel like, "Well, I can't ever buy the $300 meal."
[00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:00.020]   Well, you can.
[00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:07.580]   Take a few weeks and don't eat at TGI Fridays and save up and go and enjoy the special experience.
[00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:09.820]   You're going to really enjoy it.
[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:12.060]   You'll enjoy it especially because it's unique.
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:13.640]   It's diverse.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:18.320]   Seek out a diverse experience with people, diverse exposure to people who live all in
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.260]   different ways.
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:24.560]   This often is reflected in people's goal of travel.
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.560]   Some people like travel.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:26.560]   Some people don't like travel.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:31.320]   But to me, one of the biggest benefits of travel is diversity of experience.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.320]   You face new things.
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.320]   You face new ideas.
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:34.320]   You face new philosophies.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.320]   You're going to be challenged.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.960]   If you want to travel, go for it.
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.600]   But don't feel like if you can't travel that you can't do it.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:46.120]   Just reach out beyond your comfort zone and invite somebody to dinner in your neighborhood.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:50.840]   I have a Mexican family staying with me right now with me and my family.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.000]   It's been fantastic.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.520]   Spend all kinds of time talking about it.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.240]   We've been talking about – they're tried and true Mexicans, lived there their whole
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:02.520]   life in their late 40s.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:06.440]   So we're talking about it and it's so interesting to talk about Donald Trump and
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.360]   his comments on Mexicans with a Mexican family.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.880]   It's a lot more interesting than talking about Donald Trump and his comments with Mexicans
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.620]   with all my white friends.
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:18.560]   Do this with – invite your Asian neighbors over.
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:22.440]   Invite your – if you're a Christian, invite your atheist neighbors over.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:26.040]   If you're an atheist, invite your Christian neighbors over.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:29.920]   Seek to gain from someone else's experience and all of a sudden you'll start to really
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.600]   enjoy things a little bit more.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.040]   You'll start to be challenged in what you think.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:38.000]   You'll start to appreciate different perspectives, different opinions.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.040]   Again, you don't have to travel to do this.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:45.640]   Just set aside on your weekly calendar one night per week and invite a different one
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.320]   of your neighbors over every week.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.480]   My family has Tuesday night.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.400]   Every Tuesday night we have somebody different over for dinner.
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:56.920]   That gives me an opportunity to expose my children to all kinds of different perspectives
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.960]   and all kinds of different ideas.
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:04.560]   That leads to me being challenged and exercised and it leads to a rich life.
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.880]   It doesn't cost that much to have somebody over.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.160]   Add an extra five bucks.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.200]   You're going to be eating food anyway.
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:13.600]   Put an extra cup of rice in the pot and throw an extra steak on the grill.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.960]   It's about five bucks extra.
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:23.200]   What you gain from it will go far beyond the expense because now you'll have a diversity
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:27.200]   of experience and you'll be challenged in your perspectives and in your opinions.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.800]   You'll see the world differently.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:35.520]   That's a rich life.
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:40.960]   Another aspect of living a rich life is live a life that's rich and full of hard work.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:46.000]   There's a great danger in the US American culture.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.640]   There's a great danger in the financial independence early retirement movement.
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:57.040]   I don't know if it's called a movement but perspective.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:02.960]   The danger is to seek ease and relaxation.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:07.760]   The danger is to seek recreation.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:16.000]   Some of the most miserable people in the world are those who don't have any work to do.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.160]   Hard work has huge benefits.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:26.720]   There's a Bible proverb that teaches, "In all toil, there is profit, but mere talk tends
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:27.720]   only to poverty."
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.960]   I like that proverb.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.200]   A couple of different ways you can look at it.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:37.240]   But I just love the idea, "In all toil or in all work, there is profit."
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:44.080]   Think about how satisfying it is to engage in something difficult and to finish it.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:47.840]   Think about how satisfying it is to look out at your front lawn and it's just covered in
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:51.360]   weeds and it needs some work and you go out there and you toil and you sweat and you mow
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:56.920]   the lawn and you pull the weeds and you spruce things up and you get to the end of that afternoon.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:02.880]   You sit down on your front porch and you look at the lawn and it makes you go, "Ah."
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.200]   Does something in you.
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:08.400]   It's a huge danger for those of us who are so-called knowledge workers and that we don't
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:12.800]   get that same sense of satisfaction.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:17.720]   Tradespeople who work with their hands are much more mentally healthy than those of us
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:21.440]   who are knowledge workers because you can see the results of your effort.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.760]   You can see the results of your work.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.640]   Hard work feels good.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:31.800]   Recreation and relaxation and rest and rejuvenation only feel good when they come after the hard
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.520]   work.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:40.800]   When they become the priority, they become very empty and very hollow.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.080]   So don't be scared of hard work.
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:47.240]   Wade in, roll up your sleeves and tackle it, whatever that work is.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:57.360]   I'm not implying that because you're financially independent means that you can't work hard,
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.600]   but your experience of financial independence will be much better if you just simply take
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.960]   some of the work that you've been doing for money and you apply it to things that you
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:12.120]   may or may not do for money, but work hard.
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:16.840]   And finally, my final expression, perhaps the most important one as a rich life, is
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:24.560]   a life that's filled with spiritual peace, peace with God, because on that basis, everything
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:33.600]   else can go away, but yet that peace can be experienced now and that sense of richness
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:34.760]   can be experienced.
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:43.520]   And this is entirely independent of all of the other factors.
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:48.120]   One of the most influential, one of the most important factors, it's the one where if everything
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:53.800]   else is taken away from you, if you have no independence, if you have no choices, if you're
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:58.920]   a slave, if you have no control over time, if you have difficult relationships, if you
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:04.400]   are doing things that are not meaningful and impactful, if you're doing things that are
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:10.400]   the same all the time, so you have no diversity of experience, well, if you're at peace with
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:14.400]   God, it's a rich life.
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:18.600]   It's the cornerstone.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:24.160]   And it fundamentally transforms the experience of everything else.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:28.280]   Now all of these things are immaterial.
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:34.560]   Haven't talked about houses and cars and fancy clothes and fine wine.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:35.560]   But guess what?
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:41.600]   If you have all of these things, those immaterial...excuse me, those material things, they're nice to
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.600]   have.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:46.720]   I enjoy going to sleep in a nice soft bed.
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:49.840]   I like having a fancy phone.
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:52.960]   Enjoy having enough food in my stomach.
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:57.480]   But we all know that the material things are temporal.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:00.920]   And these immaterial aspects are far more important.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:06.960]   They make a far bigger difference.
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.760]   But in some ways, they're far harder to achieve.
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.680]   They're far harder to get clarity.
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.680]   They require much more work, much more searching.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:19.400]   It's a lot easier to set a goal and say, "I'm going to buy a Harley-Davidson motorcycle
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.520]   and fulfill my dream of owning a Harley-Davidson."
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:27.200]   Much easier to do that than to say, "I'm going to have a goal of getting at peace with God."
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:31.920]   The Harley-Davidson is tangible.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.560]   It's concrete.
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.560]   You can make a goal.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.560]   You can make a plan.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.360]   You can set out, "Okay, it's going to cost me $25,000.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.680]   I can save it a savings rate of $500 a month.
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:45.280]   Therefore, based upon my savings rate, it's going to take me this number of months."
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:50.160]   That's why we tend to jump towards those things.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.360]   Most of us probably have some tangible and material goals.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:56.360]   I've been enjoying a few months ago, I got some paddle boards.
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:59.680]   And just a week or two ago, I went ahead and bought a small RV.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.040]   I've been enjoying that, fixing it up, fixing a couple of things that need to be fixed to
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.600]   make it truly roadworthy.
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:10.360]   If you want to see a picture of it, it's on my Instagram page, instagram.com/joshuasheets.
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.360]   But it's great.
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.360]   But you know what?
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.040]   If you take a tangible...
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:22.600]   If I took that tangible goal, that RV, and if my life were a life of turmoil, if my relationships
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:29.040]   were out of line, if I was experiencing stress and conflict in all parts, the experience
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:33.720]   of using that material item, the RV would be very different.
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:36.240]   So these are the hard things.
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:39.200]   These are the difficult things to work through.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:47.960]   But they have a far bigger influence than those concrete materialistic things.
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:53.160]   So before you jump to, "I want a big fancy house and I want a fine wardrobe filled with
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:40:04.360]   fancy clothes," spend some time thinking through, "What is your definition of a rich life?"
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:10.120]   Spend some time considering these ideas of mine and then make your own list.
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:13.880]   Again, I don't claim that this list is in any way exhaustive or complete.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:16.600]   It's just a list I made up.
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.520]   But I think there's some food for thought here.
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.760]   I think these things will make a difference for you.
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:25.040]   And when you are seeking to live a rich life now, you don't need to be a millionaire to
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:28.480]   get these things in line.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:34.440]   You don't need to ever be a millionaire to live a rich life.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:40.880]   When you think about the people who are many times most honored and respected, it almost
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:49.600]   never had anything to do with their financial wealth.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:56.000]   Many times the people who had the most financial wealth in history often face the least respect.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.200]   And they had to work to do something to gain social respect.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:05.040]   It's often a guilt complex with many people who achieved great wealth and they try to
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:08.420]   do something different.
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:13.800]   But think about historical figures that you admire and respect.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:17.400]   Think about presidents of countries, American presidents.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:21.720]   Is there an American president that you admire or respect?
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:22.720]   Think of that person.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:26.440]   Now ask yourself, how wealthy were they?
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:29.160]   Do you have any idea?
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.800]   Most of us don't.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.340]   No idea.
[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:40.640]   Think about a social figure, somebody who was influential in society, an actor, an actress,
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:46.680]   a scientist, Albert Einstein, Charles Darwin.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:49.720]   These people that had influence, do you have any idea how rich Einstein was or how rich
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:53.680]   Darwin was or how rich Newton was?
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:56.480]   We don't know.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.800]   We know their name because of something else.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.840]   Think about religious figures, philosophers.
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:10.440]   Gandhi, there's a famous picture of what he died with when – I think he's like a white
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:15.120]   toga and a pair of spectacles, a pair of sandals and a bowl and a spoon I think was all he
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:16.120]   owned.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:21.640]   Jesus Christ, the most influential man in history, didn't even own the clothes on
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:25.200]   his back at the end.
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.800]   We often forget that in a materialist culture.
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:34.160]   We forget that these people had an impact that went far beyond money.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:40.720]   We spend all of our time chasing money and we neglect the greater things.
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:44.880]   Don't let that happen to you.
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:50.120]   If this show has been useful to you, at least to inspire you to think, again, write down
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:51.440]   your own list.
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:54.480]   Make sure that you're clear on what is a rich life.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:57.400]   I don't mind if it's different from mine.
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:01.840]   Maybe who knows, maybe I'll do a show like this in a couple of years and maybe my things
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:05.240]   that are on this now will change.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:07.560]   But you can live a rich life now.
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.560]   It takes intentionality.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:10.800]   It takes thought.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:11.800]   It takes hard work.
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:12.800]   It takes design.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:16.600]   It often doesn't take money.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:17.840]   Some of these things do take money.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:20.720]   We'll talk about money later.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:21.720]   We always talk about money.
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:25.240]   But many of these things don't take money.
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:29.080]   Rich in relationships, you could take the same money that you're going to spend on dinner
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:31.840]   tonight with your spouse.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:37.160]   But if you turn off the TV, take the food, put it in a basket and take it out to a park
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:45.600]   where you can watch the sunset, your experience of that dinner will be very different.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:49.480]   Take that workday lunch that you were going to spend with a co-worker and just mindlessly
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:55.040]   toss off the 15 bucks for lunch and call an old friend.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.440]   Set up lunch with the old friend.
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:44:00.840]   All of a sudden now, your experience will be different.
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:03.840]   Anyway, I've made the point enough times.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:06.040]   Thank you all so much for listening.
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.400]   I think the next show we'll talk about material wealth.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:12.280]   We'll talk about ways to get a great bargain because material things matter.
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:13.960]   They are important.
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:19.760]   It's a fallacy to think that you can focus entirely on the so-called spiritual aspects
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.880]   of wealth and not pay attention to the physical aspects of wealth.
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:25.540]   Material things are important.
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:26.540]   Everything in life is connected.
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:29.360]   The spiritual and the physical are fully connected.
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:31.720]   But tomorrow maybe we'll talk about that.
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:32.720]   That's my intention right now.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:33.720]   Thank you so much.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:36.840]   And then we'll come back and in future shows we'll talk about financial freedom, what I
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:42.480]   mean by financial freedom and why 10 years or less and what I actually mean by that.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.480]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.600]   If you'd like to support the work that I'm doing, please consider becoming a patron of

[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:51.080]   The way I set that program up is very important.
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:57.240]   I set it up to where my responsibility is to you, my listening audience.
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.240]   You can vote with your dollars.
