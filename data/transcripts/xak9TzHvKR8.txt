[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   You don't actually even need to have a points balance right now to take
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.960]   advantage of the arbitrage you can get booking a flight with points.
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.640]   In fact, transferring 63,000 points to LifeMiles when you could otherwise
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:19.120]   buy them for $825 means you're only getting 1.3 cents of value, which is
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.960]   nothing like the 8 cents you might be thinking when you go through this process.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.220]   Let's assume you earned those 63,000 points on a 2X points card after you
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.200]   spent $31,500 to get the $825 you'd need to buy those same number of points
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.800]   with the same $31,500 of spend on a cash back card, you'd need to be earning
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.560]   at least 2.62%, which is really actually a funny number because it is almost
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.880]   the exact percent cash back you can get on all purchases with the Bank of
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.040]   America Premium Rewards card, assuming you have $100,000 at a Bank of
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.560]   America or Merrill Lynch account.
