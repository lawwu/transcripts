[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and I'm really really excited in this episode because I think I found the best life hack
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.260]   for Americans now
[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:16.340]   Sorry for folks who are not Americans about 98% of readers and listeners of Financial Samurai are Americans
[00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.380]   But I'm always looking for arbitrage opportunities to help readers make more money and live better lives
[00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.080]   You know at the end of the day money is not the end goal
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.560]   It's a means to the end right and the means to the end is living the life that you want
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.760]   on your terms
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.960]   happily ever after so that life hack really is to take advantage of
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.160]   Canada now, it's not new. It's not new
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.800]   To think about Canada as an alternative to an American lifestyle after all Canada is a developed country
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.280]   They have a respectable GDP per capita
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.640]   $45,000 a year
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.920]   Very few people go through medical bankruptcies because health care is heavily subsidized if not free
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.680]   Well, it's free because the tax rates are so high. Meanwhile, the average annual tuition for Canadian universities was only
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.520]   $6,571 in the 2018-2019 academic year
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:19.040]   So with all these good things in mind, I think it's a no-brainer for Americans to consider
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.480]   Moving to Canada, but not at any point in their lives
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.440]   Only after they want to settle down maybe start a family or retire early
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.000]   So I have a 25 year old friend in my San Francisco softball league. He's from Vancouver, Canada
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.320]   Lovely place very expensive city. So he went to the University of British Columbia
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.720]   It's a top five University and the tuition was only fifty four hundred dollars in the computer science department
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.000]   So when he graduated he decided not to find a job in Canada
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.600]   But to come down to San Francisco where the computer engineering jobs pay much more
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.000]   He said I make twice as much in San Francisco as I would if I got a similar job in Vancouver
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.480]   And I said, well, don't you want to get back to your country?
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.640]   I thought brain drain is a big thing in Canada and he said well, yeah
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.400]   But let me make some money first after five years in San Francisco making double the money
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.280]   I'll then move to Seattle with my girlfriend where my firm is headquartered. It's Zillow and
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.880]   Seattle pays similar amounts to San Francisco pay despite the cost of living being about 30% cheaper
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.440]   And then further Vancouver is only about a three-hour drive away
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.080]   So that sounds like a great plan and then he said
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.640]   Once I'm in my 30s and ready to start a family then I'll move back to Canada and live a less hectic lifestyle
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.600]   You know with a stronger government safety net. I'll feel more comfortable raising a family back home and
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.800]   All this made a lot of sense
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.160]   I did feel a little bad for Canada for not getting the benefit of his productivity after providing him with 22 years of education
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.440]   but hey
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.440]   he can do what he wishes and
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:59.140]   You know since Canadians are buying US stocks buying US property and taking advantage of our job opportunities
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.840]   Why don't we just take advantage of them? I mean, it's just natural to take advantage of each other, right?
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.360]   So I was thinking to myself well
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.440]   Healthcare healthcare is a big issue
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.360]   My family pays twenty one thousand a year for healthcare premiums plus co pays and co insurance
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.040]   And I don't think this is reasonable at all for a healthy family who never sees the physician
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.920]   to generate
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.040]   21,000 in retirement income and a 4% rate of return requires me to first amass
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.200]   525,000 in capital
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.000]   That's a lot of money folks. And then further given the average college tuition is only six thousand five hundred seventy one dollars a year
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.240]   You know that that that means we no longer have to contribute
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.880]   50,000 a year in our son's five to nine college savings plan to ironically make him a millionaire by the time he goes to college
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.840]   Just to pay for college
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:56.160]   We could easily just afford the four years of twenty six thousand dollars of Canadian University tuition just from our savings account
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.240]   So it's just mind-boggling that four years of tuition
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:07.200]   University tuition Canada is about eight to nine thousand less for one year of tuition for San Francisco kindergarten
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.760]   I mean, that's just crazy. So saving fifty one thousand a year in health care and college expenses
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:21.680]   Just by moving to Canada sounds like a home run because that's one point two seven five million less in capital
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.840]   I need to amass at a four percent rate of return
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.160]   so in other words
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.320]   You can just go to Cal Canada and just automatically be a millionaire if you want to think about it that way
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.120]   But there's another thing. This is the thing that excites me the most about Canada
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.120]   and that is
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.840]   their acceptance rates for their top universities
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.240]   So as a high school tennis coach for the past three years, I've seen my students juniors and seniors
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.560]   Grind away at taking SAT exams AP exams studying every night
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.680]   missing critical matches because they had tutoring and so forth and
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:04.440]   So one day I was at practice and I was talking to one of my favorite students who's going to Occidental College in Southern, California
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.880]   And he mentioned a classmate was attending McGill University in Canada
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:16.480]   And I was immediately impressed because I remember having a financial analyst classmate in 1999 at Goldman Sachs who had attended McGill University
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.920]   She was extremely kind she was smart and she was the only one in my class
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.920]   Who ten years later after the dot-com bomb and after all this stuff made managing director?
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.000]   She was an MD at 33. So I was thinking myself Wow McGill University
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.360]   It's definitely the Harvard of Canada. I told him and he said well really
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.080]   How can it be the Harvard of Canada? How can that be right?
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:50.240]   Their acceptance rate is 50% and I said there's no way McGill University has a 50% acceptance rate
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.460]   And I said, I'll happily bet you 20 push-ups that it's 45% or less
[00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.840]   And I was saying myself, you know secretly that's like a home run win
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:06.720]   I was thinking McGill University would probably have closer to a 20% acceptance rate given the best universities in America have a single-digit acceptance rate
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.500]   So he took my bet and he looked up
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.360]   acceptance rate on Google on his phone and he immediately started dancing around because it said
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.760]   46.3% ha ha ha time to do some push-ups coach and
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:26.480]   Given that I am very adept at SEO and all stuff Google related since I run financial samurai
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:33.280]   I noticed that the acceptance rate was from 2016 as Google often has old data in its featured snippets
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.360]   So I said wait, wait, wait, buddy. I clicked on McGill's website
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:43.120]   I checked out their latest acceptance rate for 2018 and boom it was
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.160]   41.7%
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.040]   ha ha ha so
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.320]   Never challenged the coach and he did 20 push-ups right there
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:57.560]   So I would say 41.7% acceptance rate for arguably the best university in Canada is
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.240]   Kind of a joke by US standards for the top school
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:07.480]   And if you don't believe McGill University is the Harvard of Canada in the top school in Canada
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.780]   Well, let's just look at some other universities
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:16.960]   UBC 52% acceptance rate Queens University 42% McMaster 59%
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:24.120]   Waterloo 52% Montreal 57% in University of Toronto a 40% blended acceptance rate
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:30.960]   Now in other words the best universities in Canada have an acceptance rate of 40 to 59%
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:36.680]   The top 25 schools none of them have an acceptance rate of above 40%
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.760]   If you look at the top 10 schools in America, you know
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:46.440]   The Harvard's Columbia's Juilliard Princeton MIT Yale and so forth. The acceptance rates are all in the single digits
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:53.120]   We're talking four four to eight percent and the only one you get to like the 20th 25th school. It's like 10%
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:08:00.560]   So good luck getting into a top school in the United States unless you're a really rich legacy student
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.880]   Or you cured malaria while fighting gun violence
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.600]   And seriously, even some rich celebrity kids couldn't get in on their own merit
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:14.000]   They needed five hundred thousand dollars in bribes, you know to get their kids into schools like
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.680]   USC which is okay, but come on
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.620]   Georgetown great school, but you know, come on
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:27.680]   It's not that great and in the USC incident was like five hundred thousand dollar bribe for rowing and then the tennis
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.960]   Bribe was like seven hundred thousand dollars. I mean, that's just nuts
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.960]   So I said it to you and to everyone else with kids
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:43.520]   What is the point of trying to grind so hard in middle school and high school to try and get into a top?
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:51.320]   American University with a 10% or lower acceptance rate when you can be an average student and still get into a top five Canadian
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.720]   University, I mean it's as if everybody gets a trophy in Canada and
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:03.200]   It's probably true for the universities because if you think about their customs and the government the way it's set up
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.440]   You know, they're very welcoming of immigrants. They are
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.160]   Subsidizing they've got universal health care
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:17.640]   They've got high tax rates. So it's a much more socialistic society to help everybody and
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:25.680]   So given that's the case. It makes sense to go apply to Canadian universities with a 40 to 60 percent acceptance rate
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:33.320]   Given they're more accepting right? But also the reputations of the top Canadian universities are higher than their respective
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.480]   acceptance rates indicate
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.480]   I don't think most Americans and most
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:45.320]   American employers realize how high those acceptance rates are and how big of a difference they are
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.200]   between American top universities
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.400]   So I recommend applying to these universities
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:57.480]   Look at my friend my softball friend. He went to UBC. It's a great school
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.280]   but again
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:05.720]   40 plus acceptance rate and he makes probably a hundred twenty thousand dollars as a software engineer here down in America and then my Goldman
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:13.440]   Classmate who probably makes or who's been making over a million dollars since she was 33 years old and she's now like 42 years old
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:18.480]   And she went to McGill University and some people have criticized me for saying well
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:26.280]   Look, you're not gonna be able to pay the local tuition rates of like sixty five hundred or five thousand dollars a year
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.920]   Well, that's true. You've got to
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.840]   Immigrate to Canada and be a resident for one or two years to be eligible
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.920]   but I think that's worthwhile sacrifice to be instantly a
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:41.920]   millionaire or save on having to accumulate more than 1.2 75 million dollars in capital or
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.440]   Alternatively, you can just accept that you're gonna have to pay the international tuition
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:53.960]   Which is still about ten thousand dollars a year cheaper than comparable top rated universities while having a similar
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.040]   level of reputation
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.880]   so
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:58.960]   Canada
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.240]   Wonderful wonderful country
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:07.160]   I think all parents and students should consider and this is something that I've been thinking about so much since I became a father is
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.360]   What is the life of my son gonna look like in?
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:15.800]   15 to 25 years given globalization because there's so much more competitive
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.520]   You know, there's wage stagnation
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:23.320]   It's just it just seems like a tough and competitive world in the future
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:29.120]   and I think this is one arbitrage opportunity that we're definitely going to encourage and
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.480]   That's to apply to Canadian universities. So if you have any other arbitrage
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:39.480]   Opportunities that people aren't aware of maybe shoot me an email. Let's keep it private
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:44.760]   Let's not tell the world. Otherwise all arbitrage opportunities eventually get whittled away
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:49.320]   Thanks so much everyone and leave a comment in the post below. Bye
