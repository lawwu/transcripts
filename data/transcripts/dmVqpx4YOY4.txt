[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   The following is a conversation with Giannis Papas,
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.240]   a comedian who co-hosted the podcast, History Hyenas,
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.200]   that I came across when I was researching
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.000]   the Battle of Crete from World War II.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.920]   He and his co-host were hilarious in their rants
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.720]   about history and about life.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.880]   The chemistry they have is probably the best
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.880]   of any co-hosted comedy podcast,
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.280]   or even podcast in general, that I've ever heard.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.200]   As of a few weeks ago, unfortunately,
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.360]   History Hyenas is no more, at least for now,
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.440]   because all good things must come to an end.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.960]   But Giannis hosts a new podcast
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.320]   called Long Days with Giannis Papas,
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.040]   plus he has a comedy special on YouTube for free.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.680]   Quick mention of our sponsors,
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.880]   Wine Access, Blinkist, Magic Spoon, and Indeed.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.680]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.480]   As a side note, let me say that some of you
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.480]   have noticed that I have not spoken
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.680]   with too many computer scientists, physicists,
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.880]   biologists, or engineers recently.
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.800]   The reason has to do mostly with the risk aversion
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.560]   of many of these folks in the time of COVID,
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.600]   especially as they get closer to taking the vaccine.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.520]   I'm tested several times a week,
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.480]   and still some people are just more willing than others
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.960]   to have an in-person conversation in these times.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.840]   I only do these podcasts in person
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.080]   because I look for the possibility
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.960]   of a genuine human connection.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.080]   I'm willing to sacrifice a lot for that.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.760]   Maybe it's silly, but I look for the magic
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.760]   that Charles Bukowski writes about in his poem "Nirvana,"
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.480]   the magic that is somehow in the air on those rare occasions
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.560]   when two people meet, talk, and you notice
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.120]   that while on the surface you may be worlds apart,
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.840]   you're still somehow woven from the same fabric.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.460]   I've had that with many guests.
[00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.840]   Jim Keller comes to mind, but many others as well.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.520]   I'm an AI person.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.160]   Machine learning, robotics, computer science is my passion.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.840]   Trust me, I can't wait to be having
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.960]   more technical conversations again,
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.320]   but I will also continue to mix in comedians, musicians,
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.000]   historians, and of course, wise, all-seeing sages
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.040]   like Giannis Papas and Tim Dillon,
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.480]   just to keep it, as Tim likes to say, fun.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.000]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.080]   and here is my conversation with Giannis Papas.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.320]   You've co-hosted, until recently,
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.400]   an amazing history comedy podcast
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.680]   called "The History Hyenas."
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.240]   So you're a bit of a student of history?
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.320]   - Yeah, an F student of history.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.840]   - F student, okay, I thought it was more like a D minus.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.160]   - D minus, yeah.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.560]   Still gotta repeat the grade if you get all D minuses.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.960]   I actually had a .67 GPA average my freshman year,
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.000]   and I had to do it again.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.120]   This podcast is gonna be the spectrum of human intelligence.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.920]   It runs the gamut from there to here.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.080]   So this is gonna set the low bar for anything.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.000]   - I'm barely sliding into human.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.440]   I'm closer to chimp.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.080]   - And I bring that up that you're also friends
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.400]   with the great, the powerful Tim Dillon.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.320]   So let's talk about power
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.160]   and the corrupting effects of power.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.440]   Sometimes I look at Tim Dillon as he grows in power.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.000]   - I thought you meant in size.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.800]   - Size, I think they're correlated.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.600]   - Yeah, I saw him, I've been in Austin a couple days.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.040]   I saw him once, we had eight meals in one day.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.880]   - Eight meals.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.920]   - Yeah, so I feel like I've been here longer than I have
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.200]   just because of the meals with Dillon.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.480]   Kid likes biscuits and barbecue.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.080]   - Okay, so he's more like, see,
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.120]   I was imagining Putin or somebody like that.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.200]   He's more like the North Korean dictator.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.040]   - Yeah.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.960]   They get along great, those two.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.800]   - Yeah.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.440]   - They would get, I mean, Tim Dillon and King John Un
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.640]   would be like, they could make like a buddy cop movie.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.360]   They would get along like "Lethal Weapon."
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.000]   That would be a good pitch movie.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.840]   - Great podcast.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.160]   - Yeah, that would be a great podcast.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.000]   - Yeah.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.840]   (laughing)
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.920]   - So much to talk about.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.240]   So many similar ideas about the world.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.840]   So what do you think the world would look like
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.120]   if Tim Dillon was given absolute power?
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.000]   He seems like a person that's an interesting study
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.880]   of the corrupting effects of power.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.360]   - Yeah, you don't wanna give him power.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.440]   I don't even want him wearing a suit.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.040]   Like I want a guy who's as thoughtful and educated
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.360]   as you wearing a suit.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.160]   Like 'cause, you know, suits corrupt you.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.920]   You put that suit on, you start feeling that power.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.760]   - Definitely.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.800]   - It's like, you know, yeah,
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.200]   I don't even want Tim Dillon in a suit.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.000]   Power would, he would kill people.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   He'd get rid of anything that he deemed.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.480]   I mean, if you made a lobster roll
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.080]   and it wasn't up to Tim Dillon's standard,
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.520]   he would have you executed.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.360]   - The entire restaurant staff is just gone.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.480]   - He would have people below his food standard executed.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.640]   There'd be programs,
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.840]   not of people who are political dissidents,
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.280]   but of people who don't meet his food standard.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.480]   His cuisine standard is high and he's usually right.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.560]   - Do you think power does corrupt people?
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.400]   - Yes.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.680]   - One of the reasons we mentioned offline Joe Rogan,
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.440]   he's been an inspiration to me 'cause he gets,
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.600]   he gets, forget power, just more famous and famous.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.480]   And yes, probably a bit of power in terms of influence.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.400]   And he's still pretty much the same guy.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.560]   I'm not sure that's going to be true for everybody.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.560]   Do you ever think, ask yourself that question?
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.160]   - Yeah, he's a rare breed.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.200]   He's like a benign king.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.120]   Most people I meet who are like really powerful
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.740]   are like douchebags and that's how they got there.
[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.760]   I think that's, psychopaths have the advantage
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.360]   'cause they don't have feelings.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.760]   And Joe's a rare example.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.880]   He's just a powerhouse of will.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.520]   And I do think about that.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.720]   Yeah, I think I should be stopped right now.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.040]   Just stop me right now because yeah, power for me,
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.720]   I would, when people get power, they indulge.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.960]   I don't think it changes anyone.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.080]   It just reveals your darkest.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.040]   You know, people aren't supposed to have anything they want.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.520]   You gotta be able to struggle for everything.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.980]   So I would have a harem.
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.520]   I'd be like a Roman dictator.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.800]   Yeah, I'd be like a Roman emperor.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.520]   I mean, people call them emperors, they were dictators.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.360]   The most effective leaders are dictators.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.720]   I hope we get back to that.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.200]   Democracy hasn't worked.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.240]   I'm ready for a succession of Caesars
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.680]   and I wanna start with AOC.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.040]   (laughing)
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.560]   - It's true, dictators get the job done.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.480]   - They do, they do.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.400]   At certain point, you got,
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.240]   that's why social workers can only get you so far.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.600]   You need action.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.440]   I was a social worker for five years
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.180]   and all you do is ask about medications
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.660]   and you don't solve anything.
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.320]   - I do ask myself of that like,
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.320]   'cause I'm more in the tech space
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.080]   of constructing systems that prevent me from being corrupt.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.800]   'Cause right now I'm all about love
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.720]   and all about those kinds of things.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.920]   But I wonder, you said like, it just reveals the darkness.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.560]   The problem is we might not be aware of our own darkness.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.640]   I have the same feeling about money actually.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.140]   I've been avoiding thinking about money,
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.480]   like basically constructing my moral system,
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.300]   my moral compass around money.
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.980]   So like the moment I feel a little too happy,
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.740]   but about the idea of owning some cool shiny thing,
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.920]   I started to think, okay,
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.700]   I'm not gonna own that shiny thing
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.060]   'cause I'm afraid of the slippery slope of it.
[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.900]   - Yeah.
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:01.820]   - You ever think about that kind of stuff?
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:02.660]   - Yeah.
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.380]   The funny thing about the capitalist system is it's,
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:11.020]   it puts sort of a profit motive above beauty.
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.940]   And you notice when you see certain cities,
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.940]   especially in the old days where like buildings
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.260]   used to be beautiful.
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.100]   - Yeah.
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.500]   - And now they're just like boxes,
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.540]   they throw a kid up and it's just for all profit margin.
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.860]   It's the illusion of permanence that,
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.260]   it's like, oh, let me get as much money as I can.
[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.760]   You're like, yeah.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.700]   My dad used to say, everyone, it's a cliche,
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:32.780]   but you can't take it with you.
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.500]   So it's kind of, it's comical to me
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.540]   that we're here trying to get this infinite amount,
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.420]   like that we're climbing, it's like Sisyphus.
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.540]   We're all trying to climb this hill,
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.420]   but I mean, the rock's gonna fall on us.
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.380]   So I think that's a healthy outlook, yeah.
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.020]   - My dad always used to say before he passed,
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.980]   he would say, you can't, you have to survive
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.860]   not only physically, but you have to survive emotionally.
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.840]   I think a lot of people forget about the emotional part
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.060]   of survival.
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.220]   You have to survive emotionally and humor
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:03.020]   and understanding reality in its objective context
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:03.860]   helps with that.
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.980]   Accepting reality as this ephemeral thing
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.620]   that you're in really just a part of,
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.860]   but not as significant as your ego wants you to believe
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:14.980]   is a start.
[00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.740]   That's a good foundation for surviving emotionally.
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.780]   - What's that mean, surviving emotionally?
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.100]   Like what's an ideal life look like
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.340]   while you're thriving?
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.860]   - You can't take things too seriously
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.260]   because they're ephemeral.
[00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.100]   They're not permanent, nothing's permanent.
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.140]   Your bank account's not permanent.
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.300]   Your proms aren't permanent.
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.220]   Nothing's permanent.
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.020]   Your abilities aren't permanent.
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:36.220]   Your memory's not permanent.
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.060]   Your dick getting hard's not permanent.
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.620]   Can I curse on this or does this go out the door?
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.900]   (laughing)
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.180]   - Yeah. - You can curse
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.140]   to your heart's content.
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:43.980]   - Okay, yeah.
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.580]   I mean, gender's not even permanent anymore.
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.180]   I think I'm gonna change maybe
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.860]   and live my second half as another gender
[00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.140]   just to have, I'm bored with this gender.
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.340]   So it's like nothing is permanent.
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.180]   And so accepting that emotionally
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.500]   is a good start to being more flexible.
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.580]   You gotta be flexible.
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.220]   Like my dad used to say, "Anything too stiff snaps."
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.740]   You gotta, you know, it's a cliche
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:06.980]   and people have said it a bunch of different ways,
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:07.900]   but Bruce Lee's right, man.
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.940]   Be water, be water.
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.220]   (laughing)
[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:15.340]   - Yeah, Bukowski has this quote about love
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.100]   that love is a fog that fades
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.180]   with the first light of reality.
[00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.660]   So he's a romantic, that guy.
[00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.260]   But that even love is a thing
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.060]   that just doesn't last very long.
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.420]   You know, some people would disagree with that.
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.180]   Maybe it morphs, like water.
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.220]   It changes, right?
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.860]   It might not be, 'cause he's mostly
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.060]   just loved like prostitutes, I think.
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.860]   So-- - The best kind of love, yeah.
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.300]   - No demand, no responsibilities.
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.140]   - Yeah, it's a financial transaction.
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:44.980]   - Yeah.
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.940]   - Ephemeral as ever.
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.860]   You mentioned your dad.
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:54.260]   He passed away a year and a half ago.
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.340]   What did you learn from him?
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.660]   - I love my dad.
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.700]   My dad, I would say my dad was my hero.
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.860]   He was just, my dad really embodied those values.
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.700]   And I think for better or worse, it's made me who I am.
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.940]   He, my dad was a painter, he was a lawyer,
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.180]   he was a lieutenant in the military.
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.340]   - New Yorker?
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.980]   - New Yorker, born and bred Brooklyn.
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.020]   His dad, surprise, owned a diner.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.140]   So that's sort of the Greek passport.
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.140]   That's the immigration passport for Greeks in New America.
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.460]   And yeah, my dad played football.
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.380]   He just, my dad did what he wanted.
[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.220]   He lived as he wanted at all costs.
[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.380]   And I think I got that from him, for better or worse.
[00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.580]   I think it's hurt me in my pursuits.
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:43.580]   If you consider money and fame to be paramount,
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.580]   I've always done what I wanted.
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.780]   If I stopped wanting to do it, I just stopped doing it.
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:48.860]   And I think I got that from my dad.
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:52.060]   So maybe for better or worse, that's what I learned from him.
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.540]   But that's a real currency.
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.060]   Feeling like you're in love with what you're doing
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.300]   when you're doing it,
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.500]   maybe perhaps that's worth more than money.
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.100]   I don't know.
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.340]   - You miss him?
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.820]   - Yeah, every day, every day.
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:08.820]   But I'm happy that he got 91 years.
[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.700]   It's very rare.
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.980]   I mean, he smoked for 60 years.
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.100]   Talk about like a guy who was an outlier.
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.140]   I mean, he smoked like 60 years, like packs.
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.300]   I mean, and he didn't die from that.
[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.220]   He died, he had a prostate cancer,
[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.460]   which is the way men should go.
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.580]   Your dick should give out.
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.180]   It should start from the dick.
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:27.020]   I mean, we focus so much of our life on the dick
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.780]   that that's the way, that's a successful life.
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.940]   And that's why every man eventually gets prostate cancer
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.620]   'cause that is the universe's way of saying like,
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.740]   the thing you focused on the most is,
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.700]   you put the most energy into is the thing that's spent.
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.140]   And it's gonna, your rotting is gonna start there.
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.580]   So that's a successful life.
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.300]   And it just spread all over his body and he slowly died.
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.740]   I was with him when he died and that meant a lot to me.
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.540]   'Cause me and my brother weren't talking at the time
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.140]   'cause we're Greeks.
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.260]   We're talking again, but that's how it is.
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.500]   - You got a few brothers, right?
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.700]   - I got two brothers.
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.660]   But I wanted to make sure I was with him when he died
[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.820]   and I got lucky and I was in the room with him when he died.
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.540]   - You were in the room with your brother and you weren't?
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:07.500]   - No, my brother wasn't there.
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.620]   We were kind of doing shifts.
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.720]   I was there.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.700]   I spent the night, the night my dad died.
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.160]   He died early in the morning
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.180]   and I heard the death rattle of the last breath.
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:20.520]   And it was just, I think it was, he knew I was there.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.920]   And I think that just probably meant something to him.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.380]   And I'm just glad I was there.
[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.340]   - Does that make you sad that life is ephemeral,
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.180]   like you said?
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.780]   - Yeah. - That you die?
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:31.620]   - Yeah. - What do you think
[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:32.540]   about your own death?
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:33.980]   You meditate on that?
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.020]   - I think the actual, if there is a point to life,
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:42.020]   it's to hopefully not fear death, to accept reality.
[00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:45.020]   I think that's important.
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.340]   I think so much goes awry in the human condition
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.960]   when we lose touch with reality.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.540]   Every political system that's led to mass murder
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.100]   and everything, I think because it's,
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:01.020]   because the tenants of those political philosophies
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.460]   ended up being utopian.
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.740]   They were detached from reality, detached from nature.
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:09.580]   And so I think it's very important to accept
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.020]   and acknowledge your own mortality.
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.680]   I think it's the foundation for what makes a good person,
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.900]   a moral person, a contributing member of society,
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.240]   because it's true.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.720]   True things should be the foundation of all things.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.180]   If what you believe is based on illusion,
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.960]   you're gonna end up doing destruction.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.260]   Whether that destruction's on a scale of one to 10,
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.660]   you are going to be destructed because it's not real.
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.060]   It's a fantasy, it doesn't exist.
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.460]   - See, the thing is, though, truth is about,
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.740]   I don't think you can ever reach truth.
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.220]   Truth is about constantly digging.
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.900]   And to push back in your idea that you should accept death,
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.480]   I think the more honest response to death,
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.820]   so the least honest is to run away from it,
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.860]   create illusions that help you imagine
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.740]   that there's not a death.
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.420]   The next is to accept it,
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.340]   but the real honest one is to fear it.
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:01.180]   Because I mean, I'm with Ernest Becker,
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.900]   he's a philosopher,
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.820]   who wrote a book called "The Null of Death."
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:08.220]   He says that much of the human condition
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.200]   is based in the fear of mortality.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:15.020]   That's the creative force of the human energy.
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.140]   Like Freud said, "Do you wanna sleep with your mother?"
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.140]   He said, "No, that's not what motivates you."
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.820]   - Maybe his mom wasn't hot, though, I mean.
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.060]   - Or he wasn't Greek, 'cause apparently Oedipal,
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:28.100]   we found that all things good and bad, yeah.
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.940]   - Thanks, thanks for that.
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:30.780]   Thanks.
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:31.980]   - I just don't know if his mom was a looker or not.
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.100]   I mean, I'd have to Google it.
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:33.940]   - All right.
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.900]   I'll look up on Google Images.
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.980]   But I think the honest, as he says,
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:44.420]   the thing that we run away from is that there's a terror.
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.500]   He calls it like terror.
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.380]   There's something called terror management theory
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:52.300]   that some philosophers after him followed on
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.740]   that we're basically trying to run away from this fear.
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:59.940]   And acceptance is actually creating an illusion for yourself
[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.900]   like you can actually accept something
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.460]   as terrifying as this.
[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.380]   So he's more with the Stoics.
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.380]   The Stoic constantly meditate on their death.
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:09.620]   I mean, what does that mean?
[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:10.740]   I mean, it's kind of,
[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:15.900]   acceptance of death isn't a thing you do like on a Monday
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.100]   and then you're done.
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.180]   It's a thing you constantly have to meditate on,
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.820]   like reminding yourself.
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.820]   Like this ride is over.
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.220]   It could be over today.
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.620]   And that's something you're,
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.420]   if you think about every single day.
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.740]   - It gives you an appreciation of Woody Allen movies,
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.140]   at least.
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.140]   - It gives you appreciation of basically everything,
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.860]   including Woody Allen movies,
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:40.100]   which shows you how deep your appreciation for life could be.
[00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.620]   I've actually haven't been following much
[00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.180]   about what Woody Allen's,
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.460]   but apparently he's been a troublemaker
[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:46.620]   for most of his life.
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:47.540]   - He's, yeah.
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.540]   I mean, he's caused a little bit of strife.
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.860]   He's left a little, yeah.
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.220]   He's left a little confusion in his wake, for sure.
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.660]   But I mean, you know, that's another one.
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.620]   Separate the art from the artist.
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.820]   He's got, I mean, the guys will go down in history
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:01.900]   as the greatest.
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:04.620]   He's made, I mean, a movie a year and they're all,
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.740]   you can always find something good about each movie,
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.900]   like the dialogue or whatever.
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:09.860]   I love what you're saying.
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:10.700]   It's interesting.
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.340]   But the only thing I would say to push back a little bit,
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:14.300]   since we're playing a little table tennis here,
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.500]   is I don't know if it's a choice to fear death.
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.700]   That's more of an, it seems more instinctual.
[00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:23.020]   It seems like something that nature wants you to do,
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.420]   because I've been in positions
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.300]   where I thought I was gonna die, like I've been shot.
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.340]   And I had those moments.
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:32.740]   And then nature also, you know, kicks in an instinct,
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.380]   which is acceptance, where you kind of,
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.020]   I don't know, it's a chemical release or whatever.
[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:39.940]   I don't know, you know, we're robots, basically.
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.320]   So some sort of chemical is released that protects you.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.420]   But there is an acceptance.
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.300]   I don't know how much of it was a conscious choice,
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.460]   probably very little.
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.540]   And that's the point I'm making, is it's instinctual.
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.560]   We don't really have a choice in fearing death.
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.540]   Otherwise, there would be no progression.
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:59.860]   We wouldn't, all life seems to want to survive,
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.420]   not by choice, but by instinct.
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:06.100]   - So he argues that the fear is not the instinctual of it.
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.260]   It's not the animalistic stuff.
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.220]   That's the thing that makes it special,
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.780]   is the, what humans are able to do
[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.860]   is to have a knowledge that we're going to die one day.
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.020]   Animals don't have that.
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.140]   Animals' fear is instinctual.
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.420]   It's like, holy shit, what's that sound over there?
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:22.300]   He says we're actually able to contemplate
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.060]   the fact that this ride ends.
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:27.860]   And that kind of cognitive construct
[00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:29.300]   is difficult for us to deal with.
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.380]   Like, what the hell does that mean?
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:36.280]   Like, just to think about, it's going to be over
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.100]   at a certain point.
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.140]   It's just over, lights out.
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:44.260]   Like, it's very difficult to kind of load that into
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.140]   whatever this like little brain we got.
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:48.920]   Like, what does that actually mean?
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.500]   - Maybe that's what gives everything meaning.
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.340]   - Yeah.
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.220]   - Because if everything lasted forever,
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.560]   if this went on ad infinitum,
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:57.400]   there would be no meaning to it.
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.820]   It'd be like, hey, if I don't see you tomorrow,
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.320]   I'll see you in a million years.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.040]   There would be no meaning, there'd be no urgency.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.460]   There would be no feelings.
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:07.780]   There'd be nothing of magnitude or superficiality.
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.900]   It would all just be this kind of, it would be torture.
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.220]   It would actually, that would actually be torture
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:14.060]   to be here forever.
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.140]   I mean, I'm already sick of this place.
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.940]   And I'm just in my 40s, like I'm done.
[00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:21.540]   I'm sick of me, I'm sick of everything.
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.500]   - You know, a lot of people,
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.800]   when they talk about immortality,
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.460]   they consider mortality appealing
[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:31.980]   because you get a chance to do basically
[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.700]   all these things you might not get a chance to do otherwise.
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.700]   Like all the kinds of travel, broadly,
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.700]   explore, read every book, explore every idea,
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.940]   do every hobby, all those kinds of things.
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.020]   Somebody else I was talking to mentioned
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:50.740]   the reality of being immortal would be more likely,
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:53.140]   I like this idea, more likely would be
[00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.460]   you just sitting there doing nothing
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.140]   because, and putting off all that travel
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.060]   and exploration till later, because you'll always have time.
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.480]   And so what you're gonna have,
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.620]   what actual immortality would look like
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.940]   for a bunch of humans is people sitting there doing nothing.
[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.580]   - It'd be like a Greek caffeineer,
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.740]   just sitting around drinking coffee, watching, I love it.
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.580]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.100]   - I mean, it's a lazy man's paradise, yeah.
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:20.240]   - But it's so interesting 'cause that rings true to me
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.900]   for what humans are like is we'll basically
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.780]   just put off all those exciting adventures
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:28.580]   and just be lazy, become lazier and lazier and lazier
[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:29.700]   'cause you'll always have a chance
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.420]   to do all the exciting things.
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.780]   And we'll just get, we'll basically become Tim Dillon.
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.700]   We just sit there and have a podcast and that's it.
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.080]   - He works hard.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.340]   Yeah, I mean, that sounds actually like heaven, dude.
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:41.660]   That's speaking of my heart, really.
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:44.740]   I mean, I'm at heart, I'm a very lazy person.
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:47.660]   I always try to find ways to lie down.
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.260]   Like if I'm sitting, I'll figure out a way
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.220]   to kind of contort myself till later.
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.940]   That's an interesting thing to like, yeah,
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:58.940]   if you can always push something off, yeah, I like that.
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:00.820]   I think that's heaven.
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.540]   - See, we just changed your mind.
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:04.940]   You kind of like the immortality.
[00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.020]   - Yeah, I kind of like it.
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.220]   No, so there'll be no thirsts, no,
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.060]   you can always put it off.
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:12.020]   Yeah, I wanna bang this girl.
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.900]   You're like, I'll put it off.
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.300]   But now I'm thinking about Muslim heaven
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.780]   and they may be offering the best deal.
[00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.300]   I mean, if it was an expo and they had a booth,
[00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:25.220]   I may go with them because they offer 62 or 72,
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.300]   but then I'd get sick of them.
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.180]   I'd wanna, I don't know.
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:31.660]   I always wondered like, are you given the 62 versions
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:34.180]   or you choose, can you create them like an avatar,
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.660]   like a video game, or are you just given?
[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.500]   - I don't know what the number,
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.100]   why it's important to have that high number.
[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.380]   First of all, I think it's a mistranslation
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.460]   about the versions, but outside of that,
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:47.140]   outside of that, I feel like the conversation
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:47.980]   is really important.
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.540]   I don't think they ever specify like what kind of books
[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:54.780]   these girls read, like what are they into?
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.100]   Like the quality of the conversation,
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.620]   I think if you're talking about eternity,
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.580]   the quality of the intellect and the conversation
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.260]   and the personalities is way more important.
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.540]   - And the Greeks have an ancient expression,
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.500]   "Pan metro nariston," which my mother always used to say,
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.540]   which is everything in moderation, nothing in excess.
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.900]   So try and always get the status quo.
[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.060]   And yeah, that many women,
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.260]   eventually it's like the Magic Johnson effect,
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.620]   Isaiah Thomas effect, it's just too much.
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.100]   And you're gonna end up banging a dude is what I'm saying.
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.380]   You're gonna get sick of it 'cause it's too much.
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.860]   And there's going to be a eunuch
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.420]   that finds its way into your harem.
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.860]   That's been proven throughout history, every empire,
[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:33.860]   when you have all that power.
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:35.860]   And again, this goes back to power corrupting.
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:39.420]   If you have, if there's no struggle, there's no meaning,
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:41.300]   the value is from the journey,
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.020]   the working hard, the struggle.
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.780]   And if it's just given to you because you're a sultan
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.220]   or you're Alexander the Great or whatever,
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.500]   you're gonna get bored and you're gonna bang a dude.
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.660]   I think that's a scientific axiom, actually.
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.620]   Eventually you'll get bored and bang a dude.
[00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.380]   - Yeah, but I think it won't stop there.
[00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.300]   I think you'll go to animals, you'll go to robot.
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.260]   I mean, eventually it all ends up in robots
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.380]   and then the robots rebel
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.860]   and then the humans will be destroyed.
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:04.820]   - Yeah.
[00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:05.660]   - I'm sorry.
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:10.540]   If we're speaking truth, you said the value of life,
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.280]   one of the highest ideals is to seek truth.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.120]   I think if we're being honest.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.060]   - Can I ask you a quick question?
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:18.180]   If you live in a small, I come from small islands, right?
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.220]   And so there's a stereotype
[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:20.300]   that that's where they bang animals.
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.220]   But if you come from a very small community,
[00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:24.060]   you know, an island or something,
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:26.100]   and you have the choice of banging a family member
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.780]   or an animal, which one is worse on the moral scale?
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.900]   'Cause you're technically not related to the animal.
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.180]   - Right, this is interesting.
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:35.320]   I mean, all of these are human constructs, these ideas,
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.660]   but for me personally,
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:40.780]   taboo would be more taboo to have sex with a family member.
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:41.620]   - Yeah.
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:42.460]   - I mean, animal, I mean, okay.
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.900]   - It's good to know where you stand on that.
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.420]   I think your viewers, you know,
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:48.380]   if they didn't know they had that question,
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.620]   they just learned a little bit about you and now I know.
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.580]   - I look forward to the internet clipping that out.
[00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:55.240]   (both laughing)
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.940]   Yeah, I mean, there is, listen,
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.940]   outside of that, I do think about that a lot.
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:06.500]   It sounds ridiculous about morality connected to animals
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.940]   in terms of all the factory farming and so on.
[00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:11.940]   It seems like that's one of the things we'll look,
[00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:15.540]   'cause I love meat, but I kind of feel bad about it.
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:20.060]   And bad in a way where I think if we look
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.620]   like 100 years from now, we'll look back at this time
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:28.420]   as like one of the great like tortures and injustices
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.340]   that we humans have committed.
[00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.020]   And I mean, all that has to do with the sex of the animal
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.960]   has to do with consent and about the experience
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.660]   of suffering of animals.
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.700]   The reason I think about that personally a lot,
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.200]   'cause I think about robotics,
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:46.260]   I think about creating artificial consciousnesses,
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:51.020]   artificial like beings that have some elements
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.180]   of the human nature.
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:53.980]   And then you start to think like,
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:55.420]   well, what does it mean to suffer?
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.580]   What does it mean for entity to exist
[00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:00.740]   such that it deserves rights?
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.980]   This is something that the founding fathers
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:06.140]   were thinking about like, all men are created equal.
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.220]   What is it?
[00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:08.940]   Which, who is included in the men,
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.680]   who is not in that sentence?
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.500]   And are animals included in that, are robots?
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.860]   I honestly think that there will be a civil rights movement
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.460]   for robots in the future.
[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:19.900]   - Holy shit. - I don't know.
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.940]   - Is that the Turing test, the way you try to,
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.100]   is that what they call it, where you're trying to,
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:27.500]   it's see if AI can think like a human or whatever,
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.780]   or feel like a human?
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.820]   - Well, the Turing test closely defined
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.540]   is more about talk like a human.
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:38.760]   So you can imagine systems that are able to,
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.180]   you can have a conversation like this,
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.980]   and I would be a robot, for example.
[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:43.580]   But that doesn't mean I would,
[00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:48.060]   in society, that doesn't mean I deserve rights.
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.900]   Or that doesn't mean I would be conscious.
[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.560]   It doesn't mean that I would be able to suffer
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.740]   and to experience pleasure and dream
[00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.700]   and all those kinds of human things.
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.660]   The question isn't whether you're able to talk,
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.300]   which is passed in the Turing test.
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:04.700]   The question is whether you're able to feel,
[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:08.580]   to be, I mean, I go back to suffering.
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:12.560]   The thing that our documents protect us against
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.500]   is suffering.
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:16.880]   Like we don't want humans to suffer.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.100]   And if a robot can suffer,
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.880]   that discussion starts being about,
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.260]   like, well, shouldn't we protect them?
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.960]   Currently, we don't protect animals.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.280]   - We protect that, dogs.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.160]   There's laws, there's actual legislation
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.040]   that protects dogs in certain places.
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:34.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.700]   And you know what?
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.320]   Dogs is something I don't think people
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.760]   really understand enough about.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:39.880]   It's one of my obsessions.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:44.240]   So they, my dad always used to say,
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:47.000]   he'd go, "Those things are basically human."
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.920]   And I mean, they dream, they have anxiety.
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.340]   And what people often overlook about dogs
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.120]   is without dogs, we wouldn't be here.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.600]   We would not have ever evolved
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:02.920]   from hunter-gatherer to agrarian to civilization.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.860]   We wouldn't have cities, we wouldn't have anything.
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:08.940]   I mean, they are our partner in survival
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:10.520]   and they are a magical animal.
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.320]   There's no animal that was, it was like destiny almost.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.680]   I mean, a malleable animal.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.500]   There's no animal that's that malleable
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.300]   that in a few generations,
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.620]   you can tailor to a specific job that you need.
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.280]   And without that animal,
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.640]   without dogs doing that animal,
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:30.640]   protecting our crops from scavengers and stuff like that,
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.980]   the list goes on, we wouldn't be here.
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:37.500]   So we, that's an often overlooked fact
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:41.720]   that human evolution was not done in a vacuum
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.560]   just with humans.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.240]   I mean, without dogs, we would have never evolved.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.580]   I mean, we weren't the apex predator
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:46.440]   for most of our existence.
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.920]   We weren't even the apex predator.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.380]   I mean, we're getting eaten by hyenas,
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:50.720]   which my favorite animal.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.580]   And that's kind of an injustice to,
[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:54.380]   I mean, I'm kind of mad at dogs.
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:55.720]   We deserve to get eaten by hyenas,
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.060]   but without dogs, we wouldn't be here.
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:00.760]   And dogs deserve the protection.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.600]   So do horses.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.260]   They fucking lugged us around for thousands of years.
[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:06.300]   And now these fucking German psychopaths
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.840]   are eating them or whatever.
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.740]   We should not eat horse meat just on like,
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:11.780]   be a good dude, man.
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:13.500]   These things lugged us around for generations.
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.940]   They're beautiful.
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.460]   Ride them or I don't know.
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.860]   I don't know, but it rubs me the wrong way
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.040]   that we eat horses.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.280]   - Yeah, the horse is one is interesting.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.920]   And one of my favorite books is "Animal Farm" by Orwell.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.120]   And the horses don't get a good ending in that.
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:31.560]   I kind of, my spirit animal, I suppose,
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:34.200]   is the horse from "Animal Farm" boxer,
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.320]   where he says, "I will work harder."
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.600]   That's his motto.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.160]   I work really hard at stupid things.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.640]   That's basically what I do.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.940]   I just hit my head against the wall
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.120]   for no reason whatsoever.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.180]   - But that probably fulfills,
[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:47.020]   you have a big brain.
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.040]   You were probably born with a big brain
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:48.880]   that kind of fulfills--
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.200]   - It's killing neurons.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.520]   - It's exercise for you.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:52.360]   - Yes.
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.760]   - Don't you think some animals deserve to be eaten though?
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.760]   Kind of like--
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.120]   - Hyenas?
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:57.960]   - Come on, dude.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.160]   I mean, you gotta respect the hyena.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.560]   - Okay, so let's, first of all,
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.920]   let me just comment on the dog thing.
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.940]   There is conferences on dog cognition
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:08.920]   from a perspective of people that study psychology,
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.520]   cognitive science, neuroscience.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.240]   Dogs are fascinating.
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.520]   The way they move their eyes, they're able to,
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.900]   they're the only other animal besides humans
[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:18.820]   that are able to communicate with their eyes.
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.180]   They can look at a thing and look back at you
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.380]   and look back at the thing to communicate
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:25.540]   that we're all like, through our eyes,
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.980]   communicate that we're collaborating.
[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:29.540]   So every other animal uses their eyes
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.420]   to actually look at things.
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:35.340]   The dogs use it to like communicate with us humans.
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.160]   It's fascinating.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.740]   There's a lot of other elements of dogs that are amazing.
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.780]   - Yeah, I mean, if it wasn't for them,
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:41.620]   they're the ones,
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.660]   they were our first alarm system for predators.
[00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:44.520]   They would defend us.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.440]   I mean, the Basenji is one of the most ancient dogs.
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.480]   I mean, they're tiny, but they're fearless.
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.720]   And they would chase off lions.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:50.920]   Like, you know, there'd be packs of them
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.320]   and they'd chase off lions and protect the tribes.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.840]   I even get tingles like thinking about dogs
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.120]   'cause I have a dog, I love my dog.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.920]   It's just, and there's something about
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.920]   when you're walking with your dog off leash in the woods,
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.960]   it like, there's something about it
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.960]   that's like, that tugs at that
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.080]   millions of years of evolution, like that gut, you know?
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.200]   It's like, I had a Finnish friend of mine, he's a comic,
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.840]   Tommy Valamis once told me, he was like,
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.380]   he was like, the gut, he's like, I believe in it.
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.240]   Like that gut, you know, when you have that feeling,
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:23.700]   he's like, always trust that because that is million,
[00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.520]   those are all your ancestors.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.780]   That's the survival instinct of all your ancestors
[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:31.240]   at the beginning of time, you know, telling you like,
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.760]   hey, something's off here, something's, you know,
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.480]   so don't get in the car with Ted Bundy
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.320]   is what I'm saying, ladies.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.240]   How fucking stupid, how can you fall for that?
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.660]   You know, he's got a fucking sling on, don't get in.
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.500]   - Yeah, follow the gut.
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:46.200]   My question to you, are psychopaths essentially robots?
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.960]   - So first of all, let's not, you're using the word robot
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:52.960]   in a derogatory way that I'm triggered by, okay?
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.440]   - Yeah, and you should be. - So I feel offended.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.040]   - You should be because you know what?
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.440]   People are always scared of robots, but I actually,
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:04.000]   I have, I've made the sort of, I've made it the,
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.160]   hey, I've thought about it,
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.480]   I'm like, robots have been nothing but helpful.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.560]   It's the people we should be scared of.
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.360]   Again, we're kind of missing the most destructive thing,
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.220]   is us, 'cause it's, but robots are helpful.
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:16.960]   I mean, this is a fucking robot.
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.380]   You know, I went on hotel tonight, I'm already booked up.
[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.300]   You know, I got my, I can change my flight.
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:23.340]   If this barbecue with Rogan goes 16 hours,
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:24.860]   which whatever Rogan wants to do,
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.140]   I'll do if he wants to kick me in the chest,
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:28.900]   I'll let him kick me in the chest, whatever.
[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.500]   Robots are helpful, no?
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.060]   - Yeah, tanks and autonomous weapon systems
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:35.700]   don't kill people, people kill people.
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.180]   - People kill people, yeah. - Yeah, that's.
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:40.420]   - Yeah, the NRA's about to click that for you.
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:43.340]   (laughing)
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:45.660]   A lot of love for dogs, I appreciate it very much.
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.740]   And at the same time, you have the other thing
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:50.340]   that people seem to have love for, which is cats.
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:53.180]   And on the flip side of everything you've said,
[00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:56.620]   I'm trying to understand what have cats ever done
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:58.000]   for human civilization?
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.380]   - They keep rodents away.
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:01.220]   The domesticated cat is very important,
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:02.160]   keeps rodents away.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.900]   Yeah, that's what they were domesticated for.
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.460]   I mean, there's psychopathic killers
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:10.460]   who end up killing innocent neighborhood chipmunks
[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:15.900]   and birds, they really affect the balance
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.400]   of the local ecosystem, but.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.140]   - If you have love for cats too.
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:21.260]   - Not as much as dogs.
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:23.580]   I mean, dogs are, like you said, they look at humans.
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:24.980]   I actually read an article there,
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:27.100]   some people were theorizing they're smarter than chimps
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:29.140]   because of the way they can work with humans.
[00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:32.340]   And there was one border collie that spoke like 300 words,
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:35.300]   like a quarter, like almost part of the language.
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.340]   And their nose is like a, I mean, that's like magic, dude.
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:41.320]   If you can smell in my ass to what I had for breakfast
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:42.540]   from miles away.
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:43.380]   - That's intelligence.
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:44.540]   - That's intelligence.
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.820]   I mean, in some ways that their nose,
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:47.980]   if you were to put it on a scale,
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.580]   maybe their nose is more intelligent than our brain
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:51.980]   for what it does.
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:53.680]   You know, it's like, I mean, dude,
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.020]   they can smell you from miles away.
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.380]   You ever see a dog just like sniffing, catching?
[00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:59.080]   I mean, it's smelling like,
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.180]   I don't remember the date on it,
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.500]   but it's like they have like millions of receptors
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.100]   or something where we only, you know, thank God
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:07.140]   we don't have their nose.
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.260]   That would be, that would make sex weird.
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:12.500]   Be a little too intense.
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.140]   - I think you mentioned when you were talking
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:19.380]   about Woody Allen separating the art from the artist.
[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:21.380]   So that brings to mind Vladimir Putin.
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:25.740]   How about that transition?
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:26.580]   I don't know.
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.980]   I'm so sorry.
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:32.820]   But if you look at just powerful leaders
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.900]   throughout history, Stalin, Hitler,
[00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:37.460]   but even model ones like Putin,
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.180]   and we're talking about power,
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:42.220]   how do you explain them?
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:47.140]   You said that power reveals, not corrupts.
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:50.340]   But do you think there's some element
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:52.180]   to which power corrupted Hitler,
[00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:55.260]   power corrupted Stalin after he gained power?
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:56.780]   And the same with Putin.
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.540]   When Putin gained power in 2000,
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:00.780]   do you think the amount of power
[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:03.140]   that he was in possession with for many years,
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:04.740]   do you think that corrupted him?
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:07.700]   I mean, we're joking about dictators get the job done.
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:11.060]   There is some sense in certain countries
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:15.740]   where dictator is the only thing
[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:17.500]   that can stabilize a nation.
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:22.580]   The counter argument to that for democracies is like,
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:24.900]   yeah, but that's a short-term solution
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:26.380]   for a long-term problem.
[00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:28.940]   So you want to embrace chaos of democracy.
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:30.380]   That might be violent.
[00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:34.620]   There might be a lot of just constant changing
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:35.460]   of leadership.
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:37.220]   There might be a lot of corruption in the short-term,
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:42.220]   but if you stay strong with the ideals of democracy,
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:45.940]   then you'll ultimately create something
[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:48.980]   that as beautiful and stable as the United States.
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:53.620]   - The sad thing is, is I don't know
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:55.980]   if history tells that story.
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.900]   It's like I said, you look at Greece, you look at Rome,
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.660]   democracy kind of failed.
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:03.020]   The majority of Rome, the most successful empire
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:09.020]   that we've had was a dictatorship for most of its run.
[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:12.620]   But I do believe in a republic,
[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.460]   which is sort of a limited democracy.
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:17.100]   I do believe in what we have here.
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:17.980]   I believe in common law.
[00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:21.740]   I believe in individual rights.
[00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:25.060]   But yeah, I think you said it.
[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.420]   Nobody could have said it better.
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.780]   Yeah, it's a short-term solution.
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:32.740]   You look at Saddam Hussein, he kind of,
[00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:35.940]   when we took him out, then there was a lot of infighting
[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:38.980]   that happened that he was kind of keeping at bay
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:43.300]   because he was a strong man, dictator.
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.420]   - Well, he's an interesting one.
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.020]   Sorry to interrupt.
[00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:48.300]   From my understanding, I'm sure people will correct me,
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.300]   but when Saddam Hussein first came to power,
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.620]   he was quite progressive.
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:58.820]   So as far as I understand,
[00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:03.060]   the signs of an evil dictator weren't exactly there.
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:07.300]   So again, I don't know if power revealed or power corrupted.
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:09.220]   - Or that could have been the initial subterfuge
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.060]   to kind of get everybody.
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:13.220]   Hitler also is a champion of the people.
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:14.500]   Let's build some new roads.
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:15.660]   It's what psychopaths do.
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.100]   And that's why it's interesting to me.
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:20.380]   I'm not sure if power corrupts psychopaths.
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:22.180]   And now that we know that we can do these CAT scans
[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:25.620]   and brain scans, again, we know that they're born that way.
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:28.020]   Power definitely corrupts people
[00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:33.020]   who have the capacity to feel and for empathy.
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.500]   Power, I'm not sure.
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.620]   I don't think power corrupts people
[00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:40.260]   who were born psychopathic with that condition
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:44.460]   or sociopaths who were closer to psychopaths
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:46.100]   and then had some traumatic life.
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:50.100]   I just think the best way to get away
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:53.340]   with whatever nefarious thing you wanna do to feel,
[00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:54.860]   I guess the only thing psychopaths can feel
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:56.220]   is that excitement,
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.860]   is to pretend to be the opposite of what you are.
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.620]   That's what killers do.
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:01.580]   That's what the worst people do.
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:02.800]   Look at Bill Cosby.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:07.260]   I mean, he was, what better way to hide?
[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:08.700]   It's like what wokeness is now.
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:09.980]   It's like, I'm such a great person.
[00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:11.740]   And you're like, are ya?
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:14.300]   It's a great, the best way to hide
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.020]   is to pretend to be the opposite of what you are.
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:16.860]   Just like Ted Bundy.
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:18.820]   I'm just an innocent, helpful guy.
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:20.140]   And then boom, next thing you know,
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:21.460]   you're getting your tit bit off.
[00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:22.340]   - That's really well said.
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:23.420]   It's actually kind of funny
[00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:25.740]   because I talk about love a lot.
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:28.820]   And I think the people that kind of look at me
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:31.820]   with squinty eyes, they wonder,
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:34.660]   like how many bodies are in that closet?
[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:35.780]   You know what I mean?
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:38.460]   There's something about the duality of like,
[00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.300]   we're so skeptical as a culture.
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:44.980]   Like if somebody just seems to be kind of sort of,
[00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:47.900]   I don't know, positive
[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.820]   and all that kind of, how do I put it?
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:55.300]   Just simple, simple-minded in the positivity they express.
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:58.060]   They think like, there's some demons in there.
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:59.340]   - Yeah, especially if you're a New Yorker,
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:00.220]   we don't trust any,
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.260]   the nicer you are, the more skeptical we are.
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:03.460]   I've struggled with that down here.
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:04.580]   I've been like, what's your angle?
[00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:05.420]   And they're like, nah, dude,
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:07.660]   just I wanted to show you the best tacos, man.
[00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:09.980]   And I'm like, did you really, what do you want?
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:10.860]   'Cause in New York, it's like,
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:13.180]   if anyone's nice to you, they want something.
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:16.420]   And that's, the pro side to that
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:17.980]   is it makes you very street smart.
[00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:21.020]   The downside to that is it makes you way too cynical.
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:23.420]   - Yeah, I've definitely experienced that here in Texas,
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:25.980]   but people are super, super nice.
[00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:27.780]   And they're like, do all this cool shit for you.
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:32.420]   And you wonder, what's the angle?
[00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:33.460]   What are we doing here?
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:35.820]   You mentioned hyenas as your favorite animal.
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:39.620]   I forgot to ask you, what the hell were you thinking?
[00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:41.460]   Why is hyenas your favorite animal?
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:45.500]   - Yeah, it's a fascinating animal.
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:46.940]   Let's look at the whole animal kingdom.
[00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:50.420]   Like why, where do you put, so you like dogs.
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:51.460]   - Love, my favorite.
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:52.900]   - Your favorite is dogs.
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.700]   But they're kind of outside the animal kingdom
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.540]   'cause you're thinking about wolves.
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:59.100]   So the animal kingdom is in nature.
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.260]   Dogs escaped nature.
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:02.940]   - They kind of did, yeah.
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.940]   - Together with humans, like in a collaborative way.
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:05.980]   Exactly.
[00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:08.980]   So within nature, within the animal kingdom,
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:11.900]   what, who's, why not lions?
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:13.940]   - 'Cause lions are predictable.
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:16.900]   Lions are just, they're regal and kind of, they bore me.
[00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:18.140]   It's like the hot chick.
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:19.620]   It's like, we get it.
[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:22.780]   You were born the best.
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:26.500]   I like a scrappy, by any means necessary,
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.380]   intelligent and cunning.
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.580]   - But aren't they dishonest?
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:32.940]   - Yeah, and that's why I like 'em.
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:34.860]   Yes, they're dishonest.
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:37.100]   They employ chicanery.
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:41.140]   And that's just a sign of how intelligent they are
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:43.060]   and how self-reliant they are
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:45.220]   and how brutal they are.
[00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:49.020]   They're brutally honest in how much they lie.
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:52.300]   Because it's just, they're trying to get the job done.
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.260]   Lions are just like, they're too gifted.
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:57.500]   Everyone hates the fucking,
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:58.580]   if I went to school with you,
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:00.780]   I'd be like, of course Lex knows the fucking answer.
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:02.740]   Lex was born smarter than me.
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.380]   And you'd probably hate me
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:06.540]   because I was the kid always seeking attention
[00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:09.300]   and making people, it's like, that's not interesting.
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.140]   The guy that claws his way to the top,
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:12.500]   and those are hyenas.
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:16.300]   They're also fascinating just by merely who they are.
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:19.460]   I mean, they're not related to any other animal.
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:21.940]   They're more closely related to cats
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:23.900]   than they are dogs, even though they look more like a dog.
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:25.980]   Yeah, but they're very,
[00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:28.740]   like very tangentially related even to cats.
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:30.780]   So they're their own kind of thing,
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:31.880]   which is kind of mysterious.
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.700]   I don't think they've fully figured out.
[00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:37.020]   And the pseudopenis thing is the, I mean,
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:37.860]   it is the talk of-- - Can you explain
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:39.140]   the pseudopenis?
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:42.020]   - Yeah, so it's a matriarchal society, by the way.
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:44.140]   So that's the unique in and of itself.
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:48.060]   We're talking about an apex predator that is matriarchal,
[00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:49.980]   much like the praying mantis.
[00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:51.100]   It's very rare though.
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:53.500]   And they are fucking brutal and vicious.
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:56.380]   And the women are bigger and they let their cubs fight,
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:57.540]   a lot of fratricide.
[00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:58.580]   And they do that because they're like,
[00:39:58.580 --> 00:39:59.820]   "Hey, you're weaker.
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:01.380]   "I'd let your brother kill you."
[00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:03.700]   And the women have penises.
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:06.220]   The women have pseudopenises that they give birth out of.
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.540]   And the birth is violent,
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:10.580]   but they roll around with just huge pieces.
[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:13.100]   They're glue guns who just fucking swinging.
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.700]   And the women are just run the show.
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:19.020]   And it's just cool that they have these pseudopenises.
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:21.740]   (laughing)
[00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:23.460]   - It's almost romantic the way you describe it.
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:25.420]   - They have the strongest bite force.
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:26.820]   They pulverize bone.
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:29.420]   Like when they eat an animal, the animal's gone.
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:30.660]   There's no bones.
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:31.820]   They eat everything.
[00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.100]   They can pulverize.
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:36.660]   Their bite is so powerful, they pulverize bone and eat it.
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:38.460]   So if they consume an animal,
[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:40.300]   the animal was there and then the animal's gone.
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:44.860]   There's nothing for the vultures there to grab.
[00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:46.460]   - Yeah, I'm gonna have to revisit the hyenas
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:50.220]   because my experience with the hyenas was from,
[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:52.700]   first of all, "History of the Hyenas," your show,
[00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:55.140]   has rebranded them for me.
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:41:00.140]   But "The Lion King," which is a cartoon, I guess,
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:03.900]   that I get emotional at every time.
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:06.460]   I probably have father issues.
[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:07.980]   Every guy.
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:09.620]   - You probably just have feelings.
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:10.460]   You're a good guy.
[00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:11.300]   I mean, everyone gets that.
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:12.140]   - I have feelings? - Yeah, you have feelings.
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:13.220]   - That one gets everybody.
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:14.260]   I don't know.
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.300]   I get every father-son movie,
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:20.820]   like "Blow," "Wajani Depp," and "Ray Liotta."
[00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:22.020]   Damn, that's a good movie.
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:26.780]   And whenever there's the disappointment in the father
[00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:31.780]   that his son has become this incredibly successful drug lord
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:35.860]   that then ends up with nothing in prison,
[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:38.960]   just the sadness of them communicating through letters,
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.380]   man, that gets me every time.
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:47.020]   But the hyenas are not presented that well in that.
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:49.740]   - No, they're usually portrayed as like,
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.700]   it's really sad that they're portrayed that way.
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:54.860]   The lions, like lions aren't dicks.
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:56.180]   Lions are dicks.
[00:41:56.180 --> 00:42:00.900]   The alpha lions will kill the cubs of another rival.
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:02.940]   They do all types of dick shit.
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:06.060]   And yeah, the hyenas are more interesting.
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:08.340]   Like they'll just roll in, like a hyena will,
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:09.840]   like you said, they'll lie.
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:12.480]   'Cause when you watch the "Serengeti,"
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:15.240]   animals will hang out with each other, by water.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:17.040]   So one hyena will just kind of roll in
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:20.480]   and pretend like it's not hungry, and then bang.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:24.120]   They'll use any means necessary to take an animal down.
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.200]   Lions will just use brute strength.
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.120]   Hyenas use cunning.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:31.000]   And you can even go on the internet and find memes of this
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.200]   where hyenas will grab the big animal by the balls
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:36.880]   and just like will sneak up behind it and bite its balls.
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:40.300]   And you'll watch an animal 10 times the size of the hyena
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:41.940]   just slowly go down.
[00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:44.840]   It's brutal, but it's fucking hilarious.
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.260]   (laughing)
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:51.260]   - I think that's, I don't know if you follow the channel,
[00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:52.720]   Nature's Metal.
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:55.760]   That one weighs heavy on me.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.400]   With the hyenas and the balls.
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:03.600]   It's tough to intellectualize it.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:07.600]   It's tough to think that the entirety of life on earth
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:12.600]   has this history of predators being violent.
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:17.080]   Just like just the murder that we come from.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:18.180]   It's crazy.
[00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:22.480]   Just like we were talking about meditating on death.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.680]   I actually, I keep following and unfollowing
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.960]   that Instagram channel because sometimes it's too much.
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.500]   Like I can't continue with the day
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:34.920]   after like seeing the brutality, the honest brutality of that.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.400]   I don't know how to make sense of it.
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:37.800]   - It's important to acknowledge, I think,
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:38.960]   'cause it's real.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.240]   That we do come from that.
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.640]   We evolve from that.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:43.480]   It's important.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.240]   We still do that, we're just hidden from it.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.480]   You know, when you go to the supermarket
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.900]   and get your slab of meat, you're so disconnected
[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:51.680]   from where that meat came from.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:52.760]   It came from that.
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.280]   And often that's uglier to watch
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.200]   than because there's some honesty.
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:01.380]   - The nature channels only show,
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:03.260]   that's why we have so much sympathy with the prey.
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:04.380]   And this is where I think,
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:05.620]   the same thing with mafia movies.
[00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:06.940]   They don't show what the mafia really does.
[00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:08.300]   They glorify the good parts.
[00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:09.420]   That's why I like "State of Grace"
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.380]   'cause it's really just shaking down old people
[00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:12.860]   and fucking being dicks.
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:15.100]   It's not driving nice cars and being like, you know.
[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:16.940]   So, and animal channels do the same thing.
[00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:19.860]   They only show when the cheetah gets it
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:22.060]   because that's the exciting part.
[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:23.820]   But what most people don't know is that
[00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:27.220]   those predators strike out almost always.
[00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:29.880]   A majority of the time, the prey wins.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:32.120]   And so if you saw that and put in context,
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:34.400]   you might not hate it as much
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:37.720]   when the predator actually gets the little fawn or whatever
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.480]   because it's so many fawns got away.
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.840]   It's so hard to capture your prey.
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:43.940]   And you know, we don't have the,
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:47.040]   they, no documentary is gonna sit around
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:51.600]   and show you the 99 times the cheetah didn't catch.
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:52.800]   - Thank you for this perspective.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:54.000]   That's murder is difficult.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.520]   So like, this is the,
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.720]   they never talk about for people who murder,
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:00.000]   how difficult that is.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.340]   Like to trap somebody,
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:04.160]   to convince them to come back to your place.
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.000]   - Give it some respect,
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.560]   put some respect on Ted Bundy's name.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:08.120]   Yeah, it's not easy to convince somebody
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:10.120]   to get in your Volkswagen Beagle and-
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:11.420]   - The cleanup.
[00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:13.240]   And then you have to kind of plan ahead
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.280]   'cause you wanna keep doing the murder, mass murder.
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.640]   - You gotta learn how to saw 'em up,
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:18.440]   put 'em in duffel bags, bury.
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:19.280]   You gotta learn how to dig.
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:20.280]   You gotta learn how to hide.
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:21.280]   You gotta learn to lie.
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.600]   I mean, it's a lot that goes into it
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.800]   that we need to put a little respect on, yeah.
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:26.800]   - Yeah, and you have to figure out
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.080]   which tools work the best for the sawing
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.640]   and all those kinds of things.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:33.320]   So thank you for the perspective.
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:36.860]   That's what I was hoping we would bring to this table.
[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:38.320]   - That's what I'm here for, yeah.
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:42.380]   - So you got a little bit Greek in you.
[00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:47.480]   One of the episodes on "History of Hyenas,"
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.440]   you talked about the Battle of Crete,
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.920]   where the Greeks, your people,
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:59.960]   in 1941, in the early stages of World War II,
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:03.160]   is one of the most epic battles of the war.
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:07.540]   In fact, in 1941, in a speech made at the Reichstag,
[00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:10.200]   Hitler paid tribute to the bravery of the Greeks,
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.920]   saying, "It must be said,
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:15.280]   "for the sake of historical truth,
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:17.680]   "that amongst all our opponents,
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:20.620]   "only the Greeks fought with the endless courage
[00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:22.820]   "and defiance of death."
[00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:24.660]   So, okay, what do you make of this battle?
[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:27.140]   What do you make of the spirit of the Greek people?
[00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:28.860]   - This is one of the closest things to me
[00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:33.260]   because my mother was actually on the island of Crete
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:36.380]   during this, the first aerial invasion in history.
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:37.360]   A lot of people don't know that.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.920]   So this is a very significant battle.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:42.220]   First time there was an invasion from the sky.
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:45.120]   And my mother was a little girl
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:48.320]   and she lived through four years of Nazi occupation there.
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:50.120]   So my mother was a human rights lawyer and everything,
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:51.880]   but she just always hated Germans.
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:53.120]   It's just what it is.
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:55.400]   She hated Germans and she never got over it.
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:57.460]   So the most progressive, open-minded woman
[00:46:57.460 --> 00:46:58.920]   just could not get over this.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:02.880]   It's a monumental battle that a lot of historians,
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:05.360]   in retrospect, have now looked back on
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:07.520]   and said, "Because the Nazis,"
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:08.640]   first off, you gotta take it back
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:10.920]   to when Hitler instructed Mussolini,
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:12.640]   'cause let's be honest, Mussolini was Hitler's bitch.
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.480]   You know what I mean?
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:17.600]   Like if it was Fantasy Island, Hitler was the fucking,
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:19.440]   and Mussolini was boss, the plane guy.
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:22.240]   - Mussolini ever say no to Hitler or even maybe,
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:23.600]   it's always like, "Yes."
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:26.080]   - Yes, yes, we will do it.
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:29.240]   And it's like, yeah, you have to take Greece.
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:32.240]   And so, yeah.
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.280]   So Italy being much bigger than Greece,
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:37.800]   Greece is a tiny country, nine, 10 million.
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.320]   So Italy invaded Greece,
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.720]   and Hockey Day's a big, it's a big holiday for Greeks.
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:47.760]   And this speaks to the spirit.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:51.000]   Greeks infight until we have a common enemy,
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.880]   and then we unite.
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:56.000]   You see it throughout history, Sparta and Athens.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.360]   You see it in Greek families,
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:47:59.320]   where the brothers will fight,
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:02.280]   but then as soon as we have a common enemy, we unite.
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.920]   And maybe it's an overactive brain,
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:06.400]   we think too much, our tradition's philosophy,
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.320]   and we overthink things, and we fight with each other
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:10.640]   and take things personally, we're ultra passionate.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:15.040]   But when Italy said, "Hey, we're gonna move troops through,"
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:18.240]   a Greek said, "Oki," which means no.
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:20.800]   And that was, and then Italy attacked,
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:24.080]   and we beat the shit out of them.
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:28.480]   A much bigger country, much more well-equipped country.
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:29.480]   Greece beat the shit out of them,
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:31.120]   kicked them back into Albania,
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.240]   actually not only repelled them,
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:36.360]   actually conquered some ground in Albania, pushed them back.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:38.640]   And then Hitler was like, "Fuck, you know,
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:42.280]   I was planning my march to Russia, but I have to go down."
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.720]   Because he basically said to Mussolini,
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:44.560]   like, "You know, you're fucking,
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:45.960]   you basically bitch slapped him, like,
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:47.840]   'Fraid I gotta do this myself,
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:49.320]   'cause you such a fucking bitch."
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.080]   So then the Nazis invaded Greece,
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:53.200]   obviously they took the mainland with fight,
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.120]   and shout out, the Greeks never give credit
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:57.160]   to the British and New Zealand and Australian troops
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:00.120]   that were there, you know, they were a large part of this,
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:03.680]   the majority of it, but the Greeks fight, dude, civilians.
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:05.840]   I mean, they fought, you know,
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:07.640]   the Ottomans were there 400 years,
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:09.480]   you go to Greece now, there's no evidence,
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:13.440]   there's virtually no evidence of them ever being there,
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.400]   that's the Greek spirit, kick 'em out,
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:17.200]   and we kicked out hummus too.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.600]   So it's like, your culture's gone, you're gone.
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.960]   'Cause Greeks are, it's philoptimo,
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.800]   it's called philoptimo, and it's a real thing.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.440]   Philoptimo is a, there's very little,
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:29.440]   you can't translate it, but it's kind of like honor,
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.840]   loyalty, friendship, altruism,
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:35.280]   it's a, you can't define it, but Greeks know it,
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:39.360]   and we're taught it from our families, it's a vibe,
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:42.400]   and it's a Greek cultural thing, and we're an old culture,
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:44.840]   and philoptimo is what it's called, philoptimo,
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:49.720]   and it's love, it's passion, and it comes out,
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.680]   and it comes out, and so Hitler had to postpone
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:57.400]   his invasion of Russia, went down,
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:02.320]   the island of Crete took 10 days to conquer, it's an island.
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:06.280]   To put that in perspective, the country of France
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:08.120]   fell in three or four days, I can't even remember,
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:09.320]   'cause they fucking just rolled over,
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:11.900]   so what does a couple hours matter
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:14.400]   when you're that much of a fucking pussy, okay?
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:17.320]   What is a couple hours, 12 hours, fucking three or four days
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:22.220]   the island of Crete took the Germans 10 days to conquer,
[00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:24.800]   and because of that, and because of the Greek resistance,
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:29.680]   Hitler had to postpone his invasion of Russia to winter,
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.640]   and of course that was his downfall,
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:35.480]   just as it was Napoleon's, and never, dude,
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:38.000]   never try to invade Russia, they got millions of people
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.280]   to throw at death, every time you read about Russians
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:42.260]   in history books, like, and a million died,
[00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:44.520]   I mean, you just guys throw millions of people
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:47.220]   at the problem, and don't fuck with that Russian winter,
[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:49.900]   and don't fuck with Russian people, dude, they're tough.
[00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:52.160]   People in New York know that, you don't go to fucking
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.780]   Sheep's Hip Bay and start talking shit,
[00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:55.400]   you'll end up in a fucking car trunk,
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.680]   and they'll brutally murder you,
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:58.320]   I do not fuck with Russians.
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:50:59.760]   - Amen.
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:03.080]   - And there's a lot of people, a lot of historians argue
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:06.160]   that that battle was because of the Russian winter,
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:07.660]   because of delaying the Russian invasion,
[00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:10.280]   but also psychologically delaying the invasion.
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:13.320]   It was the first time, I think it was the first time
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:18.320]   the Germans failed, or didn't succeed like they wanted to
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:23.040]   early in the war, which is a little, psychologically,
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:26.440]   the impact of that, I think, is immeasurable.
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:30.000]   And also a lot of people argue from a military strategy
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.120]   perspective that, just like you said, it was an aerial
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:39.120]   attack, and that Hitler didn't think that that kind of attack
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:42.180]   would then be useful for the rest of the war.
[00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:47.180]   So that's a really, whereas it might have been very useful.
[00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:49.960]   So it's really interesting how these little battles
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:51.720]   can steer the directions of war.
[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:54.960]   Of course, me growing up in the Soviet Union,
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:57.600]   we didn't hear much about this battle.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:59.920]   Just like you said, millions of Soviets died.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.480]   All those people in history that you read about dying,
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:04.680]   those are all civilians, but I mean, not all,
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:07.240]   but a very large number of them are civilians,
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:10.680]   and their stories, obviously, that's the rooted,
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:13.440]   the literature, the poetry, the music,
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:16.080]   just the way people talk, the way they drink vodka,
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:20.140]   the way they love, the way they hate, the way they fear,
[00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:24.120]   that's all like rooted in World War II and World War I.
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:29.120]   And so, but we never kind of think about Europe,
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:32.320]   and we certainly, growing up, didn't think about
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:34.040]   their role in the United States.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.120]   All this, there's plenty of stories of heroism
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:40.080]   in the Soviet Union, enough for many lifetimes.
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:41.760]   So, but it was fascinating to read
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:45.360]   from a Greek perspective, 'cause I, you know,
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:47.520]   I don't have many Greek friends.
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:48.840]   I'm hoping to change that.
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:54.140]   - This is the beginning of a love affair of your people.
[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:56.560]   Yeah, that- - Likewise,
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:59.120]   the Americans don't hear about the Soviet contribution
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:00.840]   to the end of World War II, because obviously,
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:03.520]   we became, you know, enemies after that,
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:04.680]   because of the two systems.
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:07.280]   But yeah, without the Russians, World War II
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:08.640]   wouldn't have been won either.
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:10.280]   - Yeah, the stories are written by the victors.
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:11.760]   That's really interesting.
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:16.440]   Just looking at history, you wonder what's missing.
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:18.880]   - I'll tell you what's missing that I know for a fact,
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:21.880]   'cause my dad told me combat's hell,
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:23.600]   and he would tell me the reality of what it's really like.
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:25.940]   Guys pissing themselves, calling for their mother,
[00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:28.920]   the fog of war, obviously, fratricide happens all the time,
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.200]   it's pandemonium.
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:32.480]   I mean, there's skill involved, but I mean, there's no,
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:34.060]   like, a lot of it is just luck.
[00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:37.080]   My dad said, my dad won three, he got, you know,
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:39.600]   medals, Purple Hearts, all that shit.
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.240]   And he said the reason was is 'cause he can't,
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:42.560]   he always said, this is another thing he told me,
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:44.840]   you can't pin a medal on a dead guy.
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:46.880]   So it's like, those are the guys who deserve it,
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:47.900]   but you can't pin a medal.
[00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:50.400]   You can't do the pomp and,
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:54.240]   and I'll tell you one thing is that it is written
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.280]   by the victors, and all these leaders,
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:58.800]   they say we're in the front, we're not in the front.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.640]   We're not, whenever the history books say,
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:04.120]   he led his troops into battle, it's like, did he really?
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:06.020]   Did he, so then how did he live?
[00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:07.700]   'Cause they put, like, kids in the front, you know?
[00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:09.760]   It's like, nobody limps back from the front
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:11.160]   with, like, a injury, you know?
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:15.320]   That's army PR, you know, whenever you read,
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:20.100]   27 soldiers died, 14 were injured,
[00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:21.780]   the word injured is PR.
[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:23.260]   That's like, injured, was he?
[00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:25.020]   Did he sprain his ankle?
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:27.060]   Did he need, did he get carried off the court?
[00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:29.300]   Or, you know, he was maimed.
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:31.620]   I mean, he was like, his leg was blown off, you know?
[00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:34.460]   It's like, so I think that, you know,
[00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:36.020]   Alexander the Great was just kind of in the back
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:37.620]   on his horse and just kind of,
[00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:39.020]   he had his eunuch blown a few times,
[00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:40.820]   and he was like, is it bad up there?
[00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:42.300]   And then, like, after that, he was like,
[00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:44.020]   okay, my scribe, give me my scribe.
[00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:45.020]   Okay, when you write this down,
[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:46.260]   can you put me in the front?
[00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:48.800]   Yeah, and I was just, make me a big hero,
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:50.200]   and I was in there, and then he, you know,
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.680]   he just blew his, you know, he had sex with his eunuch
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:54.000]   and rode off into the sunset,
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.920]   because there's just no way you survive in the front,
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:57.440]   especially warfare back then.
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:59.080]   I mean, it's, like, brutal.
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:01.580]   - Then again, you have, like, Genghis Khan.
[00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:06.360]   The sense I got that he was a little bit up on the front,
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:07.400]   at least at first.
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:08.240]   - Yeah.
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:09.720]   - Or is that also, is he a little bit Alexander the Great?
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:11.520]   - Give me my scribe, yeah, it's all lore.
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.840]   I mean, you ever play the game of telephone?
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:15.480]   You know, it's like, you know,
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:16.880]   there's no video cameras back then,
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:19.960]   so shit just turns into myth, you know?
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:21.640]   And there's no way he was in the front.
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:23.620]   There's no way, he wouldn't have lived.
[00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:26.320]   You know, he was probably good on horseback,
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:29.080]   'cause those dudes were good on horseback.
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:30.280]   It was like "Game of Thrones" back then.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:32.080]   You had all these different people, and they kinda,
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:34.480]   yeah, the Mongols were wild, dude.
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:37.420]   They actually said, like, they started, like,
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:39.160]   they were more adaptable to the horse,
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:40.600]   because they were so good on horseback
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:43.480]   that kids started to be born, like, kind of bow-legged,
[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:44.440]   like, to fit the horse.
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.440]   It's wild, and they would stretch their heads
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:47.620]   and shit like that.
[00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:49.080]   They'd wrap 'em and stretch their heads
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:51.160]   so they'd find, like, Mongol skulls,
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:53.280]   and they looked like coneheads,
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:56.040]   and they were brutal and vicious.
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:59.880]   And they would maraud and rape and all the fun stuff that,
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:02.200]   you know, when you visit other places back then,
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:04.280]   there's no tchotchke stops and souvenir shops.
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:07.320]   What you do is you take women, and those are the tokens,
[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:09.540]   you know, you burn a few huts.
[00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:11.640]   Different, tourism was different back then.
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:15.760]   - Yeah, that's another difficult thing.
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:17.840]   Just, we're talking about nature and predators.
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:21.160]   To think about the long stretch of history
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:22.600]   where it was just murder.
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:23.440]   - Yeah.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:27.060]   - And we made so much progress, I guess,
[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:28.760]   in the past couple of centuries.
[00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:31.300]   The United States is a shining example of that.
[00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:33.320]   - But do you think also that it's that effect
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:36.640]   that we were, a lot of good things had to happen, too,
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:37.880]   or else we wouldn't be here.
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:41.260]   So do we just focus, isn't it like a car crash effect?
[00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:43.060]   That like, you know, the rubber neck
[00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:44.560]   that everyone pulls over to see a car crash.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:46.900]   Are we just only focusing on the negative things of history
[00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:48.600]   'cause they're just more exciting to us?
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:50.100]   Like, it's just not, it's boring to be like,
[00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:51.540]   yeah, and then there was a bunch of villagers
[00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:54.400]   and they ate every day and danced and-
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:55.880]   - And loved, yeah.
[00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:59.960]   I wonder how different those people were, you know?
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:04.280]   Like, they might've had the same exact loves and fears.
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:08.320]   And like, they perhaps had the same kind
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:11.080]   of brilliant ideas in their head, if not more.
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:11.920]   - Brilliant.
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:14.000]   And we kind of think about like this moment in history
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.200]   as like the most special moment.
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:18.120]   Like, we're doing the coolest shit,
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:19.520]   but we're doing the most amazing,
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:20.760]   building the most amazing things.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:23.160]   But maybe they were building amazing things
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:25.420]   in their different way with like less technological,
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:26.800]   but in the space of ideas,
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:29.160]   in the space of just all the different,
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:33.720]   the camaraderie, in the space of like concepts,
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:35.480]   mathematics, all those kinds of things.
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:37.100]   - Yeah, I mean, Greece, you look at the architecture,
[00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:37.940]   it still stands up.
[00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:40.920]   I mean, all the government, but it's still arguably,
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:42.700]   I mean, as far as objective beauty,
[00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:44.920]   it's hard to argue that Greco-Roman,
[00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:48.100]   it's just something about it with the columns.
[00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:50.280]   It's just, it's powerful.
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:53.480]   It's, I don't know, even Ayn Rand would probably appreciate
[00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:54.320]   it.
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:56.460]   - She doesn't, no, no, no.
[00:57:56.460 --> 00:58:01.400]   So in your history of hyenas,
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:03.440]   that unfortunately has come to an end.
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:05.200]   We were talking about empires coming to an end,
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:06.400]   all empires fall.
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:11.240]   That one, well, it may rise again.
[00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:13.800]   Empires might rise again, who knows, who knows?
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:18.000]   I'm obviously a fan, so I hope it does rise again,
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:22.340]   but you've seemed to develop your own language.
[00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:26.440]   Can you, you know, it's what it is.
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:28.200]   What is that?
[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:30.000]   What the hell?
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.640]   Is this some kind of medical condition
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:35.560]   or can you explain like the linguistic essentials
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:39.440]   that catch us up to the linguistic essentials
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:42.960]   that people need to know to understand the way you speak?
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:44.160]   - You know Leopold and Loeb?
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:46.040]   You know the story of those two?
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:47.120]   They murdered that kid
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:49.920]   and they had this weird relationship.
[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:51.200]   Anyway, it's an interesting thing to Google,
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:53.440]   Leopold and Loeb, these two guys
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:54.700]   who ended up murdering a kid
[00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:56.840]   because they developed their own language with each other
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:59.560]   and this own reality and this weird thing.
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:01.120]   And they wanted to know what it's like to murder a kid
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:01.960]   and they murder a kid.
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:04.520]   It's a famous story in American lore and history,
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:07.280]   whatever, famous case.
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:10.480]   But this phenomenon, yeah, me and Chris got together.
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.000]   It wasn't as dark as Leopold and Loeb.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.940]   We didn't murder a kid, but we murdered a podcast.
[00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:18.400]   - Or at least stabbed it a few times.
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:22.680]   - Yeah, it was something in the organic chemistry
[00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:27.240]   of me and Chris that I think we'll both end up appreciating
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:32.000]   even probably more than we do now, that it's mysterious.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.080]   I gotta be honest with you.
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:37.720]   It was the thing that it wasn't conscious,
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:39.840]   wasn't intentional.
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:44.000]   It was something that happened in the music of our energies
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.280]   that just went.
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:46.120]   - It's fascinating.
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:47.040]   - Like when you hear someone sing
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:49.280]   or when a jazz band hits a rhythm
[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:52.280]   or even when I'm on stage and I just catch a rhythm,
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:54.200]   it's like, dude, I didn't make a choice there.
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:55.180]   I don't know what that is.
[00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:56.800]   I don't know how to explain it,
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:58.600]   but it comes from somewhere else
[00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:00.520]   and I don't know what it is.
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:01.840]   It's beyond my comprehension,
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:06.120]   but with Chris, there was this magical chemistry
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:08.840]   that I have chemistry with a lot of people
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:10.240]   and it can be funny and I enjoy talking.
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.680]   - I feel zero chemistry here, brother.
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:12.520]   - No, this is great.
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:13.340]   This is great, yeah.
[01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:14.320]   It's a little bit more intelligent
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:18.800]   than when me and Chris did, but me and Chris,
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:21.600]   I think we connected on the funny bone.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:26.720]   I found him so funny and we found the same things funny.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:29.520]   And from that, these organic expressions came
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:32.440]   from some part of our brains
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.400]   that was created from this chemistry.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.760]   And yeah, we just developed this language
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:39.440]   and this cult following and people were really upset
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.880]   when we ended, but it was the right thing to end
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.660]   because like all things that end,
[01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:46.440]   it was kind of done a few episodes even before we finished.
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:48.120]   And I think we pulled the plug
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:50.280]   before it started rolling downhill.
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:53.920]   Like all great flings.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.040]   There's your long relationship,
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.820]   long marriages are boring and comfortable.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.720]   The one you really like fucking always ends abruptly
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:07.060]   and sadly, but you always look back and you jerk off to it.
[01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:09.760]   - So you guys made love.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:10.600]   - We made, yeah.
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.640]   So it was like a hot fling with me and him
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:17.640]   and it was intense and we burned the candle at both ends.
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:22.440]   I think that podcast was meant to be three years
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:25.280]   and maybe people will go back and appreciate it
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.120]   and listen to it over and over again.
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:29.720]   And I think the new things we do, people will love.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.600]   I'm doing long days now, that podcast
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:32.440]   and people seem to enjoy it.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:35.280]   - I've been really enjoying the long days on YouTube.
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:39.720]   I just found myself just like staring at you,
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:41.160]   ranting for, same with Tim Dillon.
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:43.200]   I really enjoyed whatever those rants are,
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.640]   the genius of just one thing after the other,
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:48.800]   but definitely the chemistry almost as a study.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.560]   I remember the reason I first started listening to it,
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:55.000]   I was trying to get a perspective
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.440]   on certain historical moments.
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.480]   Like it was interesting.
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.440]   I tuned in to learn history.
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:05.600]   Yeah, I came for the history and like stayed for the chaos.
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:07.700]   - Stayed for the crack open and clean out.
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:10.680]   - And yeah, it was almost,
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:13.520]   I listen to Rogan like this sometimes.
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:19.360]   I'll re-listen to an episode to try to understand
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:22.320]   why was this so fun to listen to?
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.520]   It's almost like trying to analyze humor
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:26.360]   or something like that,
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:29.240]   but it's nice from a conversational perspective,
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:32.240]   like why was this so easy to listen to?
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.520]   And with History of Hyenas,
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:36.680]   why is the chemistry so good?
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:39.200]   It's so, it's weird.
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:40.120]   It's weird.
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:41.920]   'Cause there's not many podcasts like that.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:44.520]   I don't know any with the chemistry like that.
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.360]   It's interesting.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:50.200]   And it's kind of sad that the fling
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:52.400]   with a prostitute in Vegas has to end.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.240]   (laughing)
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.400]   But that's what makes it special.
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.520]   It's the Bukowski thing with the fog.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:01.400]   The British office, one of my favorite shows was that.
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:03.080]   It ended very quick.
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:05.840]   It's only a couple of seasons or something like that.
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:09.560]   And that was tragic, but that took guts to just end it.
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:11.040]   Given all the money you could have made,
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:13.160]   given all the, you just end it.
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.480]   And that's what makes it like truly special.
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.280]   - Yeah, and I'll tell you, man, I'll just emphasize it.
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.900]   'Cause I marvel at it too.
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:22.480]   'Cause as a guy who tries to always figure out
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:25.640]   what the causes of things, I gotta be honest, man,
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:28.040]   looking back on that, even with retrospective wisdom,
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:29.500]   you know, that 2020 hindsight,
[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:31.880]   we've been done a couple months now.
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:35.480]   It's something that I can't explain.
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:38.020]   It's something that I don't know how you quantify it.
[01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:40.120]   I don't know how you describe it.
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:41.440]   It's musical.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.440]   It's really kind of rhythmic.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.440]   So.
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:47.240]   - Maybe like a Netflix show about history.
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.480]   That's in the future.
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:50.920]   - Maybe, yeah.
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:51.740]   - With the two of you.
[01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:52.580]   - Yeah, who knows?
[01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:54.320]   - You guys will meet like,
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:56.400]   with that, the way you meet with a fling,
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.320]   like a decade from now at a diner
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:02.400]   and you're both way fatter and uglier.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:06.760]   And then you just reminisce over some cigarettes and coffee.
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.520]   - It could be, yeah, it could be.
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:09.360]   - Yeah.
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.360]   - But it's definitely a classic podcast
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:13.120]   that people can go back and appreciate.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.960]   It's fast paced and it was unique.
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:18.400]   - What was it like to research for,
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.920]   I mean, it was really scholarly,
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:22.080]   the depth of research that you performed.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:25.080]   It sometimes felt like you almost read
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:27.320]   an entire Wikipedia article beforehand.
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:31.640]   - That's exactly true.
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:36.640]   We were, one fan, we attracted such funny people
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:39.640]   to that podcast and the fans were so funny.
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:43.160]   And one fan called us, nicknamed us Wikipedia sluts.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.440]   And so it just stuck.
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.120]   Yeah, we just would read Wikipedia.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.080]   I would do a lot more research than Chris.
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:48.920]   - Yeah.
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:50.800]   - And so I would actually,
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:52.440]   once in a while he'd get into it too,
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:55.240]   but for very interesting episodes,
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:58.400]   I got some subject matter would just pull me in,
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:00.720]   like Bernie Madoff, just to think of one that was recent,
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:01.560]   it was one of our last ones.
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.360]   And I think one of our better episodes,
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:06.360]   and I'm glad that it kind of ended after that
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:07.440]   'cause it was rare to,
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.920]   I think we started to slip a little bit.
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:12.160]   I got fascinated and I did a lot of research
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:13.960]   for Bernie Madoff, but usually, yeah,
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.600]   we'd pull up Wikipedia and we'd have fun.
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:17.960]   We were sort of the antithesis of Dan Carlin.
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:21.200]   I mean, you went to Dan Carlin for accuracy
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:24.200]   and thoughtfulness and you went to us for,
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:26.120]   it was a hang with histories.
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.680]   That's why history hyenas was such an appropriate name
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:31.320]   because it was a little bit of history.
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:34.200]   Some episodes were more hyena, more wild,
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.040]   and a little history,
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.240]   and some were a little more dense,
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.160]   like the Battle of Crete and less hyena.
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:40.680]   So you were always gonna get both.
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:42.440]   You're either gonna get a majority of one or the other.
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:44.920]   - Yeah, and Dan Carlin's the lion, I guess.
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:45.760]   - Yeah, you gotta get both.
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:48.360]   - You gotta get predictably good.
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:52.000]   I mean, what are your thoughts about,
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.280]   I mean, he's a storyteller too.
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:56.320]   He gets a lot of criticism from the historians,
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:57.160]   quote unquote.
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:58.960]   That's why he likes to not,
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.680]   he keeps saying he's not a historian,
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:05.440]   but what are your thoughts about hardcore history
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.400]   with Dan Carlin?
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:11.000]   Like, was he an inspiration to the podcast you were doing
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:14.880]   or like an account,
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:17.640]   like almost like a reverse psychology inspiration
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:21.040]   where you wanted to do some kind of opposing type of podcast
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:22.040]   in history?
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:27.040]   Or was history always just like a launching pad
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:29.800]   to just talk shit about human nature?
[01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:31.080]   - More of the latter.
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:33.440]   I wasn't even aware of his podcast when we started.
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:34.280]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:36.880]   - Yeah, and so it was just very organic.
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:37.960]   Again, like the chemistry,
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.160]   me and Chris became very good friends.
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:41.680]   We started the podcast.
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:43.840]   First, we did a web series called Bay Ridge Boys,
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.920]   which has its sort of little cult following.
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.840]   We did like five episodes and ended it.
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:49.560]   And then we did the podcast.
[01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:52.480]   And hyenas were my favorite animal.
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.840]   And I talk about them passionately
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:55.000]   and I told Chris about them.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.640]   And then he started appreciating them.
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:57.680]   And we both love history.
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:58.720]   I majored in history.
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:06:59.680]   It's one of the things I love.
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:00.920]   I go to museums all the time.
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.160]   I do history tours, so does he.
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:05.480]   And so it was just sort of a natural,
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:06.720]   let's do a history podcast.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:09.560]   And it gave us something to talk about each episode
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:11.080]   to sort of lean our, you know,
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:13.720]   hang our hats on and riff off of.
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:15.440]   So it had nothing to do with Dan's.
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.400]   What I think about Dan's, I think it's great.
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:21.280]   I think even if he's inaccurate in the opinions
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:24.620]   of the historical community, it starts conversations,
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:25.660]   which is good.
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:27.160]   It's like this thing where people go,
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:28.440]   "Oh, it's dangerous rhetoric."
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:31.040]   It's like, no, rhetoric only becomes dangerous
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.400]   when education fails.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:35.440]   What's going on in America is education has failed.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.660]   So if you call someone online dangerous,
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:39.320]   it's not him that's dangerous.
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:41.600]   It's the fucking stupid people that's dangerous.
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.800]   And it's the fault of this country.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:44.280]   We didn't listen to Aristotle.
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:47.880]   The future of a civilization depends on public education.
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:49.520]   And we failed.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:50.840]   Education has failed.
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:52.980]   Kids are not interested in shit.
[01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:54.640]   And so-- - In some sense,
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.760]   those, like Dan's podcast,
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:59.840]   and podcasts can be incredibly educational.
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:04.120]   That's, he's, the storytelling that pulls you in
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:08.640]   ultimately leads to you internalizing these stories
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:11.080]   and remembering them and thinking through them
[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.280]   and all those kinds of things that is much more powerful
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:16.320]   than you book on history that's accurate.
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:18.680]   - I think often it inspires you to go learn more.
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:19.760]   So it's like, I know we did that.
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:22.880]   I mean, people would go, "Hey, I went and learned about this."
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:24.720]   'Cause they knew with us, there was no pretense,
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:27.240]   which was great, that we had no standard.
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:30.360]   So it's like, nobody came to us for historical accuracy.
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:32.800]   But I was kind of turned on by the fact
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:36.320]   that it inspired people to go learn about this stuff
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:38.040]   or to at least know, like Battle of Crete,
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:41.960]   like you said, a very underappreciated battle.
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:44.280]   Even Winston Churchill said, "From here on,
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:48.220]   "we will no longer say that Greeks fight like heroes,
[01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:49.640]   "but heroes fight like Greeks."
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:52.560]   I mean, it was a monumental battle
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:54.560]   and not talked about enough.
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:57.580]   And our podcast would inspire people
[01:08:57.580 --> 01:09:00.840]   to go actually learn more, to go listen to Dan Carlin
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:04.000]   or to go pick up a book or to do research on their own.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.800]   And so I think podcasts,
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:08.760]   Dan Carlin's obviously much more accurate than us,
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:12.560]   but it's good that people are going to podcasts like yours
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:13.400]   to learn shit.
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:16.880]   Joe is really like the progenitor of that.
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:19.160]   I mean, having intellectuals on
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:23.440]   and getting the public interested with this new medium
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:28.080]   in people who are intelligent, it's nice.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:31.520]   'Cause what the mainstream press pushes out is horseshit,
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:33.680]   gorgeous horseshit.
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:37.240]   It's got a beautiful veneer, but no substance.
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:39.840]   And so this is a nice pushback.
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:41.880]   - Yeah, the authenticity of Joe's show.
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:45.760]   I mean, I started listening from the very beginning,
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:50.640]   doing my in grad school, like a technical person.
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:53.080]   And he just pulled me in and made me curious
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.000]   to learn about all kinds of things
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.600]   and use my own critical reasoning skills
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.520]   on some of the bullshit guess he's had
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:03.320]   and some of the most inspiring guess he's had.
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.960]   So I'll teach you to think.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:09.240]   I don't know much about Bernie Madoff as a small tangent.
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:10.800]   Can you tell me who the hell is Bernie Madoff?
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:13.280]   - Oh, Bernie Madoff is the GOAT,
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:15.840]   the greatest thief of all time, dude.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:18.280]   Hedge fund guy, ran a hedge fund
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:22.240]   and stole the most money in the history of America.
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:23.600]   I mean, a con artist.
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:28.960]   People obviously, he's become, he's a household name
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.680]   because of the magnitude of his crime.
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:32.160]   But you got to appreciate, again,
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.720]   you got to appreciate what went into this
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:37.320]   and how long he was able to pull it off
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:41.680]   by tricking the smartest and richest people in the world.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:43.200]   And a brilliant scam.
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:47.320]   The con man, con man is short for confidence man.
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:50.200]   And it came from, yeah, a con man,
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:53.320]   basically they exude confidence and they trick people
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:56.240]   by playing on their ego and blind spots.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.720]   And the word comes from a guy, I can't remember where,
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:00.080]   but what he used to do.
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:02.000]   I can't remember the guy's name, whatever.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.800]   You can Google it, con man.
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:04.640]   But it's very interesting.
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:06.800]   The first con man that is on record,
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:08.480]   what he would do, he would go to very rich people
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:11.040]   and he'd be very well-dressed, right?
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:14.600]   And he'd go, I bet you don't have the confidence
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:16.680]   to give me your watch.
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:17.800]   And he would play on the egos
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.280]   of these very powerful and rich people
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:21.360]   and they would give him the watch for some reason,
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:23.280]   some sort of reverse psychology bullshit.
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:25.480]   And he'd take the watch and he would just steal it.
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:27.520]   'Cause basically he's saying,
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:28.560]   you don't have the confidence to give me the watch
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:29.480]   'cause you don't, I don't know,
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:30.480]   you don't think I'm gonna give it back.
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:31.680]   And he would just take it.
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:35.440]   So Bernie Madoff was a very sophisticated con man.
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:36.640]   And again, we were talking about people
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:38.840]   pretending to be the opposite of what they are.
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:43.840]   Bernie hid his thievery in how available
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.720]   he was to his clients,
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:47.840]   how he would show up at every bar mitzvah, every birthday.
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.840]   He was always available for their phone calls.
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:52.280]   And he played on their egos.
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:55.440]   He made it so people wanted to invest in him.
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.600]   Like they were competing.
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:58.320]   He made it very exclusive.
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.800]   He wouldn't just take anyone.
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:01.520]   And there was a method behind that madness
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:05.400]   because he wanted the whales that wouldn't notice
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:07.960]   that he had this pyramid scheme going.
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:09.640]   And so what he would do is he would just rob
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:11.400]   from the richer and he just kept,
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:12.920]   it was like he'd pay back the richer
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:14.000]   with the guy who was a little less,
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.600]   and it was a pyramid scheme.
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:18.240]   And he was able to do it for so long
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:20.280]   and steal so much money.
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:22.760]   And he would win people over with the scheme
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:23.720]   because with that scheme,
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:25.840]   he was the only guy who could provide,
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:28.480]   who could guarantee like a 1% return
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:30.240]   even during times of recession.
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:32.600]   And because he was such a good con man,
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:35.520]   he hijacked people's reasoning with his charm.
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:36.800]   And that's what con artists do.
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:37.760]   That's what psychopaths do.
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:39.280]   They're so fucking charming.
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:41.120]   They get you in that Volkswagen Beetle
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:43.000]   because if they use their reasoning for one second,
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.840]   they'd go, "Hey, nobody can provide 1% returns
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:46.720]   "during recessions.
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:48.200]   "How the fuck is this guy doing it?
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:49.360]   "I'll tell you how he's doing it.
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.620]   "He's stealing from another guy to pay you.
[01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:52.880]   "You fucking idiot."
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:54.640]   - So charisma is essential to that.
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:57.400]   Maybe you can help explain something to me,
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:00.440]   something I have been affected by.
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:01.640]   - I'm going way too loud for your listeners.
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:02.480]   There's gonna be comments like,
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:03.440]   "Tell this guy to calm down.
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:05.440]   "I'm sorry, I'm Greek Apostolate."
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:07.700]   (laughing)
[01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:09.680]   - No, that's beautiful.
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:10.520]   I love it.
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:12.840]   This is something that I have been thinking about
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:16.420]   and have encountered indirectly is Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:19.800]   And I have a sense because of MIT,
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:22.120]   because of all the other people
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:25.040]   that have been touched, the wrong term,
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:26.920]   by Jeffrey Epstein in the sense that-
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:27.840]   - Literally touched.
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:30.240]   - Literally and figuratively.
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:34.960]   And it always felt to me like there's not a deep conspiracy.
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:36.740]   I don't know.
[01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:38.680]   But it felt to me like there's not
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:42.680]   some deeply rooted conspiracy where like Eric Weinstein
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:45.400]   thinks that there's some probability
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:48.960]   that Jeffrey Epstein is a front
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:50.720]   for like an intelligence agency,
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:54.280]   whether it's Israeli or the CIA, I don't know,
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:57.560]   but is a front for something much, much bigger.
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:00.860]   And then I always thought that he's just,
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:01.720]   maybe you can correct me,
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:04.280]   but more of the Bernie Madoff variety,
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:06.840]   where he's just a charismatic guy
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:10.080]   who may be a psychopathic in some sense,
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:14.600]   so also a pedophile, but just charismatic
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:18.160]   and is able to convince people of that 1% of any idea
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.380]   that in the case of scientists,
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:25.280]   is able to convince these people that their ideas matter.
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:27.200]   So one thing scientists don't really,
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:29.200]   despite what people say,
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:32.280]   I don't think they care about money as much as people think.
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:33.760]   - I mean, people are ridiculous when they think that.
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:36.240]   Yeah, that's why people get into science for the money.
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:37.440]   The person who has to get into science
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:40.160]   are obsessed with minutiae.
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:41.500]   They do the scientific method.
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:43.040]   You know how boring that is?
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:46.400]   Like you have to have a love for it in order to do it.
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.120]   - But the thing- - Love and truth.
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:52.060]   - What drives you is for your ideas to be then heard.
[01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:56.140]   And when a rich guy comes over, probably super charismatic,
[01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:58.900]   is going to tell you that your ideas,
[01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:01.100]   especially for some of these outsiders at MIT,
[01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:02.580]   at Harvard, at Caltech,
[01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:07.580]   at all these sort of big physics, biology,
[01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:13.480]   artificial intelligence, computing fields,
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:17.380]   to hear somebody say that your ideas are brilliant,
[01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:19.060]   that ideas matter, it's pretty powerful,
[01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:21.320]   especially when you've been an outsider.
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:23.180]   Like he's talked to a bunch of people
[01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:26.580]   who had outsider ideas.
[01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:31.260]   The big negative for me of modern academia
[01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:35.320]   is that most people, actually like most communities,
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:36.540]   most people think the same
[01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:38.660]   and there's just these brilliant outsiders.
[01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:41.420]   And the outsiders are just derided.
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:44.420]   And so when you have Jeffrey Epstein, like a hyena,
[01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:48.180]   sorry, sorry, sorry, going from on the outside
[01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:49.580]   and picking off these brilliant minds
[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:50.900]   that are the outsiders,
[01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:52.980]   he can use charisma to convince them
[01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:57.660]   to collaborate with him, to take his funding.
[01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:01.140]   And then thereby he builds a reputation,
[01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:03.540]   like slowly accumulates these people
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:07.620]   that actually results in a network
[01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:11.180]   of like some of the most brilliant people in the world,
[01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:13.140]   and then pulls in people like Bill Gates
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:15.340]   and I don't know, political figures.
[01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:19.380]   I tend to believe one person can do that.
[01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:22.860]   - Yeah, I mean, look at Hitler, charisma is blinding.
[01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:25.420]   I think that's what con men, speaking of Bernie Madoff,
[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:29.700]   that's one of their major tools is flattery,
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:31.580]   glib, superficial charm.
[01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:33.100]   It creates those blind spots.
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:34.540]   People wanna hear how great they are.
[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:35.980]   They wanna be flattered.
[01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:39.780]   It takes your defenses down, plays to our ego,
[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:42.620]   the how much we're all just pieces of garbage
[01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:44.060]   and wanna hear how great we are.
[01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:46.460]   We want that love from our mother and our father.
[01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:48.460]   It's Freudian and they know,
[01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:51.540]   because they're not burdened with that need,
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:55.780]   they're not burdened with that empathy or emotions
[01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:58.180]   and they just see things very calculatively.
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:01.740]   They play, they know that we're prey in their game
[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:03.620]   and they use that against us.
[01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:07.180]   And that is why someone who is not that intelligent,
[01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:09.300]   like Hitler, can probably convince
[01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:11.700]   a lot more intelligent people, you know,
[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:13.740]   and that's why we can't give Tim Dillon power
[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:15.860]   because he already stands on a stage.
[01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:17.060]   I mean, if we let that guy,
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:18.820]   I mean, he will just take over a country
[01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:21.580]   and everyone who can't cook well will be eliminated.
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:22.420]   So it's like-
[01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:23.980]   - I wonder why he keeps complimenting me
[01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:24.820]   when we're in private.
[01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:26.140]   - Exactly, be careful.
[01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:29.100]   - He looks at me, just, I like your suit.
[01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:30.460]   I like the cut of your jib.
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:31.300]   Yeah, definitely.
[01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:33.020]   - You gotta be careful of that kid, he's Hitler.
[01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:34.700]   (laughing)
[01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:35.540]   But it's crazy to think about-
[01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:36.940]   - Clip that, please, internet.
[01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:38.980]   - I mean, Quentin Tarantino said it to bet,
[01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:41.500]   I mean, in his script, personality goes a long way, dude.
[01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:42.340]   - Yeah.
[01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:46.580]   - I mean, personality can usurp common sense
[01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:48.260]   and reason of the smartest people.
[01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:52.700]   These absolute smartest people can be hypnotized.
[01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:54.780]   It's sort of like a sexy woman.
[01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:57.380]   It's like, you can be tricked
[01:17:57.380 --> 01:18:02.120]   because we have such a blind spot for flattery.
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:05.540]   - Yeah, I wonder, I think there's a BBC documentary
[01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:08.580]   on, I think it's called something like charisma,
[01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:10.540]   Hitler's charisma or something like that.
[01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:12.860]   It does quite, I mean, that one focused more
[01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:15.300]   about the power of the speeches,
[01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:18.180]   but I wonder if most of the success
[01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:21.540]   or the rise of Hitler and the third Reich
[01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:24.100]   had to do with the charisma of Hitler
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:26.060]   when he's alone in a room with somebody,
[01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:29.300]   with the generals, just one-on-one.
[01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:32.620]   Like, I wonder if that's the essential element
[01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:36.460]   of just being able to just look into a person's eyes,
[01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:39.340]   like flatter them or whatever is needed
[01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:42.060]   to earn their trust and then convince them
[01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:43.820]   of anything you want.
[01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:45.660]   - Right, yeah, I mean, you're right
[01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:49.100]   'cause that's the one piece of history we don't have.
[01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:49.940]   - We don't know.
[01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:50.760]   - We don't know.
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:53.180]   We do know that the kid crushed.
[01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:54.980]   I mean, he was a headliner.
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:56.340]   He got up there and his--
[01:18:56.340 --> 01:18:57.180]   - Oh, just speechless.
[01:18:57.180 --> 01:18:58.340]   - His hair would flop around.
[01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:00.900]   I mean, he crushed it.
[01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:02.700]   - Yeah, there's certain elements about nationalism
[01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:04.140]   and pride that are really powerful.
[01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:08.900]   Like a lot of us humans, I think, long for that,
[01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:10.820]   for the feeling of belonging.
[01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:13.300]   And when some charismatic leader makes us feel
[01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:14.960]   like we belong to a group,
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:20.260]   the amount of evil we can do to other humans
[01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:21.100]   because of that is endless.
[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:23.180]   - Especially when you do people a scapegoat.
[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:25.540]   Nobody wants to look in, nobody wants to do the work
[01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:27.300]   to be better or look at where they messed up.
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:28.620]   - Why does it always have to be the Jews
[01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:29.460]   that are the scapegoat?
[01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:32.620]   - You know, it's like, get over it, guys.
[01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:34.980]   I mean, it's like, they killed Jesus, you think,
[01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:36.300]   get over it, okay?
[01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:37.460]   It's a long time ago.
[01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:38.340]   I mean, move on.
[01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:39.180]   - Yeah, I'm Jewish.
[01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:41.700]   I understand because we do run the central banks.
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:42.660]   - And the weather.
[01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:43.500]   - And the weather.
[01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:44.580]   - Yeah.
[01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:46.060]   Don't forget about the weather, that's a big one.
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:47.340]   That's a funny one that people created.
[01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:48.180]   Like, who gives a shit?
[01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:49.660]   Well, what is the weather?
[01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:50.500]   What's the importance of the weather?
[01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:51.740]   All right, the Jews made it rain outside.
[01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:53.100]   Good, you gotta fuck, you know, they made it snow.
[01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:53.980]   Okay, you get a day off.
[01:19:53.980 --> 01:19:54.820]   Thank the Jews.
[01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:56.740]   - Yeah, it's like, there's certain conspiracies
[01:19:56.740 --> 01:19:58.620]   that make me, like flat earth.
[01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:03.260]   Like, what's the motivation for lying
[01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:04.380]   that the earth is round?
[01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:05.540]   Like, what's the conspiracy?
[01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:06.780]   - Yeah, what does anyone get out of that?
[01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:09.620]   Yeah, what is exactly the profit?
[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:11.900]   What's the strategy?
[01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:14.860]   Do you have any, from a historical perspective
[01:20:14.860 --> 01:20:16.540]   or just a human perspective,
[01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:18.660]   conspiracy theories you connect with?
[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:21.020]   Or you're not necessarily conspiratorial?
[01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:25.900]   - I'm not necessarily conspiratorial.
[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:27.700]   Nobody cares that much.
[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:28.540]   But there--
[01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:30.500]   (laughing)
[01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:32.580]   But then, you know, what happens is
[01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:34.660]   you find out this one or this two--
[01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:36.620]   - And you start questioning everything.
[01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:38.020]   - And then you start questioning everything, man.
[01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:39.820]   It's like, you know, the Vietnam War started,
[01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:40.860]   that was a lie.
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:43.540]   That was a false flag.
[01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:45.900]   And then next thing you know, everything's a false flag.
[01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:48.060]   There are some strange things on 9/11.
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:50.980]   You know, there's some strange things
[01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:52.180]   from a scientific perspective.
[01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:54.100]   I'm no scientist, but it's like, you know,
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:58.220]   yeah, three steel-framed skyscrapers falling
[01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:00.660]   on the same day in the same way.
[01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:02.740]   A lot of people say, oh, it was,
[01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:03.580]   they were hit by planes.
[01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:04.780]   It's like, yeah, but that's not why they fell.
[01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:06.500]   They fell because of fires.
[01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:11.100]   And usually, not usually, all the time,
[01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:13.020]   except for three times.
[01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:14.900]   And there was buildings that have burned
[01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:16.020]   for longer than that.
[01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:18.460]   - And there might be good explanations,
[01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:21.020]   but the lack of transparency, it's like,
[01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:22.220]   I feel like government--
[01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:23.460]   - And building seven's weird.
[01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:24.300]   I mean, the way it cut down.
[01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:27.420]   And just a neat, just a neat, the physical,
[01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:29.060]   I mean, you're a scientist, is that--
[01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:30.260]   - Well, I don't--
[01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:32.140]   - Is there resistance from the steel?
[01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:33.140]   - No, it's--
[01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:33.980]   - Free fall seems weird.
[01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:35.020]   - Not all scientists know everything.
[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:36.220]   I'm just a computer guy.
[01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:38.460]   'Cause I had some questions I wanted to ask you
[01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:40.180]   about my biology, by the way.
[01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:41.020]   - Yeah, so exactly.
[01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:41.900]   I don't understand biology.
[01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:43.980]   I don't understand the melting point of steel.
[01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:47.100]   I don't, but I'm just the common sense human
[01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:49.660]   that looks at government and institutions
[01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:51.380]   when they try to communicate.
[01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:53.580]   And there's a certain human element
[01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:56.820]   where you can sense that there's dishonesty going on.
[01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:58.660]   That dishonesty might not be deeply rooted
[01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:00.940]   in a conspiracy theory and something malevolent.
[01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:03.620]   It might just be rooted more likely to me
[01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:06.820]   in a basic fear of losing your job.
[01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:08.100]   So when you have a bunch of people
[01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:10.300]   that are afraid of losing their job,
[01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:12.460]   and they just don't want to,
[01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:14.740]   like the origins of the virus,
[01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:16.660]   whether it came from a lab or not.
[01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:19.420]   That's a pretty, I know a lot of biologists
[01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:23.500]   behind closed doors that say it's very likely
[01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:25.420]   it was leaked from the lab.
[01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:27.420]   But they don't wanna talk about it
[01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:29.260]   because there's not good evidence either way.
[01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:31.960]   It's mostly, you're just using common sense.
[01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:33.280]   So they're waiting for good evidence
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:35.500]   to come out in either direction.
[01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:38.740]   But just like nobody in positions of institutional,
[01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:41.420]   like centralized power wants to just honestly say,
[01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:42.540]   "We don't know."
[01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:44.940]   Or on the point of masks or all those kinds of things
[01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:47.580]   to say, "Here's the best evidence we have.
[01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:49.060]   "We're not sure, we're trying to figure it out.
[01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:50.700]   "We're desperately trying to figure that out."
[01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:53.960]   Or just like honesty, especially in the modern day.
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:55.940]   That's the hope I have for the 21st century
[01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:59.140]   is people seem to detect bullshit much, much better
[01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:00.900]   because the internet. - Yeah, internet, yeah.
[01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:02.740]   - Yeah, and we seem to-- - But they also believe
[01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:03.900]   crazy shit too.
[01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:05.500]   There's no Yang without a Yang, I guess.
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:09.260]   - But I think the conspiracy theories arise only
[01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:13.020]   when the people in positions of power in government
[01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:15.180]   and institutions are full of shit.
[01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:18.020]   Like the air will be taken out of the conspiracy theories
[01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:20.660]   if the people in elected power would be much more honest.
[01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:21.940]   Like just like real.
[01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:23.640]   You have people like Andrew Yang,
[01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:26.220]   whatever you think about him, just more honest.
[01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:29.500]   He just like says whatever the hell comes to mind.
[01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:32.700]   By the way, he's running for New York mayor.
[01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:33.540]   - Mayor, yeah.
[01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:34.740]   - Do you have opinions?
[01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:35.900]   - Yeah, it's no good.
[01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:37.740]   I like Andrew Yang and it's no good.
[01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:40.500]   I'd be honest with you, I'm a lifelong New Yorker.
[01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:41.820]   I mean, I'm a New Yorker.
[01:23:41.820 --> 01:23:44.340]   - Well, you're a New Yorker, so nothing's good.
[01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:45.740]   - Well, something is good.
[01:23:45.740 --> 01:23:47.860]   - Okay, America. - And let's be honest
[01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:48.900]   about New York.
[01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:51.060]   It's a very socially liberal place.
[01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:52.900]   It is the head of the snake.
[01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:54.380]   New York is the country.
[01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:56.340]   If New York, when New York's not doing good,
[01:23:56.340 --> 01:23:57.580]   country's not doing good.
[01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:01.460]   It's the most important city, DC, New York.
[01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:03.180]   It's really Rome, be honest.
[01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:05.540]   Maybe I'm biased, I don't know.
[01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:06.380]   - No.
[01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:07.820]   (laughing)
[01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:09.700]   - We just did, New Yorkers, we walk around everywhere
[01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:12.400]   and we go, this is just like New York, but not New York.
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:17.420]   But New York needs, and I'm a guy who leans left.
[01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:20.300]   I just, I lean left and that's just what it is.
[01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:21.860]   - A dictator, is that where you're going?
[01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:22.700]   - No, we need-- - Are we going back
[01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:25.080]   to Stalinism? - We need, it's a money town.
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:26.540]   Let's be, come on, man.
[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:29.500]   I mean, New York is a money town.
[01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:33.460]   And Wall Street, and then when AOC and her cronies
[01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:36.740]   at the local level rejected that Amazon thing,
[01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:39.460]   you're going like, what do you think makes cities?
[01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:42.300]   What's gonna create jobs in the 21st century?
[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:44.100]   What do we need, more nail salons?
[01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:45.500]   More pizza places?
[01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:47.340]   I mean, we're living in the tech revolution
[01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:51.220]   and whatever your opinions are about Jeff Bezos,
[01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:53.340]   that's the world, tech.
[01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:54.700]   And they want you to come here,
[01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:56.080]   of course you give 'em tax breaks.
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:58.180]   That's why companies go anywhere.
[01:24:58.180 --> 01:24:59.800]   She's so fucking utopian,
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:02.220]   and that progressive wing is so utopian,
[01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:05.180]   and that always ends in disaster
[01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:06.660]   because it's not rooted in reality.
[01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:08.220]   It doesn't accept the reality
[01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:09.500]   that people are self-interested.
[01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:12.380]   Now they're gonna do this 14%, 15% tax hike
[01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:13.900]   on people making a million dollars more.
[01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:16.260]   In New York City, a million dollars is not that much.
[01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:18.100]   So people are gonna flee New York.
[01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:19.820]   The tax base is gonna flee.
[01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:21.860]   New York's gonna fall to shit like it did before.
[01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:23.320]   - So you're saying it basically needs
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:24.620]   a more capitalist front,
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:26.480]   a more capitalistic type of thinker.
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:28.860]   - Bloomberg, Giuliani when he was still sane
[01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:31.160]   and his hair wasn't melting off his face.
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:33.480]   Prosecutor, you need a tough,
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:34.360]   I mean, I don't know what's happened.
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:36.480]   That guy's lost it, but it's fun.
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:37.400]   - Yeah, it's fun to watch.
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:40.040]   - Yeah, it's fun to watch him be just like Trump's lackey.
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:41.600]   Like, yeah, boy, whatever you want, boss.
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:43.500]   I'll just say whatever you want, boss.
[01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:47.160]   New York is a money town that needs a money guy
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:49.360]   and sort of more of a Republican.
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:50.760]   I have to say on the local level,
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:53.200]   as more of a guy who leans left, I'll just be honest.
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:56.540]   It's a tough city that needs a tough mayor,
[01:25:56.540 --> 01:25:57.540]   not some guy who's going like,
[01:25:57.540 --> 01:25:59.580]   "I understand, we all need free money."
[01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:02.660]   Andrew Yang, I think is right in the big picture
[01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:04.580]   'cause all the real jobs are somewhere else.
[01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:06.020]   And you look at those Asian cities, you go like,
[01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:07.940]   "Oh, that's what our cities used to look like
[01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:09.540]   "at the Industrial Revolution."
[01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:12.300]   You know, there was jobs and people were making things here.
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:14.220]   And now you look at those cities in Asia
[01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:15.100]   and you're going like, "Wow."
[01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:16.380]   And then you go to Detroit and you're like,
[01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:17.620]   "Yeah, we're done."
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:19.860]   You go to Cleveland, you go, "We're done."
[01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:22.360]   - So I don't, actually, it's funny.
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:24.940]   The reason I really like Andrew Yang is
[01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:27.140]   I've learned a lot every time he talks.
[01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:28.620]   Like, it's not his opinions,
[01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:31.540]   he's just giving a lot of data, like information.
[01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:32.380]   Which I--
[01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:34.140]   - Just start a podcast, don't run for mayor.
[01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:34.980]   - Yeah, that's true.
[01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:37.180]   He already has a podcast, I think, Yang Speaks.
[01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:38.020]   - Who doesn't?
[01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:38.860]   - Who doesn't?
[01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:40.260]   - Fucking who doesn't now?
[01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:41.460]   That's the way we communicate.
[01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:44.180]   I don't even talk to people unless it's on a podcast.
[01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:46.860]   - Well, listen, man, I'm not gonna criticize that
[01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:47.980]   because there is something,
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.400]   like I talked to my dad on a podcast for four hours
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:55.320]   and I'm not sure I would ever talk to him
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:57.560]   in the way we talked without the podcast.
[01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:58.940]   - What does he do?
[01:26:58.940 --> 01:26:59.780]   - Physicist.
[01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:00.600]   - Oh shit.
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:01.440]   - But like--
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:02.260]   - I'm gonna check that episode out.
[01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:05.440]   - Yeah, it's episode 100 and,
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:11.840]   you know, the way I recorded that podcast
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:14.760]   is I tried to put my ego aside.
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:17.000]   It's actually really tough to talk to your dad,
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.360]   especially 'cause you're giving him a platform.
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:21.700]   Especially, so at that time,
[01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:24.620]   there's already a bit of a platform for this podcast.
[01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:27.620]   And so there's this, as a son,
[01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:30.660]   you think like, oh, here it goes with this bullshit again.
[01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:34.340]   Like that's the natural son thought you have.
[01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:36.940]   But at the same time, I wanted to,
[01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:38.940]   the way I thought about it is in 20 years,
[01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:41.320]   when I look back, like I wanna do a conversation
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:43.580]   where I'm happy with it, you know?
[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:45.040]   So I wanna make him shine.
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:47.760]   But I also called him out on like,
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:49.940]   why were you so distant?
[01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:50.780]   - Wow.
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:51.800]   - Like all of that kind of stuff.
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:53.440]   Yeah, it was very difficult to do,
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:54.680]   but it was really important to do.
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:55.920]   And I don't think I'd be able to do it
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:57.800]   without a microphone.
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:58.880]   - Right.
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:00.480]   - Listen, how often do we sit there
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:01.960]   and just focus our attention,
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:03.720]   just look at the other person?
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:05.640]   I don't know, man.
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:07.360]   This is not even recording right now.
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:08.200]   (laughing)
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:09.020]   - No, really.
[01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:10.360]   - I just invited you over.
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:11.920]   - Just so we could actually, you're right.
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:14.120]   The podcast does make, like I've been listening
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:15.800]   to every word you've been saying.
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:17.240]   And if we weren't doing a podcast,
[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:18.400]   I might be looking at my phone
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:20.600]   or being self-conscious about something else
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:21.440]   or nervous or anxious.
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:23.640]   - You're zoomed in, especially with people close to you.
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:25.800]   I mean, that was, I recommend that actually
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:29.520]   for people to talk to their family on a podcast.
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:32.360]   Or like fake or not, that's really powerful.
[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:35.360]   It made me realize that there's a clear distinction
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:38.280]   between the conversations we usually have with humans
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:41.580]   and those we have when a podcast is being recorded.
[01:28:41.580 --> 01:28:45.760]   What the fuck were we talking on before that?
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:47.520]   I knew you were gonna lose your train of thought
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:49.160]   on that one because that's a big one.
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:50.760]   There's emotion behind that one.
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:53.600]   A podcast with dad, that's gonna take you to a place.
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:55.160]   It took you to a place.
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:57.200]   It took you outside of interviewer.
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:58.040]   - New York, it went to a place.
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:28:59.320]   - New York and Yang, yeah.
[01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:00.800]   - In New York and Yang.
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:02.200]   So the data, one of the things
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:03.680]   that really surprised me about.
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:05.560]   (laughing)
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:07.440]   I like the psychoanalysis you just threw in there.
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:09.200]   - Yeah, I knew that was gonna happen.
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:10.720]   Yeah, it took you to a place.
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:12.840]   - So Angie Yang mentioned--
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:14.520]   - Do you respect me now, dad?
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:16.720]   MIT, is it enough?
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:18.720]   A fucking million people listening to this?
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:20.520]   I've got 14 Rogans.
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:21.800]   Is it enough, dad?
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:22.760]   I'm creating robots.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:24.120]   Is it enough for you?
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:25.080]   - It's never enough.
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:26.040]   - That's what drives you probably.
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:27.160]   - That's probably what drives me.
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:30.200]   That's what gives meaning to life is it's never enough.
[01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:33.280]   And I hope to pass that on to my kids one day,
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:34.680]   that nothing's ever enough.
[01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:36.480]   - Whether they're robot or human, right?
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:37.320]   Your kids.
[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:38.880]   - Most likely, let's be honest, robot.
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:39.720]   - You might call one of your robot.
[01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:40.760]   Do you love your robot?
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:41.680]   Are you starting to love your,
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:43.200]   is it gonna be like that Pygmalion thing?
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:44.520]   You create them and then they kill you,
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:45.520]   but even while they're killing you,
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:46.360]   you got a tear rolling down your eye.
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:48.600]   - The tear, a slow one tear, one tear.
[01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:49.440]   And just--
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:50.480]   - Why are you doing this Frankenstein?
[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:52.960]   And they're going, "Why, why?"
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:53.880]   - But I loved you.
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:56.520]   Those would be the last words out of my mouth.
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:59.240]   But Angie Yang mentioned something on the,
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:03.720]   that it cost $400,000,
[01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:07.240]   over $400,000 per year to support
[01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:10.000]   one person in prison in New York.
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:14.760]   When I heard that number, it was really confusing to me.
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:19.040]   It cost that much, 400K per person.
[01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:24.280]   And it was really refreshing to hear a politician
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:27.160]   describe a particular problem with data,
[01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:29.400]   that this is this prison industrial complex,
[01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:30.880]   whatever the hell it is.
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:32.400]   And whether the solution,
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:33.960]   it's unclear what the solution is.
[01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:35.200]   I think he has solutions,
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:38.400]   but just the honesty of presenting that information
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:39.280]   was refreshing.
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:42.920]   And I'm not sure a capitalistic person would solve that.
[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:44.800]   Those kinds of problems he might make worse.
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:48.800]   And I'm not, you know, I'm a huge fan of capitalism.
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:53.720]   I think the free market is the way we make progress
[01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:56.640]   in this world, but it seems to go wrong
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:58.320]   in certain directions,
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:00.640]   like the military industrial complex, the prison,
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:03.160]   anything that ends with industrial complex.
[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:06.320]   And so I'm not sure.
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:09.440]   I'm not sure if all of the problems,
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:10.920]   you're basically saying,
[01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:15.160]   let's put New York's problems aside.
[01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:19.120]   We need to have New York shine first
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:20.560]   to do what it does best.
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:21.600]   - Essentially, yeah.
[01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:23.400]   - And then the problems we'll fix them.
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:26.200]   Well, and then we can focus on the problems.
[01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:27.720]   But if you just say like, here's a problem,
[01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:29.240]   here's a problem, here's a problem,
[01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:30.600]   let's make sure we have the safety net
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:32.640]   that protects us against all of these kinds of problems.
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:35.160]   That's not going to, that's going to kill the city,
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:39.320]   the spirit of the city that is, in your biased opinion,
[01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:40.800]   the Rome of the world.
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:44.600]   That said, a lot of people are fleeing New York.
[01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:46.520]   - Yeah, that's why I say it.
[01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:48.960]   That's the reality of the situation is, you know,
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:51.680]   I'm all for the public good, but yeah,
[01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:53.600]   there needs to be, back to that Greek expression,
[01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:54.520]   pon metronariston.
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:58.800]   I also think the free market is responsible for progress.
[01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:00.120]   I think it's the most natural thing,
[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:02.000]   the thing that's most aligned with human nature,
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.480]   which is self-interest,
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:06.480]   and which I believe, not to the extent that Ayn Rand would,
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:08.880]   but I do believe people are mostly self-interested,
[01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:11.440]   especially with one gun to the head.
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:12.880]   Morals are out the window.
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:14.120]   You know, it's about survival.
[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:16.920]   So, you know, create a system that respects that
[01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:17.960]   and acknowledges that.
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:21.160]   But socialism works very well, at least right now,
[01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:25.640]   as a check, as to temper the excesses of capitalism.
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:30.640]   And in certain scenarios is the more appropriate system,
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:31.640]   you know, in a vacuum.
[01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:36.640]   So one being prisons or, you know, governance, you know,
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:38.880]   parks.
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:41.160]   - Maybe even, well, and this is a difficult one,
[01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:42.520]   but in healthcare.
[01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:43.360]   - Healthcare.
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:44.520]   - It's unclear what to write.
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:45.600]   There's a lot of debates there.
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.040]   - Yeah, doctors want votes.
[01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:50.960]   - So I guess you're voting for AOC, you're saying.
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:53.600]   - No, I'm not voting for AOC, but I do,
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:55.640]   it's just a tough one, that's a tough one,
[01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:59.040]   but ultimately the Hippocratic Oath,
[01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:01.760]   it's like, how do you turn people away, man?
[01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:02.840]   How do you do that to people?
[01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:07.840]   It's like, it's a tough thing to reconcile helping people,
[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:13.520]   curing people with the marketplace.
[01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:16.400]   It's just, I can understand why that one's so tough.
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:18.320]   And then you got hypochondriacs, of course,
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:19.600]   who drain the system, you know,
[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:21.960]   like people who have anxiety, like me,
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:24.720]   who had COVID and called 14, you know,
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:26.560]   I called 14 ambulances.
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:28.480]   So, and then of course we're fat
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:31.000]   and the free market made us fat because it played,
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.600]   the marketing made us want all this junk food
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:34.520]   and that's a burden on the healthcare system.
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:35.480]   So we gotta do something about that.
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:36.320]   We gotta get creative.
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:38.360]   We need new thinkers, I'll be one of them.
[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:40.960]   When you go to a fast food restaurant, you stand on a scale.
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:43.960]   If you're over a certain thing, you can't be served.
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:45.600]   It's good for the healthcare system.
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:47.040]   You know, you just hand it a salad and say,
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:49.600]   "Sorry, this burger's illegal for right now."
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:53.240]   If you achieve these certain BMI goals,
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:57.160]   then you can have this burger, but right now you can't.
[01:33:57.160 --> 01:33:58.680]   That's where the state's important.
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:33:59.520]   - Yeah.
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:00.440]   - Okay, to regulate our freedoms.
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:02.240]   No slurpees, I'm with you, Bloomberg.
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:03.560]   (laughing)
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:04.880]   - Well, I'm with you to go along.
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:06.320]   I think the salads are too expensive.
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:07.400]   They should be subsidized.
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:10.500]   If you go to like a fast food joint,
[01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:12.720]   the burger's always gonna be cheaper than the salad.
[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:13.840]   And this does not make sense.
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:15.200]   We should run on this platform.
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:16.440]   I'll be your vice president.
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:19.760]   We'll ban burgers for people over a certain weight
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:21.000]   and make salads cheap.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.240]   - Three-day work weeks.
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:23.320]   Why has that been happening?
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:24.720]   - Okay, where are you going with this one?
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:26.360]   - Good, good for the economy.
[01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:27.680]   Stimulates the economy, right?
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:30.340]   More shifts, creates more jobs,
[01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:32.400]   more people spending 'cause they have more leisure time,
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:34.840]   boosts the leisure economy.
[01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:36.960]   Why are we still doing the five-day work week?
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:39.680]   That was tempered from the seven-day work week.
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:42.040]   It used to be seven-day work week.
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:43.280]   It used to be like,
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:44.640]   people who are just these libertarians,
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:45.480]   it's like, "Come on, dude.
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:46.720]   What is this?
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:49.080]   Are we freshmen in college?
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:50.400]   We're gonna talk about Ayn Rand next.
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:52.000]   Let's talk about reality, okay?
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:52.840]   And human nature.
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:54.560]   People are fucking greedy.
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:56.240]   They lie.
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:57.200]   There's no end to up,
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:59.520]   which is one of my favorite expressions.
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:00.360]   - No end to up?
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:01.200]   - No end to up.
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:02.040]   There's no end to up.
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:04.800]   - Can we dissect that from a Randian perspective?
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:07.680]   - There's no end to up, which is,
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:08.560]   you just keep going.
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:09.400]   It's never enough.
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:10.960]   The human flaw, it's never enough.
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:11.840]   No end to up.
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.400]   More, more, more.
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:16.000]   And you have to reconcile the fact that you're gonna die.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.840]   So this no end to up thing is that balance
[01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:25.480]   is just as valuable as progress.
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:27.440]   So we have to reconcile those two things
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:30.200]   and put them on a seesaw
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:31.600]   and figure out how to get two people
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:34.280]   who have the equal weight to keep it like that.
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:35.120]   And that's the goal.
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:38.240]   And it constantly vacillates according to the time.
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:39.440]   Sometimes you need a little more socialism.
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:40.840]   Sometimes you need a little more capitalism.
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:43.320]   You gotta fly the plane, man.
[01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:44.840]   You gotta fly the plane, dude.
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:48.160]   - What's your, looking back at history,
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:52.360]   how you, is there a moment, time period in history,
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:54.920]   a person in history that's most fascinating to you?
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:56.160]   You mentioned Bernie Madoff.
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:57.880]   Maybe second to Bernie Madoff.
[01:35:57.880 --> 01:35:59.800]   Is there, in the Battle of Crete,
[01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:01.440]   is there something that you've always been curious about?
[01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:02.280]   Even if it's something
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:04.240]   you haven't actually researched that well yet,
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:06.440]   just something that pulled at your curiosity,
[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:09.040]   that instructed the way you think about the world?
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:11.120]   - An individual or an event?
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:12.920]   - Event, individual,
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:17.920]   moment in history or a person in history.
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:23.240]   - There's a few, but Queen Elizabeth,
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:26.840]   the Elizabethan era, the sun never sets
[01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:30.160]   in the British Empire, very successful empire.
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:35.040]   What an absolute success story that is
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:37.780]   is for a leader and a woman.
[01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:40.920]   - Can you tell a little bit about her story?
[01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:41.840]   - Well, you know-- - I actually don't know
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:43.480]   much about the British Empire. - Yeah, she had a good run.
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:46.320]   I think it's like 70 years, there's a Shakespeare.
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:49.200]   Oh, I guess, what's the word, Pax Romana,
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:52.120]   the period of Rome that was at peace,
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:54.640]   and they flourish, a couple of emperors
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:56.360]   like Trajan or some good ones,
[01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:58.200]   and I think he was part of the Pax Romana,
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:36:59.760]   that sort of just a peace
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:01.320]   and a comfortable flourishing time.
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:05.880]   And England had sort of that in their empire under her.
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:08.320]   Successful reign, she murdered her cousin.
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:09.240]   You know the movies,
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:13.360]   Cate Blanchett plays her and does so,
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:14.800]   and she didn't win the Oscar
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:16.720]   because fucking Gwyneth Paltrow
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:19.460]   put a British accent on in Shakespeare in Love.
[01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:20.320]   It's a tragedy.
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:21.320]   Why do I know this?
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:22.600]   Because I'm not a full man.
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:25.960]   I'm a comedian, which means I do skits, I perform.
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:29.800]   Cate Blanchett's an incredible actress, great movies.
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:32.280]   She was just so, and here's the thing,
[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:34.120]   she never got married.
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:39.120]   She was so astute at public relations.
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:43.760]   And imagine how strong you gotta be as a woman
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:47.560]   to lead the greatest empire maybe known to man at the time,
[01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:50.000]   and to do so so successfully.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.920]   How Machiavellian you have to be,
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:53.040]   how idealist you have to be,
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:54.800]   how much of a good marketer you have to be.
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:56.260]   Propaganda machine was on point.
[01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:58.040]   She was married to England.
[01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:01.320]   She was adored the way she adorned herself.
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:02.840]   You walked in, you're like, holy man,
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:04.340]   God just walked in here.
[01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:06.100]   And of course she got fucked.
[01:38:06.100 --> 01:38:07.480]   I mean, who doesn't fuck?
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:08.600]   We all fuck.
[01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:10.440]   Even robots one day will fuck.
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:13.400]   But she did that propaganda thing.
[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:17.920]   And historians, they haven't decided this,
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:20.040]   but I believe she fucked.
[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:24.920]   And I believe she did that as a tool of propaganda.
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:26.200]   I'm married to England.
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:29.520]   - So you're directly referring to like using sex
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:31.040]   as a way to manipulate people.
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:35.560]   - Well, she was known as like the virgin queen.
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:37.840]   And her thing was like, I'm married to England.
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:40.800]   Like I can't be distracted by man or woman, blah, blah, blah.
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:42.240]   She never had any kids, nothing.
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:47.120]   I think she did that as a tool of manipulation.
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:48.880]   Which you need.
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:51.800]   Rulers need to, Obama made you feel good.
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:53.840]   And then he went and carpet bombed everywhere.
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:56.700]   You need to feel good about your guy,
[01:38:56.700 --> 01:38:58.120]   no matter how evil they are.
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:00.920]   And she was fucking a dictator.
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:01.800]   But when you look back at her,
[01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:03.660]   everyone's like, oh my God, she was so great.
[01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:06.360]   The horror and the shit that she had to do,
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:08.160]   she didn't put that in the history books,
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:09.740]   but that's what probably was part
[01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:11.760]   of what made her successful.
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:14.960]   And she's a fascinating character to ponder on
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:16.280]   'cause she was so successful.
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:20.040]   And England flourished so much.
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:21.540]   And it's just fascinating to me
[01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:23.440]   because she was the great virgin queen.
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:26.660]   And can you think of, there's no other woman
[01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:29.640]   who was that, I mean, Angela Merkel, I mean, come on.
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:32.000]   I mean, there's nobody who comes close.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.640]   And defeating the Spanish Armada,
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:34.760]   I think that happened under her.
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:36.480]   I mean, I'm no professional historian,
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:38.640]   but I mean, the woman crushed.
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:42.600]   - Do you think it's more effective to lead by love,
[01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:44.320]   which it sounds like what she did
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:46.800]   from the PR perspective or by fear?
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:48.080]   Where do you land on that?
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:50.640]   - Dude, I'm no leader, that's a great question.
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:52.080]   We gotta ask Joe.
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:53.680]   (laughing)
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:55.080]   - Well, yeah, this is interesting
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:57.120]   'cause I think leading in the 21st century
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:59.420]   in whatever ways is different.
[01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:02.020]   I think it's very difficult to lead by fear.
[01:40:02.020 --> 01:40:05.680]   I mean, that's why I find Putin fascinating
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:08.800]   and like really fascinating.
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:11.920]   Like is he a relic of another era
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:14.220]   or is he something that will still be necessary
[01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:16.720]   in the coming decades for certain nations?
[01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:19.280]   - I think he's a, I don't think he's a relic
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:20.120]   from another era.
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:23.000]   I think his background, I think he is who you think he is
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.360]   because his background was in espionage.
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:28.360]   His background was in subterfuge and espionage.
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:31.320]   I think I've said the word subterfuge maybe 10 times now.
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:32.160]   But he-
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:34.240]   - You like big words, you're intellectuals.
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:37.460]   - I just, I'm sitting here with you, it's time to flex.
[01:40:37.460 --> 01:40:41.000]   But he's very good at that, right?
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:44.000]   Like controlling people with psychology
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:47.080]   and even if you look at the way he sort of used the internet
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:51.760]   and has sort of been, gotten into the citizens
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:56.600]   of other countries opinions and it's very KGB.
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:59.480]   He also looks great without a shirt on a pony.
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:00.320]   - On a horse.
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:01.640]   - On a horse, yeah, yeah.
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:05.120]   I thought he would choose a pony 'cause a pony's smaller.
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:07.520]   - Would you put Queen Elizabeth
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:09.040]   as the greatest leader of all time?
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:10.940]   - Probably, yeah.
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:15.940]   I think as a woman and you look at the length of the reign,
[01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:19.420]   I think it's like 70 something years or something like that
[01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:23.260]   that she reigned, success, man, success.
[01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:26.340]   She used the church, she used public psychology.
[01:41:26.340 --> 01:41:29.420]   Shakespeare, the greatest playwright of all time
[01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:31.620]   under her reign.
[01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:35.500]   People were going to plays and it was a success front
[01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:37.340]   and she was marauding everywhere else,
[01:41:37.340 --> 01:41:41.660]   marauding and culling resources for the empire.
[01:41:41.660 --> 01:41:44.380]   Just say a absolute successful.
[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:46.900]   It's even a token of her success,
[01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:48.940]   we don't consider her a dictator.
[01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:52.180]   She's a dictator, you know, she was queen.
[01:41:52.180 --> 01:41:54.140]   This is my thing I love about the feudal system
[01:41:54.140 --> 01:41:56.560]   that these fucking countries still have feudal systems.
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:58.940]   They're celebrating a horrible thing,
[01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:01.980]   divine right of kings, oppression.
[01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:05.320]   Kings were dictators and now they have fucking ceremonial.
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:07.700]   Why don't we have a ceremonial Führer?
[01:42:07.700 --> 01:42:08.660]   What is in Germany?
[01:42:08.660 --> 01:42:09.660]   He doesn't do any of the bad stuff,
[01:42:09.660 --> 01:42:11.740]   he just rolls around and does this shit.
[01:42:11.740 --> 01:42:13.100]   I mean, it's like, what the fuck?
[01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:15.820]   There's no difference between a Hitler and a fucking king,
[01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:17.680]   they did the same horrible shit.
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:19.940]   Why not a fucking ceremonial conqueror?
[01:42:19.940 --> 01:42:21.960]   Alexander the Great walks in, rapes a little bit,
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:23.580]   but it's all fine, it's for ceremony.
[01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:25.500]   He represents the country, Macedonia.
[01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:26.700]   It's great.
[01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:30.260]   - It's interesting to see that some,
[01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:33.860]   you're starting to see a bit of that in Russia with Stalin,
[01:42:33.860 --> 01:42:36.760]   actually, the celebration of a man
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:39.900]   that helped win the Great Patriotic War.
[01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:40.880]   - Uh-oh, yeah.
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:43.160]   - Right, so you're already starting to see that.
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:44.800]   It's very possible in history books,
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:48.360]   he'll be seen as maybe like a Genghis Khan type of character
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:51.760]   and you forget the millions that he tortured.
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:54.480]   So you're one of the most successful and brilliant people
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:55.520]   the world has ever seen,
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:59.840]   so you're the good person to ask for advice.
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:03.020]   There's a lot of young people that look up to you.
[01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:05.040]   God bless their souls and hearts.
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:06.560]   - Made the right choice.
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:08.600]   - What advice would you give to a young person,
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:12.320]   maybe to yourself, to a young version of yourself?
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:15.480]   Just how to live a successful, a good life.
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:18.220]   - Be doggedly you.
[01:43:18.220 --> 01:43:23.080]   I think the magic happens when you are stubbornly,
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:25.080]   doggedly you and you meet other people
[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:26.120]   who are doing the same.
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:28.520]   And the real magic of life,
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:30.880]   the real true currency in this ephemeral life
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:35.880]   is sort of the communication that happens between people.
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:37.420]   That's the real currency.
[01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:39.660]   Friendships, love, it's cliche,
[01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:44.660]   but I think the meaning of life is to experience love.
[01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:47.860]   And I think people often mistake,
[01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:50.560]   maybe it's because of Hollywood films and things like that,
[01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:54.700]   that love is a feeling, but it's not, it's an action.
[01:43:54.700 --> 01:43:56.940]   So that took me a while to learn
[01:43:56.940 --> 01:43:59.500]   and I think that's why I've made decisions since
[01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:01.700]   that I think have been good for me and healthy for me.
[01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:03.220]   Love is an action.
[01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:06.780]   People can say things, you can feel things.
[01:44:06.780 --> 01:44:08.300]   That doesn't mean they're necessarily real.
[01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:10.140]   It's all chemical reactions.
[01:44:10.140 --> 01:44:13.220]   It's all tied to our immaturity
[01:44:13.220 --> 01:44:17.060]   and psychological issues and survival.
[01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:22.060]   But action, when you do things, when you act out of love
[01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:25.240]   and that's what it's about.
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:27.400]   - Is there times when you were younger
[01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:30.940]   where you were kind of dishonest
[01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:32.980]   with who you are to yourself?
[01:44:32.980 --> 01:44:33.820]   - Yeah.
[01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:35.820]   - In terms of like, what kind of things did you have to do
[01:44:35.820 --> 01:44:38.340]   to shake yourself up and be like,
[01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:41.840]   okay, I thought I'm gonna be a scientist,
[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:44.400]   but instead I realized I'm gonna do this.
[01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:45.780]   - Yeah, my parents were- - I'm gonna make funny.
[01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:48.700]   - Yeah, comedy is a hard thing to explain
[01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:51.340]   to an immigrant mother who came here
[01:44:51.340 --> 01:44:53.060]   and under Nazi occupied Crete
[01:44:53.060 --> 01:44:55.500]   and became a human rights lawyer and lawyer.
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:58.720]   My brother's a lawyer, my father's a lawyer,
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:44:59.560]   clawed his way up.
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:00.400]   His dad was a-
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:03.040]   - So you're a disappointment.
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:04.120]   - I'm the black sheep.
[01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:07.680]   Yeah, my brother went to Oxford, Georgetown Law at Brown.
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:10.320]   (laughing)
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:13.000]   Has a master's in law degrees.
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.140]   My mother has four law degrees.
[01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:18.440]   She was on the Human Rights Commission in New York
[01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:20.140]   up for a judgeship under Dinkins.
[01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:24.280]   She was the editor of Unitar.
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:26.740]   She wrote a seminal piece on the human rights of children
[01:45:26.740 --> 01:45:27.900]   for the United Nations.
[01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:30.300]   And yeah, I was a comedian.
[01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:31.340]   I was always a fuck up.
[01:45:31.340 --> 01:45:33.300]   And the thing that I was best at,
[01:45:33.300 --> 01:45:34.940]   the only thing I was ever decent at
[01:45:34.940 --> 01:45:37.220]   was just like making people laugh.
[01:45:37.220 --> 01:45:39.180]   I don't know why, I don't know where that comes from.
[01:45:39.180 --> 01:45:40.020]   But-
[01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:42.140]   - Was there ever a question or was there a moment
[01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:43.940]   where you decided this is what I'm gonna do?
[01:45:43.940 --> 01:45:46.180]   - There was a moment after I graduated college, yeah.
[01:45:46.180 --> 01:45:48.740]   But I was thinking about all types of stuff
[01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:50.900]   that other people imposed on me.
[01:45:50.900 --> 01:45:52.540]   And I was honest with myself.
[01:45:52.540 --> 01:45:55.200]   And once I figured out it was an actual career path,
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:56.160]   I wasn't even aware.
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:57.600]   Back then the internet wasn't huge.
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:00.680]   You know, late '99, 2000, it wasn't big yet.
[01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:03.000]   So I thought Robin Williams was just like an actor.
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:04.880]   I didn't know there was comedy clubs and all.
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:07.840]   So once I learned that, I was just like, I tried it.
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:09.900]   I suffered from massive anxiety.
[01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:12.360]   I remember the first time I did comedy, my arms went numb.
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:14.220]   I started having a massive panic attack.
[01:46:14.220 --> 01:46:15.940]   I have my first set, I can show it to you.
[01:46:15.940 --> 01:46:17.400]   It's like, I suggest, I just-
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:18.240]   - On video?
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:19.060]   - Yeah, on video.
[01:46:19.060 --> 01:46:19.900]   - Oh, nice.
[01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:20.740]   - I kept going, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:21.560]   And the reason why I kept saying thank you
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:23.840]   is 'cause I forgot my whole joke 'cause I was so scared.
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:24.720]   And then they laughed
[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:26.560]   because of the amount of times I said thank you.
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:29.880]   And then once they laughed, I remembered the whole thing.
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:32.440]   And I did the five minutes and I remember getting off.
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:35.300]   And for a person who never felt like he had a place anywhere,
[01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:39.560]   nothing ever felt right, that felt like, okay, I found it.
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:41.160]   This is what I'm supposed to do.
[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:42.000]   This is it.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000]   It was the only time in my life I felt that.
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.560]   I haven't felt it since, never felt it before.
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:48.420]   So it's the only thing I can do.
[01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:49.360]   And-
[01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:50.200]   - Yeah, I had that.
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:51.600]   That's funny 'cause there's,
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:54.800]   I have a similar experience, like immigrant family.
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:56.920]   And the world tells you to do certain things
[01:46:56.920 --> 01:46:58.440]   and you think that's right.
[01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:02.920]   But then you put yourself in situations,
[01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:07.920]   by luck probably, where it's like, oh, this feels right.
[01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:11.280]   I don't know what this means, but this feels right.
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:15.040]   I think the biggest moment like that for me was,
[01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:17.140]   I don't know what to make of it exactly,
[01:47:17.140 --> 01:47:21.160]   but when I met Spot, the robot, the four-legged robot,
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:22.600]   it was like five years ago.
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:28.600]   It felt like the depth of fascinating ideas
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:31.480]   that are yet to be explored with this thing.
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:32.400]   This felt like a journey.
[01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:33.920]   It was like a door that opened.
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:37.080]   I was like, I don't wanna be a professor.
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:40.280]   At that point, I realized I don't want to-
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:41.120]   - Interesting.
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:43.320]   - Do sort of generic stuff.
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:45.000]   I want to do something crazy.
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.720]   I want to do something big.
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:48.500]   That's the reason I stepped away from MIT.
[01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:50.840]   That's the reason I have this burning desire
[01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:51.720]   to do a startup.
[01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:54.040]   That's the reason I came to Austin.
[01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:56.040]   Yeah, I don't know what the hell it all means,
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:57.560]   but you just kind of follow that.
[01:47:57.560 --> 01:47:58.400]   - That's awesome.
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:00.280]   That sounds like you're following what's doggedly you.
[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:04.200]   And also I think, just to piggyback off it,
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:07.200]   I think that means no matter what it is,
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:10.280]   'cause I think the American dream is sold like,
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:13.560]   hey, if you're not Beyonce or if you're not famous,
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:14.380]   you're not worth it.
[01:48:14.380 --> 01:48:15.220]   I hate that.
[01:48:15.220 --> 01:48:16.960]   And that's what I love so much about certain countries
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:20.260]   like Sweden, it's like where everyone has healthcare
[01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:21.620]   and stuff like that, 'cause everyone's a little,
[01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:22.460]   is valued more.
[01:48:22.460 --> 01:48:25.300]   It's like whatever, if you wanna be a doorman, do it.
[01:48:25.300 --> 01:48:26.500]   It's all the same.
[01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:28.140]   Prince was not happy.
[01:48:28.140 --> 01:48:30.240]   There's no, just because you're rich or famous,
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:31.980]   you're still the same guy.
[01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:34.780]   Whether your possessions are a lot, little.
[01:48:34.780 --> 01:48:37.460]   It's like, I have met some doormen.
[01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:39.660]   I have met some tax gabbers that,
[01:48:39.660 --> 01:48:42.100]   a lot of you not, are more fascinating.
[01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:44.900]   Comedians are horrible people.
[01:48:44.900 --> 01:48:45.740]   (laughing)
[01:48:45.740 --> 01:48:47.140]   Some, I wanna get away from all of them.
[01:48:47.140 --> 01:48:50.500]   I have very few friends, Paul Verzi, Tim Dillon,
[01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:52.840]   who are comedians 'cause they're awful, awful people.
[01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:55.860]   Some of the people who you know the most,
[01:48:55.860 --> 01:48:58.740]   who are the most famous, are not who they say they are.
[01:48:58.740 --> 01:49:00.240]   Usually that's the case.
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:01.780]   They're putting on that public facade
[01:49:01.780 --> 01:49:04.020]   'cause they're fucking sociopaths.
[01:49:04.020 --> 01:49:05.260]   And they're horrible people.
[01:49:05.260 --> 01:49:07.100]   And some of the most beautiful people I've met
[01:49:07.100 --> 01:49:09.920]   and the most interesting people I've met have regular jobs.
[01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:13.300]   There's no shame in any fucking job.
[01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:16.220]   We don't all have to be rappers with like rims.
[01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:17.400]   It's just a weird thing.
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:19.400]   - Yeah, fame is a drug.
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:22.160]   And yeah, comedians, I agree with you.
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:24.660]   There's some part of me that knows
[01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:26.880]   that there'll be a moment in my life
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:30.000]   when I'm standing there with like a sword
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.860]   or a knife in my stomach
[01:49:31.860 --> 01:49:35.520]   and looking at Tim Dillon's smiling face,
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:39.680]   saying, "You shouldn't have trusted me.
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:41.720]   You stupid fuck."
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:43.720]   So on that note, (laughs)
[01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:46.200]   Giannis, I've been a huge fan of yours.
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:47.840]   I love what you're doing with "Long Days,"
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:49.040]   now your new podcast.
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:52.680]   And I obviously love all the stuff you've done before
[01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:53.560]   with "History of Hyenas."
[01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:57.480]   The chemistry you have with yourself is also fun to watch.
[01:49:57.480 --> 01:49:58.760]   So man, I'm a huge fan.
[01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:00.720]   It's a huge honor that you come down here.
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:01.560]   Thanks so much for talking to me.
[01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:03.400]   - It means so much to me to hear you say that.
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:04.220]   I really appreciate it.
[01:50:04.220 --> 01:50:06.440]   I'm a big fan of yours and "Have Me On" has been amazing.
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:07.280]   And just thank you, man.
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:08.640]   Thank you for "Have Me On."
[01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:10.560]   And people, if they wanna watch my special,

[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:15.760]   - And let's go eat some barbecue.
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:17.240]   - Let's do it.
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:18.800]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:19.920]   with Giannis Papas.

[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:38.160]   Thank you for listening
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:40.360]   and hope to see you next time.
[01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:42.940]   (upbeat music)
[01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:45.520]   (upbeat music)
