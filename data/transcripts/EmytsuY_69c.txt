[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   A podcast listener named Matthew writes in to ask about same-sex attraction.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.100]   He asks, "If so-called same-sex marriage is unbiblical, a truth which I, as a man struggling
[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.380]   with same-sex desires, affirm, what am I to do with 1 Corinthians 7 verses 8 and 9 if
[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.920]   I burn with homosexual passion?
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.640]   Am I misunderstanding that passion?
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.600]   I find these lusts even more difficult to battle in light of this passage because I
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.240]   feel stuck."
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.600]   I am deeply thankful that Matthew is honest about his same-sex attraction.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:45.200]   And I'm thankful that he embraces the biblical truth that acting out that attraction in homosexual
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.600]   practices would be sinful.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:59.320]   And therefore, as he says, he's struggling to be faithful to that conviction.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.480]   That's a great and a noble and God-pleasing thing, that struggle.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:15.280]   So he asks about 1 Corinthians 7 and 9 where Paul says, "If they cannot exercise self-control,
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.000]   they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion."
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.120]   Well, yes, that's true.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:31.600]   Marriage is one possible means of governing our sexual passions.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.400]   But there are two things to remember here, relevant for people who are heterosexual and
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.920]   people who struggle with homosexual desires.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.200]   Marriage is not a foolproof solution to a man's passions.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.640]   We know this because of how much adultery and how much pornography there is among married
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.880]   men.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:02.920]   So if marriage is not an option for you, heterosexual or homosexual, you are not being denied the
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.320]   solution to your passions.
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.140]   It's not the solution.
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.240]   Marriage is not the solution.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.040]   Here's the other thing to remember.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.600]   Paul explicitly addresses men who have same-sex attraction and how they are to manage their
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.600]   passions.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:27.880]   It's found in the chapter before chapter 7, not chapter 7.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.720]   We often read it just to establish that homosexual behavior is sin, and we fail to see the glory
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.680]   of the help that's in the text.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.240]   Let me read 1 Corinthians 6, 9, and 10.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.560]   "Do you not know that the righteous will not inherit the kingdom of God?
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.000]   Do not be deceived.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.280]   Neither sexually immoral," that is fornication, "nor idolaters," that's probably greed or
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:00.320]   covetousness, "nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor greedy,
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.080]   nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God."
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.540]   In other words, if you say, "I'm a greedy person, and that's the way I was born, and
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.400]   I will embrace greediness as a good thing," you will perish.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.920]   So don't think that any particular sin is being picked on here.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.640]   These are sins which if you love them, cherish them, pursue them, live in them, they will
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.600]   destroy you, not just homosexuality or fornication.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.080]   Now here's the next verse.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.640]   This is the crucial one.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:43.960]   "Such were some of you, practicers of homosexuality, such were some of you, but you were washed,
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:51.360]   you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.880]   Spirit of our God."
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.780]   That is massively important for those who struggle with same-sex attraction and aim
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.480]   to be pure and holy in their lives.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.520]   You were a practicer of homosexuality.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.560]   You were that, and you are no longer.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.600]   What happened?
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.120]   You embraced the name of Jesus as the banner over your life.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.060]   You submitted to him.
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.480]   You put your faith in him, and his blood cleansed you from all sins.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.480]   You're washed.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.840]   You're declared righteous.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.040]   You are sanctified.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:35.680]   And then specifically, Paul says this sanctifying, powerful influence was by the Spirit of our
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.240]   God.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.600]   So there's the practical daily key.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.600]   The power is the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:51.200]   First you know you are accepted and declared forgiven and cleansed and righteous, clean.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:57.560]   And then day by day, you trust God's promise to help you.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:05.640]   And by this promise, the Holy Spirit comes in power and helps you resist temptation.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:12.620]   You put to death the deeds of the body, as it says in Romans 8, 13, by the Spirit, relying
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.840]   on the Spirit, calling upon the Spirit, living in the Spirit.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.200]   It's not in you.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.920]   It's in him.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.320]   God supplies the Spirit to you, it says in Galatians 3, 5.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:29.400]   God supplies the Spirit to work these miracles by hearing with faith.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.160]   That is, you hear the promise.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:40.040]   You hear the gospel promise, and you believe it, and you bank on it.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.120]   And in and through that promise and that faith, the Holy Spirit comes.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:51.920]   And the way he comes is by making the promise of God's person and God's help and God's reward
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:57.480]   more precious to you than the power of the temptation you are facing, and thus you are
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.520]   able to kill it.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:09.080]   So my answer is, until marriage is God's call on your life, and don't assume it couldn't
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.080]   be.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.880]   I'm talking to a person with same-sex attraction.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:21.000]   Until marriage to a woman, or if you're struggling with lesbian issues, a man, until marriage
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.280]   to the opposite sex is your calling, bank on the precious work of Christ to secure every
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:38.360]   promise for you and to supply the mighty Holy Spirit to help you live a pure and useful
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.120]   life without sexual sin.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.480]   Amen.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.480]   Thank you for that, Pastor John.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.400]   And the sounds of the Phillips neighborhood filling the background as you, Pastor John,
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.760]   record from your home office.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.640]   And well, as many of you know, Victoria Osteen recently tried to explain how human happiness
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.520]   and God's glory interact, and it caused quite a firestorm online, and many of you wrote
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.520]   in.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.400]   Tomorrow, we will hear from Pastor John.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.400]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.440]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.440]   [end]
