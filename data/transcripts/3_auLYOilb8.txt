[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.840]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.860]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.120]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.960]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.040]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.680]   Recently, I had the pleasure of hosting two live events,
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.280]   one in Seattle, Washington, and one in Portland, Oregon,
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.080]   both entitled The Brain-Body Contract,
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.320]   where I discussed science and science-related tools
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.120]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.960]   My favorite part of each evening, however,
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.960]   was the question and answer period that followed the lecture.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.120]   I love the question and answer period
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.880]   because it gives me an opportunity to hear directly
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.700]   from the audience as to what they want to know most,
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.600]   and indeed to get into a bit of dialogue,
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.740]   so we really clarify what are the underlying mechanisms
[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.760]   of particular tools, how best to use the tools
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.260]   for things like focus and sleep.
[00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.240]   We also touch on some things related to mental health
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.380]   and physical health.
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.340]   It was a delight for me,
[00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.600]   and I like to think that the audience learned a lot.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.560]   I know that many of you weren't able to attend those events,
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.760]   but we wanted to make the information available to you.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.960]   Therefore, what follows this is a recording
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.480]   of the question and answer period
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.360]   from the lecture in Portland, Oregon.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.520]   I hope you'll find it to be both interesting and informative.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.060]   I'd also like to thank our sponsors of these live events.
[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.920]   The first is Momentous Supplements,
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.000]   which is our partner with the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.280]   providing supplements that are of the very highest quality,
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.760]   that ship international, and that are arranged in dosages
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.320]   and single ingredient formulations that make it possible
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.600]   for you to develop the optimal supplement strategy
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.440]   for you.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.560]   And I'd also like to thank our other sponsor,
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.600]   which is Inside Tracker,
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.620]   which provides blood tests and DNA tests,
[00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.040]   so you can monitor your immediate
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.660]   and long-term health progress.
[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.520]   I'd also like to announce
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.220]   that there are two new live events scheduled.
[00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.360]   The first one is going to take place Sunday, October 16th
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.800]   at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.560]   The other live event will take place Wednesday, November 9th
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.960]   at the Beacon Theater in New York City.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.920]   Tickets to both of those events are now available online
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.340]   at HubermanLab.com/tour.
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.040]   That's HubermanLab.com/tour.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.980]   I do hope that you learn from and enjoy the recording
[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.520]   of the question and answer period that follows this.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.540]   And last, but certainly not least,
[00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.280]   thank you for your interest in science.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.860]   [upbeat music]
[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:18.420]   What are the current best practices
[00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.860]   for post TBIs, traumatic brain injuries,
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.320]   for those of you that aren't familiar with TBI,
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.740]   especially long-term multiple, ooh, et cetera.
[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.800]   Thoughts on hyperbaric,
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.080]   oh, I'm so glad you asked this, Danny.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.000]   Morelage and his treatment for TBIs.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.160]   Okay, TBI, one thing about TBI and concussion,
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.880]   everyone thinks football.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.720]   Guess what?
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.220]   Most of the TBI is not football.
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.900]   There aren't that many football players.
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.040]   They're just large, so they stand out.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.920]   [audience laughing]
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.000]   There might be a few here this evening.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.440]   Of course, football players are a concern
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.460]   when it comes to TBI.
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.640]   Most head injuries are going to be construction workers.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.680]   Have you ever seen the hard hats they wear?
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.740]   I don't even know if they are just there for show.
[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.940]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.560]   And we actually have a lab at Stanford
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.880]   that's focused very hard on trying to solve this problem.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.300]   So construction workers, car accident,
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.320]   bicycle accidents, Portland, amazing city to cycle.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.880]   I'm frankly afraid to cycle.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.300]   You're a small moving object around these big objects
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.360]   and people are staring to their little aperture
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.760]   on their phone while driving.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.120]   I mean, whatever happened to that, by the way,
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.180]   of not texting while driving?
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.840]   Somehow that just disappeared.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.240]   It's like, it really has just disappeared.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.400]   There was all this science showing
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.000]   that it's worse than drunk driving.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.820]   TBI.
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.880]   Well, the basic rules of the don'ts apply.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.000]   If you get a head injury, don't get a second head injury.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.480]   But that often isn't feasible for people
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.420]   that need to continue working construction
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.540]   or that are struggling.
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.980]   What do we know?
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.380]   Well, this is a great opportunity for me
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.000]   to distinguish modulatory foundational tools
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.920]   from things that directly change your brain
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.540]   and nervous system the way that you want to.
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.380]   What do I mean by modulatory?
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.540]   We hear so much and there's so many studies
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.260]   showing that great sleep, quality nutrition,
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.280]   good social interactions, avoiding chronic stress
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.580]   and on and on and on are important for everything.
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.380]   They're related to Alzheimer's, they're related to ADHD.
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.300]   I mean, we could do thousands of podcast episodes
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.660]   just returning to the same 10 things.
[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.600]   Sleep, don't stress too much or too long,
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.340]   good social connection, avoid toxic people,
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.020]   eat good food, not too much processed food.
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.100]   We could have an argument all night
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.300]   and I don't want to have one about
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.060]   whether or not it's mainly plants or this.
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.560]   I mean, on the inner, this is, you know,
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.900]   obviously eating high quality food
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.320]   is something that we should all be doing.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.380]   Which foods you select is a topic that is very barbed wire
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.700]   and I can give only my opinions.
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.240]   All of that modulates your brain function,
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.700]   but it doesn't mediate or change anything directly.
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.120]   It's setting a foundation of what's possible.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.460]   So we should all be doing those things
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.020]   and especially people who have TBI.
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.820]   Now, this question relates to hyperbaric chamber.
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.820]   Hyperbaric chamber, there's some very interesting data.
[00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.860]   It's essentially a hyperoxygenation of the brain
[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.780]   for very brief periods of time.
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.860]   I think the data on hyperbaric chamber and TBI
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.100]   are very encouraging.
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.660]   The problem is, much in the way that a few years ago,
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.800]   cryo was only available in a few places
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.980]   and now people are doing ice baths
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.280]   and cold showers on their own,
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.740]   it's hard to find a hyperbaric chamber.
[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.360]   They aren't just laying around
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.020]   and they don't have them at spas typically
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.400]   and they are quite expensive.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.220]   So yes, there are interesting and important data,
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.580]   I think, on hyperbaric chamber.
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.320]   You definitely wanna work with a physician
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.180]   or somebody who is very skilled,
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.540]   a practitioner who's very skilled in hyperbaric chamber.
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.020]   They do seem to improve brain function
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.700]   by hyperoxygenating the brain for brief periods of time.
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.640]   Seems to improve a number of things,
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.020]   but above all, it seems to improve the quality
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.580]   and duration of sleep,
[00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.840]   which indirectly allows the brain to repair itself
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.140]   because as I mentioned earlier, brain repair occurs
[00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.260]   or brain change largely occurs in sleep.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.080]   So if you don't have access to hyperbaric chamber
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.520]   but you do have TBI, what are some of the other data?
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.440]   What do those point to?
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.640]   Well, I go on and on
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.120]   and you don't have to get this from supplements,
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.660]   you can get it from food,
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.760]   but this threshold level of these EPA essential fatty acids,
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.560]   there are now so many data, so much data
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.120]   on the valuable role of these essential EPA fatty acids,
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.920]   thresholds being somewhere between one and two grams per day
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.060]   of the EPA, so much so actually
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.020]   that there are now prescription forms of EPA
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.640]   that doctors are starting to prescribe for people with TBI,
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.980]   although for most people, you can get this through,
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.060]   you can look up and we've done podcast episodes
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.740]   about different ways to access this.
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.880]   Also functions as an antidepressant, equally good,
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.220]   believe it or not, in clinical trials to SSRIs
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.240]   once one gets over the one
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.340]   or basically two grams per day of the EPA.
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.500]   The resident expert on the internet about this
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.180]   is pretty extreme about the dosage
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.860]   and that's Dr. Rhonda Patrick,
[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.300]   who by the way deserves a nod of acknowledgement and support
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.540]   because turns out that before me or David Sinclair
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.500]   or Matt Walker or any of these guys were blabbing
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.140]   to the world about stuff that they had learned
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.140]   in the archives of science and in their laboratories,
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.300]   the first person in was this woman named Rhonda Patrick.
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.760]   As far as I know, the first public facing,
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.640]   formerly trained scientists to start going
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.920]   on all these podcasts and risk her reputation
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.520]   and the kind of stuff that you deal with
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.540]   when you put your neck out there like that
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.700]   and Rhonda's, I think, terrific.
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.040]   We don't agree on everything
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.200]   and it would be weird if we did,
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.540]   but I think she's really been the proponent
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.340]   of these higher doses of EPAs for TBI
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.240]   and for cognitive function into all ages.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.180]   We often hear about ways to increase dopamine,
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:09.700]   however, are there effective ways to decrease dopamine
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.700]   when you get too much of it for certain behaviors
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.940]   or habits we wanna break?
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.460]   Katie Ham, I think, is the last name.
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.140]   Thank you, Katie, for your question.
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.360]   Yeah, dopamine is a slippery slope
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.760]   and Dr. Analemki is the expert in this
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.180]   and we've had a lot of conversations.
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.700]   She's one of my closer friends on the faculty.
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.060]   Unfortunately for her, our coffee discussions
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.640]   often last four hours or more.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.300]   Her poor patience and family.
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.120]   Here's the thing.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.380]   When dopamine is higher in your brain and body,
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.380]   when you've deployed it through excitement
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.220]   or pharmacology or otherwise,
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.200]   it tends to narrow your focus and make you seek more of it
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.780]   in that general theme that you happen to be focused on.
[00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.280]   Could be anything.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.180]   That's the scary thing about dopamine.
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.460]   What can you do to control it and to reduce it?
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:04.620]   Well, for those of you that are engaging in habits
[00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.360]   that are healthy, maybe that doesn't require
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.540]   reducing dopamine.
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.620]   How do you define healthy versus unhealthy?
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.620]   Well, I think the simplest way to define addiction,
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.020]   at least by my mind,
[00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.340]   is that addiction is a progressive narrowing
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.820]   of the things that bring you pleasure
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.480]   and a good life is a progressive expansion
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.020]   of the things that bring you pleasure.
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.720]   A rather simple definition and yet,
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.540]   when we think about the biology of dopamine,
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.720]   dopamine is not unique to one pursuit.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.300]   It's not unique to the pursuit of sex
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.940]   or the pursuit of warmth when you're cold
[00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.540]   or cool environments when you're too warm
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.200]   or food or social media.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.180]   It's just a dumb molecule that puts you
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.960]   into this forward state of mass,
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:51.700]   small visual aperture and a kind of obsessive-like nature.
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.500]   What can you do to counter that?
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.820]   Well, the best thing to do is to not get
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.720]   into that state too long, but if you do,
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.860]   the best thing you can do is to try
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.460]   and switch off that system, not through pharmacology,
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.320]   but by not pursuing more dopamine.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.880]   The day after a big event,
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.840]   the so-called postpartum depression,
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.900]   named, of course, because of true postpartum
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.700]   after the delivery of a child that's quite common
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.020]   for people to get very, very depressed,
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.220]   there's a lot of neurochemical
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.860]   and hormonal adjustments that are occurring,
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.420]   but different types of postpartum depression occur
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:27.180]   after a big party, the Monday blues, the Sunday blues,
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:31.620]   the post-whatever blues, the four-month mark
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:35.860]   in a relationship is typically when dopamine starts to drop.
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.540]   I always tell people, just wait.
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.620]   I'm telling somebody very close to me right now,
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.260]   just wait four months, four months, four months,
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.700]   and also spend as much time with that person as possible.
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.760]   I don't know what this deal is
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.740]   about not spending as much time with people.
[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.900]   I think people are afraid that the dopamine wave pool
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.180]   is just gonna pull them both under.
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.500]   I think they call that the escalator model of relationship,
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.660]   where you just sort of find yourself in the relationship
[00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.040]   because you went through the stages
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.200]   without actually deciding on them in any event.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.460]   Four months seems to be the stage
[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:10.620]   in which the dopamine crescendo starts to relax a little bit,
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.900]   not in a long-distance relationship, however.
[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.100]   We know this, right?
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.300]   Anticipation is dopamine, that positive anticipation.
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.260]   And there's a whole beautiful science of this in the,
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.820]   and I should say psychology of this.
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.260]   There's a wonderful book, actually.
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.780]   The name of the book is embarrassing, always.
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.060]   I don't know why for me to say.
[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.440]   It's by a psychologist called "Ken Love Last,"
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.280]   which is a psychoanalytic book
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.520]   about this dopamine serotonin system
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.500]   and the kind of seesawing back and forth,
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.480]   and the fact that in relationships,
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.640]   people often just slam on the dopamine side of things,
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.580]   and then they hit a wall and wanna break up,
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.960]   or they go into this like warm, cozy, fuzzy feeling thing,
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.240]   and they go, well, I guess the exciting part is over,
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.120]   and this idea that one could actually,
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.760]   or two people, or however many people were in Portland,
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:59.000]   could oscillate this seesaw.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.440]   I don't think that you want to use pharmacology
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.180]   to turn off the dopamine system,
[00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.480]   but for people that have a hard time sleeping
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.820]   and that are really in a state of agitation
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.180]   and constantly obsessing, the psychiatrist,
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.640]   one of the oldest and most effective treatments,
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.220]   is that the psychiatrist,
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:20.420]   and this does have to be prescribed,
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.820]   will use a very, very low dose
[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:26.060]   of a dopamine receptor blocker like haloperidol,
[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:27.980]   which is used to treat schizophrenia.
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:32.740]   Very low dose to shut down the obsession component.
[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.900]   Smart, well-educated psychiatrists know this
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.180]   as a useful tool, but this is a one-time thing
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.300]   with a very low dose,
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.920]   because having your dopamine block sucks.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.580]   It does not feel good, but not being able to sleep
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.240]   and being in an obsessive mode also sucks.
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.180]   So it's actually a very potent clinical tool.
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.200]   So pharmacology is one tool,
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.960]   but really at the far end of things.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:58.340]   I believe that one should try and modulate their own dopamine
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:03.340]   by not rewarding oneself on a regular basis,
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.920]   but only randomly.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.580]   Random intermittent reward
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.200]   is truly the best schedule of reward,
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.760]   hence slot machines and so on.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.920]   And you should engage random intermittent reward.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.620]   And I think this is also the way that we should train kids.
[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:18.840]   I call it training kids.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.460]   You can tell I don't have kids.
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.760]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.680]   You don't reward them every time.
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.880]   I don't believe everyone should get a trophy every time,
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.660]   nor should you always just reward the winners,
[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.060]   because those winners often, we see cases of this,
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:35.020]   high-profile cases of this, they often crash and burn.
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.480]   I mean, the number of high performers
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.040]   that crash and burn publicly,
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.520]   and Lord knows how many do it privately, is remarkable.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.340]   It's 'cause their dopamine system is all messed up.
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:48.100]   So random intermittent reward is the scheduled reward
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.480]   that we should impart on ourselves.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.700]   If you had 10 minutes a day to improve your brain plasticity,
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.520]   what would you do and when would you do it?
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.980]   Richard Conlon, thank you.
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.120]   Well, I'm gonna say again,
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.040]   I would absolutely anchor my physiology
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.900]   with morning sunlight viewing.
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.240]   I can't help it.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.560]   You know what's interesting?
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.200]   I'll tell you very briefly,
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.680]   you know what's special about morning sunlight?
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.800]   This low solar angle sunlight.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.080]   I don't think I've talked about this much on social media
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.440]   or on the podcast.
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.980]   There's a group at the University of Washington,
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:22.440]   a couple, Jay and Maureen Knights.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.500]   They run a lab together.
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.840]   That sounds like a horrible thing,
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.700]   but they do it and they get along very well.
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.680]   And they've discovered that the cells in your eye,
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.520]   the neurons that set your circadian clock
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.780]   make you alert during the day
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.220]   and make you sleepy at night and so on.
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:42.500]   Those cells respond best to yellow-blue contrast
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.280]   and orange tones.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.620]   Now, this is important because when you go out
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.080]   in the morning, even if it's not at sunrise,
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.320]   but it's close to sunrise,
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.240]   or you look at the sun in the evening,
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.440]   what you'll see is yellow-blue contrast
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.120]   or orange, yellow, blue, orange,
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.960]   that old thing from kindergarten or first grade.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.200]   That's not the color of light that you're going to see
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.360]   when the sun is overhead.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.900]   Now, this also is really interesting
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:12.740]   because artificial lights, at least to my understanding,
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:16.360]   even the daylight simulators have not picked up on this.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.600]   It's just about bright light.
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.400]   Someone ought to design something that can mimic this,
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.720]   but nature has done this beautifully for us.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.720]   And so viewing low solar angle sunlight
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.540]   in the morning and in the evening is most effective
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.280]   because of those yellow-blue contrasts.
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.400]   Now, here's the really wild thing.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:37.120]   Those circuits that set your levels of alertness and sleep,
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.860]   yes, they respond best to yellow-blue contrast,
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.660]   but what that tells us is crazy.
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.840]   What that means is that color vision
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.920]   was probably not related to color perception first
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.740]   because all of that is completely subconscious.
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.280]   The pathways that do this are present in people
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.640]   who are pattern vision blind.
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.480]   So what do I mean?
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.440]   I mean that color vision likely evolved
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.480]   from a need to synchronize your internal state
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.520]   with the external world and the best stimulus
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.760]   in the outside world to do that is yellow-blue contrast.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.840]   In other words, our ability to detect color
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.240]   was first and foremost, and we understand this
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.440]   based on evolutionary genomics and so forth,
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.440]   to extract time of day information,
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.060]   not color of fruit or color of skin or anything like that.
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.280]   That's all secondary, which is wild and crazy.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.200]   And this is yet another example
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:32.160]   of the way we think things work is not the way they work.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.640]   It's completely 180 degrees opposite,
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.800]   and I'm just gonna give you a little teaser.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.100]   I had a guest on the podcast.
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.800]   We haven't aired the episode yet.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.760]   His name is Eric Jarvis.
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.360]   He works on speech and language.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.480]   He also was admitted into Alvin Ailey Dance Company.
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.960]   Again, who are these people?
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.120]   He's a professor at the Rockefeller.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.780]   Anyway, I learned from Eric,
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.500]   and you'll learn when that episode comes out
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:56.120]   that you only find elaborate speech and language
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.200]   in species that also engage in dance and song,
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.240]   and the genomics point to the fact that song and singing
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.980]   came first and language came second.
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:09.760]   And that led me, during that episode of the podcast,
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.840]   I wrote down in my notes.
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.280]   I was listening to him talk, and I wrote down in my notebook.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.680]   It just scrawled in big letters.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.880]   It says, "I am so happy right now."
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.040]   I was just blown away.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:22.320]   I couldn't, and it makes so much sense when you hear it
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.920]   that the colors in the sky were what we,
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.660]   our system is trying to extract,
[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.360]   not a perception of those colors in the sky,
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.040]   'cause they're informing us about time
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.000]   and orienting us in time.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.980]   That song and the communication of emotional states
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.960]   would be simpler and more foundational
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:40.700]   than communication about specific patterns of language.
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.600]   When you hear it, suddenly it makes sense,
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.940]   but of course, we're human beings,
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:48.480]   and unless you're Eric Jarvis or Ali Krum or Anna Lemke,
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:52.680]   you think about all this stuff backwards, as I do.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.840]   "How can I navigate my way through taking supplements
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.340]   "to optimize my health when my career demands
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.960]   "infantry prevent me from being able
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.840]   "to establish consistent routines?"
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:05.320]   Andrew Yegan, well, thank you for doing what you do, Andrew.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.280]   The consistent routine thing is tough.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.840]   Here are the, here's what I can say
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.500]   without going into a long two and a half hour episode
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.920]   about jet lag and shift work, which we've done.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.940]   The most powerful way to anchor your brain and body in time
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:24.560]   is indeed viewing light, sunlight,
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.160]   at consistent times of day.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.280]   That's not something I made up.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.020]   We know this based on a lot of work
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.360]   that dates back to the 1930s.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:36.980]   The second most powerful stimulus is going to be movement
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.580]   and changes in body temperature.
[00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.340]   In particular, increases in body temperature
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.820]   tend to make us alert, and decreases in body temperature
[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.340]   tend to make us sleepy.
[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.140]   Body temperature drops one to three degrees
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.520]   to get us into sleep.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.140]   Why does a cold shower wake you up?
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.040]   Adrenaline is released, and believe it or not,
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.900]   your body is heating up internally to combat that cold,
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.260]   unless you make yourself hypothermic.
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:01.700]   So, sauna, hot baths to get sleepy,
[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.680]   cold showers, ice baths, et cetera, to wake up.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.100]   Sort of obvious when you hear it, but it's counterintuitive
[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.700]   because you think, oh, heating up the body to wake up
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.440]   and cooling down the body to go to sleep,
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.280]   so getting into cold ought to cool me down,
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.800]   but your body compensates,
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.580]   just like if you threw a cold towel on a thermostat,
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.220]   you'd crank up the temperature in the room
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.660]   and vice versa for heat.
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.580]   Okay, so what do you do?
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.260]   You want to try and use as many of these things,
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.740]   light, temperature, exercise, food,
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.560]   when you eat is typically associated with waking.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.100]   Very few of us are capable of eating in our sleep.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.760]   And then the other one is social activity and rhythms.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.640]   Now, the discombobulated person is gonna be the person
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.880]   that has not aligned to these things in a consistent way,
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.080]   so while schedules vary,
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.000]   and Andrew, I don't know your exact schedule,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.480]   what I can say is, if you suddenly go from daytime behavior
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.800]   and sleeping at night to the so-called vampire shift,
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.480]   as it's called in the military,
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.380]   and suddenly you're up in the middle of the night
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.360]   and you're sleeping during the day,
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.560]   then when you come off that shift,
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.600]   what you want to do is try and combine
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.800]   as many of those same things at one time.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.280]   So it would be get your sunlight,
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.860]   so go jogging without your sunglasses,
[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:13.180]   drink your coffee, engage with other people
[00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.780]   and communicate, eat a meal afterwards,
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.700]   or as the case may be before,
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.740]   try and bring as many of those things together
[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.580]   the same time of day for a few days,
[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:25.020]   and pretty soon your system will map around that.
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:28.540]   So the reason I encourage for those of us
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.380]   that are not doing shift work
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.940]   to try and be fairly consistent about sunlight viewing
[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.520]   is it sets in motion everything else that's correct,
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:38.460]   but if in terms of timing of eating,
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.900]   appetite will follow, when your alert will follow,
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.940]   you'll start to learn your own rhythms.
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:47.880]   When you can't control your schedule,
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.140]   try and combine as many of those cues,
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.940]   again, light, temperature, exercise, food,
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.540]   social engagement, into one period of time
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.580]   and try and lock that into a more or less
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:01.380]   a one or two hour period or plus or minus one or two hours
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:05.040]   at a particular time of day for at least two or three days,
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.140]   and your schedule, meaning your internal clocks,
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.220]   will lock to that.
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:12.340]   How is social media changing our brains, Thomas?
[00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.060]   Well, you hear all the terrible ways
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.200]   in which it's changing our brains,
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.300]   and I think that, again, we go back to this thing,
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.260]   is it the aperture that we're looking at?
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:24.420]   So is it the format that we're engaging in things?
[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.180]   Or is it the content?
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:29.700]   Well, the way I like to think about the phone
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.560]   is the way that we've been engaging with the phone
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.400]   and the laptop, for that matter,
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.180]   in staring into the small visual aperture each day
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:40.580]   is sort of like walking like this all day long, right?
[00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:43.500]   We have this amazing ability to shuffle our feet
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.860]   and take small steps or to take big strides to run,
[00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:49.740]   to move, I think that's the sagittal plane for movement.
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.060]   I know it for the brain, but it always messes.
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.740]   The PTs are vicious people online, by the way.
[00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.300]   The PTs and nutrition people,
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.820]   I've learned to just not say anything,
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:02.280]   that I'm not a PT and I'm not a physical therapist,
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.580]   and they do incredible work,
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.020]   but it's a very spirited crowd.
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.700]   And the nutrition thing is really weird.
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.420]   I mean, it's just incredible.
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.880]   People are either throwing liver at you
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.300]   or they're throwing celery at you
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.740]   or they're fasting or they're not fasting.
[00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:19.960]   It's nuts.
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:27.340]   In any case, the social media
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.780]   and staring at a small visual aperture
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.020]   is changing our brains.
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:34.460]   Here's one way I know in which it's changing our brains,
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:36.860]   and then I'll tell you how to fix it.
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:41.160]   If you stare or look at something within two feet of you
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.580]   for a certain number of hours each day,
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:45.460]   your eyeball actually gets longer.
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:47.300]   And the visual image then is focused
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.540]   in front of your neural retina, not onto your neural retina,
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.940]   and you are becoming myopic, nearsighted.
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.900]   And if you look at things in the distance enough,
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.020]   guess what, your eyeball changes shape
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.680]   and your lens will focus appropriately,
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.860]   the image onto your retina, take some work.
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.220]   Kids that look at things up close too much
[00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.700]   and adults that look at things up close much
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.180]   become nearsighted.
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:13.620]   And there's a beautiful set of clinical trials now
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:17.040]   where mainly in kids, if kids get outside
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.940]   for two hours a day, getting a lot of this UVB
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.180]   and blue light that we're told is so terrible for us,
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.020]   but they get it from sunlight,
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.780]   they actually can reverse myopia
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.420]   or reduce the incidence of myopia,
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:31.420]   maybe even glaucoma, although that's a big maybe.
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:36.420]   So how much staring into a small visual aperture is too much?
[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.660]   I don't know, but what we do know
[00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.600]   is that we are literally becoming myopic
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.660]   in terms of our vision, and we're becoming myopic
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:46.460]   in terms of our cognition, and then there's the whole
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.780]   business of what's actually contained in those tweets
[00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:50.980]   and those social media feeds and those news stories,
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.420]   which frankly, I feel like you lose either way.
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.100]   Whether or not you're in one political camp
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.280]   or another political camp, you're upset
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.820]   about half of the information out there.
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:03.980]   So I feel like it's, and I'm not someone
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:07.660]   who knows how to talk about politics without stumbling.
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:11.860]   I didn't do well in social studies and this sort of thing.
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:13.660]   It just never made sense to me.
[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.300]   It just felt like the prize goes to the person
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.980]   who can shout the loudest and the most coherently
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:22.020]   for a moment, so, but I encourage, of course,
[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:25.780]   people to be politically active, and I vote,
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:30.380]   but the content is tricky to navigate,
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.820]   and I can't really speak to that,
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.580]   except that it seems to be bothering everybody
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.040]   on one side or the other or in the middle,
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.780]   and the format is something that we really understand,
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:42.860]   and again, I don't know of many people
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.700]   that are talking about this narrow visual window format
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.220]   thing, it came up more during the lockdowns
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:49.580]   when we were all inside a lot
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.660]   and not looking out at a distance.
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:55.220]   The data say really to try and get at least 10 minutes
[00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:58.500]   of long-distance viewing, so longer than 10 feet
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.580]   away from us for every 30 minutes of close-up viewing,
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.040]   and not a lot of us are doing that.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.420]   If you're walking to your car looking at your phone,
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.280]   you're definitely losing an opportunity.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:12.780]   What new piece of neurological research
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.940]   are you most excited about, Matteo Minato?
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:16.940]   Um, ooh.
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:23.580]   I think the piece of neurological research that I,
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:26.340]   all right, the weird stuff, I've got this colleague
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.580]   at Stanford, Tony Weiss-Cory, and they're really
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:32.380]   into literally taking proteins from young blood
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:36.020]   and young spinal cord, cerebral spinal fluid,
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:39.700]   and putting it into older people and animals,
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:43.340]   and they get younger, that stuff's pretty wild.
[00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.460]   The fecal transplant stuff is pretty wild, right?
[00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:48.500]   You take the microbiome from one person,
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.900]   and as it sounds, you transplant it to somebody else,
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:56.460]   and they take on the physical characteristics of the donor.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.660]   It's crazy.
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.700]   Until I talk to my, there's some shouts
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.620]   for fecal transplant, nice.
[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:04.900]   I have never read the method sections of those papers.
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.300]   I'm actually afraid to read the method sections.
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.940]   You know, I would say this is not neurological,
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:14.100]   but the work from Chris Gardner and Justin Sonnenberg
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.900]   also at Stanford, it makes it sound like I just
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.460]   like Stanford, Stanford State, but these are the people
[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:19.580]   I'm closest to and surrounded by.
[00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.980]   There are excellent places everywhere, of course,
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.260]   including OHSU, and I'm not just saying that
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.980]   'cause I'm here, I actually have close colleagues here
[00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:29.820]   and friends here at OHSU, also amazing,
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:32.260]   although that tram thing freaks me out.
[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.580]   It's like, I always just have all these ideas
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:36.920]   about what's gonna happen if that thing breaks.
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:41.920]   But the microbiome data are really interesting.
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:46.640]   I never understood why getting your gut microbiome
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.320]   was important, and it turns out it's because your gut
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.880]   actually makes many of the neurotransmitter precursors
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:54.800]   that your brain uses, so that's pretty cool.
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.280]   And I always thought it would be a complicated thing
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.520]   to get your gut microbiome right,
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.320]   but it turns out that it's fermented foods
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.640]   that seem to have the biggest effect.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.020]   There was all this argument about fiber,
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.600]   and yes, fiber is important, and here I am getting nervous
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.480]   talking about nutrition 'cause the people are gonna
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:13.480]   like come at me with fiber, but it's very clear
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:17.240]   from Justin and Chris' data that people who are getting
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.660]   four servings a day of these fermented foods,
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:22.560]   whether or not it's kimchi or sauerkraut or kombucha,
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.400]   that stuff actually seems to encourage
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.800]   a healthy gut microbiome, and people feel better
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.080]   and their immune system works better.
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:32.920]   And I like this because it actually, it resolves an issue
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:37.320]   which is that high-dose probiotics, these very expensive
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.600]   need-to-be-refrigerated things, those actually can create
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.760]   brain fog and other issues.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:43.380]   They're for real severe cases of dysbiosis.
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:46.880]   So I always like an instance where one can look to foods
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:50.500]   which are good 'cause I like to eat
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.820]   in order to resolve these issues.
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:56.220]   In terms of other neurologic issues, I think that frankly,
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:00.220]   I think the stuff on dopamine is fundamentally important.
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:02.180]   So much addiction, that's a severe case,
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:05.980]   but also so much waxing and waning of motivation.
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.360]   And once you understand the dopamine system and you say,
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.980]   what activities am I engaging in
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.820]   or pharmacology am I engaging in?
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.100]   What am I doing to spike dopamine?
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.620]   You start to go, oh, I get it.
[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:17.980]   The waves in this wave pool are too high,
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.040]   and that's why I can't do this consistently.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.700]   And then you do the counterintuitive thing
[00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.320]   of approaching things with a little less excitement,
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.400]   but then you're able to do them more consistently.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.620]   It's like, ah, and maybe with some luck,
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:31.440]   I'll end up finishing this book that I've been working on
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.800]   for four and a half years as a consequence
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.220]   'cause I can't seem to.
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:39.240]   Thinking about the Wim Hof method, do you believe it?
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.420]   How is it really working?
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.200]   What process is happening in his brain?
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.740]   Oh boy.
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.980]   Madison Cameron, everyone here probably familiar
[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:50.820]   with Wim Hof whose occupation on Wikipedia
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:52.260]   used to be Daredevil.
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:53.380]   That was cool.
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.280]   It's like Evil Knievel had it and Wim had it.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.340]   I got a story about Wim, actually in 2016,
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:02.600]   I heard about this guy Wim Hof and I got ahold of him,
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:07.600]   actually his children, and I had one vacation that year
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:12.060]   and I flew to Spain and I spent some time mountaineering
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:14.860]   with Wim, which was absolutely terrifying.
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:19.460]   I almost lost a leg legitimately.
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:22.160]   I tied in wrong on a bridge sling.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.300]   He told me it was good for me.
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:26.120]   He told me to stare into the lizard's eyes
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:29.020]   and I stared into the lizard's eyes.
[00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:33.740]   I jumped backwards off this homemade bridge sling thing
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.420]   and I had the rope wrapped through my leg in it.
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.780]   I came back with basically the tendon
[00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:40.540]   on the back of my knee exposed.
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.660]   And sitting next to me on the plane
[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.980]   was our vice dean of research at Stanford
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:47.680]   and I had to explain to him what I was doing and why.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.940]   It was very embarrassing.
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:52.680]   What did we do on that trip?
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.600]   Well, a couple of things
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.100]   that will help me answer your question.
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.740]   First of all, when I arrived,
[00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:59.220]   I suffer terribly from jet lag,
[00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:02.200]   but the moment I got there, Wim did not say hello.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.960]   He literally told me to get into the ice bath
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.660]   and I did 10 minutes in the ice bath,
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:07.800]   not because I'm tough,
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:11.120]   but because he held me down in the ice bath.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.460]   He is indeed one of the strongest human beings.
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.920]   He reminds me of the bus driver on "The Simpsons"
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.320]   or the janitor, excuse me.
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.360]   No, Otto is the bus driver, right?
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.420]   The janitor on "The Simpsons" like, oh, that guy.
[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:25.980]   That's Wim, incredibly physically strong guy.
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:29.900]   What do I think is going on with Wim Hof stuff?
[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:33.740]   Well, Wim Hof, whether or not he understands it or not,
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:36.580]   I always think he's sort of the Bob Dylan of breath work.
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.580]   Like everything he says seems to have some intuitive sense,
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:39.580]   but you don't really understand
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:41.080]   what in the world he's saying.
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.100]   He's gonna come after me now.
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.740]   We've had a good but complicated relationship.
[00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:49.900]   I'll just confess, maybe someday we'll resolve that.
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:52.340]   No big scandal or story there,
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:54.220]   just we communicate very differently.
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:58.600]   Wim has a couple of methods.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.660]   One is to deliberately hyperventilate.
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:02.780]   There's also called Tummo breathing.
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:04.340]   My lab actually studies this.
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:05.940]   We have a paper that I'm happy to share with you,
[00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:07.740]   the results, although they're not published yet,
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:10.240]   where people do deliberate cyclic hyperventilation,
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.460]   which as the name suggests,
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.000]   you just breathe really deeply in
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.740]   and really deeply out 25 times.
[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:17.460]   Or if you're Wim, you say in and out, in and out.
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.240]   I just tell people, here's how it works.
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.580]   You go, you do that 25 times and you heat up
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.980]   and you feel really agitated.
[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:25.580]   And that's because of adrenaline.
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:29.100]   If you throw yourself into an ice bath
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.860]   or a cold shower, adrenaline.
[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:32.940]   If somebody upsets you
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:35.480]   or you got a triggering text, adrenaline.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.420]   Adrenaline sounds like a terrible thing,
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:40.180]   except when you deliberately induce it.
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.220]   As my colleague, David Spiegel says,
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:44.520]   "There's a big difference between it going into a state
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.480]   "and you controlling your entry into a state."
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.220]   So it's not just about the state you're in,
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:50.420]   it's about how you got there
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:53.680]   and whether or not you had anything to do with it.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.020]   States of high adrenaline are very powerful.
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:59.260]   When you self-induced adrenaline by cold shower,
[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:03.000]   cyclic hyperventilation, AKA Wim Hof breathing,
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.900]   or Tummo breathing, you then have an opportunity
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:09.600]   to create a very distinct mind-body relationship.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.180]   We all hear that interoception
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.040]   and the mind-body relationship interoception,
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.820]   just your ability to sense your heartbeats
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:18.000]   and what's going on in your body, powerful, right?
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.380]   Terrible if how you feel sucks.
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:24.900]   So interoception is wonderful,
[00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.420]   but when you're anxious,
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:28.540]   it actually is more adaptive
[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:30.380]   to be able to maintain your thinking
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.100]   and get yourself out of that anxious state.
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.140]   So if you're trembling and your body's freaking out
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:35.220]   and your cheeks are flushing
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:38.620]   and your brain is following your bodily state,
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:40.700]   well, that's not good.
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.760]   And if you're somebody, and sadly, this happens a lot,
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.460]   where you've experienced a lot of trauma,
[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.620]   or typically this is people that have been barded
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:51.700]   with extreme criticism or physical abuse
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:53.100]   or other kinds of abuse during development,
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:54.540]   they actually can seem very calm,
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:56.580]   but internally, they're freaking out in their head
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.180]   and they're just thinking, "Just get me through this,"
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.440]   and they just go into a state
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.120]   where no one knows they're upset.
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.500]   I've known people like this, and it's eerie to me
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:08.500]   because I've never had that response to stress,
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.620]   but it's very common.
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.200]   And so we should learn and be careful
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.380]   about deciding that people are in one state or another
[00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:17.260]   based on their bodily or their mental response.
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:21.260]   Wim Hof breathing, cold showers, et cetera,
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:24.220]   are a great practice, in my opinion,
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:27.220]   because they allow you to spike your adrenaline,
[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:29.300]   and you can do that, for instance,
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.620]   by making the water colder if you want more adrenaline,
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:33.580]   staying in longer if you want more adrenaline,
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:35.200]   moving your limbs around in the water
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.320]   will give you more adrenaline
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.780]   'cause it breaks up that thermal layer,
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:39.440]   it makes it a lot colder,
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:43.620]   or doing 50 deep inhales and exhales.
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:46.140]   That is very useful because then you have the opportunity
[00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:49.820]   to use that prefrontal cortex and to stop
[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:52.280]   and sense all that adrenaline in your body
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.620]   and yet maintain clarity of mind,
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:58.240]   and that's an absolutely powerful tool.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.100]   I would even call it a power tool.
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:01.740]   And Wim figured this out.
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:02.980]   I don't know if you know this,
[00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:04.900]   but the way that Wim discovered all this
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.180]   was he was in deep grief
[00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:07.940]   about the tragic death of his wife.
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:10.820]   She committed suicide, jumped off an eight-story building,
[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:14.620]   just truly tragic death, and he was in situation.
[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:16.500]   He had four children at the time.
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:18.260]   Now he has five.
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:21.060]   And he was in a state of depression
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:25.160]   and he ended up going into the canal in Amsterdam,
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:28.500]   and it was very cold and it shocked his system.
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.120]   And in that shock to his system,
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.500]   which is caused by adrenaline,
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.580]   he somehow was able to anchor his thinking
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:38.160]   and in a kind of genius of sorts,
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:43.100]   Wim thought, wow, I can intervene in my physiology
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.300]   with this strange activity.
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.520]   And then he realized that breathing would do it as well.
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.020]   You didn't have to get into cold water.
[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.540]   And then years later, we discovered,
[00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.280]   not we meaning my lab, but other labs,
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.060]   that when you get into cold water,
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.060]   even just 60-degree water,
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:01.040]   that there's a very long-lasting increase in dopamine
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.620]   that is 2.5 X above baseline,
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:07.380]   which is on par with some prescription drugs
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:08.460]   for increasing dopamine.
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:11.220]   So when people laugh at me, oh, this cold water thing,
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:12.900]   I get teased a lot on the internet.
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.540]   I've heard on the internet that I eat sticks of butter,
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:16.580]   which I never said.
[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:18.780]   I said, I like butter.
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:22.220]   I've been told all sorts of things.
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.780]   I've been told I eat sticks of butter.
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:25.760]   I don't know why.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.660]   I've been told that I'm dead.
[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:29.180]   That was an interesting one.
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:30.780]   That was one of the cooler ones.
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:34.740]   But when I was going out there as a serious scientist
[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:36.540]   and saying, using deliberate cold exposure,
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:38.080]   you can use all sorts of things,
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:41.100]   or if you come to my lab, I'll be happy to put you in VR
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.580]   and expose you to all sorts of scary stuff,
[00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:43.940]   or we can inject you with adrenaline,
[00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:45.700]   or you can inject yourself with adrenaline
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:48.280]   and titrate that, adjust the levels of that.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.820]   So it's a very powerful tool.
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:52.420]   And I think that Wim and others deserve credit
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.540]   for really tapping into that.
[00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.980]   And as a last point, there's a beautiful study
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:58.880]   in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:02.820]   years ago using this deliberate cyclic hyperventilation
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:06.900]   thing, 25 breaths, and then another group meditates,
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:09.320]   and then they inject them both with E. coli.
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.020]   And the people injected with E. coli who meditate
[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:17.100]   get nauseous, vomit, diarrhea, and they get a fever.
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:21.440]   And the people who first, far fewer symptoms if any.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.280]   Why?
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:25.500]   Because adrenaline actually suppresses
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:29.060]   a lot of these innate immune responses
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:30.620]   in a way that's healthy in the short term.
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:32.620]   This is why you can work, work, work, work, work,
[00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:33.740]   or you can study for finals,
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:35.180]   or you can take care of a loved one,
[00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.360]   and then you finally stop and rest and go on vacation,
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.380]   and then you get sick.
[00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:42.980]   Stress activates your nervous system,
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.300]   and in doing so, it activates your immune system.
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.080]   It makes perfect sense when you think about it.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.060]   How would we ever go through famine
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:51.420]   if you're just getting flus whenever you're stressed?
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:52.620]   We can deal with a lot.
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:55.260]   My suggestion is if you're coming off a period
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:58.920]   of high stress, to do some sort of adrenaline spiking
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.520]   behavior as you taper out of that stressful period,
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.940]   not going strictly to massage, vacation,
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:08.700]   and yoga nidra all day long, as I would reflexively do.
[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.840]   Can red light therapy help treat exercise intolerance
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.620]   and fatigue in mitochondrial disease?
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:14.980]   Allison, I'm glad you brought this up.
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:17.220]   This is another case where I thought,
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.540]   oh no, this red light stuff is crazy.
[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:21.100]   And then I went into the literature,
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:23.140]   and it turns out that in 1908,
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:26.020]   the Nobel Prize was actually given for phototherapy.
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:28.780]   So there we go again, and here,
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:31.040]   I have this slide, I chose not to use slides tonight,
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.620]   but I have this slide that shows Ken Keesian,
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:36.820]   the magic boss, and stuff from the 1930s,
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:39.540]   and psychedelics, and people getting into cold water,
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.760]   and then here we are, 2019, 2020,
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.060]   you've got Wim Hof and Matt Johnson
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.400]   giving people macrodoses of psilocybin.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:49.120]   We're right back where we were.
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:51.700]   And one of my major goals is to really try
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:56.420]   and create some scientific discussion around these things.
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:58.920]   This stuff is crazy on the face of it,
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:01.160]   but there are mechanisms that are real that underlie it.
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.860]   Red light, because it's long wavelength light,
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.500]   longer, literally, as opposed to short wavelength light,
[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.980]   can penetrate through things like skin,
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:12.880]   and can indeed change mitochondria.
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:15.040]   One of the more impressive results on red light
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.160]   comes from my good friend Glenn Jeffrey's lab
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.440]   at the University College London.
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.840]   I've known Glenn for years.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.420]   In a few years, he was a basic vision scientist,
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:25.960]   and a few years ago, he started using red light.
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.820]   He'd have people look at red light
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:29.700]   at a distance of about two feet in the morning,
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.860]   so this is long wavelength light,
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.840]   and sometimes even just take a flashlight,
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.240]   a torch, as they call it in England,
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.680]   and cover it with a red film,
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:38.500]   and they would look at this stuff
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:39.840]   for a few minutes each morning,
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:44.400]   and it can reverse some forms of age-related vision loss
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.640]   and macular degeneration,
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:48.400]   how we now know it can prove mitochondrial function
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.920]   in photoreceptors by reducing
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:52.200]   what are called reactive oxygen species.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.040]   Here's what's interesting.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:57.040]   It only seems to work in people older than 40,
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.580]   and it seems to only work
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:00.600]   if you do it within the first three hours of waking,
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.460]   and the incredible thing is you can do this
[00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:04.400]   for one or two minutes a week,
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.160]   and some of the positive effects
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.080]   last as long as three weeks,
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.980]   and it's affecting a very specific form
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.860]   of visual improvement, which is acuity,
[00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:14.640]   kind of fine detail stuff in my particular wavelength,
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.120]   so particular colors and objects and things.
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.340]   Pretty impressive, so yes,
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:20.720]   red light can improve mitochondrial function
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.000]   to the photoreceptors.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.400]   If you are gonna try and do this stuff,
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.720]   don't put it too close.
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:27.040]   I don't have any affiliation
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.360]   to any red light panel companies,
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.400]   so I can't say anything there.
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.160]   They are rather expensive.
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.700]   Nowadays, people are putting red light everywhere,
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:36.640]   and I do mean everywhere.
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.320]   People are putting red light on their stomach
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.160]   for improving ovarian function.
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.180]   Whether or not I can penetrate isn't clear to me.
[00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.740]   All the way down there, people are trying to do this.
[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:47.740]   I have a friend, I won't name him.
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:50.280]   Recently, he told me he's really into the red light therapy.
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.740]   He's putting it on his testicles
[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:53.100]   to try and increase testosterone,
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.600]   but he told me that after he handed me the red light.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.460]   (audience laughing)
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:39:59.880]   True story.
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.940]   My team knows who this is.
[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:02.240]   There's no one on my team, thank goodness.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.460]   I was like, oh, that's super interesting.
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:09.620]   I actually don't think you wanna contact
[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:11.060]   the red lights directly to your skin.
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:12.700]   So, red light is powerful.
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.460]   I don't think we have, aside from the vision protocol,
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:17.520]   I don't think that it's clear which protocols are best.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:20.200]   I will say, if you're into red light infrared sauna,
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.920]   typically those don't get hot enough.
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.020]   Typically, if you wanna get the benefits of sauna,
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:28.320]   you wanna get between 80 and 100 degrees Celsius,
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:33.320]   which is 176 to 210 or 208 Fahrenheit,
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:37.780]   and I don't actually do the conversion in my head.
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:39.480]   I memorize it.
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:41.100]   You mentioned the consequences of blasting your brain
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:42.180]   with too much dopamine.
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:43.540]   Is it possible to overdo ice baths
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:45.100]   while following the same line of thinking,
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:46.660]   will you experience extreme low in dopamine
[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:47.860]   with too many ice baths?
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:51.060]   Thank you for the question.
[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:53.260]   Any behavior that spikes adrenaline,
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:55.620]   you will eventually get better at tolerating it.
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:57.100]   You will become cold adapted,
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.520]   and you will become comfortable at high adrenaline states,
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.260]   and you just have to ask yourself this.
[00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:03.880]   It's just like lifting weights in the gym or running.
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:07.040]   You need to leave some space for improvement.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.980]   So, if you run, as people do,
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:12.660]   and you do your 5K, then your 10K, then your half marathon,
[00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:16.120]   maybe a 10K is a half marathon, I don't know, but anyway,
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.280]   then you're doing your marathon,
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:20.480]   then you're doing ultras that are 50 miles and 100 miles.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.120]   I mean, eventually, you're gonna start doing damage, right?
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.900]   And eventually, you look at every ultra runner,
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:27.900]   and typically, these are people
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:30.520]   who are very much on the dopamine pursuit system.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:31.900]   I mean, I don't think that he would mind.
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:33.860]   My good friend and a podcaster
[00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:36.820]   who I have tremendous respect for, you know, rich role,
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.180]   amazing human being,
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:41.700]   and also has an amazing story about addiction.
[00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:42.820]   He was an alcoholic.
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.660]   I'm not sharing anything that he hasn't already shared
[00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:48.940]   in this amazing book, "Finding Ultra."
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:50.900]   You know, he got really into running,
[00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.220]   running, running all the time,
[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.980]   and you know, there's a dopamine history there for him.
[00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:58.360]   Some of us can use ice baths so consistently
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.780]   and make it so cold and doing them longer and longer
[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:03.380]   that indeed, you're playing with the dopamine system.
[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.460]   Is it bad?
[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:06.960]   Well, it depends on what you're trading that in for,
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.000]   you know, at the expense of what?
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.420]   Is it giving up cocaine?
[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:11.460]   Yeah, great, stick with the ice bath.
[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:14.920]   But you know, you can only make it so cold,
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.280]   and you can only stay in there so long
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.860]   before you become Wim Hof, right?
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:20.860]   And it worked out for Wim,
[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:22.820]   but there's really only one Wim Hof.
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:26.240]   And in general, that speaks to a larger theme,
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.420]   which is I love the idea of people using tools
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:29.820]   and understanding mechanism.
[00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:31.280]   I mean, of course I love that.
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:35.160]   It's what I talk about and think about so much of my life.
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:36.360]   But for most of us,
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.460]   we don't make a living doing those things.
[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:41.580]   And so I do think that the ideal situation
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.020]   is to have behaviors and tools
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:44.900]   that you intersperse throughout your day
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:45.900]   and throughout the week.
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:48.620]   For instance, I think three times a week
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:49.760]   is fine for the ice bath.
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:52.660]   No one said you had to do it every day,
[00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:56.160]   but you should see sunlight every morning, if you can.
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:59.400]   Just because if you miss a day, your system will be fine.
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.780]   Just spend twice as long outside the next day, seriously,
[00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:03.860]   'cause it's a slow integrating system.
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:07.700]   But you know, for most of these high intensity things,
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:10.280]   the less often you do them, the more powerful they are.
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:12.580]   In fact, if you get into a very hot sauna
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:16.140]   for four, excuse me, 30 minute sessions on one day.
[00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:18.300]   So you go 30 minutes, get out for five minutes.
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:19.740]   30 minutes, get out for five minutes.
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:20.700]   30 minutes, get out for five minutes.
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:21.780]   Two hours a day in the sauna.
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:23.020]   That's a lot of sauna.
[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:24.340]   But the growth hormone released
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:28.760]   from that type of protocol
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:32.200]   is a 16x increase in growth hormone.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.620]   This has been measured in humans.
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:35.040]   Whereas if you do it every day
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.140]   or three or four times a week,
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:38.700]   you get diminishing returns on that.
[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.660]   So I actually am a big fan of doing really intense stuff
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:43.680]   only every once in a while.
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.180]   This is also why I only take one long run per week
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:47.340]   or one long hike.
[00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:49.040]   First of all, I don't have time for it.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.140]   I'm not an ultra runner.
[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:51.460]   I got other things to do.
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:54.020]   And second of all, it's a strong stimulus.
[00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:55.620]   I'm sore until Tuesday
[00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:58.120]   or I don't wanna run until Tuesday anyway.
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:59.300]   I actually think that's fine.
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:00.860]   And I actually encourage
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:03.260]   kind of more healthy rational schedules
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:04.580]   of these kinds of behaviors.
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:07.520]   There's no rule that says you have to do something every day
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:10.060]   even if you're trying to engage in neuroplasticity.
[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:13.300]   You can learn French or an instrument
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:16.320]   by practicing three times a week
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:20.340]   as long as your practice is very focused, right?
[00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:21.740]   Daily perhaps would be better,
[00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:24.440]   but very few of us have the opportunity
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.400]   to do things every day consistently.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:30.400]   And I really wanna encourage a more balanced approach.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.920]   Before working through Thasher, what's the base?
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.400]   Oh, goodness gracious.
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.420]   The skateboarders are always in the house.
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:39.260]   My first non-biological family
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:40.420]   was a skateboarding community
[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:43.060]   when I have great relationship with my parents now.
[00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:44.500]   But because there was a time
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:46.340]   when there was no one to go to soccer games
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:47.180]   or do any of that stuff,
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:48.380]   the skateboard community took me in
[00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:49.620]   'cause there were no parents involved.
[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:50.440]   It was great.
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.060]   There were no referees or coaches
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:55.300]   'cause I didn't like authority and it was awesome.
[00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:56.580]   And there was no nutritional plan.
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:58.940]   You drank your Slurpee and you sat on the curb
[00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:00.980]   and it was fantastic.
[00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:01.940]   I don't do that anymore.
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:02.940]   But the skateboarding community
[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:05.140]   is one that I've remained close with.
[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:07.100]   I did write for Thrasher under a different name
[00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:10.040]   while I was a postdoc to make some extra cash.
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.920]   You won't find those articles anywhere, I hope.
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:16.100]   They're not very good.
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:19.460]   And best skater, I was involved in it enough
[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:20.940]   that this will only make sense
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:22.340]   to like three people in the audience,
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:24.100]   but I had decent heel flip.
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:25.620]   I could nollie better than I could ollie
[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:27.140]   and I was never very good.
[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:28.640]   And I just, oh, there were more skateboarders
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:29.540]   in the audience.
[00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:31.340]   What I will say though is you have to be very careful
[00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:32.960]   with skateboarders 'cause I don't wanna claim
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:33.980]   that I was any good.
[00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:37.660]   Any success that I had was out of sympathy of others
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.260]   for letting me hang around.
[00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:42.020]   It's a great community and it gave me great appreciation
[00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:44.580]   for indeed communities of kids
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:49.460]   that don't have structure and sports leagues and teams
[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:50.620]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:53.080]   Nowadays, it's actually a much different landscape.
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:56.400]   And I have to also say what it's really amazing
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:00.120]   to see all the incredible girls and women skateboarders.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.420]   Also, there were none.
[00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:04.340]   It's Olympic sport now for women and girls
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:07.300]   and it's an Olympic sport for boys and men too.
[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.020]   So it's awesome to see that community.
[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:11.820]   Okay, what are your favorite brain hacks
[00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:14.020]   for doing hard things ranging from cold exposure
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:16.180]   to getting through selection?
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:17.940]   Hobie Darling, thanks for the question.
[00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:21.460]   Yeah, hard things.
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:23.020]   Well, I'll be honest.
[00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:25.500]   I learned how to hack into my adrenaline system
[00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:27.880]   a long time ago through the worst possible mechanism,
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:31.100]   which is that I would set up battles in my mind.
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:36.020]   I would get into competition with people imagined or real,
[00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:39.740]   or I would get into states of fearing, shame
[00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:42.820]   and screwing up.
[00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:45.740]   So this is what a lot of people do, I think.
[00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:46.860]   You end up scaring yourself
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:49.760]   into trying to do the hard thing and it works.
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:54.760]   The problem is it feels rather like a downward spiral
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:58.940]   because those negative states of mind
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:01.540]   work to liberate adrenaline and get you in
[00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:02.360]   through hard things.
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:05.180]   So being as a kind of rebellious kid, resistance was,
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:06.460]   if someone told me I couldn't do something,
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:09.240]   I was like, yeah, try me, this kind of thing.
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:12.380]   And as I mentioned before, I wasn't crazy about authority.
[00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:14.860]   And so that was the method for a long time.
[00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:17.900]   And then I started reading Oliver Sacks' books
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:21.820]   and I started learning from people who seem to access things
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:23.580]   through this whole love thing.
[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:25.580]   And I tried that love and kindness meditation thing
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:26.860]   and that didn't work.
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:30.820]   And what I started doing was I actually,
[00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:33.880]   I'll just tell you, before I came out here tonight
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.340]   and before I do anything challenging,
[00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:39.300]   I just actually like to imagine the people
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:40.580]   that have supported me.
[00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:43.100]   It's a weird tool, I don't think I've ever shared,
[00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:45.460]   I'm actually slightly embarrassed to share this out.
[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.160]   'Cause there are only two things that make me cry
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:49.100]   and that's talking about my bulldog
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:51.340]   and talking about my graduate advisor.
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:53.700]   And if I talk about it any longer, I'll probably cry.
[00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:55.860]   But I think about them a lot
[00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:57.500]   because they were kind of similar.
[00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:59.200]   (audience laughs)
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:02.020]   They were kind of ornery and they were hard on me
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:03.860]   and I adored them both.
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:06.460]   And so these days I try and think about people
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:09.060]   that really, that I love.
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:11.020]   And so I have been trying to do this whole like doing things
[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:12.220]   from a place of love thing.
[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:15.780]   And so for me, that's animals and people that I love.
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:19.500]   Okay, now I am better to move on.
[00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:20.880]   So, oh, thank you.
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:24.780]   Okay, they're telling me one more question.
[00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.300]   So I'm going to answer one more.
[00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:27.140]   What do I fear?
[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:28.700]   How do you manage your fear, KB?
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:31.660]   Oh gosh, this is gonna turn into a,
[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:33.500]   no one's gonna be satisfied until I cry.
[00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:35.460]   I get it, I get it.
[00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:40.340]   I do cry, but again, about the things I mentioned before.
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:41.580]   I realized something, by the way,
[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:43.280]   we just recorded an episode on grief.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.980]   It hasn't come out yet.
[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:46.700]   Fascinating topic.
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:48.820]   I realized at one point, by the way,
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:49.660]   I'll just give this away,
[00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:54.220]   that I thought I was really sad about losing them.
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:55.940]   I thought I would tear up really easily
[00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:57.180]   because I was sad about them.
[00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:58.500]   But then I realized that this,
[00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:00.120]   gosh, I can't believe I'm gonna do this.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:02.160]   But I realized that feeling that I was feeling
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:03.900]   is the exact same feeling of love
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:05.100]   that I had when they were alive.
[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:07.460]   So grief is love, and when you look at the literature,
[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:10.500]   it's basically that, but your brain is freaking out
[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:12.940]   because that map of knowing where people are
[00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:14.120]   in space and time.
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:17.280]   Grief is basically a remapping of the space.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:18.300]   Where are they?
[00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:19.940]   Time, when are they?
[00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:23.120]   And then this kind of abstract map representation
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:24.620]   that we call closeness.
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:26.340]   And grief is this process
[00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:28.820]   of like ripping ourselves off of that.
[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:30.260]   So in any event, what do I fear?
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:31.960]   Talking about things like this.
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:34.700]   What do I fear?
[00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:39.700]   Um, quite honestly, my biggest fear,
[00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:44.220]   the thing that would just make me feel just horrible,
[00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:46.460]   is I fear letting down my friends.
[00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:50.900]   I have an amazing, I love my family and they're wonderful,
[00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:55.120]   but I have this incredible relationship to friendship.
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:57.500]   And I just, I adore my friends
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:59.980]   and I would sooner give up all my limbs
[00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:02.940]   and die before I would deliberately let them down.
[00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:03.980]   So there you go.
[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:05.140]   That's what I fear most.
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:08.300]   (audience applauding)
[00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:19.960]   I also fear I've gone long
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.900]   and so my team has shut this down.
[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:25.940]   I just want to just briefly, two things.
[00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:28.780]   First of all, I of course want to thank everyone
[00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:30.300]   for coming here tonight.
[00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:31.660]   I realize it's the middle of the week
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:33.540]   and to commit some hours of your life
[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:36.580]   to thinking about these brain mechanisms.
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:38.580]   We got pretty nerdy there for a minute
[00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:42.060]   and hopefully the tools redeemed those
[00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:45.440]   who were only interested or mostly interested
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:48.420]   in practical tools, but hopefully some of the insights
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:50.500]   about how you work were useful as well.
[00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:52.060]   I do want to just make brief mention
[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:53.620]   of the sponsors that made this possible
[00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:55.300]   'cause they did make this possible
[00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:57.260]   and we made every effort to try and keep
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:59.180]   the ticket prices manageable for people
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:01.500]   and thanks to Inside Tracker and Momentus
[00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:02.820]   for making this possible.
[00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:05.740]   And then, of course, I would be completely remiss
[00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:09.060]   if I didn't say thank you for your interest in science.
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:11.600]   (audience applauding)
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:12.440]   Thank you.
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:16.600]   Thank you.
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:18.900]   Oh, wow, thank you.
[00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:20.720]   Thank you.
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:21.560]   Thank you.
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:26.460]   Thank you.
[00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:28.100]   Thanks so much.
[00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:30.560]   Everyone, be sure to get home safely tonight.
