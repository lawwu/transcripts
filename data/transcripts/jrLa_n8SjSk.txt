[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120]   - Nah, for sure, I remember bro,
[00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.800]   like I realized you were a killer
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.040]   and like it was your rookie season, right?
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.920]   And I think we were in training camp in San Diego
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.660]   and I'll never forget this.
[00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.280]   I think I came down and like hit like a heasy pull up,
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.440]   but I think you were on the side,
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.160]   like waiting for me to pass him.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.280]   He was like, "I hit the shot."
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.280]   But you were like, "Mike, like I can do that too."
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.240]   You can pass him, I was like, "Okay, like he's cold."
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.040]   Like, and this is your rookie season.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.000]   Like I was, and you just were so confident, bro.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.400]   And so it was like,
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.200]   it was a joy to watch you play
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.040]   and like be your teammate, you know.
