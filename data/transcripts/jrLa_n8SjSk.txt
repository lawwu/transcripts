[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480]   - Nah, for sure, I remember, bro,
[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.800]   I realized you were a killer,
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.040]   and it was your rookie season, right?
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.920]   And I think we were in training camp in San Diego,
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.660]   and I'll never forget this.
[00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.280]   I think I came down and hit a heasy pull-up,
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.320]   but I think you were on the side,
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.160]   waiting for me to pass him,
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.280]   and he was like, "I hit the shot,"
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.280]   but you were like, "Mike, I can do that, too."
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.640]   You passed him, I was like, "Okay, he's cold,"
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.240]   and this is your rookie season,
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.000]   and you just were so confident, bro,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   so it was a joy to watch you play,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.480]   and be your teammate.
