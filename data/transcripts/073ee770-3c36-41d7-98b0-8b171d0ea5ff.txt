[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.620]   I am James Hong and welcome to the Surpassing Value Podcast.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.740]   The fuel and desire for this podcast was born out of a compulsion to flesh out what's
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600]   been going on in the midst of an ocean of megaphones that may not actually withstand
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.620]   the test of scrutiny.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.320]   As a signpost theologian, I will do my best to filter out the impurities and point people
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.320]   in the right direction.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:46.320]   For episode number five, I wanted to talk about the term "social justice."
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.480]   This term has been thrown out quite often and in many different situations.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.380]   Everyone seems to have their own tinge, their own stance, their own opinion.
[00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:06.520]   Everyone seems to state that their view on social justice is correct and whether or not
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:15.040]   we should embrace it, whether or not it is right, wrong, good, evil, biblical, unbiblical.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:22.520]   Moreover you have proponents who are quick to embrace it or discard it for their own
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.520]   reasons.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.960]   Let me give you some responses, some typical responses to social justice that are common
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.080]   today that you've probably heard in some variation.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.720]   I believe in social justice because Republicans are evil.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.400]   Republicans believe in gerrymandering.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.440]   Republicans don't care about life after the child is born.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.360]   I believe in social justice because Jesus was countercultural and Jesus would have believed
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.680]   in social justice.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.640]   I am a political agnostic, but clearly social justice is not a concept we could disagree
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.640]   with.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:10.320]   Now, these responses are in no way exhaustive, but they are somewhat indicative of the attitudes
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.320]   one would have towards the concept of social justice.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:24.000]   Now embedded in these responses is some definition, however blurry, some conception they have
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.680]   of social justice, which is why the speaker is able to answer the way they do.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:38.040]   It would appear though that more than a concrete definition that springs forth, the idea of
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:48.760]   being pro-social justice to the contemporary proponent of it, or here, conjures up events
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.440]   and more likely than not, disdain for those events.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.440]   This is particularly true for events where one party is a civilian and the other party
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.560]   is some type of law enforcement.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.240]   For many people, you could replace social justice with the word compassion and that
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.840]   would be enough.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.180]   For many others, you could replace the word social justice, the term social justice, with
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:21.900]   government assistance or liberalism or higher taxes for the rich or evaluation of police
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.280]   protocols or some variation thereof and that would be enough.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:35.280]   The thing is though, we need to agree on a definition to have a meaningful conversation,
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:43.620]   but nearly all people engaged in this conversation are simply not able to define the term.
[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:51.480]   They're able to conjure up feelings, images, video clips.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:59.160]   People are quick to cast aspersions and caricature an opposing viewpoint, thereby vilifying anyone
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:06.440]   seemingly associated with that viewpoint.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:14.080]   This gives people the feeling of moral superiority without engaging in actual intellectual rigor,
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.700]   which is very convenient to the one destroying the straw man.
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:25.080]   There is what I would call emotional intelligence involved, but very rarely is there abstract
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.880]   intelligence involved.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:36.980]   It is incredibly dangerous to state you believe in something so readily when you can't even
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.980]   define it.
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.600]   Moreover, you've probably heard many people say something to the effect of, "Social
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.160]   justice is everywhere."
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.500]   But is it really?
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.960]   If we're going to make claims like that, we should be able to back it up.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.200]   Now sometimes people make that claim and they just don't have the time to do so, so I
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.800]   get that.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:07.860]   But not backing it up is not helpful, particularly now since many people will internally disagree
[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:14.200]   with that sentiment without actually verbalizing that they do.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:21.160]   I want to tell you from the beginning, right now, that I do indeed that this ideology is
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:27.660]   everywhere, and my aim is to prove it in this episode.
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.200]   So let me ask this question again.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:37.000]   Can anyone really define the term "social justice"?
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.080]   Where does it come from?
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.440]   What was its origin?
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.080]   After all, as stated, if we're going to evaluate this new theory, this new phenomenon, this
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:52.560]   new doctrine, should we not first be able to agree on a consensus definition?
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.560]   Of course.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.480]   We absolutely have to define our terms.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:06.480]   The reason it is so imperative to define our terms is because defining terms is equivalent
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:13.920]   to building a foundation for the subsequent inquiry, for the subsequent investigation,
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.240]   for the subsequent discussion.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:23.400]   If we do not define our terms, it's not just time that we're wasting.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:34.920]   Not defining our terms allows these very slithery ideologies to go unnoticed or even escape
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.080]   being brought to light.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:44.200]   2 Corinthians 10, 4-5 says this, "For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh,
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.400]   but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:54.080]   We are destroying arguments and all arrogance raised against the knowledge of God, and we
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.720]   are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ."
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:05.800]   Ephesians 5, 11 states, "Do not participate in the useless deeds of darkness, but instead
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.840]   even expose them."
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:15.600]   Now if you are participating in a worldview and you don't even know it, you won't be
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.280]   able to bring it to light.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:25.140]   If we're going to bring every thought captive to Christ, you won't be able to do that if
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:30.200]   you do not know what you are talking about.
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:38.440]   When you look at the history of destructive ideologies that have ravaged societies and
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:46.120]   cultures and false ideologies that have confused the church, the common denominator has always
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:51.960]   been ambiguity, amorphousness.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:08:02.000]   They are slithery, slippery, and more often than not, seem good.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.520]   This is much like the false teachers themselves, because even Satan presents as an angel of
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.360]   light.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.680]   You see that with the prosperity gospel teachers of the world, the Joel Osteens, the Joyce
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.960]   Myers of the world.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:30.240]   So in this episode, the bulk of the following segment is going to include lengthy quotes
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:36.440]   from various scholarly works as it relates to social justice.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:47.760]   The reason I am doing that is to present to you how widespread this undefined, ambiguous
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:59.200]   concept of social justice has permeated into our society and also the church.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:07.920]   The reason I'm reaching out to scholarly works is because today's intellectual obscurities
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:16.400]   will become tomorrow's cultural norm, and we are already at tomorrow.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:21.920]   There are many reasons for that, and when I say for that, the fact that intellectual
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:28.400]   obscurities, yesterday's intellectual obscurities become tomorrow's cultural norm, or today's
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.600]   intellectual obscurity will become tomorrow's cultural norm.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:37.320]   There are many reasons for that, and I do want to devote some time in a future episode
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.220]   as to how and why that happened.
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:48.520]   If you want to just speed ahead, feel free to read the British historian Paul Johnson's
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.520]   book "Intellectuals."
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:56.380]   That will give you an idea of what I'm talking about.
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:02.600]   To give you an example of an intellectual obscurity becoming a cultural mainstay, you
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:07.560]   need to look no further than Karl Marx.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:15.320]   Marxism quickly became the world's dominant ideology, and we thought for a time that it
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:22.880]   was stamped out, but it is absolutely making a comeback.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.360]   So on to social justice in the academic literature.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.560]   On to social justice in the academic literature.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:30.560]   V.H.
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:35.400]   Schmidt, S-C-H-M-I-D-T.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:43.900]   He writes in the International Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences in 2001.
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:51.560]   He states this, and I quote, "The concept of social justice is used very differently
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.840]   in the available literature.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:11:00.560]   So if one is not already committed to a particular definition, it is hard to distill a common
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.600]   core out of its many usages.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:09.460]   To some extent, this has to do with the term's indiscriminate application to almost any kind
[00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:14.900]   of distribution problem without consideration of the different quality of problems arising
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:19.160]   at different levels and in different subsystems of society.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:25.000]   A first desideratum is therefore that these differences be adequately acknowledged in
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.160]   attempts at theorizing about the concept.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:34.460]   Social justice in the design of a society's basic structure may not mean the same as social
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:40.040]   justice in the determination of wage levels by firms or in the distribution of household
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.040]   duties.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:46.300]   To the extent that there are overlaps between the term's meaning and links between single-justice
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:53.340]   problems and/or levels of societal aggregation, they must be carefully examined and extracted.
[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:58.120]   But if the term 'social' is to have any serious meaning at all, then it is also important
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:03.760]   to develop a clear sense of the types of problems it is to be applied to, of their differences,
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.400]   their relative interdependence and independence.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:12.240]   Or to put it differently, what is needed is greater clarity about the locus of regulation
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.940]   of different categories of problems.
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:19.860]   Some such problems need to be regulated at the macro level, others are better left to
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:26.280]   lower-level instances, and it is quite likely that even a well-ordered basic structure will
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:32.960]   leave many problems of social justice unresolved and hence cannot prevent all injustices in
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:38.040]   the spheres for which it provides no determinate answers.
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:42.920]   If this is the case, then it is all the more important that the theoretical discussion
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.880]   be more focused and less diffuse."
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:54.000]   Do you see what Schmitt is acknowledging here?
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:02.120]   He acknowledges that there is no real consensus definition for social justice.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:08.160]   So before anything substantive could happen according to V. H. Schmitt, we need to define
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:14.720]   what exactly needs the redress, what exactly needs the remedy.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:19.720]   Now when you look back upon history, one of the main underlying problems with terms and
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:27.800]   concepts that do not have a clear definition is that it could evolve and carry with it
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:38.520]   a qualitatively different understood meaning while backpacking with it the same ethos.
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:52.400]   In Conceptions of Teacher Education, J. A. Whitcomb, in International Encyclopedia of
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:59.160]   Education, 2010, he writes this with respect to having a social justice approach towards
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.160]   education.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:07.480]   "A social justice approach to teacher education begins with the idea that a central purpose
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:12.880]   of education is to redress social, economic, and political inequities.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.520]   Its intellectual roots lie within a radical progressive tradition.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:23.320]   In this conception, a good teacher understands socioeconomic and political forces that maintain
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:29.640]   structural inequality and oppression, including how schools as institutions reinforce the
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:35.160]   status quo and further inequitable educational experiences.
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:40.660]   Given the centrality of race, ethnicity, and class inequality, a social justice approach
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:46.440]   to teaching involves an ongoing commitment to grapple with these matters.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:53.640]   A teacher for social justice enacts curriculum so that students develop both a critical social
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:15:00.160]   consciousness and the intellectual and practical tools to be agents of change.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:04.620]   Students study the experiences of those who have been marginalized along with possibilities
[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.180]   for liberation.
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:10.620]   The teacher also ensures that students learn skills and knowledge associated with the most
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:17.680]   powerful cultural capital, thereby helping to promote access to all levels of society.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.220]   Classrooms are democratic communities where the teacher helps construct an ethos of care
[00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.560]   and respect.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:30.040]   Finally, a social justice teacher also embraces an identity as a community activist and sees
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:38.280]   this work as an extension of her teaching."
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:55.540]   Whitcomb is essentially embedding the idea of almost a missionary within the vocation
[00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.620]   of teaching.
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:01.900]   That is plainly what Whitcomb is advocating here.
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:16.020]   Again, I'm quoting to you scholarly articles, scholarly works that are uplifted by our culture.
[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:24.220]   And Whitcomb is saying that you need to have this mindset.
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:34.200]   And if you follow the language here, the language is identical to what you would read in Karl
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:39.620]   Marx's The Communist Manifesto.
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:43.180]   Moving on to medicine and public health.
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:50.300]   In expanding the concept of public health, Theodore H. Tolchinsky, he's an MD and also
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:58.020]   has a master's in public health, along with Elena A. Varvakova, also an MD, has a master's
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:00.940]   in public health and also a PhD.
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:07.820]   They write in The New Public Health in 2014 with respect to social justice as it relates
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:14.980]   to medicine and public health, "Social justice is a matter of life and death.
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:20.480]   It affects the way people live, their consequent chance of illness, and their risk of premature
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.480]   death.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:27.660]   We watch and wonder as life expectancy and good health continue to increase in parts
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:31.540]   of the world and in alarm as they fail to improve in others.
[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:36.900]   A girl born today can expect to live for more than 80 years if she is born in some countries,
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.980]   but less than 45 years if she is born in others.
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:44.260]   Within countries, there are dramatic differences in health that are closely linked with degrees
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.420]   of social disadvantage.
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:51.180]   Differences of this magnitude within and between countries simply should never happen.
[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:56.340]   These inequities in health, avoidable health inequalities arise because of the circumstances
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:00.860]   in which people grow, live, work, and age and the systems put in place to deal with
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.240]   illness.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:07.580]   The conditions in which people live and die are in turn shaped by political, social, and
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.340]   economic forces.
[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:13.700]   Social and economic policies have a determining impact on whether a child can grow and develop
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:18.380]   to its full potential and live a flourishing life, or whether its life will be blighted.
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.820]   Increasingly the nature of the health problems rich and poor countries have to resolve are
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:22.940]   converging.
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:27.980]   The development of a society, rich or poor, can be judged by the quality of its population's
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:33.400]   health, how fairly health is distributed across the social spectrum, and the degree of protection
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:43.440]   provided from disadvantage as a result of ill health.
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:52.480]   So even in the area of medicine and public health, social justice is now a matter of
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.380]   life and death.
[00:18:55.380 --> 00:19:05.240]   So if it's a matter of life and death, embedding that ideology would be naturally the only
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.240]   thing to do.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:12.780]   Not just the right thing to do, but the only thing to do.
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:22.900]   And notice here the language that is used here is very similar again to the language
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:28.460]   mirrored in the Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx.
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:42.140]   It is a single variable approach that packaged within it assumes certain factors to be true.
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:54.360]   And you could hear the globalist agenda within this quote.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:20:07.620]   And if it's a matter of life and death, why wouldn't anyone, any good-hearted person,
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:17.740]   why wouldn't anyone who has any type of compassion want to adopt this approach when it comes
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:23.300]   to medicine and public health?
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:30.500]   Stephen Bales, Professor of Humanities and Social Science at Texas A&M, in 2018, he writes,
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:34.780]   responding to the question, "What is social justice?"
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:38.600]   This is going to be a little bit longer, but it's going to be worth it.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:44.440]   He writes, and I quote, "Social justice, thought, and action weaves itself throughout world
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:50.360]   history, working as a counterpoint to humankind's unfortunate propensities for greed, power,
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:53.240]   and physical and economic violence.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:58.620]   The fundament of this thought and action has come out of philosophy, religion, and politics.
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:03.900]   It has originated organically as a reaction to exploitation and oppression.
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.180]   Sometimes it is a combination of two or more factors.
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:13.940]   It never separates, however, from the context of history, cultural, and human-social relations."
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:21.460]   According to Bales, social justice is an evolved concept that may mean different things to
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:25.100]   different people at different times.
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:30.740]   Moving on, and I quote, "Social justice emerged in its modern conceptualizations out of the
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:39.020]   inequities heaped on a mid-19th century European working class by the capitalist mode of production.
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:45.240]   From this miasma, Karl Marx developed his principle of needs, the theory that establishes
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:50.820]   the material framework for development of individual abilities and potentialities on
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:53.020]   an equal footing.
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.700]   Concepts of social justice and human rights continue to develop over the next century
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:05.300]   and a half in the face of unbridled industrialization, incessant wars, imperialism, colonialism,
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:06.660]   and globalization.
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:11.380]   This development did not result in any consensus on a technical definition, with differing
[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:18.300]   and sometimes competing or even blending versions of social justice such as Marxist, feminist,
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:24.240]   Christian, anarchist, and conservative, and liberal."
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:31.080]   As an idea, social justice remains ambiguous, and its theoretical and practical realization
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:36.660]   rests upon context, economics, cultural milieu, and the historical moment.
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:42.220]   This consideration, we shall see, has implications on implementations related to modern library
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:47.340]   work, which operates in a neoliberal, late capitalist environment."
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:48.340]   Unquote.
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.100]   I want to stop there for a second.
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.460]   We see Bayles here.
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:23:02.080]   He is being forthright with the influence that Karl Marx has had on today's understanding
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.700]   of social justice.
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:09.340]   I am not putting words into his mouth.
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:13.500]   That is what he's stating.
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:14.820]   Let me move on here.
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:21.080]   Quote, "The Oxford English Dictionary defines social justice broadly as justice at the
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:26.980]   level of a society or state as regards the position of wealth, commodities, opportunities,
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:28.300]   and privileges.
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:33.660]   Human rights is a closely related concept, albeit a more abstract one that often calls
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:38.580]   for the fulfillment of baseline requisites as opposed to parity of distribution.
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:45.180]   It is impossible to see the practical realization of the latter concept without the sufficient
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:48.700]   realization of the former and vice versa."
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:49.700]   Unquote.
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.580]   I want to stop there.
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:24:03.500]   For Bayles, baseline human rights could only be fulfilled if there is a parity of distribution.
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:12.500]   Baseline human rights could only be fulfilled if there is a parity of distribution.
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:21.020]   Parity of distribution meaning equality of all outcomes regardless of whether or not
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:24.220]   that is equitable.
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:29.220]   I'm going to illustrate to you why that is so dangerous in a second, but for now, I'm
[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:32.380]   not assailing anyone here.
[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:34.660]   I'm just quoting them.
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:42.460]   I've given you a little bit of an analysis already, but my point in quoting these people
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:47.020]   is to show you what they are saying.
[00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:55.180]   I've stated already how much I dislike setting up straw men and then taking out the straw
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:56.780]   men.
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:00.180]   That is intellectual dishonesty.
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:09.220]   Which is why I went into great lengths to quote them and in so doing paint an accurate
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:19.820]   picture of what is objective reality and then proceed to do an accurate analysis of that
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:24.700]   objective reality.
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:25.700]   Let me go on.
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:31.180]   Quote, "While many of these definitions highlight economic factors and the equitable
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:36.820]   distribution of resources, social justice is more than just a way of understanding material
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:38.740]   apportionment.
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:45.260]   Marx suggested this when he theorized that the ultimate object of communism is the full
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.980]   realization of one's humanness.
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:56.900]   His notion was that gaining true freedom returned to people the agency to realize their liberation
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:04.380]   from the exploitive material and ideological handicaps that abuse their humanity.
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:11.140]   Those theorists today, Marxist or otherwise, agree that social justice extends past the
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:17.980]   economic to incorporate political, cultural, religious, and sexual freedoms and that we
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:26.620]   should aim at a humanity liberated from all unjust social, political, and ideological
[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:31.240]   constraints."
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:42.100]   According to Bayles, social justice extends beyond economics and into every sphere of
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.100]   life.
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:51.500]   Every sphere of life.
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:27:07.840]   I am not saying that everyone who is "pro-social justice" adopts these views.
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.200]   I'm not saying that.
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:18.960]   What I am saying though is that the vast majority of people using this term are probably conjuring
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:29.800]   up images and events and when they do so, they're borrowing from a worldview, a term
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:38.960]   that's completely loaded, not understanding the term itself as opposed to having a well
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:43.560]   thought out understanding of the term.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:52.880]   What they don't understand is that the worldview, the framework that is espoused by social justicians
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:56.120]   come from the quotes I've just given you.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:00.200]   That much is a fact.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:06.480]   That is why I went to great lengths to quote from these scholarly articles to prove to
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:12.460]   you that yes indeed, social justice is everywhere.
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:25.640]   Yes indeed, it's a lens that you see everything else through.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:35.600]   All these quotes came from different academic areas, yet they were unified in their glorification
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:46.040]   of social justice while at the same time maintaining that they really don't have a concrete definition
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.040]   of it.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.800]   That was from the academic literature itself.
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:57.040]   I could have shown you more, but I think you got the picture.
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:02.520]   What are some takeaways here from everything that I've quoted to you?
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:09.960]   From the worldview that was espoused by these social justicians that are fair to them, that
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.840]   are fair to them.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.840]   I'll give you a couple.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:21.040]   The social justicians are operating under a worldview seeking a redistribution of wealth,
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:27.160]   power and influence, not based on equity.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:34.560]   The social justicians are operating under a worldview that is atheistic in nature.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:41.760]   The social justicians are operating under a worldview that inherently consists of centralized
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:48.920]   power of the state, because that's the only vehicle in which you can pull this off.
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:53.880]   That inherently consists of centralized power of the state.
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:59.940]   The social justicians are operating under a worldview that inherently believes in some
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.920]   shifting version of right and wrong.
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:08.800]   The social justicians are operating under a worldview that inherently believes that
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:16.160]   the execution of their vision must be accomplished since it is a matter of right and wrong, of
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.180]   life and death.
[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:26.560]   The social justicians are operating under a worldview that inherently believes in equality
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:38.160]   of outcomes through the vehicle of a centralized state.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:44.480]   And if that is going to happen, it is not going to be, like I said earlier, it is not
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:56.080]   going to be based on equity, but it must inherently intrinsically be based on partiality.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:01.680]   It must be based on partiality.
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:09.680]   Remember when I told you in the first episode I considered myself a signpost theologian?
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:15.040]   Signpost theologians sift and filter through ideas.
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.000]   It's a made up term.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:23.120]   I found in my estimation two of the best responses to this.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.680]   And I'm going to quote them both for you.
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:33.760]   I considered synthesizing them myself, but the reason I didn't was because I didn't want
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.800]   to come off like it was my own work.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:42.960]   But more than that, more importantly than that, I found it to be perfect just the way
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.360]   it is.
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.480]   First work.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.080]   This is Michael Novak, N-O-V-A-K.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:54.300]   Michael Novak, he was a George Frederick Jewett Scholar in Religion.
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:32:01.520]   George Frederick Jewett, J-E-W-E-T-T, Scholar in Religion, Philosophy, and Public Policy.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.720]   He passed away in 2017.
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:15.200]   Working for the Heritage Foundation, he penned an article entitled, "Social Justice is Not
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:19.160]   What You Think It Is."
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:23.840]   I'm going to quote to you a portion of this long article.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:30.520]   Novak says this, and I quote, "Let us begin by asking what most people think social justice
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:31.760]   is.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:35.800]   After that, let us review how the term arose.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:41.320]   It is a Catholic concept, later taken over by secular progressives.
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:46.160]   What social justice actually is turns out to be very different from the way the term
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:51.560]   is used now popularly."
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:56.060]   With respect to distribution, he writes, and I quote, "Distribution.
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:33:01.440]   Most people's sense of social justice is generic, amounting to nothing more than what we find
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:06.440]   in the dictionary under social justice, the distribution of advantages and disadvantages
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.440]   in society."
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:14.200]   Now, notice that the dictionary definition introduces a new key term, "distribution."
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:21.760]   Alas, the original notion of social justice had very little to do with distribution.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:30.800]   Worse, this newly added term suggests that some extra-human force, the visible hand,
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.400]   does the distribution.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:40.240]   That is some very powerful human agency, usually the state."
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:45.640]   With respect to equality, he writes, and I quote, "Equality.
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:52.580]   Furthermore, the expression 'advantages and disadvantages' supposes there is a norm
[00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:56.720]   of equality by which to measure disadvantages.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:02.040]   Consider this professorial definition, 'Although it is difficult to agree on the precise meaning
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:07.480]   of social justice, I take that to, most of us it implies, among other things, equality
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:11.560]   of the burdens, the advantages and the opportunities of citizenship.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:16.680]   Indeed, I take that social justice is intimately related to the concept of equality and that
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:21.460]   the violation of it is intimately related to the concept of inequality.
[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:28.760]   This definition expresses a whole ideology, that equality is good and ought to be enforced."
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.180]   And note what has happened to the word equality.
[00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:37.760]   In English, equality usually suggests fairness, equity, or the equitable.
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:44.080]   But what is equitable is often not to give the people the same portions, but rather to
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:48.560]   give what is proportionate to the efforts of each.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:54.280]   In European languages, most thinkers follow the model of the French term, egalité.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.680]   Egalité means the equals sign.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.860]   Equal.
[00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:01.880]   This on one side is equal to that on the other side.
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:06.960]   Egalité is a quite different notion from the English equitable.
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:13.520]   This French continental usage is captured in the American Sociological Review.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:18.880]   As I see it, social justice requires resource equity, fairness, and respect for diversity,
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:23.480]   as well as the eradication of existing forms of social oppression.
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:29.040]   Social justice entails a redistribution of resources from those who have unjustly gained
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:34.640]   them to those who have justly deserved them, and it also means creating and ensuring the
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:39.920]   processes of truly democratic participation in decision making.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:46.080]   It seems clear that only a decisive redistribution of resources and decision making power can
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:51.280]   ensure social justice and authentic democracy.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:58.280]   In brief, shifting to the French egalité changes the entire meaning of equality from
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:04.560]   equity or fairness to arithmetical uniformity.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:09.200]   This is really a dreadful change because where people take equality very seriously, they
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.560]   soon insist on uniformity.
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:17.940]   In the Inca society under Spanish rule, the first utopia was attempted.
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:22.400]   People were assigned by social class certain colors of robes to wear, and regimented hours
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:26.960]   were established for everything that was done throughout the day, even lovemaking hours
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:29.760]   with great emphasis on bringing forth more children.
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:38.020]   If you are going to make everybody equal, you really have to make uniform crucial items
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:42.840]   of daily life."
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:46.440]   Do you see what Novak is saying here?
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:50.560]   Equality was once conventionally associated with equity.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:57.960]   Now equality means arithmetical uniformity.
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:02.640]   Equality once meant to give what is proportionate to the efforts of each.
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:08.660]   It once meant to give what is proportionate to the efforts of each, but now means merely
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:14.880]   the same portions regardless of any other factor.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:18.440]   To give you an example, you have two people.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:22.980]   One person works 80 hours a week, the other person works 20 hours a week.
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:27.560]   You give to the person who works 80 hours a week whatever is equivalent to the amount
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:29.160]   of time that they worked.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:35.220]   You give to the person who worked 20 hours a week equivalent to that person, the 20 hours.
[00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:40.680]   But under equality of outcomes, we're not talking about equity.
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:44.200]   We're talking about arithmetical uniformity.
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:48.960]   So instead of giving them what is proportionate to the amount of hours that they worked, you
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:57.440]   each give them $1,000 irrespective of how much they worked because under this social
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:06.840]   justice theory, we're trying to achieve equality of outcomes and not what is proportionate
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:11.040]   to the efforts of each.
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:23.360]   The meaning changes while as I stated earlier, it backpacked the ethos of equity.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:32.200]   It's a sleight of hand just like when the magician pulls a coin from your ear.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:41.440]   This is the perfect segue here for me to just read off to you a piece written by one of
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:46.880]   the preeminent cultural theologians of our time.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:50.180]   It is a bit long, but more than worth it.
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:57.140]   This was written by Daryl Bernard Harrison of the Just Thinking Podcast.
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:04.000]   He wrote a blog post on equity or equality, equity or equality.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:10.880]   You can just input his name into a search engine and you will find this blog post.
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:15.360]   I'm just going to read it out for you because it is that good.
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:21.660]   Daryl Bernard Harrison in a blog post entitled "Equity or Equality?"
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:27.080]   He writes, and I quote, "The Old Testament provides an excellent, though rather disturbing
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:31.440]   example of the distinction between equity and equality.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:37.440]   It is found in 1 Kings 3.16-28, which records the account of two mothers, both of whom are
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:43.440]   prostitutes, which petitioned King Solomon to settle a dispute between the two of them
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:47.360]   that involved two babies, one dead and one living.
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:53.040]   As the situation unfolds, it becomes apparent that the two discordant women possess vastly
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:56.560]   contrasting paradigms of what justice is.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:02.960]   One viewed it in terms of outcome, equality, whereas the other viewed it in terms of truth,
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.040]   equity.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:10.360]   In the end, King Solomon judged with equity, not equality, a decision that subsequently
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:14.960]   garnered him great acclaim throughout the nation of Israel.
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:21.100]   King Solomon chose equity over equality, knowing full well that his decision would mean that
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:26.800]   one of the two maternal petitioners who stood before him would depart from his presence
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.520]   childless.
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:34.940]   He understood that his primary responsibility was to God, and as such, that he would judge
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:41.200]   his people, the small and the great, on the basis of the truth of God, and not on subjective
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.200]   outcomes.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:49.560]   And yet interestingly, if not ironically, therein lies the rub for many social justice
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:56.560]   equalitarians today, namely, that equity is no guarantee of outcome, and for social justice
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:00.600]   equalitarians, outcome is everything.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.080]   Everything.
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:08.360]   The first occurrence of the word "equity" in scripture is in Psalm 98, where the psalmist,
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:13.220]   speaking of God, declares, "And he will judge the world in righteousness; he will
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:17.320]   execute judgment for the peoples with equity."
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:20.880]   The word equity in Psalm 98 is the Hebrew noun meishar.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:29.040]   It is an architectural term that denotes straightness, levelness, and evenness in measurement.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:35.600]   The word carries with it the concept of judging with a straight line, one that is devoid of
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:43.440]   ethical or moral defects, irregularities, or deformities such as partiality, prejudice,
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.260]   or bias.
[00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:50.640]   As John Calvin states in his Institutes of the Christian Religion, "In all laws we
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:58.000]   must bear these two things in mind, what the law prescribes and how equitable it is, for
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.800]   it is on equity that the law's prescription rests.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:07.240]   Since equity is natural, it is inevitably the same for all peoples.
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:14.360]   Thus all the laws on earth, whatever their particular concern, should be about equity.
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:19.120]   As for the laws, regulations, or prescriptions, because they are conditioned by circumstances
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:25.200]   on which they partly depend, there is no reason why they should not be different, provided
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:28.260]   they are all directed to the goal of equity.
[00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:34.660]   Now as God's law, which we call moral, essentially bears witness to the natural law and to conscience
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:41.780]   which our Lord has imprinted on all the hearts of all men," Romans 119, "there is no doubt
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:48.520]   that the equity of which we now speak is wholly revealed in natural law.
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:55.320]   That is why equity must be the goal, the rule, and the finality of all laws."
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:43:03.040]   There are professing Christians today, particularly in America who are under the guise of justice,
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:09.920]   are proffering a gospel of equality over and above a gospel of equity.
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:15.760]   This reality has become increasingly evident given the current socio-political milieu in
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:22.200]   which equality, not equity, is regarded as the highest standard of biblical probity and
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.320]   virtue.
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:29.000]   But for King Solomon to have employed that kind of judicial hermeneutic and resolve the
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:35.600]   dispute that was before him through a deliberate or premeditated bias toward equality rather
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:43.060]   than equity would have been to distort justice (see Deuteronomy 16, 19-20).
[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:49.380]   How could it possibly have been justice to divide a living baby in two solely on the
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:53.580]   basis of accusation and not truth?
[00:43:53.580 --> 00:44:04.460]   True biblical equality means that each person and situation is judged with equity, not partiality.
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:10.380]   Truth always must be the goal, not outcomes.
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:17.660]   Equality inherently involves prejudice, and God has expressly commanded in his word that
[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:24.980]   his people are not to harbor such sinful bias in their hearts (see James 2.9).
[00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:31.780]   Equity seeks first to discern what is objectively true and, subsequently, to render a ruling
[00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:34.780]   or verdict solely on that basis.
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:43.580]   Equality, on the other hand, prioritizes pursuing a desired or preferred outcome without regard
[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:46.980]   to that which is objectively true.
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:52.700]   Scripture teaches that the providence of God reigns over all outcomes and judgments that
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:56.220]   come to pass in this world.
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:45:02.820]   So when the outcome of a disputed matter is not what you or I may have desired, as believers
[00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:09.100]   in an altogether holy, just, and righteous God, we remain steadfast in the hope that
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:17.820]   one day all wrongs will be made right, just as God, who cannot lie, has promised.
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:25.740]   Biblical justice is first and foremost a matter of equity, not equality.
[00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:29.160]   Equity not equality.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:35.220]   There is a distinction to be made between the two, and it is not an insignificant one.
[00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:40.900]   Any concept of equality that is not fundamentally rooted in equity can never be regarded as
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:42.740]   justice.
[00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:47.820]   Followers of Jesus Christ are to judge with truth in mind, not outcome.
[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:52.860]   This principle was emphasized by Jesus himself in John 7.24, where he says, "Do not judge
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:57.600]   according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment."
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:03.980]   John 7.24, "Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment."
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:10.460]   King Solomon applied that principle in his dealings with the two women in 1 Kings 3.
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:14.900]   His righteous judgment was not rendered on the basis of emotional pleadings or subjective
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:21.060]   presuppositions but on objective and impartial truth, even though for one of the two women
[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:26.540]   who entreated him, the outcome would be other than what she desired.
[00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:33.900]   Followers in Jesus Christ are to judge with equity and leave any consequences to an omniscient
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:46.640]   and omnipotent God who alone is sovereign over all outcomes."
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:54.220]   That was Daryl Bernard Harrison of the Just Thinking Podcast in the blog post entitled
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:47:00.060]   "Equity or Equality."
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:06.480]   I don't want to add to that because that was so great, but let me just say this thing.
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:19.700]   He is not saying, he is not saying that we should not care for the poor or for the disenfranchised.
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:24.140]   That is not what he is saying.
[00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:27.620]   Always think critically.
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:38.900]   What he is saying is wholly and distinctively different, W-H-O-L-L-Y, wholly and distinctively
[00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:55.540]   different from the imperatives of defending the vulnerable and doing biblical justice.
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:48:01.660]   Do not conflate the two.
[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:07.020]   There is so much more I could say regarding this topic, but I already know how long this
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:10.300]   episode is.
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:15.500]   I plan on doing a chapter two to this episode.
[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:21.580]   If you are listening to this episode and you have questions, as always, feel free to just
[00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:29.820]   email me at thesurpassingvalue@gmail.com.
[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:39.100]   In the chapter two of my episode, my tentative plan is to do a book review of two books and
[00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:40.780]   sort of amalgamate them.
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:45.000]   It will be a combination of synthesizing and doing a book review.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:51.700]   I am fortunate to be a part of the launch team for a book coming out on December 22nd
[00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:54.260]   by Professor Thaddeus Williams.
[00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:59.620]   It is called "Confronting Injustice Without Compromising Truth."
[00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:10.300]   It is a great book, but that will probably be my chapter two to this episode.
[00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:12.660]   Thanks for making it to the end.
[00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:17.420]   I'll continue to try to make the journey worth it.
[00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:32.980]   To him, the honor, glory, and eternal dominion, James Hall-Mellon.
