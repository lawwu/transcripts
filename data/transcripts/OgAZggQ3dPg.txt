[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   class tonight. I hope that you're doing well and glad that you could make it to Intermediate
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:12.640]   Biblical Counseling. This is, I believe, session number 13, and we're looking at Theology exam
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:18.960]   number 13 tonight, and I think we're going to be in for a very encouraging study tonight.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.240]   We're in the section of our essays where we're dealing with the doctrine of Christ, Christology,
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.280]   and so what that means is we're writing our essays on our favorite topic, which is the person of
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.680]   Jesus Christ, and if you're a Christian who loves Christ, then obviously we love to read about
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:45.120]   Christ, hear about Christ, and learn about Christ, and we get to write some essays here about Christ,
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.920]   and so I think we're going to be in for a good study tonight, and so thanks for joining us,
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.040]   and hope you had a great week, and hope you're working your way through the essays and the
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:05.360]   studies, and that this material has been useful for you. Just as a word of devotion for tonight,
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:13.520]   I want to start off our class by looking at a section of Scripture that is packed with meaning.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.800]   I'm just going to pull out one devotional thought from Matthew 3, verses 13 to 15,
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:28.720]   and just introducing the whole concept of substitution. Theology exam number 13 is
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:36.640]   dealing with the doctrine of substitutionary atonement, and so the concept of substitution,
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.920]   one person standing in place of another, is going to be the simple concept that we're going to
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.920]   be looking at for an hour in this webinar, and also that you're going to be thinking about
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.640]   and writing about in your essay in the week to come, and it's a simple concept, a beautiful
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.120]   concept. It's repeated time and time again in the Scripture, the concept of substitution,
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:12.160]   one man standing in place of another, and that is, as we'll see, the essence of the gospel,
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:20.400]   and this was just, I think, a number of years ago. I did some reading on this topic,
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:28.240]   on this particular passage from Matthew 3, verses 13 to 15, where you have the baptism of Jesus,
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.880]   and it says in verse 13 that Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.240]   him. John would have prevented him saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.160]   But Jesus answered him, "Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:54.560]   righteousness." Then he consented. So, here we are at the beginning of Jesus's public ministry.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:02.320]   John the Baptist has been preaching a message of repentance. John the Baptist, as you know,
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:11.360]   has come to prepare the way for the Messiah, and his message was just simple and clear and
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.280]   a very hard message. It was, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,"
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:26.400]   and so John's message was very simple. You all are sinners, and you need to repent. He preached
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.840]   baptism of repentance, so he was calling sinners to repent and confess their sins. Then he would
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:42.880]   baptize them in the Jordan as a public demonstration of their contrition. What a person was saying
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:52.240]   when they were baptized by John in the Jordan was essentially, "I'm a sinner, and I need forgiveness,
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:59.360]   and I need repentance." They were confessing their sins as they were being baptized
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:13.120]   by John. So, John had this very hard message, "Repent." He had no patience for the religious
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:22.000]   sort of virtuosity, this exterior religion that was practiced in Israel in that day.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:29.280]   He even preached to the Pharisees, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.640]   wrath that is to come?" He went to the religious leaders of his day, and he basically called them,
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:40.400]   "You bunch of snakes, you need to repent, and you need to bear fruit in keeping with repentance.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.480]   Don't just tell me that you're repentant. Show in your actual life that you have turned from your
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:54.880]   sin and turned to the Lord." So, John was just preaching this hard message. And so, it was just
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:04.000]   a very simple picture of being baptized by John. You were saying, "I am a sinner, and I need
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.160]   to repent." And so, here is this amazing scene in Matthew 3 verse 13 as the context
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:21.040]   where it says that Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:33.760]   That's really just a stunning scene. Why is that? You remember that John knew who Jesus was,
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.360]   that Jesus was the Lamb of God who came to take away the sin of the world. Jesus was the Messiah,
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.920]   and John the Baptist knew all of that. And yet, here comes Jesus who needs no repentance,
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:53.520]   and he wants to be baptized by John. And John's looking at this, and it says in verse 14,
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:00.080]   "John would have prevented him." And you know why. John understood, "Jesus, you're not a sinner.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.600]   You're the Lamb of God who's come to take away the sin of the world. You're the Messiah.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:14.880]   You're the light. You don't need to stand in the place of a sinner." And he wanted to stop Jesus
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:21.760]   from being baptized. And then to carry the thought even further, he was protesting not only that
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:29.040]   Jesus would stand in the place of a sinner, but he was protesting that he would be standing in
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:37.920]   the place of a righteous man baptizing Jesus. And verse 14, John's basically saying, "The roles are
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:46.000]   reversed here. I need to be baptized by you. I'm the sinner, Jesus. I need to be in the place of
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.520]   sinners. You're the righteous man. You need to be in the place of a righteous man. We have our roles
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:02.080]   reversed." He says, "Do you come to me?" And Jesus answered him, "Let it be so now, for thus
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.160]   it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he consented. Now, there's been
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:14.240]   pages and pages of reflection on this simple scene of why was Jesus baptized and what is
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.120]   the significance of all of that. And I just want to pull out a devotional thought for us tonight
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:26.800]   as we consider this whole concept of substitution. And my devotional thought is simply this, that
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:36.320]   Jesus began his earthly ministry the same way he ended it, and that is he stood in the place of
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:48.320]   a sinner even though he had no sin. That was why Jesus came. He came to be a substitute for sin
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:58.080]   and to stand in the sinner's place. And what results from Jesus standing in the sinner's
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:05.920]   place is that you have this role reversal, which is seen in, you know, the theme is already here.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:11.280]   It's going to come to full crescendo and climax at the end of the gospel records, but you begin to
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:18.640]   see the theme here of because Jesus says, "I'm going to stand in the place of a sinner," then
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:27.360]   John is saying, "Why are the roles reversed? Why am I not in the place of the sinner? Why am I in
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:36.560]   the place of a righteous man?" Now, you get the concept here. This is initial, the beginning of
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:42.000]   Christ's ministry. This isn't in full clarity what we're going to see in the fullness of Christ's
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:50.560]   life, death, and resurrection, but you begin to see the themes start to emerge, and they will come to
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:59.120]   a full climax at the cross of Calvary where Jesus will, at the cross, stand in the place of a sinner.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:07.600]   He will be the perfect substitute for sin. He will take our penalty. He will die our death.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:17.440]   He will take our curse. He will take the wrath of God that a sinner deserves, and he will stand
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:27.120]   in the place of a sinner so that the sinner who trusts in Jesus for salvation will stand
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:35.360]   in the place of a righteous man. And you and I look at the cross, and we are saying a similar
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:42.240]   thing that John said at Jesus' baptism, which is, "Jesus, what are you doing in the place of a sinner
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:49.600]   at the cross? And Jesus, what am I doing in the place of a righteous man that you have died my
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:59.040]   death, and I now live your life? You have taken my curse, and I now receive your blessing. You,
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:07.920]   the Son of God, were forsaken by the Father so that I, as a child of wrath, would be accepted
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:15.600]   by the Father." The role reversal of the gospel is just stunning, and yet that is the essence
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:22.640]   of Christianity. That is the good news that we proclaim is not just Christian ethics,
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:29.360]   not just Christian morals, not just Christian behavior, but we proclaim Christ as substitute.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:38.640]   He is the perfect substitute who stood in our place so that we would receive all of the blessings
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:46.240]   that he earned through his perfect life and his obedience to the law. And I just want to
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:53.360]   encourage you as counselors in training that that is not just a theological truth that we
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:58.560]   tuck away, and we write an essay about, and then we kind of put that essay aside, and we
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:04.320]   never see it again. If you're going to minister to people who are struggling with sin,
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:12.960]   you are going to need to learn to teach them about Jesus and his saving work on the cross.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:18.880]   You have good news to tell to those who are struggling with sin, to those who are
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:27.840]   weak in their faith, to those who are downcast and downhearted because of all of the issues of life.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:35.680]   You and I have encouraging news to give to both those who are strong in faith, those who are weak
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:41.440]   in faith, and we have good news. We have the gospel to proclaim even when our counselee is
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:47.440]   an unbeliever, even when we realize that they've never placed their trust in Jesus Christ. We have
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:57.040]   the gospel, the good news, the evangelion to proclaim to our counselees, and I just hope that
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:03.520]   that truth will shape your counseling ministry, that you will be, as we'll discuss tonight, you
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:13.120]   will be constantly relating the message of your counseling back to Jesus and Jesus Christ and him
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:19.680]   crucified, back to his work on the cross and all that he accomplished for us, and that you will
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:30.880]   learn to minister that truth to marriages who are in need of transformation, to fellow saints
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:37.200]   who are struggling with sin, to those who have lost hope. We want to minister the message of
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:45.600]   the cross, and back to our defense of biblical counseling, only biblical counseling can minister
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:52.240]   that message. It's those counselors who are most committed to the Scripture who will be the most
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:13:01.040]   Christ-centered and cross-centered, gospel-centered in their message and their counseling ministry,
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:07.440]   so I hope that encourages you as we prime the pump to look at the great doctrine of substitutionary
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:13.760]   atonement tonight. Let me pray for us, and we'll dive into our study tonight. Father, thank you
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:20.480]   for Christ, and thank you for the message of Jesus and him crucified. We thank you for our perfect
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:29.200]   substitute. We thank you that Jesus obeyed the law perfectly and earned the blessings of the law,
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:38.560]   and at the cross, he stood in the sinner's place, that though he had earned the law's full blessing,
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:46.800]   that he took the full cursing of the law of God so that those who had only sinned against you
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:51.440]   and who had only rebelled against your law would receive the full blessings
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:59.440]   of his obedience. We thank you for this amazing role reversal that has taken place,
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:07.120]   that we as sinners stand in the place of a righteous man while Christ, the righteous man,
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:15.920]   stood in the place of a sinner. We pray that this doctrine of substitution, the full atonement
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:23.520]   that's been made on our behalf, would shape our lives, that would shape our ministry, and that it
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:31.760]   would be an essential component of the content that we communicate to our counselees, that we
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:37.760]   believe in Jesus Christ and him crucified, and therefore we have hope for life and we have hope for
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:42.560]   those who are struggling under the weight of sin. Thank you for my brothers and sisters tonight who
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:48.720]   are tuning in and desiring to hear your word and to learn from your word, and bless each one,
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:57.120]   we pray in Jesus' name, amen. Okay, well we're going to dive right into theology exam number
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:06.560]   13, and the exam question is provide an explanation of and the biblical basis for
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:13.760]   the doctrine of substitutionary atonement. That's my comment there. Note the concept of substitution
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:22.320]   is there. Explaining the implications of this doctrine for human guilt over sin and relate
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:32.880]   your understanding of this to the concept of false guilt. So a very important essay question,
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:41.440]   and I trust that this will be a rich study for each of you. You're going to have to
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:48.240]   address this exam in two parts. There is, first of all, the explanation of the doctrine of
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:56.720]   substitutionary atonement, and then secondly, you will want to deal with the issue of guilt
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:04.160]   under the heading of objective guilt and subjective guilt. You'll also want to deal
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:10.320]   with the concept of false guilt, and we'll do some overview of those topics tonight,
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:19.680]   and so this is a wonderful study, and I hope this will be a blessing and encouragement to you.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:31.760]   So on your handout, I have some resources that I've put into your hands. Paul N's Moody Handbook
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:36.720]   of Theology has an excellent section on the atonement and the whole concept of substitution.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:45.200]   He goes into great detail on the grammar, the Greek grammar in the New Testament that deals
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:53.040]   with the concept of substitution, and so that is a very good read and resource for you.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:17:02.880]   I also want to highlight that Paul N's in that book has a good section on the false theories
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:10.640]   of atonement that you'll want to be familiar with to contrast with the biblical view of atonement,
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:17.600]   and we'll do a little bit of work on that tonight. I won't be able to get to all of the false
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:23.840]   views on atonement, but if you want more on that, you can read Paul N's Moody Handbook of Theology.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:28.160]   Wayne Grudem's Systematic Theology is excellent on that topic as well,
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:35.760]   and Charles Ryrie's Basic Theology is very good on this topic. I think I would recommend reading
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:43.920]   N's and Ryrie first and then going to Grudem after that. You'll find a lot of overlap in those
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:50.800]   resources, but each of those works are excellent, and I think it'll be helpful to you to nail down
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:58.480]   this whole doctrine of substitutionary atonement. And then on false guilt, we have Jay Adams,
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:08.000]   A Theology of Christian Counseling, pages 144 to 146. You may need to purchase the whole book to
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:16.480]   get those three pages. I don't know any easier way to do that, but I guarantee you that if you
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.720]   do purchase that book, that the rest of the book is worth the price of admission, so you won't be
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:27.440]   wasting any money, but those three pages from A Theology of Christian Counseling really go into
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:37.760]   this whole concept of false guilt. Jay Adams is writing in order to address the issue of Freud
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:45.600]   and how Freud dealt with the issue of false guilt. Freud basically said that false guilt is guilty
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:52.240]   feelings that aren't rooted in any objective truth. It's just the battle between the ego,
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:59.920]   the id, and the superego. And so, psychotherapy according to Freud was working out all of these
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:08.720]   guilty feelings that weren't rooted in objective truth. And so, Adams is responding to that whole
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:15.920]   concept of the Freudian concept of false guilt and outlining a biblical view of guilt that is
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:25.280]   really rooted in objective guilt that we believe that we feel guilty because we are guilty.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:34.640]   There is real actual guilt and violation of the law of God that results in guilty feelings. So,
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:41.520]   the contrast between the Freudian view of guilt is that we as sinners have actually
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:50.080]   transgressed the law of God, and therefore, we feel guilty. So, Adams talks about the biblical
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:58.800]   view of dealing with guilt is we deal with subjective guilty feelings by dealing with the
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:05.920]   objective guilt problem where Freud just said you have these guilty feelings. They're not
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.520]   really rooted in anything. So, the answer is you talk about them in psychotherapy,
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:17.920]   and that can go on for years, and there's no real guarantee that psychotherapy will actually
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:29.360]   make substantive change in your life. But it was a model that Freud espoused and promoted.
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:37.440]   So, just realize Adams is responding to that, and he has good three pages there in the Theology of
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:45.600]   Christian Counseling. So, I would feel guilty recommending that to you to get the entire book
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:53.760]   for three pages of reading material, but my guilty feelings are not rooted in objective guilt. I
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:21:00.480]   think you'll be well-served to get the entire book, and that entire book is a great resource
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:04.800]   for anyone who's training to be a biblical counselor. And then I want to recommend Robert
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:12.640]   Jones's work, I Just Can't Forgive Myself. He has a journal article version of this material,
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:19.920]   A Biblical Alternative to Self-Forgiveness, and then Jones also has a booklet that's available.
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:26.720]   I think it's $2 on Amazon, or you can go to biblicalcounselingbooks.com and get a copy.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:35.920]   And I think the title of that booklet is Forgiveness, I Just Can't Forgive Myself.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:42.480]   So, either the journal article or the booklet will be extremely helpful to you
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:51.200]   in really expanding this whole idea of false guilt. This idea that counselees will say,
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:57.440]   "I know that God has forgiven me for my sin, but I just can't forgive myself."
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:04.880]   How do you deal with that in a counseling session? And Jones walks you through some possible
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:11.280]   options as to what is happening in the counseling room and how you can address those issues. And
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:20.880]   if I have time tonight, I'll be able to touch on that briefly, but I really encourage you to get
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:27.680]   those resources in relation to the issue of false guilt. It's probably too much material to
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:34.720]   incorporate in your essay, but it is a very good foundation to biblical counseling ministry,
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:39.200]   and you'll find it very helpful in future ministry opportunities.
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:46.160]   So, think through those resources, and I hope that's a helpful introduction to you.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:55.360]   So, let's move to your handout on page number two. We're introducing the doctrine of substitutionary
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:04.080]   atonement and just some general kind of primer type of quotes to stir up your thinking on the cross.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:11.680]   John Stott has written that "the cross is the blazing fire at which the flame of our love
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:19.520]   is kindled, but we have to get near enough to it for sparks to fall on us." I think what Stott's
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:29.920]   saying there is that you would do well to spend much time studying the cross of the Lord Jesus
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:37.280]   Christ. I highly recommend Stott's book, The Cross of Christ. That is a must read. I would rank that
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:44.480]   up with J.I. Packer's Knowing God as one of the top 10 or top 20 books that every Christian should
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:52.400]   have. The cross of Christ, where he goes into the meaning of the cross and all the implications of
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:24:00.000]   Christ's death on our behalf for the Christian life. It's a very foundational work and one that
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:07.840]   will help you see and appreciate the love of Christ. I love what Spurgeon said, "Oh give me
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:14.240]   the story of the cross, the veritable story. Yes, let my eyes behold the wounds of Jesus as I stand
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:23.360]   and bow before the crucified." Just this wonderful language. "Here I see atonement completed,
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:31.040]   satisfaction rendered, justice honored, grace expounded, love struggling, bleeding, contending,
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:36.960]   conquering. In the actual death of Christ upon the cross, I see the safety of his elect whom
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:46.320]   he has purchased with his precious blood." Just another wonderful perspective that calls us to
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:55.200]   consider the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. So we see that the cross is at the center of biblical
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:01.360]   Christianity and the implication should be the cross should be at the center of our counseling
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:08.640]   ministry. 1 Corinthians 15 verse 3 says, "For I deliver to you as a first importance what I also
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:13.200]   received, that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures, that he was
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:20.160]   buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures." So as it has well
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:26.080]   been said, there are many things that are important but there are only a few things that can be
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:35.120]   categorized as being of first importance and what is the first importance in the church and in our
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:42.320]   lives ought to be the essential truths of the gospel. Christ died for our sins in accordance
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:47.440]   with the scriptures. He was buried. He was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:53.680]   Now at the risk of overstating the obvious, I mean that is Christianity is the belief in Jesus
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:26:01.360]   Christ and him crucified and this is the simple focus that we want our counselors to embrace and
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:07.840]   to communicate to counselees and you have to ask the question if it's so simple then why doesn't
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:16.000]   everyone do it? Why doesn't everyone counsel and tell people of how their problem relates to the
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.680]   message of Jesus Christ and him crucified and when you survey the scene that's going on in the
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:28.880]   counseling world today, you realize that this is actually a lot more rare than you might first
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:36.000]   think. Secular counselors don't minister Jesus Christ and him crucified. Integrationist counselors,
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.600]   there's a wide range of Christian integrationists but that is not the focus or the center of
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:48.240]   their message to counselees. It's really the distinction of biblical counseling that we
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.840]   minister Jesus Christ and him crucified and then we relate every counseling issue back to
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:58.400]   the cross. I have hope when I counsel someone dealing with an anger problem
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:06.640]   because if that person is a believer then Jesus died to save that person from their sins
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:14.000]   and not only to save that person from the penalty of sin but also from the power of sin
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:22.320]   and so I can reason from the counseling issue which is anger to the cross and give that believer
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:28.720]   hope and encouragement that because Jesus died to save you from the power of sin you can make
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:35.840]   progress and you can grow and overcome this anger issue. You would hope and think that that kind of
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:41.040]   counseling would be going on all the time but you realize that's just not the case in the counseling
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:47.840]   world and so because the cross is at the center of biblical Christianity, we want it to be at the
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:54.880]   center of our biblical counseling ministries. If you look at your handout in 1 Corinthians 2 verse
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:28:01.600]   2, Paul makes this amazing statement, "For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:10.800]   Christ and him crucified." So that's a pretty good counseling conviction. I have determined my heart
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:18.160]   to know nothing except Jesus Christ and him crucified. You say, "Then why are we in training
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:24.160]   for biblical counseling? Why are we dealing? Why are we studying the topics of anger and anxiety
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:30.240]   and depression and conflict resolution?" Well, it's not so that you can think less of Jesus Christ
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:36.720]   and him crucified. It's so that you can relate all of those counseling issues and as Spurgeon said,
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:43.520]   you take any issue in life and you make a beeline to the cross. It's dealing with
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:50.400]   two believers who are in conflict with one another and taking them to the foot of the cross
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:57.440]   where they can both behold Jesus Christ and him crucified and see that their conflict really needs
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:05.120]   to be resolved with grace being extended to both parties because Christ has given so much grace
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:10.480]   to us. So when Paul says, "I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:16.880]   crucified," he's not saying I don't study other issues. He's saying every topic that I study,
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:23.760]   I relate it to the message of the cross and the fundamental truths of the gospel.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:29.200]   This is how D. A. Carson has explained it. He said, "Focus on Christ crucified." That is what
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.840]   Paul did. "For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:40.080]   crucified." This does not mean that this was a new departure for Paul, still less that Paul
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:46.080]   was devoted to blissful ignorance of anything and everything other than the cross. No, what he means
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:52.640]   is that all that he does and teaches is tied to the cross. He cannot long talk about Christian joy
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:59.680]   or Christian ethics or Christian fellowship or the Christian doctrine of God or anything else
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:07.440]   without finally tying it to the cross. Paul is gospel-centered. He is Christ-centered. I love
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:19.520]   that language of tying everything to the cross. Friends, tie your counseling to the cross,
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:27.920]   and God will use and bless your ministry greatly. The Spirit loves to exalt the person of Christ,
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:35.040]   and the Spirit especially loves to exalt the message of Jesus Christ and him crucified because
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:42.880]   that is the central theme of all of Scripture. And so learn to tell people of the finished work
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:49.280]   of Jesus Christ on their behalf. There's so many counseling scenarios that we could draw up and
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:55.120]   just relate back to the cross, but one comes to mind is that when you're counseling someone who's
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:31:04.640]   going through a physical illness, a chronic illness, or just some form of suffering in a
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:11.680]   season of disappointment, to minister the message of the cross is one of the most powerful things
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:17.200]   that you can do for that person. Just taking them to Calvary, assuring them of the love of Christ,
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:23.440]   telling them of the height and the length and the breadth and the depth of Christ's love for each
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:31.040]   believer, and then showing them that the greatest demonstration of Christ's love for them is not in
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:38.320]   the circumstances that they're facing. It's not in whether their preferences are fulfilled. It is in
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:44.640]   the final work of Jesus on the cross. That is the greatest demonstration and proof of Christ's love
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:52.640]   for every believer. So learning to minister that to believers is one of the greatest things that a
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:32:00.800]   counselor can do. Let me move to page three, and I'll cover some of this quickly, but letter b would
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:08.640]   be the truth that the cross is a demonstration of the attributes of God. You have here the holiness
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:14.880]   of God, the righteousness of God, the love of God, the wrath of God, the wisdom of God, the sovereignty
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:21.440]   of God. All of these attributes are put on full display at the cross of Calvary where Jesus died
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.440]   for our sins. I love the language of Eric Raymond who wrote this, "Stand with me in the shadow of
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:34.000]   the cross and see God's attributes perfectly illuminated, tremble at his holiness and the
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.160]   demands of his sacrifice. Be convicted and comforted by the unfathomable love that demanded
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:46.560]   and accomplished Calvary. Feel your knees knock as you behold the gasping sun drink dry the eternal
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:53.840]   vat of condemnation that was due you as he bears all of the burden of divine righteousness. Stand
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:33:01.280]   in the shadow of the cross to learn of God for it is here where the son of God was set for to amplify
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:08.800]   and supremely demonstrate all of the divine perfections. Stand here and fall in love with
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:17.680]   this dangerously lovely God and his supremely beautiful son. Stand here and marvel, stand here
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:26.320]   and worship, stand here and don't move for you are right where God wants you." I just love that idea
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:34.480]   of standing in the shadow of the cross to learn of God. It says, "We stand in the shadow of the cross
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:40.880]   and behold Jesus and him crucified that we behold the holiness of God." This is how much God hates
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:51.840]   sin. We see God's holy wrath and judgment upon sin. It says, "We behold the wondrous cross upon
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:59.040]   which the prince of glory died that we behold the righteousness of God." The righteousness that is
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:04.400]   given to the sinner by grace alone through faith alone. A righteousness that's not earned
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:12.960]   through works of the law but a righteousness that is given by grace through faith. We behold the
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:20.960]   love of God as we behold the cross. That Jesus loved us even when we were his enemies and he
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:28.320]   laid down his life for us in order to redeem us and to bring us to himself and to reconcile us to
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:39.520]   God the Father. We behold the wisdom of God that makes foolish the wisdom of man. We behold the
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:45.440]   sovereignty of God that this is God's salvation plan that he has determined before the foundation
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:53.680]   of the world and that he has unfolded through the generations of time to culminate in the sacrifice
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:35:02.000]   of the Son of God at the cross of Calvary. It's as we stand in the shadow of the cross that we learn
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:10.720]   of the attributes of God. That the attributes of God are not to be learned only in abstraction or
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:20.320]   in principle but we see each of these attributes put on display as the Son of God laid down his
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:29.120]   life at Calvary. And so as C.H. Spurgeon has well said, "Abide hard by the cross and search the
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:37.760]   mystery of his wounds." All of that to say as we move to the next page of your handout on page four
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:46.480]   that I really hope and believe that the writing of this essay ought to be a life-changing experience
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:53.920]   for all of us. Any contemplation of the cross of Jesus Christ, the perfect substitute,
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:36:04.400]   the perfect Lamb of God, ought to drive us to worship and to be lost in wonder, love, and praise
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:11.840]   at the greatness of who Jesus is. It ought to stir us to love one another for if Jesus has loved us
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:21.040]   in this way and so we ought also to love one another and it ought to assure us of the greatness
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:25.280]   of Christ's love for us. And I just pray that that'll be your experience as you study these
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:32.560]   things and as you write these essays that it'll be more than an intellectual experience but that
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:43.520]   it will be a devotional exercise in abiding hard by the cross and allowing the greatness of Christ's
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:51.600]   love to encourage and to sanctify you. As we move to page four and we're looking here at the
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:59.360]   doctrine of substitutionary atonement and we'll just break that up in terms of its concepts
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:07.600]   and make it as simple as we can. Just beginning here with that first word, substitution,
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:17.120]   the concept of substitution, which simply means that Christ died in the place of sinners,
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:27.440]   that Jesus took our place at Calvary. This is the simple message of the gospel and yet we never
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:36.880]   move on from it that Jesus Christ is our perfect substitute. And this concept of substitution
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:44.080]   is made very clear throughout both Old Testament and New Testament scriptures and I want to spend
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:49.920]   a little bit of time on that just to show you that it's not that when Jesus died on the cross
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:53.600]   in the gospel records this was the first time we saw the concept of substitution
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:38:01.360]   in the Bible. That's not true at all. We see this concept of substitution repeated
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:08.800]   throughout all of Old Testament history and then into New Testament history is repeated and
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:17.440]   emphasized in so many ways in so many different places. Charles Ryrie has defined it this way,
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:24.800]   "Substitutionary or vicarious atonement simply means that Christ suffered as a substitute for us.
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:34.560]   That is, instead of us, result in the advantage to us of paying for our sins." And just looking at
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:42.320]   the clear scriptures which speak of this concept of substitution, Isaiah 53 verse 4,
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:49.440]   "Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows. Yet we esteemed him stricken,
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:56.320]   smitten by God and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions. He was crushed for
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:04.560]   our iniquities. Upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace and with his stripes we are
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:14.480]   healed." Just the clear language there articulating the concept of substitution, Jesus
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:20.480]   standing in our place. Verse 10 says, "Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush him.
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:27.600]   He has put him to grief when his soul makes an offering for guilt. He shall see his offspring.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:33.360]   He shall prolong his days. The will of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. Out of the anguish
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:38.880]   of his soul he shall see and be satisfied. By his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant,
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:46.480]   make many to be accounted righteous and he shall bear their iniquities."
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:54.800]   So again, the concept of substitution being closely tied to this idea of role reversal.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:40:01.200]   That he is going to take our iniquities. He is going to take our griefs. He is going to be
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:10.160]   crushed for our sins. And the result is that many will be made righteous. Many who have sinned and
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:19.840]   gone astray will receive righteousness. This of course is more clearly articulated by the Apostle
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:25.680]   Paul in the epistle to the Romans. And yet even here in the Old Testament, you begin to see
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:35.360]   the concept of substitution being articulated and the idea of a righteousness that we have not earned
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:43.600]   being given to those who do not deserve it. Moving to the New Testament, we have
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:50.000]   among many passages, 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 24, which says, "He himself, that is Christ,
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:57.680]   bore our sins in his body on the tree that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:10.480]   By his wounds you have been healed." So many elements of this. Jesus dies our death. We take
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:18.160]   his life. Jesus takes our curse. We receive his blessing. Jesus takes our sins. We receive his
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:26.000]   righteousness. Here in verse 24, you have, "He is wounded so that we receive healing."
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:33.600]   So many different aspects of the wondrous grace of God in this respect.
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:38.880]   We point out the grammar. I mentioned Paul Enns has some good material there
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:43.280]   looking at the grammar of the New Testament, the preposition ante,
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:50.480]   meaning instead of, as Ryrie explains, the root meaning of this preposition, which occurs
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:57.840]   22 times in the New Testament, is face-to-face opposite as two objects placed over against each
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:06.000]   other and one being taken instead of the other as in an exchange. So you can call it a role reversal.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:15.200]   You can call it an exchange. It's the idea of two objects being placed over against each other.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:25.520]   The preposition ante, Ryrie says, supports substitution. We see this preposition used in
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:32.320]   Luke 11, verse 11, where Jesus says, "What father among you, if his son asked for a fish, will
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:41.280]   instead ante of a fish give him a serpent?" So in that passage, the two objects being exchanged
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:50.000]   are a fish and a serpent, one being exchanged in place of another.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.200]   But we see that same preposition being used by Jesus to describe his redeeming work
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:00.080]   on the cross. Matthew 20, verse 28, "Even as the Son of Man came not
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:07.040]   to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many."
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:19.920]   So Jesus stands in the place of many as he dies on the cross for our sins. 1 Timothy 2,
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:26.240]   verse 6, "Who gave himself as a ransom," using that same preposition, "ante lutron,"
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:35.040]   a ransom for all, which is the testimony given at the proper time. So that preposition in the
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:40.320]   Greek supports the language of substitution. And then you have the preposition "who pair"
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:48.720]   with the meaning "for the sake of" or "on behalf of." Romans 5, verse 6, "For while we were still
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:54.080]   weak at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly. But God shows his love for us that
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:44:04.800]   while we were still sinners, Christ died for us." Again, supporting the idea of substitution.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:11.280]   These quotes aren't on your handout, but I couldn't resist sharing them with you because
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:20.400]   they're so helpful. John Gill, who was an expositor of the days of old, he writes,
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:24.720]   "Becoming the surety of his people, he was made under the law, stood in their place,
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:30.560]   and having the sins of them all imputed to him, the law finding them on him,
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:39.280]   charges him with them and curses him for them. The curse of God in vindicating his righteous law was
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:45.520]   on Christ when he hung on the cross, for he was made a curse not for himself or for any sins of
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:56.000]   his own, but for us in our stead, for our sins, and to make atonement for them." And John Stott
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:02.080]   in his work, The Cross of Christ, has said this, "The concept of substitution may be said then to
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:08.640]   lie at the heart of both sin and salvation. For the essence of sin is man substituting himself
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:17.280]   for God, while the essence of salvation is God substituting himself for man. Man puts himself
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:24.960]   where only God deserves to be. God sacrifices himself for man and puts himself where only man
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:32.320]   deserves to be. Man claims prerogatives which belong to God alone. God accepts penalties which
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:41.040]   belong to man alone." That is amazing grace. How sweet the sound. And I hope you will celebrate
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:49.920]   that this week and also in your counseling ministry. Our counselees need to hear this.
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:56.320]   They need to hear that Christ stood in their place for their sin. It should not be assumed.
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:03.440]   It should not be something that you touch on once and then you never come back to again.
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:12.400]   It is a truth that we ought to teach our counselees and then come back to and enrich
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:20.080]   and deepen their understanding of the cross. And that is what makes for a powerful counseling
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:27.120]   ministry. So moving on then from the broader concept of substitution,
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:31.520]   letter B, you have the doctrine of penal substitution.
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:39.600]   The doctrine of penal substitution. And that simply can be defined as Christ bore in our
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:47.840]   place the full penalty for sin. This is in the work, "Pierce for Our Transgressions,
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:53.920]   Rediscovering the Glory of Penal Substitution." The authors write, "The doctrine of penal
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:47:00.960]   substitution states that God gave himself in the person of his son to suffer instead of us
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:06.640]   the death, punishment, and curse due to fallen humanity as the penalty for sin."
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:15.040]   And so this is the biblical teaching that the demands of the law needed to be satisfied,
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:23.040]   that there was a penalty for transgression of the law and the only man who ever fully kept God's law
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:30.000]   was the one who took the penalty of the law and he fulfilled the law's demands in full,
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:39.360]   allowing the law's blessings to be placed upon us. That is the doctrine of penal substitution,
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:48.880]   that Jesus fully satisfied the penalty for sin at the cross. Now that's a simple truth,
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:54.560]   but I want you to just contrast that with some false views of what happened at the cross. These
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:48:02.000]   are some false views of atonement that are explained in Paul Enz's work and also in Charles
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:09.280]   Ryrie's work. You'll find more detail on this, but just to give you a flavor of how you can go
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:14.880]   wrong on this doctrine, the false view would be number one, the ransom to Satan theory.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:24.480]   This is the idea that Satan held people captive as a victor in war and so a ransom had to be paid
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:30.560]   in order to set people free. The ransom needed to be paid not to God, but to Satan.
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:41.440]   And so this false view is the idea that Jesus paid a ransom to Satan in order to free men
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:52.400]   from Satan's power. In response to this view, the biblical teaching is that the ransom
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:49:00.880]   was made to God, not to Satan. Satan did not have the power to free man. God alone had the power,
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:07.760]   and so this theory is false because it makes Satan the benefactor of Christ's death.
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:12.720]   A second false view would be the moral influence theory.
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:22.560]   This view taught that the death of Christ was not necessary as penal substitution,
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:36.240]   or rather Christ merely set a moral example to influence people to have a softened heart,
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:42.800]   and through the moving of people's emotions, they will be led to repentance,
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:50.240]   and therefore the death of Christ was not substitutionary in nature. It was merely
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:58.480]   a death that was meant to morally influence others and bring emotions that would lead them
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:06.160]   to repentance. Obviously, that is a false view of what happened at the cross. And then a third
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:13.360]   false view would be the example or martyr theory. This view, which is more liberal than the moral
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:18.960]   influence view, suggests that the death of Christ was unnecessary in atoning for sin.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:29.280]   Christ was an example of obedience that was meant to inspire people to live as Christ
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:35.840]   lived, so there was no penal substitution that took place under this view. It was merely
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:43.120]   Jesus set a good example so that we would love as he loved.
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:51.280]   We want to articulate an understanding of the cross which emphasizes penal substitution. There
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:58.240]   was a penalty that needed to be paid because of sin. The wages of sin is death. There was
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:06.480]   the wrath of God that needed to be satisfied in order for men to be reconciled to a holy God,
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:17.360]   and so at the cross, a holy God unleashed his holy wrath on a holy sacrifice and Jesus made
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:25.680]   the full payment for sin at the cross and satisfied God's wrath in full. That is the
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:33.600]   doctrine of penal substitution. Very briefly, letter C, you may want to bring into your essay
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:41.280]   and your understanding of penal substitution just the Old Testament pictures of substitution,
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:49.040]   which are many. They're all over the Old Testament. You can go all the way back to
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:52:00.480]   Genesis and how God clothed Adam and Eve with the skin of an animal, and you see even in those very
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:08.800]   first pages of the book of Genesis, you have the concept, at the very least, of an animal being
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:19.280]   killed in order to cover man. That's not a full, clear explanation of substitution as we find in
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:24.800]   the New Testament, but you do see some initial echoes of that teaching even in the very beginning
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:32.800]   of the book of Genesis. You have in Exodus 12, you have the Passover, the lamb being slaughtered,
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:40.480]   the blood of the lamb being placed over the doorposts, allowing the wrath of God to pass over
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:47.120]   the Israelites' homes, and you have this idea that there was an innocent life that needed to
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:53:00.000]   be a substitute, that an innocent life needed to die in order for God's people to be redeemed.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   And then you have the Old Testament sacrificial system, Leviticus chapter 4, the sin offering.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:13.280]   You have Leviticus chapter 16, the day of atonement. You have the blood of bulls and
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:24.080]   goats and lambs being slaughtered in order to be a picture of atonement and forgiveness of sin.
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:30.240]   Obviously, those bulls and goats could never fully take away sin, but they could only point forward
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:38.320]   to the perfect sacrifice that would come in God's time that would effectually pay for all of man's
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:43.840]   sin. But just think about living in the Old Testament and just celebrating the Passover and
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:52.960]   observing the sacrifices, and you have blood everywhere, you have animal sacrifices being
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:54:00.720]   offered on behalf of sinners, and it would have been hammered into your heart and into your mind
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:07.440]   that in order for atonement to be made for sin, in order for a sinner to live,
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:15.760]   that there must be one who takes the sinner's place. There must be an innocent life that is
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:24.160]   taken, and blood must be shed in order for the sinner to have life. And that would have been
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:32.160]   hammered into your heart and mind over generations of Old Testament history so that when Jesus
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:39.440]   comes in the fullness of New Testament revelation and John the Baptist proclaims, "Behold the Lamb
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:47.360]   of God who takes away the sin of the world." If you have all of this Old Testament language and
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:55.360]   picture of substitution having been hammered into your heart and mind, that statement would have
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:55:04.880]   landed with incredible power. That this is what all the Old Testament pointed forward to. This
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:12.560]   is the Lamb of God who fully takes away the sin of the world, and that statement, that proclamation
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:21.600]   by John, would have landed with great impact. That here is the perfect substitute that all
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:30.320]   Old Testament sacrifices could only point forward to and anticipate. So that leads us to letter D,
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:37.040]   and I believe this is, I think that's a typo at the bottom of page 5, but pretend that's a letter
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:45.360]   D, the result of substitution. And this is the good news, is that because Jesus is our substitute,
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:52.720]   that the wrath of God has been satisfied on our behalf. The word "propitiation" in the New
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:56:04.800]   Testament simply means "satisfaction." That is good news. God is satisfied with the work of Jesus
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:14.880]   on our behalf. This is why God the Father calls us to come to his throne of grace and calls us to
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:22.080]   come with confidence, because he's satisfied in the work of his Son. And I think what you're going
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:32.160]   to find in counseling is that in many believers' lives, they claim to not be Catholics. They claim
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:38.320]   to be Protestant and to believe in grace alone, faith alone, Christ alone, the scriptures alone,
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:46.400]   the glory of God alone. They claim to believe in the biblical gospel, and they do. But functionally,
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:56.400]   on a practical level, there may be this idea that I have to do penance because of my sin,
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:57:05.120]   that I can't fully come into the holy presence of God through the work of Christ, that God
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:12.160]   looks on me with disfavor, or God is punishing me for my sins. You'll find that many counselees
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:19.280]   struggle with this whole idea of, "Yes, I know I have sinned, and so I have to do some form of
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:26.480]   penance in order to make it up to God." And that's where we as counselors need to minister
[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:34.400]   the biblical gospel, that any believer in Christ has full access into the throne of God, because
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:41.120]   God is satisfied with the Son's sacrifice. So let me move to the last page here, and I will cover
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:48.480]   this briefly. What the essay question is asking you to do is to not only articulate an understanding
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:58.240]   of the cross and the concept of substitutionary atonement, which is this idea that Christ paid
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:03.600]   the penalty for our sins. It wasn't just that He was a moral influence. It wasn't just that
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:09.840]   the cross of Christ was meant to move us emotionally, but it was an actual payment
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:18.880]   for the penalty of sin that satisfied God's wrath. And so then the essay is asking you to
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:26.880]   relate that to the issue of guilt. And I cover this in my year one training, and so I'm not going
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:34.480]   to do this in full depth here, but just to lay the foundation, what you're going to need to do
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:42.480]   under this topic is to distinguish between objective guilt and subjective guilt.
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:49.760]   Objective guilt is the actual guilt that we have incurred because of our disobedience to God's law.
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:59.040]   Subjective guilt is the feelings that result because of the fact that we are actually guilty.
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:03.760]   So as I said, that's the contrast with the Freudian view, which said that
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:10.960]   subjective guilt has no objective basis. The biblical understanding is we feel guilty because
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:17.680]   we are guilty. Miller Erickson says that guilt is the objective state of having violated God's
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:23.920]   intention for man and thus being liable to punishment. Stuart Scott defines objective
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:29.360]   guilt as a legal liability or culpability to punishment. So if you look at that passage in
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:38.320]   Genesis 3, Adam and Eve felt guilty. They were ashamed because they were guilty. They had
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:47.600]   disobeyed God's command. And so ideally speaking, your subjective guilty feelings always correspond
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:56.880]   to your actual objective guilt. That would be the functioning of a healthy conscience. A healthy
[00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:07.360]   conscience registers subjective feelings of guilt when you have actually incurred objective guilt.
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:13.520]   Now, the counseling problem is that most people's consciences aren't always
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:21.200]   healthy. They malfunction or they register guilty feelings where you're not actually guilty
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:30.720]   or they don't register guilty feelings when they ought to make you feel guilty.
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:38.480]   And so that is where this whole category of false guilt comes in. And I'll just define false guilt
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:45.280]   very simply. It can be defined as subjective feelings of shame that are not rooted in an
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:55.360]   objective state of wrongdoing. So the perfectionist feels guilty because he or she did not get straight
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:07.200]   As. So your GPA is a 3.8 instead of a 4.0. And so the perfectionist feels guilty over that.
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:14.160]   But you have to ask the question, where does it say in the Bible that you have to get a 4.0 in
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:21.120]   your academic career? Where does it say that? I mean, you can relate that to a perfectionist
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:28.640]   may feel like very guilty that I don't do home-cooked meals every day for my children.
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:37.040]   And I have to do takeout and feed the McDonald's every once in a while. My wife and I gave up on
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:42.720]   that issue many years ago. We don't feel guilty anymore for feeding them McDonald's. They live.
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:48.080]   But perfectionist may feel that way that, gosh, I should feed them something more healthy and
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:56.720]   nutritious. And I feel so guilty not cooking every meal. And you have to go back to where
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:04.480]   does the Bible say that that is the standard for cooking meals? Where does the Bible say that that
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:11.120]   is the standard for academic careers? So you see that false guilt is you're registering guilty
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:19.840]   feelings where there is no actual objective guilt. And so the counseling implication here
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:26.240]   is that we need to help people train their conscience with the Word of God so that their
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:34.080]   guilty feelings correspond to actual guilt. And then where they actually are guilty,
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:43.440]   we need to take that guilt to the cross and minister the grace and the hope that is in
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:48.240]   the truth of Jesus Christ and Him crucified. We need to minister that to our counselees.
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:54.000]   We need to let them know that there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.080]   We need to let them know that Christ's sacrifice on the cross is more than sufficient to pay for
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:06.880]   all of your sins—past, present, future—sins of omission, sins of commission, sins of attitude,
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:14.400]   sins of action. Christ's sacrifice is sufficient to pay for all of your sins. And we need to
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:22.720]   minister the gospel to objective guilt. When we do that, the guilty feelings will be dealt with.
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:28.160]   Where the guilty feelings are not related to objective guilt, then we need to help train
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:34.160]   our counselees' conscience with the Word of God so that their conscience starts to register
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:41.600]   subjective guilt where there is objective guilt. So I hope that's a helpful overview
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:52.160]   for you. Okay, I took some time with that. I was hoping to get to the issue of self-forgiveness,
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:58.560]   but I'm not going to have time to get to that. But I'll commend to you the link that I sent out
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:07.680]   with Robert Jones's work on false guilt, as well as his booklet, "I Just Can't Forgive Myself."
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:13.440]   If you want to get some more perspective on this whole idea of false guilt and the counseling
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:20.160]   implications of that, get Robert Jones's work, and he will help you with that. Do read the
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:29.200]   link that I sent you from Jones on objective guilt and subjective guilt. He also deals with
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:34.400]   false guilt and works through those categories. I think you'll find that that is very helpful
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:42.160]   and very practical. So thank you for joining us tonight. What I'm going to do is I'm going to
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:47.600]   pray, and I'm out of time. So I'm going to pray. Close our time. I will hang on for another five
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:51.920]   minutes if any of you have questions about the essays or anything I can help you with practically,
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:56.560]   but I hope that was a good overview of substitutionary atonement and how it relates
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:02.240]   to false guilt. I hope you have a wonderful week of study on these topics. Let me pray for us.
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:07.520]   Well, Father, we thank you so much for Christ, and we just thank you so much for
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:15.840]   that glorious truth that we can never really get enough of, the truth of Jesus Christ,
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:22.960]   our perfect substitute. We just thank you that, Lord, we are accepted on the basis of His merits
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:29.040]   and not on the basis of our own merits. And because we come to you through the Son
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:35.840]   and His perfect work, that we can be assured of your love and your affection toward us.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:42.640]   And we just glory in these things. We thank you for your Spirit who ministers this truth to our
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:50.080]   hearts and assures us that we are indeed children of God in Christ. And we pray that we would be
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:56.320]   able not only to rejoice ourselves in these truths, but give us grace that we may be able to minister
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:04.720]   the truth of the cross and Jesus Christ and Him crucified to those who are struggling
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:10.880]   and weighed down with the issues of life. Make us into biblical counselors who are also
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:16.960]   Christ-centered counselors, we pray. I thank you for my brothers and sisters here and bless
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:22.480]   their week and make it, we pray, fruitful for your glory. In Jesus' name, amen.
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:30.160]   Well, amen. I will hang on for a couple of minutes here. And if you have any questions,
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:45.360]   otherwise I will encourage you to have a great week of study in these doctrines.
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:04.080]   Okay, we have one question that came in. Can you continue with your counseling example on
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:14.560]   false guilt and forgiveness? I'm trying to remember the example that I gave. It's a good question.
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:27.680]   I think the Jones material is going to help you work through the whole idea of people who say,
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:35.680]   "I can't or haven't forgiven myself." You know, "I know that God has forgiven me, but I can't
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:44.240]   forgive myself." And he gives a number of options there that what they might be saying.
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:54.080]   And one of those options, possible things that a counseling might be saying is that, "I have a
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:08:05.040]   standard." For example, the perfectionist who believes that he needs to get a 4.0
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:11.840]   on all academic work and feels guilty if he gets a B in a class.
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:18.240]   Well, there's no biblical standard that says you have to get all A's in every class,
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:25.760]   but the counselee has made an extra biblical standard and is holding himself to a higher
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:33.040]   standard than the Word of God. And so, part of the biblical counseling ministry, I think,
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:39.600]   is to help people with that. It's just to say, point them to the standards of God's Word that
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:47.920]   God's commandments are not burdensome. 1 John 5 verse 3, "Jesus promised an easy yoke and a light
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:53.680]   load." And if you have loaded yourself up where your Christian life is so burdensome
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:09:01.680]   that you feel oppressed because there's so many standards that you're consistently
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:08.000]   failing to measure up to, then you have to ask yourself, "Is that the commandments of God,
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:14.720]   or is that your own standard for yourself that you have made?" And you do find that in counseling
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:24.000]   ministry that people have made their own standards, that they will labor to exhaustion trying to
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:31.440]   fulfill standards that are not in the Bible. You think of parents today, especially here in Orange
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:38.800]   County, where there's every option for parents to put their kids in art class, in athletics,
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:47.760]   in music class, as well as every academic class and tutoring that you could possibly
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:53.680]   imagine. It's just parents are drowning in options, and high-performance parents who
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:10:00.160]   feel that everything in their parenting revolves around their performance and their ability to
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:06.960]   have their children in the best programs will drive themselves to exhaustion and drive their
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:12.400]   children to exhaustion trying to meet some kind of standard that they perceive is a standard of
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:20.720]   excellence, but it's not God's standard. There's no Bible verse that says you must raise your
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:29.840]   children to be athletic, artistic, musical, academic, and you have violated God's commands
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:35.920]   if you don't fulfill that. That's a standard you may have made for yourself, but the Bible hasn't
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:42.480]   made that for you. Working with parents on that and just what is the biblical standard? Well,
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:48.560]   Ephesians 6.4 says, "Bring your children up in the fear and admonition of the Lord.
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:57.120]   Fathers, don't provoke your children to anger." If you don't make your children mad, then you're
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:05.040]   halfway there. It's not a complicated parenting paradigm that the Bible presents to us. Just
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:10.720]   don't make them angry and raise them up in the fear and admonition of the Lord. Then
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:13.920]   aside from that, there's just a whole lot of freedom of how you're going to apply that.
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:22.800]   I do think that a lot of false guilt is related to legalistic standards that we make for ourselves
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:32.560]   and we don't experience the easy yoke that Christ has given to us. It's an excellent question.
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:36.880]   There's probably a longer answer than you wanted, but it's an excellent question on
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:43.120]   false guilt and forgiveness. A second question came in. "What about those that have sinned
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:48.000]   against someone and has honestly repented toward that person, but that person refuses to forgive
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:57.120]   them and the one who already repented still feels guilty because that person did not forgive them?"
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:07.920]   It's an excellent question. The issue is you have Believer A who has repented.
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:14.640]   It looks like the second person may be a believer, may not be a believer,
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:24.240]   but the second person is refusing to forgive them. I would try to help that person understand
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:30.320]   what is their responsibility versus what is the other person's responsibility.
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:40.320]   Romans 12, "As far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men," and you cannot take
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:49.600]   the responsibility of the other person's responses toward you. You're responsible before God to
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:58.400]   repent, to confess sin, to pursue peace. There is an element of if a person has
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:07.120]   seriously sinned against another person and has repented of that sin and confessed that sin,
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:14.960]   then there is an element of you need to give the other person time to process that and not demand
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:23.440]   forgiveness, but to request forgiveness. I think you're probably describing an issue of
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:34.320]   more of that the person is weighed down with unnecessary guilt because there hasn't been
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:39.440]   reconciliation in the relationship. I would just be trying to help that person understand
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:46.800]   their responsibility before God versus the other person's responsibility.
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:52.800]   Take a look at Paul Tripp's Circles of Responsibilities. I think that's in his
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:58.960]   appendix in Instruments in the Redeemer's Hands. That's an excellent tool that I use
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:04.800]   in counseling just to distinguish what is your responsibility as a believer versus what is
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:13.040]   God's responsibility. Your responsibility is to be as obedient as you can to the Word of God,
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:21.120]   and God's responsibility is to work a number of these issues out. For example, my responsibility
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:28.560]   is to be faithful to raise my children. It's not my responsibility to make them Christians.
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:35.280]   I can't take that responsibility for myself. If I do, I'm going to labor under a lot of
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:40.960]   unnecessary guilt because I'm trying to take responsibility for something that God has not
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:51.600]   given me grace to accomplish. Just think trying to help people understand their limited responsibility
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:15:01.040]   in this world is something that happens in counseling. You counsel people who are afflicted
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:08.640]   with insomnia, and some of it is they're afraid to go to sleep because the universe is going to
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:15.840]   fall apart without their labor. They're burning the candle at both ends because it all depends
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:23.520]   on them and their work to get things accomplished. Part of helping people sleep is to help them
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:29.760]   realize their limited responsibility in this world. If you look at Paul Tripp's Circles of
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:35.440]   Responsibility, and you look at our responsibility, you'll find that our responsibility is actually a
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:43.360]   lot smaller than we might think it is. Excellent question, and I hope you can encourage that
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:54.480]   believer to fulfill their responsibility before the Lord. God bless you guys. Thank you so much
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:16:01.600]   for joining us tonight. We'll be back here next Sunday at five o'clock p.m pacific time, and we'll
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:09.520]   look at theology exam number 14. In the meantime, have a great week, and God bless you. Thanks so
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:13.200]   much for your encouragement, and we'll see you next week.
