[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.720]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.920]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.920]   My name is Joshua.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.920]   I'm your host.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.720]   And today we round out part five of our five-part series called "You Don't Have to Be Smart
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.520]   to Become Financially Independent, But You Can't Be Stupid."
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:31.520]   And the idea is this, I spend so much time talking about radical, hardcore ideas, very
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.080]   technical forms of analysis that I fear that you might have the impression that somehow
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.920]   you have to be smart to do this stuff.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.760]   That's a mistake.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.040]   There are so many ordinary people who have worked at ordinary jobs, but just worked hard
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.400]   at them, who have lived ordinary-looking lives, but have just reined their expenses in a little
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.080]   bit, who have invested in ordinary investment vehicles, but who have simply stayed the course
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.920]   and followed their strategies, who have protected themselves from catastrophe through very ordinary
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.560]   means of protection like emergency funds and insurance policies.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.860]   And they've gotten rich.
[00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.920]   So I want to make sure that you don't think that you have to live in a van down by the
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.360]   river while you're starting up your next tech startup that's going to make you $10 million
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.360]   and invest all your money in the latest crypto offering in order for you to become rich.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.800]   You don't.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.080]   You just can't be stupid and make the stupid mistakes that so many people make.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.600]   Today we talk about part five of my framework called "Optimize Lifestyle."
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.360]   Now optimize lifestyle is in a sense very simple.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.680]   When I teach this, I teach it in the simple way to say, you can earn an income of $50,000
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.020]   per year at a job you like and at a job you don't like.
[00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.120]   And the net result on your life measured in financial terms is going to be the same.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.360]   But the result in your life measured in lifestyle is going to be very different.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.320]   So if you don't like your job, you don't have to be crazy smart and invent some brand new
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.320]   thing.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.280]   Just go look for and get another job that you think you might like more and see if you
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.420]   like it better.
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.580]   If you don't like that one any better, you don't have to be all that smart, come up with
[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.680]   some brand new approach.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.160]   Just go and get another job that you think you might like better.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.560]   It's very simple.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.720]   What about expenses?
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.760]   Well, you can optimize the way that you spend your money.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.240]   You can buy an ordinary house that you really like because it's close to your children's
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.240]   school, it's close to the local library, it's close to the stores, and it has a really beautiful
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.240]   view.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.920]   Or you can buy a really ordinary house that you don't like because it has some problems
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.600]   that you don't like.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.760]   Well, if you don't like your house, just sell it and go buy another one.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.760]   If you don't like your car, just sell it and go get a different one.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.240]   If you don't like where you live, just move and go live somewhere else and optimize those
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.720]   things.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.360]   You don't need any super secret strategy.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.360]   You just need to pay attention to those things that are working for you and do more of them.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.320]   Pay attention to the things that are not working for you and change them.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.920]   Finally, with investments, how can you optimize your investment portfolio?
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.000]   I want to encourage you, think broadly about it.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.960]   I knew a guy one time who worked in my local coin shop and I would go in and talk to him.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.620]   He worked in the local coin shop.
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.620]   He loved it.
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.040]   He enjoyed working there.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.760]   He was a real expert, especially in numismatic coins.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.280]   I would go in and chat with him and we'd talk about different things.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.320]   He provided great customer service on the job.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.680]   He had a really rewarding type of work that he did.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.720]   He enjoyed the industry.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.920]   He liked selling coins.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.360]   But on the side, he would spend all his time buying rare coins and putting together collections
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.200]   and then selling them as collections.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.720]   For a guy like that, it would be crazy for him to make a primary source of his investment
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.280]   in stocks or even in real estate.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.520]   He was not suitable for a real estate kind of approach, but he was very suitable for
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.320]   buying and investing in rare coins.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.320]   He knew what he was doing.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.480]   So if you want to invest and you have an interest in rare coins or whatever the appropriate
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.560]   version of that is, go for it.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:05.840]   Another guy that I knew, I'm trying to use common man examples just as a common man example.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.200]   Another guy that I knew, he always thought that he should put money in stocks, but what
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.040]   happened was he always wound up putting money in stocks and then he needed money and he
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.000]   would take the money out of his 401k and sell it.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.320]   This happened again and again and again.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.280]   I sat with him as a financial advisor and he expected me to say the same thing that
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.960]   every other financial advisor said, "You got to put your money in and leave it alone."
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.920]   Meanwhile, I look over in the corner of the room and there is a massive, massive gun cabinet
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.000]   sitting there.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.280]   Now we got to talking and I am a very good listener.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.520]   When people want to talk to me about all their guns, I think it's an interesting subject.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.120]   And the tens of thousands of dollars that were there held in that gun cabinet, those
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.080]   tens of thousands of dollars kept on accumulating.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.400]   All I did was say, "Listen, you've got this skill.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.400]   You've got the money.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.320]   You spend your time going to gun shows.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:10.160]   Just focus on this as your investment approach, optimizing investments."
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.680]   And in those two cases, I used very tangible subjects.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.240]   Some people are into cars, some people are into horses, some people are into horse trailers.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.240]   I don't know.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.240]   I'm using that.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.600]   Some people are into crypto and they just love crypto.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.120]   Well, put your money where your mouth is and focus and be willing to focus on investing
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.040]   in what you know and in what you love and what you care about so that you can reap some
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.600]   reward from your investments.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:42.320]   It's not just numbers on a paper of what the US stock market is doing.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:51.480]   My point with these examples is you can get a lot of life satisfaction from your investments.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.840]   My friend who did coins, he loved it.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.740]   He was at the coin show anyway and he was really good at putting together collections
[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.360]   and selling them for way more than he had in them.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.520]   It took him a long time.
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:09.640]   It took him years to put them together, but he loved the process and he was doing it anyway.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.560]   My friend who did the guns, he did a little bit of gunsmithing on the side, built some
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.720]   rifles and sold them, helped some friends build some rifles, bought things cheap, sold
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.120]   them, traded, did all this stuff.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.120]   Loved it.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.120]   He was doing it anyway.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:35.240]   And he couldn't hold on to $10,000 in his 401k because he could sure hold on to $10,000
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.880]   in a gun because he didn't want to part with it.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:43.600]   At some point in time, obviously, you got to part with the thing, but hopefully my examples
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.960]   ring true for you.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.920]   You can optimize how you earn your income.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.600]   You can optimize how you spend your money.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.640]   You can optimize how you invest.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.960]   You can optimize the house that you live in, the car that you drive, where you live, the
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.440]   state you live in, the country you live in.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.600]   Just don't be stupid about it.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:07.280]   On every one of those things, there is a level of stupidity.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.160]   For example, I said, you can live in a, if you don't like your house, move to another
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.160]   house.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.880]   Well, remember, move to another house doesn't automatically mean move to the $10 million
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:21.100]   penthouse condo, unless you got the, actually got the money to pay for it.
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.440]   But you can optimize these things.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.040]   The cool thing about optimization is it frequently leads to greater success.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:32.680]   If you choose a job that's well suited for you, then it'll be easier for you to work
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:39.440]   longer hours in it, work harder at it, and grow in it over the long term.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.240]   You'll accrue more and more unique inside knowledge, unique skill that will help you
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.440]   earn more and more and more money.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:52.580]   It starts with choosing the right job for you, and then you just simply follow it through.
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.600]   The cool thing about optimizing where you live is if you live in a state that you like,
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.820]   in a country that you care about, in a town that you've chosen, in a house that works
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:06.100]   well for you and is important to you, then it's a lot easier for you to stay in that
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.760]   house for many, many decades.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.500]   If you'll just stay in the house for many, many decades, your expenses will be so low
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.160]   that it's hard for you not to buy a few more houses and rent them out, because what else
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.200]   are you going to do with the money that's piling up in your checking account?
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:24.800]   If you'll choose investments that you care about, that are optimized for you, then you'll
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.940]   wind up having inside knowledge on that market, and you'll be able to exert inside knowledge
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:34.460]   on that market in order to earn above average rates of return, and that earning of above
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:39.820]   average rates of return will keep you growing your investment portfolio.
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:44.020]   Because you're investing in something that you're interested in and you care about, you'll
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:48.180]   automatically see the opportunities that are right for you.
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.740]   It's not complicated.
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:10:00.740]   You don't have to actually be all that smart to become financially independent, but you
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:05.700]   can't be stupid.
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.020]   I hope this series has been helpful to you.
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:13.460]   I hope that when I dig into weird stuff, I hope you just listen to it and say, "If it's
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:19.180]   right for you, it's fine to be weird, but just say, 'How can I apply that a little bit?'"
[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:23.660]   Recognize that I don't think everybody needs to go to the hardcore extreme, but you can
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:28.020]   still become financially independent if you'll take a few strategies here and there and apply
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:31.460]   them to your life.
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.460]   Thank you for listening.
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:36.660]   You've honored me with your time and attention, and I'm grateful for that.
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:41.480]   And I hope that I've effectively served you today with some ideas and strategies and tactics
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:46.220]   and techniques and tools that will help move you towards your goals.
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.660]   Before you go, three simple requests.
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:54.340]   One, if there's an idea that's been helpful to you in today's show, make a plan to take
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.380]   action on it.
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:01.780]   Listening does lead to learning, but learning in and of itself doesn't automatically lead
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.120]   to a life change.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:08.100]   It's action that leads to a life change.
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.820]   So take action.
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:15.420]   Two, take something that was helpful to you in today's show and share it with somebody
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.980]   that you care about.
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:24.180]   I'm depending on you to be a co-laborer with me in helping me to propagate the message
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.660]   that I'm seeking to share.
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:32.500]   That helps the person that you are engaging with, and it also helps you because teaching
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:39.380]   others is one of the most effective ways for you to learn and for you to cement your learning.
[00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:44.620]   Three, if there's an idea that's been specifically helpful to you, and if you're gaining financial
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:49.340]   benefit from Radical Personal Finance, I'd be grateful if you'd consider paying me for
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.980]   this work voluntarily.
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.220]   Come by radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron and you can sign up there to support the show
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.460]   at whatever level you feel is right for you.
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.220]   This is a voluntary support.
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.860]   That's my Patreon page.
[00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:07.900]   You can support me with a dollar a month, $5 a month, $10 a month, any number that seems
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:08.900]   right to you.

[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:20.920]   Hi, I'm Caleb.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.420]   I was born with osteogenesis imperfecta or brittle bone disease.
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:38.180]   I have broken my bones almost 200 times, and I have had 11 surgeries, but I didn't let
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.180]   my bones heal.
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.180]   I'm learning how to ride a bike, bike ride, climb, race, and I'm learning how to stand
[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.180]   and walk.
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:49.340]   Well, I can only do all of this because of generous people like you and Shriners Hospitals
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.340]   for Children.
