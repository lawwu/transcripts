[00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.580]   You just can't be stupid and make the stupid mistakes that so many people make.
[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.840]   Today we talk about part five of my framework called Optimize Lifestyle.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.320]   Now Optimize Lifestyle is, in a sense, very simple. When I teach this, I teach it

Or you can buy a really ordinary house that you don't like because it has some problems that you don't like. Well, if you don't like your house, just sell it and go buy another one. If you don't like your car, just sell it and go get a different one. If you don't like where you live, just move and go live somewhere else and optimize those things.

[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:56.700]   You don't need any super secret strategy. You just need to pay attention to those things that are working for you and do more of them. Pay attention to the things that are not working for you and change them.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.700]   I knew a guy one time who worked in my local coin shop and I would go in and talk to him.

[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.720]   He was a real expert especially in numismatic coins and I would go in and chat with him and we'd talk about different things and he provided great customer service on the job. He had a really rewarding type of work that he did. He enjoyed the industry. He liked selling coins. But on the side he would spend all his time buying rare coins and putting together collections and then selling them as collections.
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:56.740]   For a guy like that, it would be crazy for him to make a primary source of his investment in stocks or even in real estate.
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.740]   He was not suitable for a real estate kind of approach but he was very suitable for buying and investing in rare coins. He knew what he was doing.
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.740]   So if you want to invest and you have an interest in rare coins or whatever the appropriate version of that is, go for it.
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.740]   It's not a bad thing to invest in rare coins. It's not a bad thing to invest in rare coins. It's not a bad thing to invest in rare coins.
