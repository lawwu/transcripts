[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:35.180]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.700]   a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.740]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need
[00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.740]   to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.040]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.140]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.060]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.940]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a live Q&A show.
[00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.820]   These are the shows that work
[00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.420]   like live call-in talk radio, you call in, we chat.
[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.980]   And of course I release it to the podcast feed
[00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.100]   in usually about 30 minutes or so.
[00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.180]   So it's not quite live for you, but mostly.
[00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.700]   These are my personal favorite shows of the week
[00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.380]   because I don't have to choose the topics.
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.540]   I don't have to think in advance.
[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.660]   I just show up to a phone line and you get to call in
[00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.740]   and talk about anything you wanna talk about.
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.080]   Ask any question you want to,
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.620]   bring up any topic you wanna talk to,
[00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.580]   and we can chat about anything that's on your mind.
[00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.420]   I do my best.
[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.420]   If I can't help you, I try to point you
[00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.240]   in the right direction,
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.620]   and you can judge for yourself the results.
[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.980]   If you would like to join access to these Friday Q&A shows,
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.540]   you can do so by joining us on Patreon.
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.660]   Go to Patreon and search for Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.980]   Sign up to support the show there on Patreon,
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.220]   and I will be happy to talk to you on next week's Q&A.
[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.540]   Just helps me to meter the access a little bit.
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.120]   If I open it up to the public
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.900]   without screening it with Patreon,
[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.700]   then I would have probably 30, 40, 50 callers every show.
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.940]   That's usually how it's been
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.040]   whenever I've done something public.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.820]   So by metering it behind Patreon,
[00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.500]   it allows me to have a manageable number of callers.
[00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.820]   At the moment, we've got five sitting in line.
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.580]   We'll see who else joins here in the next few minutes.
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.680]   To begin with today, let's see.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.020]   We will go to Andrew in Texas.
[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.860]   Andrew, welcome to the show.
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.300]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.620]   Andrew in Texas.
[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.620]   - Thank you.
[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.380]   Thank you for taking my call.
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.660]   A question about home equity line of credit.
[00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.140]   And I got some of the answer
[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.540]   in your recent podcast on ratios,
[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.860]   and really found that valuable.
[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.300]   But yeah, I'm finding that with real estate values
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.740]   that have kind of climbed over the last year or two a lot,
[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.860]   I've got suddenly a lot of home equity,
[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.540]   and I've been getting bolder through your podcast
[00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.180]   and different things about the idea of taking risk
[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.780]   with that money, putting that capital
[00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.300]   or putting that equity to use in a better way.
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.260]   And so I got an email from my credit union,
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.380]   says, "Hey, look how big it is
[00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.260]   "to take out a home equity line of credit."
[00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.260]   And so I've been approved for $240,000 in that.
[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.700]   And so I'm looking to take a start, not with all of it,
[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.260]   but maybe 100,000 and put that to work,
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.540]   probably with the guys who are managing
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.900]   my retirement accounts, basically in the stock market,
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.940]   they've been having very productive results.
[00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.340]   And so just looking for any kind of reassurance
[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.300]   or further advice on any mistakes
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.860]   that might come up on that.
[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.860]   The reason I like that kind of thing is,
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.980]   I don't really have in my income budget,
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.860]   the money to make new payments from that loan.
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.860]   But if I take out 110,000 and put 10,000 in savings
[00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.020]   and just make payments from that for a while,
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.020]   I give some time for the 100,000 to get up and going.
[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.420]   And I believe the income and the growth from that
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.700]   will eventually pay for those payments.
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.540]   - How much do you earn per year from your job?
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.220]   - You might have 120.
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.300]   - And currently, without having taken out
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.580]   any home equity loan, what is the current
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.260]   mortgage balance on the house?
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.500]   - 295.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.420]   - 295, and if you sold the house,
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.060]   about how much would it sell for?
[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.460]   - 650,000.
[00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.420]   - And other than this, do you have any other debt?
[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.660]   - No.
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.660]   - Okay, and how old are you?
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.580]   - 55.
[00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.100]   - 55, so right now, you're thinking,
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.180]   if I go ahead and take out a home equity line of credit
[00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.860]   on the house, and let's say I take $100,000 out
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.060]   of the equity in my house, and I put that money
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.540]   invested in the stock market with my
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.020]   investment management guys, then I could probably
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.220]   make a higher return in the stock market
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.780]   than I can on my home equity line of credit.
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.220]   Is that what you're thinking?
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.180]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.020]   - Okay.
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.260]   Well, I'm not--
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.340]   - And I'm also open to other, I'm also open to
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.060]   a business, or I like having that capital available
[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.860]   for any other kind of investment opportunity
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:29.700]   that comes along.
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.420]   - Yeah, how much money do you have currently in savings?
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.180]   Is this not in retirement accounts?
[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.220]   - No, 15,000.
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.020]   - And how much money do you have in retirement accounts?
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.580]   - 180.
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.580]   - Okay, so why do you own such an expensive house,
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.460]   unless you have other investment assets
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.300]   that you haven't told me about,
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.060]   but only have about $180,000 in retirement accounts?
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.100]   - Well, it's grown in value.
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.400]   I was able to get into it fairly cheaply.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.860]   - How much did you pay for it?
[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.180]   - 12 years ago, 392.
[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.100]   - Great, nice.
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.100]   And do you have, are you married?
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.140]   Do you have children?
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:24.100]   - Yes, yeah, I have college-age children, and I'm married.
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.060]   - Could you, have you and your wife talked about
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.820]   changing houses at this point in time?
[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:30.860]   If you have college-age children,
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.500]   have you talked about changing, selling this house
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.740]   and going somewhere else?
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.380]   - A little bit, a little bit,
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.800]   but we're pretty connected to family and community.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.620]   So, we could move to a smaller house
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.620]   in the neighborhood still, but we love our house.
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.380]   And like I say, it's grown in value considerably
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.180]   over the last five years.
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.500]   - Okay, well, obviously, I don't think
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.100]   that what you're talking about here,
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.420]   you're thinking about some conservative moves,
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.180]   you're not trying to get every dollar out of it,
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.500]   you're trying to figure out what to do here.
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.660]   But let's talk through some of the options.
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.540]   The first thing is, to me, it seems like you've got
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.840]   an expensive house compared to your income.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.540]   And just to clarify, your income is 120,
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.640]   is your household income higher than that?
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.000]   - A little bit.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.600]   My wife works some, she has her own business,
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.880]   but that income's very uneven,
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.240]   and not a lot when it is on.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.160]   - So, it just feels like kind of an expensive house
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.320]   for you to have with $120,000 income
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.640]   and with a little under $200,000 in retirement assets.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.560]   I think that ratio is a little bit out of whack.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.120]   It might be, and it might have been, the best solution.
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.680]   There are some times, especially with children,
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.000]   with young children, where we make a decision
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.360]   that's a lifestyle decision,
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.720]   even if it's not the optimal financial decision.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.200]   I think it makes a lot of sense for parents
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.620]   to spend and have a nicer house, a bigger house,
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.120]   when their children are younger,
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.920]   because they'll use the house.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.160]   And so, in a situation like mine, I work from home,
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.480]   my wife works from home, where children are at home,
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.280]   we homeschool, and so I would be happy to give advice
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.000]   to someone like me and say, you should have a nicer house
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.400]   than maybe somebody who doesn't spend much time
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.560]   in their house.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.040]   But, at the end of the day, the house is still
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.760]   not primarily a moneymaker.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.080]   It's primarily a consumption item.
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.120]   And so, you want your ratios to be better
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.000]   to where the amount of money that you spend on house
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.780]   is not so much compared to the amount of money
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:47.760]   that's in investments.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.680]   Now, that's what you're trying to do
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.120]   by considering taking out a home equity line of credit.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.200]   And I'm not 100% opposed to it,
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.760]   but I wanna point out that you could do it
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.040]   in a couple ways.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:01.000]   So, you should first consider the actual lifestyle
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.480]   of what you need where you live there in Texas right now.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.800]   In most parts of Texas, a $650,000 house
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.280]   is a very nice house.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.160]   And that may have been a perfect situation
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.900]   when you had teenagers in the home,
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.880]   when you could really use the house as a social center.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.120]   For me, this is important.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.840]   I want my house to be a house
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.280]   that with my children's friends is used.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.780]   I want our house to be a social hub.
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.200]   I want it to have the game room and the pool
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.160]   and the things that make it an attractive place
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.680]   for my children's friends to hang out
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.300]   so that I can be involved in that part of their life.
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.000]   I don't want them going away to the fancy house
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.560]   three miles over all the time instead of us,
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.440]   because they're ashamed that we live in some shack
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.880]   where they don't have room to entertain their friends.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.560]   But if your children are college age,
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.840]   that might be changing.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:50.000]   Not saying do anything drastic, but reconsider it.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Because a couple things line up here
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.640]   to make my instinct go
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.340]   that the first idea might be to sell the house.
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.940]   Number one, you got a lot of gain.
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.560]   Let's say you bought it for 400 and it's worth 650.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.320]   If you could sell it for 650,
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.260]   I'm ignoring here sales expenses,
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.200]   you could clear $250,000 tax-free,
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.940]   assuming that you qualify for the exclusion of capital gain
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.160]   for a personal residence.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.560]   That would be great.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.320]   Because if you could sell it and get some tax-free gain,
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.560]   now you could go ahead and invest that money
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:25.160]   into the market or any other investment
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.160]   that you wanted to invest it into,
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.600]   and you're not paying any kind of interest payment on it.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.800]   You would clear it tax-free,
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.320]   you can go and invest the money,
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.320]   go ahead and put that $250,000
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.880]   into other investment assets.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.440]   Could be fine if it's in stocks,
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.880]   could be fine if it's in your own business,
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.960]   could be fine if it's in a rental house,
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.200]   something like that.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.320]   You could also possibly just go ahead
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.660]   and streamline your house.
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.560]   You probably a little bit young
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.640]   to really be looking for that,
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.880]   but I know that when watching my parents,
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.640]   when my parents sold their big house
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.160]   at a big five bedroom house,
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.280]   I think six bedrooms, something like that,
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.920]   big old house that they built for us to live in.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.880]   But then once their parents died
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.760]   and once my siblings and I generally all moved out,
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.200]   then moving into a condo for them was a wonderful solution.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.600]   It really brought a better lifestyle to them.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.040]   And so talk about those lifestyle considerations
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:15.980]   with your wife and see,
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.880]   because it can work out financially
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.600]   in your best interest as well.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.120]   You could do this same thing
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.280]   and do it more efficiently if you did that.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.740]   So if you sold the house,
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.120]   and let's say you bought something for 300,000,
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.560]   put down a minimal down payment, 10 or 20% down payment,
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.440]   just fine instead of the traditional mortgage,
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:39.220]   then you could go ahead and invest the money
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.840]   and have a safer position all the way through.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.280]   So my instinct is that if you and your wife
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.120]   were willing to move,
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.560]   that that would probably be a better financial move.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.200]   I'm not--
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.040]   - I think-- - Go ahead.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.920]   - I think our expenses related to the house
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:59.260]   are really more like a $400,000 house.
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:04.880]   And so mortgage and that kind of stuff,
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.200]   except for account of property taxes,
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.260]   but that's a fairly minor piece of it.
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:16.260]   So I get it,
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.460]   doing it without debt,
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.660]   and I'm not crazy about the debt,
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.540]   but you've opened up a new world for me
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.420]   to consider that type of thing
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.020]   as far as kind of a equity stripping kind of thing
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.900]   to have investment capital.
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.200]   And so I'd like to hear kind of more on the investment side.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.040]   - Okay.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.780]   So let me pivot there,
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:37.620]   but before I do,
[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.260]   I wanna talk about equity stripping for a moment.
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.980]   The key thing here that stands out to me
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.100]   is that you live in the state of Texas.
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.420]   So I'm a lot less enthusiastic about equity stripping
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.620]   for somebody who lives in Texas or who lives in Florida,
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.520]   where you have good homestead exemption laws
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.120]   as compared to equity stripping
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.340]   for somebody who lives in Georgia.
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.460]   I don't think, and again,
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.340]   there's always value in having a paid off house,
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.340]   especially at a younger phase of life,
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.780]   but I don't get real excited about a guy in Georgia
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.620]   having a $650,000 paid off house.
[00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.080]   But in Texas, you have to bring into that,
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.380]   the fact that, hey, this equity that's in my house
[00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.580]   is protected by favorable creditor laws.
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.480]   And so for a Texas resident or a Florida resident
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.340]   or another state that has favorable homestead exemption laws,
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.180]   I'm more excited now about having the home equity,
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.900]   which doesn't make it an immediate slam dunk for me to say,
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:32.060]   strip all the equity out and do something else with it.
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:33.440]   But if you did wanna do it,
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:37.340]   I would say what you need is you need a very compelling story
[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.540]   of how you're going to invest the money more effectively.
[00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:44.140]   I'm not, depending on the interest rate of,
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:47.340]   depending on the interest rate of the house
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.500]   and depending on what you're invested in,
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:54.140]   I think in theory, it can work for people
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.660]   to invest in stocks versus paying,
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:57.500]   putting down a mortgage.
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.400]   So the argument goes like this.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.080]   If a financial advisor is giving advice to somebody
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.000]   who says, I have an extra $2,000 per month,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.800]   should I put the money into the stock market
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.980]   or should I pay extra on a mortgage?
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.420]   The numerically correct answer,
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:16.420]   given our past experience over the last 80 years or whatever
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.880]   is going to be that you'll come out ahead
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.820]   by putting the money into the stock market
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.940]   versus paying off the mortgage early.
[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.980]   So that's generally the best answer.
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:28.220]   Mathematically, whatever returns a higher investment
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.100]   is mathematically superior.
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.420]   So if you're borrowing money on a mortgage at 3%,
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.500]   and you're investing it at say,
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.040]   7% net of taxes and fees and expenses on an investment,
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.940]   you're going to come out ahead by investing the money.
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.620]   And that applies whether you have extra money
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.060]   and you are trying to,
[00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:50.420]   should I pay extra on the mortgage
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.860]   or should I put money in the stock market?
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:53.040]   It applies there.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.280]   And mathematically, it's no different
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.220]   if you're trying to say about,
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.720]   should I borrow the money out of my house
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.020]   and go ahead and put the money into the stock market?
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.700]   Mathematically, it's the same.
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.980]   Now psychologically, it can be a little bit different.
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.100]   You always hear, Dave Ramsey, for example,
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.020]   if somebody calls into his show and says,
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.940]   Dave, should I borrow money?
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.700]   Should I put my extra money in the stock market
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:18.620]   and put money in the mortgage?
[00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:19.660]   He'll always flip it,
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:20.940]   which I think is a valuable question.
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.940]   He'll say, if you had a paid off house,
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.420]   would you borrow money on it to put it in the market?
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:29.420]   And often, the answer to his question is often no,
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.440]   because we sense some kind of psychological certainty
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.980]   of having a paid off house.
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:39.080]   And I think that's valid and we should consider that.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.840]   I personally would be slow to do what you're proposing.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.840]   I would be slow to put this into a mainstream investment,
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:52.200]   stock investment, especially one,
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.440]   I would be slow to do that.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.020]   I would be quick to do it into real estate
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.840]   where I had a higher potential rate of return
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:59.880]   for my involvement,
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.700]   and I would be quick to do it into a business,
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.700]   but I would be slow to do it into stocks.
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.080]   But I think that--
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.940]   - I can tell you about the stocks.
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:13.360]   A normal kind of index fund or something,
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.400]   I would absolutely agree with you.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:20.400]   But I've had my money with some guys
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.580]   for the last nine months or so,
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.760]   and I've tracked their results and stuff
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.160]   for a lot longer than that,
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:31.160]   who are much more actively managing things than that,
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:36.440]   and have been getting 30, 40% annual returns
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:45.000]   for the last couple of years.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.160]   - Last couple of years or last nine months?
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.760]   - Well, they've certainly had it in the last nine months,
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:56.760]   and they beat the market before that,
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:02.040]   and avoided most of the big down bear markets.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:07.480]   So I feel like that opportunity
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:11.640]   is largely what's motivating this,
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.680]   because otherwise I wouldn't know exactly
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.200]   where to put the money right now.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.600]   - Are they with a local financial advisory firm
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.560]   there in your area?
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.640]   - Yes.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.340]   - What are their minimums for you to bring money to them?
[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:27.000]   - 50,000.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.440]   - Okay.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.280]   I'm very skeptical.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.440]   And what I'll tell you is that I can't answer,
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.000]   this is a question I think where you need to
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.360]   sit down with someone, either privately
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.040]   and go through more details,
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.460]   and kind of really look hard at this.
[00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.000]   And I think that this would be good
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.240]   probably to engage somebody in your area locally,
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.900]   who can help you with your scrutiny
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.160]   and with your due diligence.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.360]   So let me just kind of see what I say,
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.040]   and I'll point out some of the red flags,
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.440]   and then you can consider what's best to do.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:00.680]   So to reiterate, I'm not opposed to taking money
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.400]   from a home equity and investing it into something
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:08.400]   that has a higher chance of return.
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.120]   I don't love the idea of adding more debt on like this,
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.080]   and I think that you own too much house.
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.360]   If you want to build wealth,
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.900]   I don't think that you should start
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:21.280]   by putting on more debt onto the house.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.320]   I think you should start by saying,
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.240]   could we buy another house in the neighborhood,
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.920]   you know, one that's $400,000 instead of 650,
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.480]   and go ahead and take our tax-free gain.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.920]   Now, that's obviously a personal decision
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.580]   that you and your wife would need to think about,
[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:37.840]   whether that fits your lifestyle.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.120]   And I'm not saying you have to, right?
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.000]   You're not broke, you don't have to do it.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.600]   But I think that that would be my preferred solution
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.780]   to go ahead, harvest some of that tax-free gain,
[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.440]   downsize the house, buy a smaller house,
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.360]   perhaps one that you can force some more appreciation into,
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.880]   and live, kind of go ahead and downsize to a simpler one,
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.520]   and free up the cash.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.080]   I think you have too much house
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.280]   if you really want to build wealth
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.840]   compared to your income and your assets
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.320]   at this stage of life.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.520]   Now, if you proceed forward with this plan,
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.000]   I don't think it's completely wrong.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.600]   I'm skeptical of these guys.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.000]   Nine months is not impressive to me.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.240]   Almost every year,
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.400]   lots of people beat the market every single year.
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.840]   A local firm is not particularly impressive to me.
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.120]   I believe personally,
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.680]   I am not a strong, efficient market hypothesis aficionado.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.000]   I believe that there are people
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.700]   who beat the market consistently over time.
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.280]   The problem is that most,
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.020]   I've never found someone who's gonna be open to somebody
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.400]   with a $50,000 investment to do that.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.920]   Is it possible that they're out there?
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.700]   Is it a new firm where they have
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.480]   a really smart financial advisor
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.560]   and they are able to do it?
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.560]   It's possible, right?
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.400]   I don't like it when people make blanket statements.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.880]   It's possible that these are some smart guys
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.000]   who've got a good strategy
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.840]   and they're just getting started, et cetera,
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.600]   and you may be able to get in today with $50,000,
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.160]   whereas their minimums,
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.440]   three years from now are gonna be a million bucks.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.180]   I'm deeply skeptical though,
[00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:05.960]   because almost anybody can beat a market over nine months.
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.740]   The stock market has been up for the last nine months.
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.920]   How much they beat it by, I don't know, right?
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.920]   Every strategy works cyclically.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.480]   So I've spent too much of my career
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.640]   sitting down and showing people charts
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.400]   about why a diversified portfolio is the solution
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.960]   because it, a diversified portfolio is a solution
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.400]   because look, this wins this year,
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.280]   this market, this segment wins this year, et cetera.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.860]   And so I'm not impressed with nine months,
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:32.440]   no matter what the returns are,
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.560]   and I'm not impressed with guys
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.040]   that have a $50,000 minimum,
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.000]   and yet you're convinced
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.480]   that they're gonna beat the market.
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.720]   So what I'd say is go slow,
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.640]   and I think you need to engage somebody local
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.080]   who can go through all the numbers
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.080]   and take some more time to think about
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.560]   kind of the full situation
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.300]   before you make this particular decision.
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.140]   Fair enough?
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.800]   - Yep. - All right, cool.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.520]   Keep me in the loop though as things develop.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.200]   I'd love to hear more from you.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.480]   All right, we'll move on to,
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.400]   looks like it's gonna be Chris in California.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.240]   Chris, welcome to the show.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.600]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:07.200]   - Hi, Joshua, thank you so much for taking my call.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.480]   So kind of in the spirit of your show,
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.320]   I have two questions about, I guess,
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.400]   sort of getting my data right.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:19.280]   The first one is, so based on a personal experience,
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.880]   I'm starting a dental facilitator service
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.840]   for a holistic dental group in Costa Rica,
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.360]   and I was just curious if you had any thoughts,
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.280]   maybe sort of starting that,
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.640]   if there's any, I don't know, tax sort of snags
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.880]   that I'm not, maybe should be aware of going into it,
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.720]   or just wanted to get your general thought on the idea.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.560]   - You're living in the United States?
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.240]   - I am.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:47.120]   - And you are seeking to establish, basically,
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:51.040]   a marketing operation to encourage dental tourism
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.640]   to Costa Rica, is that right?
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.920]   - Yes.
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.000]   - So you've worked out, you found some local dentists
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.120]   in Costa Rica that you think you can refer business to,
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:03.240]   you'll market it to US Americans primarily,
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.880]   and you'll say, look, if you'll get on an airplane
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.000]   and fly to Costa Rica, you'll be able to get
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.760]   your dental services, very high quality
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.800]   at a third of the price, plus a vacation
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.900]   to Costa Rica to boot, is that right?
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:17.760]   - You got it, yeah, and it's with this one particular
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.360]   dental group that I actually went
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.560]   and experienced personally, I had a, yeah.
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.240]   - Great, great, okay, so from a tax perspective,
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.320]   if you are living in the United States,
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.040]   there is no way for you to reduce your taxes
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.600]   on this type of operation.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.440]   For the extent that you are living
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:38.320]   in the United States yourself, you won't be able
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.400]   to do this in a tax-efficient way.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.960]   You're going to be taxed just like any other business,
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.960]   and the fact that you have a referral relationship
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.600]   to send people to Costa Rica isn't going to help.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.520]   Now, if you are willing to move from the United States,
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.280]   and possibly even move to Costa Rica,
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.380]   then yes, you can do this business
[00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:00.880]   in a more tax-favorable way, but that's gonna be
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.560]   a lifestyle decision as to whether
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.600]   you're willing to move or not.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.040]   - Okay, got it.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.280]   Okay, I do think it's a good idea.
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:16.120]   Costa Rica is, it's a disaster of a country economically,
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:20.680]   with the exception of it's a great place
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.560]   for tourists to go, they got a great tourist infrastructure,
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:26.560]   and it is a good place for medical tourism,
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.900]   and so I think that in the coming years,
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.480]   you'll see more and more medical tourism.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.200]   Costa Rica basically destroyed the medical tourist
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.480]   marketplace for six months, they totally closed
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.920]   their borders for, I don't know, months,
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.040]   almost six months in the pandemic.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:46.000]   But I think that their borders are open now,
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.180]   they don't require COVID tests for people to come in,
[00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:49.520]   I've been thinking about setting up an event
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.600]   there in Costa Rica in the coming weeks myself,
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.320]   because of that, although now the United States
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.560]   requires people to come back in.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.440]   Prices are good, and I think it can work out really well.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.320]   There are lots of dentists, lots of very trained dentists,
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.440]   and I think it's a good solution for that.
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.720]   I also think you should, and since you have
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.680]   personal relationships there, I think that's good.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.720]   I think you should also look at Mexico as well.
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.660]   I think that Costa Rica can work well
[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.840]   for certain types of medical tourism,
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.400]   for example, dental tourism, I think there's also
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.980]   a good argument to be made in favor of things
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.760]   like laser vision correction surgery to Costa Rica,
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.800]   there are a number of hospitals there that do that.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.400]   I think that can be a feature.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.840]   But on the whole, I don't think it has quite the depth
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.000]   that a market like Mexico has.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   And so, one of the business ideas that I've personally
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.160]   toyed with is setting up a medical tourism company
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.000]   into Mexico, because I think that Mexico is easier
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.560]   for people to get to in the United States.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.320]   I think they have a much deeper bench
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.880]   of physicians and whatnot, and so I think it's also
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.120]   a good option for you to consider.
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:55.000]   I have known people who have done medical tourism companies,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.040]   and I think it can be very profitable,
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.360]   so I think it's a great thing for you to pursue.
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:02.360]   And a referral relationship, where you act as a go-between
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.120]   and you charge a commission, can be a very low cost
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.600]   and high profit business, so I'm totally in favor of it.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.720]   Just tell you that you're not gonna save any money on tax,
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.640]   doing it from the United States.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.800]   And I wouldn't necessarily move to Costa Rica,
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.440]   because you won't save anything in tax
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.800]   if you move to Costa Rica.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.800]   So you could run it tax efficiently
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.240]   if you were willing to move, but not to Costa Rica
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.420]   in this particular context.
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:27.520]   - Okay, cool, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:28.680]   Thank you so much.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:29.760]   One more quick question.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:33.440]   So listening to your show the other day,
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.080]   it was like I had a moment of going,
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.520]   oh no, am I making the right choice?
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.800]   I'm about halfway through, I'm about 70%
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.840]   through my coursework for the CFP,
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.520]   and I was hoping that this is not a dying industry.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:51.760]   I guess my question is, do you still feel
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.060]   that the CFP is a worthy pursuit?
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:57.040]   - You know, I've struggled with that question
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.920]   so much over the years.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.200]   I have a CFP designation, I maintain it,
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.520]   I let it lapse for about a year and a half,
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.720]   'cause I didn't keep up my CE,
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:09.960]   but last year I went back and caught up my CE credits,
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.720]   my continuing education credits, and reinstated my CFP.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:16.120]   I don't know, I honestly don't know.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.760]   The financial, so the financial,
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.700]   let's talk, I'll walk it through with you.
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.080]   So first of all, the financial advisory business
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:26.120]   is a business that has been under significant pressure.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.200]   As I think about the history,
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.320]   going back over time, we have had,
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.600]   so if you go back to, let's say, the '80s, right?
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.800]   When you said financial advisor,
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.800]   people thought stockbroker.
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.200]   Well, what happened to stockbrokers?
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:44.840]   Basically, stockbrokers largely disappeared.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:48.360]   You had people come in, and instead of being a stockbroker,
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.560]   you had the low-commission trades
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.120]   and no-commission trades come in.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.000]   Then you had the move towards mutual funds.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.440]   You had a massive growth in the mutual fund industry.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.280]   So financial advisors made a lot of money
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.520]   selling mutual funds.
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:04.040]   When I started in 2004, I didn't sell a lot,
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:09.040]   but I still sold some commissionable mutual funds,
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.000]   Class A mutual fund shares.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.040]   And there are people out there who do sell that,
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.480]   and I'm not current on all the industry figures,
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.200]   but I would say for the most part,
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.120]   selling commissioned mutual funds has basically disappeared
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.000]   in favor of no-load funds.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.920]   You had the incredible transformation of the industry
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.800]   with Jack Bogle and Vanguard,
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.520]   where everything moved from,
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.600]   if you look at the asset flows
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.000]   that used to flow into active management
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.960]   that now goes into passive management,
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.160]   it's absolutely turned upside down.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.720]   Vanguard has completely won the day
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.840]   to the point where now it's basically considered,
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:50.760]   it's almost a form of dogma, financial planning dogma,
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.120]   that if you suggest anything
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.800]   other than passive index fund investing,
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.400]   you just don't do it.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:01.400]   You look at some of the vocal commentators,
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.840]   you look at Dave Ramsey and his influence
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:07.240]   on term insurance versus whole life insurance,
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.160]   very, very effective.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.800]   Al Williams and his story and everyone else.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.800]   So there's been a massive move towards term life insurance
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:18.440]   and passive index fund investing.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.960]   So what have financial advisors done in response to this?
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.520]   Well, I would say they've adjusted in a few different ways.
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.600]   So most of the wire houses and whatnot,
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.160]   they move towards saying,
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.720]   okay, we're gonna charge management fees,
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:35.160]   that way we can still get our money
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:40.160]   and we can go ahead and yet still engage
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.040]   in whatever our investment strategy is.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.880]   You've seen some bifurcation
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.240]   with the investment marketplaces.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:50.040]   There are still people who market themselves
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.320]   as investment experts,
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.000]   but it seems like a lot of those people
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.720]   have moved into the hedge fund space
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.240]   and to work with accredited investors
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.200]   instead of with retail investors.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.760]   So for example, the previous caller,
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.080]   that kind of situation is pretty rare.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.920]   I very rarely hear of someone who says,
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.320]   look, we can beat the market
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:09.400]   and look, here's our results and test us
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.960]   and we'll take a $50,000 account.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:14.360]   I mean, I very rarely hear about that kind of thing.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.720]   Meanwhile, in the financial advisory space,
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.640]   there are still people who have,
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.120]   there's still people who work with insurance companies.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.640]   There are the New York Life, the Northwestern Mutuals,
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.160]   the Guardian, the Mass Mutual, et cetera,
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.520]   and have an insurance practice
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.800]   and some cases an investment practice.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:30.960]   You still have plenty of people
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.600]   that work with the large firms,
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:37.000]   doing charging fees on investment management.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.840]   But then you have this bifurcation
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:42.760]   into the financial planning world for a fee.
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:47.760]   So you've got kind of the Garrett Planning Network guys,
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:51.880]   who charge us an hourly fee for financial planning.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.800]   You've got the XYPN Network, right?
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.920]   More only targeting younger advisors and younger clients
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.280]   who they try to go with monthly retainer fees,
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.320]   primarily or flat fees.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.560]   But I think the fee pressure is down,
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.440]   down all over the board in financial planning.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.680]   So I'll tell you from my perspective,
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:14.720]   I like what I do because it gives me a one to many business.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:19.360]   I would not choose myself to go into financial planning
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.560]   for an hourly fee.
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.480]   I think it's a very low paid profession.
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.640]   And even if your hourly fees are,
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:28.160]   my hourly fee right now for consulting is 400 bucks an hour,
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.160]   I'm gonna raise it to 500 before the end of the year.
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:35.280]   But even still, it's so much even there,
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.880]   and I don't even provide a lot of deliverables with that,
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.600]   it's just straight phone consulting.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:43.960]   But the amount of, and to some people it sounds high, right?
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.760]   But the amount of work you have to go through
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.120]   to get enough clients to fill your schedule,
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.840]   doing hourly fees, it's just,
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.400]   it's not a business that excites me.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.020]   So I wouldn't pursue that option
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:56.120]   in the financial planning business right now.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.000]   I would personally go back
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.920]   into the insurance side of the business.
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.440]   I really like insurance.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.440]   And I think that when done properly,
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.320]   insurance solves so many problems
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:10.320]   that it makes it really, really a good solution.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:14.960]   But there continues to be a very significant
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:19.960]   kind of undercurrent of people who don't do insurance.
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:23.760]   Very rarely would I talk to a group of CFP students
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.680]   at the University of Texas or whatever,
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.640]   where they're getting a degree in financial planning,
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.580]   and many of them are just not that excited
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.120]   about going into the insurance business.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.020]   And I understand that, right?
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.480]   When I went into the insurance business at 23,
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.880]   all I could think about was how quickly
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.920]   I could get out of it.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.080]   Well today at 35, I would go into insurance,
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.520]   and I could happily just work in insurance
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.040]   the rest of my life and feel happy about it
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.080]   because the business model works.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.840]   If you go and work as a fee-only planner,
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.700]   you walk away from insurance commissions,
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.360]   which I think is a business mistake,
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.480]   a major business mistake.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:57.100]   So I guess for me, if I were to go back into it,
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:01.000]   there are three options that I personally would pursue.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.520]   Number one is I could go back and have a hybrid model
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:08.760]   of insurance and investment management.
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.360]   I personally think that's the sweet spot
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.680]   as long as you can get a good enough solution
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.360]   where you can provide good solutions
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.740]   in both of those areas.
[00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:19.440]   But I think that insurance and investment
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:23.320]   fit together so perfectly that it's just a mistake
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:25.760]   to do only one of the two.
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:29.080]   The second place is I would go and work
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.620]   in a single-family office or a multifamily office,
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:35.360]   and just go straight to the high end of the market.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.440]   That's where I would personally enjoy working
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:41.300]   because if you have the credentials and the skills,
[00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.040]   then you can walk away from the pressure
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:48.040]   of the things that annoy you of working with low-end clients.
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:50.800]   That's kind of the second thing.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.080]   And then the third thing is I do think there are options
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.480]   in the financial education space,
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:58.520]   but I would focus less on the CFP stuff
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.040]   and more on the making money space.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.160]   The CFP curriculum has become
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:06.280]   basically a technical consultancy.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:11.280]   And it's becoming more of kind of the accountant
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:16.520]   advice industry versus the make money industry.
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:20.200]   And I appreciate good accounting advice, right?
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.280]   That's fine.
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:25.080]   But as an accountant, you're never going to make a fortune
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:28.360]   as an accountant unless you build a large firm.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.240]   There's nothing wrong with working as an accountant.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.840]   It can be a perfectly reasonable career.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:36.800]   You can make a fair income and you can make a fair income.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:37.800]   You can serve your clients
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.000]   and it's a very agreeable type of work,
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.620]   better than many other kinds of work.
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:44.420]   I could do accounting, but I wouldn't go after it
[00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:47.760]   with a sense of this is an aggressive growth model
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:48.880]   because the numbers aren't there.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.560]   And I think that kind of the financial planner world
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.640]   has largely gone in that direction.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.260]   The CFP world is largely that.
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.800]   It's a technical specialty.
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.520]   You need to understand a generalized knowledge
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:04.440]   of insurance, estate, tax, investments, et cetera,
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.640]   but it's extremely generalized and commoditized.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:11.360]   And so in that world of generalized commoditized work,
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.440]   it's hard to stand out.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:17.380]   So I would say that being a certified financial planner
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:18.920]   as a step one would be analogous
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.960]   to being a family medicine doctor.
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.160]   Is it a good career?
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.000]   Of course it's a good career.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:25.840]   Can you make money?
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.600]   Yeah, you can be highly paid.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:31.160]   But being a family medicine doctor,
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.820]   your income is going to be very, very different
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:36.320]   than if you're a pediatric anesthesiologist.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:41.120]   There's a 4X return of being a pediatric anesthesiologist.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.800]   And so for me, that would be what I would say
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.640]   is that just getting a CFP designation
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:48.800]   and working as a generalized financial planner
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:52.120]   can be a very agreeable, perfectly adequate
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:55.000]   professional compensation where you can make a good living
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.600]   in a very agreeable way.
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.880]   But it's not a specialty that's going to make you
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.120]   really rich in a really short period of time.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:04.640]   - Great, that's great.
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.280]   And thank you so much.
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.680]   And sort of last thought is,
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:10.800]   I'm working, I would be a career changer.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.520]   I work as a creative director right now.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:13.720]   So this is really helpful.
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.680]   I really appreciate all your wisdom on that.
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:16.560]   Thank you. - My pleasure.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.960]   I think you just gotta find a spot
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.160]   that you're comfortable with and that you feel fits you.
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:24.160]   And if you can find that spot that it fits you,
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.940]   then I think it's a great career.
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:30.200]   I like it and it's a really good way, again,
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.720]   to serve people and to help people.
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:34.440]   My only frustration, I'll share my biggest frustration
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:38.200]   with you for you to consider, is just simply this.
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:41.400]   I thought when I got into financial planning,
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.800]   I thought that I was gonna help people get rich.
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:47.280]   And what I discovered is that I couldn't
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.780]   really do it very well.
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:53.200]   And I realized that as a financial planner,
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.880]   what I was doing was giving some
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.880]   technically proficient answers that would
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.640]   help people optimize a few things.
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.280]   And so for me, my desire has always been
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.480]   to help people get rich.
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:07.000]   And so today, if I were making that same choice again,
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.720]   and I'm actually moving in this direction
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:11.260]   just to my own attention, I care much more
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:13.800]   about teaching people how to 10x their income
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.600]   than I care about teaching them how to remove
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.440]   10 basis points from their portfolio expenses.
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:23.440]   I find the portfolio expense and the tiny tax optimization,
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:28.800]   I find that stuff extraordinarily boring and non-meaningful.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.960]   Whereas I find the 10x stuff, right?
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:34.600]   Here's how you 10x your income with entrepreneurship.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.880]   Here's how you 10x your lifestyle with a remote business.
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:41.460]   Here's how you cut your taxes to zero by going offshore.
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:44.640]   To me, those big wins make me so excited
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:49.480]   about seeing people how they can get progress fast,
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.520]   that that's where I wanna spend my time.
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.280]   So I would rather, if I were making a career change
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:57.960]   right now, again, if I needed money fast
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:01.400]   and I wanted to make $150,000, $200,000, $250,000 a year,
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:02.880]   and I needed to do that for five years
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.200]   to stabilize my family, I would go be a financial planner.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.480]   Now, I have the experience, so I know I could do it quickly.
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:11.000]   You might take you some more time to retrain for that.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.940]   But if I wanted to make an impact,
[00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:16.200]   I would much rather go work for Russell Brunson
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:19.320]   than I would go and be a financial planner
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.320]   because I believe that a guy like him,
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:24.400]   at the end of his life, he's gonna be,
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.880]   I mean, the amount of money that he's gonna help people make
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.820]   is gonna be absolutely staggering.
[00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:34.820]   Tai Lopez is gonna have a much bigger credential
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:36.920]   at the end of his life with the amount of money,
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.960]   the amount of people that he's helped to build wealth,
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:42.780]   become wealthy than any financial planner I've ever met.
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:44.740]   So is it a good career?
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:47.140]   Yeah, I've known a lot of guys who made a fortune
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.440]   as an estate planner, et cetera.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.480]   But for me, the excitement is always on the big wins,
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.160]   not on the minor optimization.
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.800]   And I just see that as the,
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.720]   that's one of the big downfalls
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.640]   of many of the modern financial planners,
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.120]   including the CFP curriculum.
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:04.120]   It's just, it's mostly focused on minor things.
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:07.500]   I've never heard a CFP, here's my final comment.
[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:11.840]   I've never heard an accountant or a CFP
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:16.080]   talk to their client about leaving a high-tax jurisdiction
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.180]   and moving to a low-tax jurisdiction.
[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:20.040]   And yet that in and of itself
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.200]   could be the single most valuable idea
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.760]   that you ever give somebody.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.920]   I'm doing a show, I meant to do it yesterday,
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.520]   I'll do it, it'll probably be out on Monday.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.360]   But the next show I'm gonna do
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.880]   is talk about the magic of the doubling penny, right?
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.040]   You can start with a doubling penny,
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.680]   and you can say, and you can,
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.720]   if you start with one cent
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.840]   and you double it every day for 31 days,
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.600]   you wind up with $10.3 million, I think,
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.140]   at the end of 31 days.
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:48.280]   If you cut that doubling with a 30% tax rate,
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:52.480]   then you all of a sudden put yourself in a situation
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.960]   where that, I can't remember the number,
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.300]   I did it with like 35% tax rate, 30%,
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.480]   it comes down to a few thousands of dollars,
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.160]   and in some cases, literally $25
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:02.660]   with tax rates that we pay.
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:06.560]   Now, that's just pointing out the power of tax.
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:09.340]   And so for me, wanting to help people get those big wins,
[00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:11.400]   before I would go back and be a financial planner,
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:12.920]   I would go set up an offshore firm
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.800]   and teach people how to leave high tax jurisdictions
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.620]   like California or like the United States
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:19.520]   or like Germany, because in today's world,
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:21.240]   that's where the exciting stuff is.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.880]   Or I would go to where they can 10X their returns
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.920]   and help people make money with better marketing, et cetera,
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:29.220]   because to me, that's the stuff that's exciting enough
[00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.060]   to keep me going.
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:31.800]   So best of luck to you.
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:32.800]   John in Florida, welcome to the show.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.360]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:41.720]   John in Florida, you're up.
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.480]   I gotcha, yep.
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:46.800]   I wanted to talk cryptocurrency.
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:50.300]   I need a sanity check.
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:56.720]   I've been in the space for a long time,
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:01.720]   and I've got a fairly well-rounded portfolio
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:06.400]   of many different currencies.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:10.680]   The total currently of that portfolio
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:15.680]   is about 600,000 in US dollars.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:26.920]   I've ridden multiple run-ups.
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:30.120]   So I was actually in on that very first run-up
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:35.120]   to $1,000 back, and then I rode it all the way down to 200.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.600]   And then I rode it up again to 20.
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:41.280]   And I was shocked and amazed that I had,
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:46.640]   my portfolio had grown to $200,000
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:51.640]   at the top of that 20,000 run, but I didn't do anything.
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:56.120]   And then I watched it run all the way down to about 50.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:01.120]   And now I'm at the position where it feels like
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:09.260]   a similar type of feeling as that.
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:14.260]   Like, whoa, at the high, my portfolio was pushing 800K
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:19.340]   just earlier this month.
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:23.020]   And it's come back down to 600, right?
[00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:28.020]   So I don't wanna sell, 'cause I don't,
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:31.780]   I mean, I don't need the money.
[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:37.860]   And I don't have a plan for it per se.
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:42.100]   Like, if I turn this into cash,
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:45.860]   it's just gonna sit in the bank and decrease in value
[00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:49.100]   with the flood of new printing.
[00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:54.900]   So I don't know, I just wanted to hear your perspective
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:59.900]   on, I know it's not a crystal ball or whatever,
[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:04.700]   going to a million a coin or 10 million a coin, whatever.
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:09.700]   But is there something that you can say about
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:17.940]   taking money out along the way?
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:24.700]   Like, I would estimate my total investment
[00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:29.060]   in US dollars that I'd put in probably over the whole time
[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.340]   is somewhere around 100,000.
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:35.300]   Just in purchases.
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.380]   - I understand the question.
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:37.300]   Let's talk it through.
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.620]   So we're gonna talk it through on two levels.
[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:41.660]   I'm gonna begin with what's most impactful,
[00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:43.460]   and then we'll talk about crypto.
[00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:46.820]   The most impactful is always personal financial planning.
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:49.900]   In my opinion, what I fall back on
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:52.260]   is always personal financial planning.
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:54.100]   And I'll elaborate what I mean by that
[00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:55.820]   so that you understand.
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:43:00.820]   Because to me, this is the one thing that I can control.
[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:04.460]   I have no idea what the price of Bitcoin is 12 months
[00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:07.820]   or 12 years from now, and neither do you.
[00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:09.780]   We have our hunches, we have our ideas,
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:12.020]   you have your beliefs, you have your perspectives.
[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.620]   But at the end of the day, we have no idea.
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:16.820]   12 years ago, Bitcoin didn't exist.
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.260]   12 years from now, will Bitcoin exist?
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:22.020]   Well, to the extent that something digital
[00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:25.340]   and intangible exists, yes.
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:27.700]   But what will be the impact on society?
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:28.520]   We don't know.
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:31.320]   So we have some ideas, we'll talk about those in a moment.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.640]   But what can you know?
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.940]   You can go back to your life, and you can always say,
[00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:37.760]   well, what should I do right now in my life?
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:41.980]   And with regard to the risk factor,
[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:45.980]   you can put in place the things that make you feel good.
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:48.800]   And so what I do is I go back to financial planning.
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.660]   I say, where am I right now?
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:53.420]   So first, how old are you?
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:54.260]   Are you married?
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:55.260]   Do you have children?
[00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:59.900]   - Yeah, I'll be turning 40 this year,
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:04.420]   married with four children under 11.
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:05.340]   - Okay.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:08.740]   If your $600,000 disappeared today,
[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:10.660]   all of your cryptocurrency disappeared today,
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:12.900]   pretend that the United Nations came out
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:16.460]   and all 193 member nations of the United States,
[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:18.300]   sorry, out of the United Nations says,
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.380]   not only are we banning Bitcoin,
[00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:22.420]   but we're banning any cryptocurrency,
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:24.740]   and you can never convert your cryptocurrency
[00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:27.920]   into a local fiat currency period whatsoever.
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.460]   That would of course impact massively
[00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:33.000]   the value of all crypto assets
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.100]   that are intending to be used as some form of currency.
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:40.420]   So your $600,000 could disappear overnight.
[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:42.800]   Let's say that happened, unlikely,
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.540]   but let's say that happened.
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:47.320]   In that situation, would your family be destitute?
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:48.940]   Would your children be on the street?
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:50.980]   Would your wife and children go hungry?
[00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:52.180]   Would your wife divorce you?
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:54.340]   How bad would that be for your situation?
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:58.820]   - It wouldn't affect my situation at all.
[00:44:58.820 --> 00:44:59.660]   - Okay.
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:01.420]   So to me, this is my answer,
[00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:04.240]   is if it wouldn't affect my situation at all,
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.940]   that means I've done good financial planning.
[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:09.860]   I've put myself in the best solution possible.
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:12.420]   I've protected myself on the downside.
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:15.820]   And so what I can do, what I can control is,
[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:18.020]   are my children gonna be put out on the street?
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:19.620]   Are we gonna run out of food?
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:21.540]   Do we have some other assets?
[00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:25.060]   So if I were a young, if I were a single guy, for example,
[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:27.600]   and it were just me, and let's say that I had an income
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:31.060]   where I could work and earn $100,000 a year at a job,
[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:33.180]   I would be willing to take a risk
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:36.100]   on having 100% of my assets in cryptocurrency.
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:36.920]   Why?
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:39.100]   Well, because if my cryptocurrency disappears,
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:42.380]   I still have income and I'm gonna be okay.
[00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:44.940]   If I were a married guy with children
[00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:47.260]   and I had a good, robust home life,
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:48.780]   and I had a good source of income,
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:50.220]   and I had some other assets,
[00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:53.300]   then I would be willing to take a big risk on a hunch,
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:54.860]   right, on cryptocurrency.
[00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:56.620]   What I would not do myself
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:58.580]   is I would never put myself in a situation
[00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:01.020]   where if my cryptocurrency disappears in value,
[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:02.500]   my children go hungry.
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:04.500]   Or if my cryptocurrency disappears in value,
[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:05.940]   my wife divorces me.
[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:08.060]   Or if my cryptocurrency disappears in value,
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:10.080]   I'm left destitute living under a bridge.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:12.000]   Like, to me, that's unacceptable.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.500]   So as long as you're thinking about your downside,
[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:16.620]   then we're in a good shape.
[00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:18.860]   And you can make your hunch on what you think
[00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:21.820]   is the best for you.
[00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:24.460]   Now, I do think it makes sense to diversify.
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:26.780]   And so when you have a winning hand,
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:30.100]   I believe it makes sense to take some of those winnings
[00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:31.460]   and put them into something else
[00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:33.500]   because it protects you on the downside.
[00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:36.260]   The example that I usually use is with entrepreneurs.
[00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:37.500]   And I've been saying this for years.
[00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:38.420]   I must repeat it.
[00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:40.720]   I mean, I've been on the show dozens of times.
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:41.660]   I don't know.
[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:44.340]   But I always give this talk to entrepreneurs, okay?
[00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:47.900]   And these days, I work with a lot of entrepreneurs.
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:48.900]   When I was a financial advisor,
[00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:49.980]   I always worked with entrepreneurs
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:51.420]   because that's where the money is, right?
[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:53.060]   Entrepreneurs know how to make money.
[00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:55.040]   They know how to literally make money.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:57.140]   They take something that doesn't exist.
[00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:59.760]   They call it into existence with their vision,
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.420]   their words, and their actions.
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:03.580]   And then they literally create a money printing machine.
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:04.920]   It's the most incredible thing in the world.
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:05.760]   And it's all legal.
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.340]   That's entrepreneurship, okay?
[00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:08.580]   So you'll be with an entrepreneur.
[00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:10.180]   And let's say that you have an entrepreneur
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:12.580]   that has a wonderful, smooth business model.
[00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:14.380]   And they're looking at their business model.
[00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:16.460]   And they're saying, you know what I can do?
[00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:20.060]   Is I can take this business,
[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:22.340]   and for every dollar that I put into this business,
[00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:24.500]   it will print me $10 out.
[00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:26.460]   And so you might be sitting there with them,
[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:28.220]   talking to them about buying stocks
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:30.660]   in someone else's business, or buying gold coins,
[00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:32.020]   or buying cryptocurrency,
[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:34.100]   or buying a life insurance policy.
[00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:34.980]   And they always look at it,
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:36.660]   and in the back of their mind, they're saying,
[00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:39.420]   but if I put a dollar into my business, I get 10 out.
[00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:41.580]   I put a dollar into my business, I get 10 out.
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:43.400]   I put a dollar in my business, I get 10 out.
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:45.100]   Why would I ever do anything different?
[00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:47.460]   And so the example I use is gambling, right?
[00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:49.700]   So let's say, John, you and I, we get on a cruise ship,
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:51.900]   you know, we're with our families, we take a cruise,
[00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:53.580]   and we decide tonight, you know what?
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:55.220]   We're gonna go down to the casino.
[00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:57.700]   And, you know, we get babysitters for the children.
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.700]   We dress up in our fancy suits,
[00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:01.540]   and our wives put on their slinky dresses.
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:02.600]   And we say, all right,
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:03.780]   how much are we gonna gamble tonight?
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:05.260]   Let's say it's, I don't know if you're a big gambler,
[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:06.560]   but a thousand bucks, right?
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:08.220]   So you take a thousand bucks out in cash,
[00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:09.140]   you leave all your cards,
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:10.780]   and you say, here's a thousand bucks in cash.
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:12.020]   We're gonna go, and we're gonna gamble tonight
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:12.860]   with a thousand bucks.
[00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:14.140]   Lose a thousand bucks, big deal.
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:16.380]   It's the price I paid for an evening's entertainment.
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:18.580]   And so we go down, and we're playing, and we're playing,
[00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:19.500]   and we're doing well,
[00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:21.740]   and our thousand grows to a thousand, to 1,200,
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:23.180]   to 1,500, to 1,800.
[00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:25.380]   All of a sudden, we're up to two grand, okay?
[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:27.920]   Now, what does a smart man do when he's out gambling,
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:30.820]   and he's doubled his money from a thousand to 2,000 bucks?
[00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:34.260]   - He will take cash out and walk away.
[00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:35.940]   - Cash out and walk away, right?
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:37.140]   But wait a second.
[00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:39.940]   Maybe it's only 9.15 at night, we're having a great time,
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:42.100]   we already paid the babysitter for six hours,
[00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:43.100]   and you know how hard it is
[00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:44.780]   to get a babysitter for four children.
[00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:46.420]   So you're like, okay, what do we do?
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.220]   Well, at least at that point in time,
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:50.900]   maybe you say, okay, I wanna keep playing,
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:53.140]   we're having a good time, we're enjoying ourselves,
[00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:55.500]   but you might at least take the original thousand
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:56.980]   and slide it in the back pocket.
[00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:58.420]   That way you're playing with your winnings,
[00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:00.500]   and if you lose it all, at least you walk away whole,
[00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:02.140]   or you might double it up.
[00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:04.660]   So the problem is that that's what you and I would do
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:06.140]   as non-addictive gamblers.
[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:08.740]   We may or may not walk away,
[00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:10.980]   but we would at least take some off the table
[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:12.060]   and tuck it aside,
[00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:14.500]   knowing that we're playing a dangerous game.
[00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:17.460]   So what happens is oftentimes business owners
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:20.820]   and other types of investors sometimes don't do that.
[00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:23.340]   They play the thousand, and it's up to 1500,
[00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:25.300]   and up to 1800, up to two grand.
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:27.120]   Then they look at it and say, man, we're doing awesome.
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:29.340]   So they play the two grand and they double it to four.
[00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:31.420]   Then they play the four and they double it to eight.
[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:33.620]   Then they play the eight and they double it to 16.
[00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:37.180]   It's 10.45 at night, we're parents, we go to bed early,
[00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:38.020]   and we're looking at it saying,
[00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:39.740]   okay, just one more good roll.
[00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:41.900]   And all of a sudden they play the 16,
[00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:45.340]   but instead of this time doubling to 32,
[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:48.940]   it declines to something significantly less
[00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:51.380]   due to perhaps unforeseen activities.
[00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:55.080]   So my answer is head your bets, right?
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:56.980]   Okay, you got the thousand, play it,
[00:49:56.980 --> 00:50:00.140]   take 500 off the table when you're up to 2000.
[00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:03.140]   Take 500 off the table, put it in something else.
[00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:06.100]   Grow it up, you know, take another thousand off the table.
[00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:08.540]   Just take some off the table and diversify it.
[00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:10.020]   And diversify it into something
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:11.260]   that you think is a good investment,
[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:13.660]   but that's not subject to the same forces.
[00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:15.140]   So what would I do if I had built
[00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:19.620]   a $100,000 portfolio into $600,000?
[00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:21.540]   And by the way, before I tell you what I'd do,
[00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:25.580]   for me this is very personal because I've known
[00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:28.380]   so many people who've made money in good markets.
[00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:32.820]   In 2000, I knew somebody, young guy, who made a fortune.
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:35.100]   He went from nothing to a couple million dollars
[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:37.100]   overnight with a dot-com business.
[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:39.940]   Bought a Porsche, had millions of dollars
[00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:42.320]   and was doing awesome.
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:45.660]   And then everything fell out and he lost it all.
[00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:47.280]   Lost his Porsche, lost everything.
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:49.540]   And I thought to myself, that was stupid.
[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:51.780]   Then in 2000, you know, in the mid-2000s,
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:54.780]   I had friends who were making fortunes in real estate.
[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:57.460]   And then they lost it all, went through bankruptcy,
[00:50:57.460 --> 00:50:59.500]   bankrupted out of $2 million worth of property.
[00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:01.940]   And I thought to myself, that was stupid.
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:04.600]   Why can these people not see that when you've gone
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:08.280]   from nothing to multi-millions in a short span,
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.480]   it might be worth it to take something aside.
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:12.360]   And it's because you get that gambler's greed
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:14.240]   where you say, this is working, this is working,
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.360]   this is working.
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:19.060]   So if I built 100 into 600,000, I would look down
[00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:21.540]   and I would say, well, this portfolio very well
[00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:22.800]   could keep going.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:25.040]   But I need to make sure that if this thing wipes out,
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:26.520]   that I'm not ruined.
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:28.920]   And so I need to make sure that I do something.
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:32.800]   Maybe I take $100,000 and I buy gold in a vault in Austria.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:36.040]   Maybe I take $200,000 and I go buy a rental property.
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:38.280]   Maybe I take some money and I put it in the stock market
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:40.040]   where somebody else is managing it.
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.040]   Doesn't really matter.
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:43.920]   The point is that it's not all on one thing.
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:47.880]   So that if this disappears, then something,
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:49.520]   that I still have something covered.
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:52.780]   Because I've never seen a market in anything
[00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:55.720]   where it couldn't all be misdisrupted overnight, right?
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:58.240]   Hello, US government or your state government comes in
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:51:59.680]   and says, hey, you've got a rental property,
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:01.040]   but you can't evict your tenants.
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:03.080]   What did that do for the value of your real estate?
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:04.920]   What did that do for your rental flows?
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:08.920]   Or they come in, I mean, there's just any market can crash.
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:12.040]   So if $600,000, the loss of it,
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:15.480]   wouldn't affect the rest of your life that badly,
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:16.860]   then I would say, keep playing, right?
[00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:19.840]   Keep investing in what you think is gonna happen.
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:22.120]   But if it would, you wanna make sure
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:23.480]   that you're levering up over time.
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:25.320]   And so you need to look at the rest of your portfolio
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:27.120]   and consider how does the 600 relate
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:29.440]   to the overall portfolio.
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.400]   So that's my first answer is look at it
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:33.240]   in a financial planning perspective.
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:35.480]   What would it be like if I lost it all?
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:36.860]   What would the harm be?
[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:39.580]   How big of an asset does this represent and go on?
[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:42.960]   And I just, I would say, look at it like this, right?
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:46.980]   Do you remember the Snapchat story from the last five years?
[00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:54.360]   - I know of several stories,
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:55.840]   but I'm not sure which one you're talking about.
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:57.600]   - Here, I'm just thinking about the owner of Snapchat.
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:00.400]   Now, I don't have all the data current in my mind, okay?
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:02.480]   But there was a time a number of years ago
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:05.640]   when Snapchat was the next hot thing.
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:08.200]   It was very, very valuable.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.720]   Mark Zuckerberg came to the owner of Snapchat
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:14.120]   and offered him something like two or $3 billion
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:16.380]   for the purchase of Snapchat.
[00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:17.360]   He said, no.
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:20.960]   He said, no, I'm gonna keep Snapchat to myself
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:22.720]   and I'm gonna keep on building it.
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:27.540]   Mark Zuckerberg then, a month or two or whatever later,
[00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:31.520]   rolls out all of the identical features of Snapchat
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:36.440]   across the board to Facebook and Instagram,
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:38.840]   his services that he owned.
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:43.200]   And at that point in time, it was rather obvious to me
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:45.140]   that Snapchat basically imploded.
[00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:47.680]   There was a time where basically everyone I followed
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:51.760]   had their yellow profile picture, follow me on Snapchat.
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:53.480]   I haven't seen one of those in a long time.
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.860]   I personally could never figure out how to use the app.
[00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:57.440]   Maybe I was stupid, but I could just,
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:59.120]   it never made sense to me.
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:00.520]   And here was this guy who had offered--
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:01.360]   - You and me both.
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:04.640]   - Yeah, two or $3 billion to sell to Facebook
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:06.200]   and he chose to say no.
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:08.200]   Now, was it the right decision or not?
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:11.720]   We would only know that if we could talk to him and say,
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:13.320]   well, what do you value more?
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:16.120]   As I understood it, he valued his independence.
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:18.920]   And Snapchat is still in some sense a going concern.
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:20.360]   I don't hear about it much anymore,
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:21.340]   but every now and then someone says,
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:22.820]   oh, Snapchat's gonna come back.
[00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:25.240]   I'm sure he still has as much money as he needs
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:26.680]   and he's gonna be fine.
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:29.080]   But I think about that and I say,
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:32.440]   put yourself in those situations and ask yourself,
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:33.840]   would you wanna have cashed out?
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:35.640]   Me personally, if someone offered me
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:38.960]   two or $3 billion for a company, I would cash out.
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:41.280]   I would cash out because I don't need to be the guy
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:43.080]   who's got $50 billion.
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:45.280]   Two or $3 billion is pretty substantial.
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:47.000]   That's pretty good.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.840]   And you don't get, a lot of times you only get
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.200]   one of those opportunities in life.
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.640]   So you've gotta consider it in the context
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:55.020]   of your personal financial planning
[00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:57.600]   and then think about the maximum upside,
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:00.440]   the maximum downside and see how that affects you.
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:03.240]   That said, I remain very bullish on crypto,
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.200]   my personal opinion.
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:08.040]   I remain very bullish on the importance of cryptocurrencies,
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.040]   on the use case for them.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:13.880]   And while I believe that the fundamental value
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:17.440]   of a Bitcoin is a magical number made up
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:20.020]   exclusively from supply and demand,
[00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:22.880]   that's the world we live in with everything else in life.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:24.860]   The value of a US dollar is a number
[00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:26.540]   that's exclusively made up
[00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:28.980]   based upon the value of supply and demand.
[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:31.060]   And so it's made up, it's fantasy,
[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:33.060]   just like everything else in our life.
[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:36.680]   But I think that the arguments are going forward
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:40.940]   that cryptocurrencies can be a very, very useful part
[00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:42.000]   of what we're doing.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.620]   Now, will the long-term winner be Bitcoin?
[00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:47.260]   Will the long-term winner be Ethereum?
[00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:50.020]   Will the long-term winner be some other minor,
[00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:51.340]   useful coin that's been developed?
[00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:52.660]   I don't know.
[00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:55.220]   So those things are opaque to me,
[00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:58.820]   but I think that my personal opinion
[00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:02.700]   is that we are still in the very early stages
[00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:04.340]   of a transformation in the world,
[00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:06.380]   and that more and more people
[00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:10.380]   are going to start to use these tools.
[00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:14.580]   I need cryptocurrency personally to succeed
[00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:16.940]   in order to minimize the hassle
[00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.580]   of dealing with the banking system.
[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:20.580]   And I don't see why it can't succeed.
[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:24.020]   And to me, every marker is on the way.
[00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:26.380]   The biggest marker right now is gonna be regulation, right?
[00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:28.740]   You had new regulation in India recently.
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:30.420]   The United States government is passing
[00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:33.580]   all kinds of new regulation on cryptocurrency.
[00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:35.540]   Could the whole premise still fail?
[00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:38.220]   Well, I think any one currency could fail,
[00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:40.020]   but in terms of the premise, to me,
[00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:41.140]   this seems to be in line
[00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:42.900]   with the direction the world is going.
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:45.820]   And so as long as I'm not gonna be wiped out,
[00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:47.660]   I would personally continue
[00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:49.360]   to be involved in the marketplace.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:55.080]   - Okay, yeah, that's kind of my same general feeling.
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:57:00.640]   When I was looking at the number
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:03.880]   and I was like, wow, that's a good amount of money.
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:07.840]   And then I was like, how many years would that last
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:09.440]   if I were to cash it out?
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:14.440]   And would that be like 10 years of income after taxes?
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:21.640]   And that right now,
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:25.680]   and that kind of got my head thinking like,
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:30.240]   well, maybe I should do something rather than nothing.
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:32.120]   And then I went to start adding up numbers
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:34.360]   of how much I'd put into it,
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:35.760]   'cause I'd never actually done that
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:37.800]   until I got to thinking.
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:40.520]   And I was like, I was pretty flabbergasted
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:43.360]   that I had put that much in without even knowing about,
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:47.320]   knowing the total over five years
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:53.400]   that I didn't keep that information in.
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:59.520]   It just got the ball rolling.
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:02.280]   Like maybe I should do something about this differently
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:04.000]   than any time before.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.640]   But that being said, I'm also bullish.
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:09.400]   I think they've got,
[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:12.760]   there's places to go further than where we are.
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:18.200]   So yeah, I appreciate your thoughts.
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:20.800]   I think I'm just gonna let it ride
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:25.520]   because it could be that Snapchat story.
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:30.480]   - To try to put it succinctly, my answer is very simple.
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:33.200]   When you have something better to do with the money
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:36.160]   than what it's invested in right now,
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:38.320]   do that thing that's better.
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:41.320]   So when you have a better use of the money
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:43.440]   than your cryptocurrency portfolio,
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:45.480]   do that thing that's better.
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:47.440]   What could be some examples?
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:48.920]   Maybe you look down and you say,
[00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:50.200]   if we paid off our house,
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:52.840]   our life would be better because of this reason.
[00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:55.120]   Well, then if you're convinced of that
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:56.480]   and you make that decision,
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:59.920]   you'll do it and you'll feel happy with it
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:01.200]   even if Bitcoin went to the moon
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:02.240]   because that was the decision
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:03.920]   that was right for you at the time.
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:04.760]   I wouldn't, just to be clear,
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:07.600]   I wouldn't hasten to do that, but it's an option.
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:09.360]   If you thought, you know what,
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:12.280]   my daughter is dying of cancer.
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:14.200]   And if I take this $600,000
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:15.840]   and invest it into her medical treatment,
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:17.320]   I may be able to save her life.
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:19.680]   You would do that because it's a better option.
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:22.120]   If you come across another investment opportunity,
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:25.600]   a business, a house, a stock, a different coin,
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:27.920]   whenever you find something better,
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:29.420]   then do what's better.
[00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:31.340]   But don't just retreat from what you think
[00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:34.440]   is the best thing because you're somehow scared of it.
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:37.200]   Think it through and always question your assumptions,
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:40.360]   but only change when you have something better to do.
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:41.840]   All right, we go to John in Pennsylvania.
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:42.680]   John, welcome to the show.
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:43.880]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:48.360]   - Hey, Joshua, thanks for taking the call.
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:50.400]   That's a good voice for that last caller.
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:54.280]   I'm gonna be sending this show to a friend of mine
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:56.280]   who has basically the same situation,
[00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:59.080]   but you just add a zero to the totals.
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:01.560]   He's been fluctuating between the millions
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:04.280]   and really struggling with the psychology of it.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:05.480]   Actually, he seems pretty stable.
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.240]   I'm struggling with being his friend.
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.160]   - Right. (laughs)
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:10.240]   - Not knowing what to do with those scales of money.
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.680]   I don't know how to--
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:13.740]   - I'll tell you what's worse than that
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:15.120]   is the people who are struggling
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.200]   with the fact of how many Bitcoin they bought
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.880]   and then they lost in a wallet
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.680]   that became inaccessible to them.
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:22.200]   I had a client of mine one time
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:25.880]   that a year or so ago, he had $2 million.
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:28.720]   What was at that point in time worth $2 million
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:31.280]   sitting in a hard drive that he couldn't get into
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:34.460]   because he couldn't, in a password he couldn't remember.
[01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:37.520]   And then just watching the prices increase
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:39.280]   where now, I don't know, but I'm guessing
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:43.160]   that what was $2 million is now $5 or $6 million
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:44.760]   is just a major gut check.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:46.280]   And so I've been thinking about that a lot
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:48.200]   because it's a matter of how well
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.960]   do I have my systems worked out?
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:52.440]   How well do I have my backup plans?
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:54.200]   Just even for simple things like my computer
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.440]   and my phone and whatnot.
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.960]   Sometimes we play a risky game
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.480]   and don't cover ourselves properly.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:01.040]   And those are the people that I think about
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.960]   and pray for that they'll still be alive a year from now
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:06.540]   rather than having punched themselves in the face
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:08.720]   so many times that they just can't do it anymore.
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:09.560]   So go ahead, John.
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:12.640]   - Yeah, no, that's absolutely brutal.
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:15.360]   And I know my own problems with memory
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.800]   and devices and everything.
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:19.480]   Yeah, that would probably be me, to be honest.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.680]   I only have like 100 something in Bitcoin or cryptos
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:24.840]   and I'm more interested in it as a currency
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:28.560]   that's usable rather than a speculation thing.
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:31.240]   But at the same time, I can't deny what my friends
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:33.440]   I've been able to build with it.
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.120]   Although I couldn't have taken the swings.
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.640]   He's gotten from whatever it's 40,000,
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:38.840]   he's turned it into five
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:40.360]   and then he watched it go back to 500
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:42.800]   and then up to recently to nine
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.320]   and then back to seven in the millions.
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.520]   And I just, I don't think I would ever be able
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:48.520]   to take the swings.
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:51.520]   Just, I couldn't do what he did
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.760]   even though I watched him doing it.
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:55.880]   You know, I know that I wouldn't be in the same situation
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:58.440]   'cause I couldn't have done it in those ways.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.640]   But yeah, I'll be sending this to him.
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:03.560]   Anyways, my question is,
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:06.800]   I caught it a couple of weeks ago.
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:10.480]   I've been laid off and trying to,
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:13.160]   well, I am enjoying some time off, a sabbatical.
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:16.680]   I'm still interviewing a bit half-heartedly
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:19.760]   kind of questioning whether I'm burning bridges
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:24.760]   by taking interviews but not preparing 100% for them.
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:27.400]   But in my time off here,
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:29.800]   I'm trying to focus a little bit more on walking
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.640]   and health and different things.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:34.120]   And one thing I've found in my walks
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:35.760]   and listening to certain things
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.760]   and exposing myself to different ideas
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:40.040]   and trying to get fresh ideas in my head
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.880]   is I'm pretty good at delving deep into things,
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:44.440]   getting into one or two topics
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:46.400]   and just spending all my time
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:47.600]   going deeper and deeper into them.
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:50.920]   And of course, the mechanisms we have with Instagram
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:54.960]   and YouTube makes that deep dive real easy.
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:59.000]   And other algorithms kind of favor that type of a feed.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.240]   And it's been fun.
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:04.200]   But I remember, I'm sure you did a long time ago
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.960]   about exposing yourself to lots of different ideas
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:09.120]   and books being a primary way to do that.
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.560]   So I'm trying to read more.
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:11.560]   I used to read nonfiction.
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:14.320]   I'm trying to read a little bit more fiction.
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:15.880]   I'm just wondering if you have any ideas
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:20.880]   on trying to expose myself to a broader range of ideas
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:27.600]   both for future occupations, maybe business ideas,
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.520]   and not necessarily just money-making things,
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:30.400]   just hobbies even.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:34.520]   And yeah, just sort of looking for some thoughts around that.
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:37.640]   I mean, I find myself going to the library
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:40.840]   and just picking out literally random books
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:44.800]   off the bookshelf to see if it starts a curiosity
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:46.680]   down one avenue or another.
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:49.680]   Should I be more direct or more intentional about it
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:53.920]   when kind of all the world's a possibility?
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:56.440]   - I don't know how to be more intentional about it
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:58.000]   in what we're talking about.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.280]   I think that the secret is always,
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:03.840]   as I've said in previous shows that you've heard,
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:08.360]   you read or you learn in the direction of your goals.
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:11.200]   So when you have a goal, something that you've said,
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:14.040]   this is something that I would do, I would want to do,
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:17.160]   you identify the goal, and then you start learning
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:19.600]   or reading or exposing yourself to things
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:21.440]   in the direction of that goal.
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.520]   And that to me is what has made things,
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.120]   that's where things are so easy now.
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.800]   If we can get people to write down a goal,
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.920]   and the writing it down is important,
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:32.360]   but the most important thing is just to notice a goal.
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:34.720]   And it can be simple, like I want to be healthier,
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.560]   but just to notice that and not say,
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:38.240]   oh, okay, I'm just gonna pass it by,
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.480]   but say I want to be healthier and write it down
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:43.040]   so then they can recognize this is something that I want,
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.800]   now I can start doing something towards it.
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.440]   So my coaching in that situation would be,
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:47.920]   I want to be healthier.
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.840]   And then I would ask the person to say,
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:51.300]   what are some things that I could do
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:54.000]   that might move me in the direction of being healthier?
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.920]   I could schedule an appointment with a doctor,
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.480]   I could go and read a book on health,
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:59.400]   I could figure out what aspect of my health
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:01.600]   I want to improve, et cetera.
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.440]   So the key is just to notice it.
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:05.960]   So when you can notice something that you'd like to do,
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:09.720]   then it guides your web walking.
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:10.640]   If you notice and you say,
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.440]   I'd like to live a more adventurous life
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:16.940]   and travel around the country with my children in an RV,
[01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:18.960]   well, now you have something that guides
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:20.920]   your Instagram channels you follow,
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.760]   your YouTube channels you search out,
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:23.820]   the blogs that you read,
[01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:27.020]   the books that you find in the library or on Amazon, et cetera
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:28.320]   or the people that you talk to.
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.280]   Oh, hey, look, there's a meetup of travelers in my area,
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.280]   I'm gonna go get together with them.
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.160]   When you don't have that though,
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:37.200]   then I don't know of any way to direct that
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.960]   other than through what you've said.
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:43.440]   So what I would do, what I encourage people to do
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.240]   is if you are unemployed,
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:47.840]   you find yourself with significant amounts of time,
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.520]   expose yourself to things
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.560]   where ideas will come into your mind.
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:54.600]   So I like the library because I can go to the library
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.800]   and I can just bumble around.
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:58.140]   I can go through sections
[01:05:58.140 --> 01:06:00.700]   and see if anything attracts me to a certain section.
[01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:02.540]   And then if something attracts me to it,
[01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:05.000]   I just grab a book off the shelf and sit and read all day
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.940]   or take home 20 or 30 books
[01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:08.260]   and browse through them for a day or two
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:10.260]   and then take them back, it doesn't matter.
[01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:11.900]   Browse through the magazine racks.
[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:15.200]   So this is where a Barnes and Noble
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.740]   or something with a big magazine rack
[01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:19.100]   or the library magazine rack is so interesting
[01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:21.660]   because these are things that other people are interested in
[01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:22.700]   and if other people are interested in,
[01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:24.380]   I might be interested in it too.
[01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:25.220]   And then along the way,
[01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:27.060]   just ask yourself the questions of
[01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:28.820]   why are you interested in this certain thing?
[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:30.900]   What is it that you're looking for?
[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:32.720]   Is there some theme to it?
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.460]   Beyond that, I don't know.
[01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:36.580]   I think that thinking about it is probably enough
[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:38.620]   to develop the skills of introspection
[01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:41.880]   to understand what's important to you and why you like it.
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:44.500]   But as far as how to expose yourself,
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:46.780]   it is I think somewhat random
[01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:48.280]   and there are too many options in the world.
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:50.520]   There's too many careers, there's too many choices,
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:51.980]   there's too many hobbies.
[01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:54.060]   There's just far too many to think
[01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:57.140]   that you could ever do some kind of comprehensive analysis.
[01:06:57.140 --> 01:06:59.900]   Rather, I think it's just a matter of training yourself
[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:02.600]   to be observant to what you're interested in and why.
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:06.100]   - I appreciate that.
[01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:10.620]   I think the very start of your advice there
[01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:12.300]   gave me what I needed, which is,
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:14.020]   I actually have one or two things
[01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:16.020]   that I'm getting pretty deep into it
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:20.660]   and I guess I had a little bit of uneasiness or guilt about,
[01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:24.020]   I already had, not necessarily specific goals,
[01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:25.420]   I can put goals around those,
[01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:27.580]   but I was delving deep into these things
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:31.020]   without thinking, maybe I haven't gone wide enough first,
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:32.540]   but I already had an innate interest
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:35.420]   from multiple angles on these hobbies.
[01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:37.940]   And so I think just what you said,
[01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:39.220]   maybe building a goal around that
[01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:41.980]   so I have more intentionality about what I've already
[01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:45.500]   in my head chosen these handful of things I'm working on
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:48.180]   is really what will solidify that feeling
[01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:49.540]   or take away that feeling
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:52.180]   that maybe I didn't explore widely enough
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:54.260]   before I delved into these things.
[01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:55.660]   If it's in my head and I'm interested in it,
[01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:57.940]   I should probably just be okay with
[01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:01.060]   dedicating my time to pursuing it.
[01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:02.020]   - Dedicate your time to it
[01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:04.500]   and then just be okay with it sliding away.
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:08.180]   If it's not of interest anymore, just let it go.
[01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:09.500]   I mean, it sounds very woo-woo,
[01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:13.940]   but I think that to me, it's fine to say,
[01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:16.860]   hey, I was into that, but now I'm not into that so much.
[01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:19.980]   And I don't know of any magic formula to this
[01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:22.620]   other than just to be easy on yourself.
[01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:24.820]   I think that at the end of the day,
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:26.660]   being present in today is important
[01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:29.260]   and then just being observing what you like to do,
[01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:30.180]   what you don't like to do,
[01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:32.340]   what enhances your experience of today,
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:34.540]   what enhances your experience in the future.
[01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:38.820]   And those are uniquely individual things.
[01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:42.460]   So I don't see this as the area
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:44.940]   of where there's any objective reality.
[01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:46.700]   There's no right or wrong.
[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:48.700]   This is just a matter of, hey,
[01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:50.300]   here's what I'm into right now,
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:51.900]   and here's why I'm into it.
[01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:55.180]   And those reasons can be completely your own reasons.
[01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:58.180]   And if what you're doing is morally right,
[01:08:58.180 --> 01:08:59.500]   you're not harming other people,
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:03.700]   then these are areas where it's just a free personal choice
[01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:05.200]   that can change along the way.
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:08.060]   - Yeah, that's great.
[01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.900]   And I think that's another good thing I need to do
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:11.140]   is I've already done in my head,
[01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:12.620]   but maybe just writing down all those.
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:14.460]   There's multiple benefits of this hobby
[01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:17.460]   and things I can do with my kids with it.
[01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:20.300]   So just solidifying on that and just being okay
[01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:22.700]   with it, I think is what I need to do.
[01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:23.940]   So I appreciate that, thank you.
[01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:25.540]   - My pleasure, thanks for calling in, John.
[01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:26.900]   All right, we've got four callers left.
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:27.960]   We're gonna move faster here.
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.120]   Houston, Texas, go.
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:33.620]   That was gonna be this big--
[01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:35.300]   - I'm not sure-- - There we go, there we go.
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:36.140]   I had it all lined up for you.
[01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:39.340]   It was gonna be a dramatic, perfect, like boom, boom, boom.
[01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:41.780]   Go ahead. (laughs)
[01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:43.940]   - All right, yeah, I listened to your two episodes
[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:46.020]   with Jonathan Harris and we love it
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:47.980]   that children, they're developing process
[01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:50.460]   and our role as parents is a topic
[01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:54.380]   that you cover in your podcast.
[01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:57.540]   And as new parents, I just have a couple of questions
[01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:59.020]   that I'll just ask first,
[01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:01.180]   and if we don't have time, it's fine.
[01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:02.220]   - Go ahead.
[01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:04.380]   - It is important for us to stay close
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:07.460]   to our extended family and for them to be a big part
[01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:08.900]   of our children's life.
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:12.100]   And we currently envision keeping our children
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:14.020]   in a traditional school system,
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:19.020]   but also try not to fall into the traps
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:22.460]   of a mindless, busy family life.
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:26.300]   And what would be your advice on how we should create
[01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:30.620]   a framework for this from a young age,
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:33.940]   just based on your own experience with your children
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:37.260]   and other knowledge that you have?
[01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:39.380]   Basically, if you can stick to it,
[01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:41.460]   that's all I had for today.
[01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:44.380]   - How old is your child or how old are your children?
[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:47.340]   - Oh, she, we just have our first kid
[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:49.860]   and she's like five and a half months old.
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:51.780]   - Great.
[01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:52.620]   - Yeah.
[01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:56.620]   - I think the most important advice that I would give
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:58.620]   and that I think that anyone else would give
[01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:03.620]   in this situation is focus on your child,
[01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:07.300]   not on someone else's child, but on your child,
[01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:10.380]   and then seek to do what you believe
[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:12.740]   is in the best interest of your child,
[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:14.940]   based upon your vision as a parent
[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:17.560]   and based upon their unique personality.
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:23.460]   For example, I personally am pretty strong,
[01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:27.020]   I'm strongly opposed to enrolling my child
[01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:28.900]   in a government school.
[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:31.260]   And I have clear reasons for that.
[01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:34.060]   But that's not an absolute statement.
[01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:37.020]   I'm opposed to it in my mentality,
[01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:39.620]   and I've got what I think are good arguments against it
[01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:42.780]   as to why for me, for my children, for my family,
[01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:44.940]   it's probably not a good idea,
[01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:47.080]   but that's not an absolute statement.
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:50.500]   I need to look carefully at my child
[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:54.800]   and I need to think about what's in my child's best interest
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:56.500]   and there may be times
[01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:58.660]   where you completely change everything.
[01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:02.060]   So even if Jonathan Harris were sitting here talking to you,
[01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:03.940]   I think that would be the first thing he would say
[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:05.660]   is look at your children
[01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:07.940]   and think about who they are as individuals
[01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:09.700]   and what your vision is.
[01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:12.180]   And what I'll tell you is that right now,
[01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:14.780]   there's no need to worry at five and a half months,
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:18.580]   there's no need to worry about any of these decisions
[01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:21.740]   because you won't know who your child is
[01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:24.500]   until more time comes.
[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:28.780]   And so you need to be aware of your particular child.
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:33.380]   And so let me give you just a couple of practical examples.
[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:37.580]   Your daughter might be incredibly smart
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:40.620]   and you might find that she's so smart,
[01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:43.860]   you have a hard time keeping her challenged.
[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:46.700]   And so what you need to do is you go
[01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:50.900]   and you find the best, most challenging school.
[01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:53.620]   And yes, you're a fan of the traditional school environment,
[01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:55.980]   but you go and you try the local government school
[01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:57.980]   and they just don't give her enough challenge.
[01:12:57.980 --> 01:12:59.620]   Then you go and you find the best,
[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:02.140]   most elite private school in your area
[01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:04.220]   and they don't give her enough challenge.
[01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:06.660]   And so basically you and your wife,
[01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:07.740]   you throw up your hands and you say,
[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:09.100]   "We have to homeschool, right?
[01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:11.260]   "Because we can't keep her challenged in this situation
[01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:13.140]   "because she's just too smart."
[01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:15.380]   And so now all of a sudden, she's so smart
[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:18.460]   that you are doing something
[01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:20.420]   that you never dreamed you would do.
[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:22.220]   Now let's do the opposite example.
[01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:27.220]   You might then find out you're working with your daughter
[01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:29.740]   and you're trying to challenge her,
[01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:31.620]   but she's lonely all the time.
[01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:33.220]   And she doesn't have enough friends
[01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:35.980]   and she was thriving on the social interaction.
[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:37.180]   But you can't find a solution.
[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:38.020]   So what do you do?
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:38.860]   You go start a school, right?
[01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:40.780]   I've known people who've started a school for their children
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:42.380]   because they couldn't find what they wanted
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:44.820]   and the school became a fabulous, thriving business.
[01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:46.660]   But you can't predict anything like that.
[01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:47.780]   It's unknown.
[01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:49.740]   Or the exact opposite could be, right?
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:53.620]   Maybe your daughter, instead of being smart, is not smart
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:56.100]   and has tons and tons, she's slow,
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:58.060]   she's behind all her peers.
[01:13:58.060 --> 01:13:59.940]   Well, in that situation, you're gonna look at her
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:00.780]   and you're gonna say,
[01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:02.620]   "What's the best thing for me to do with her?"
[01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:04.620]   And if I had a child that was slow
[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:05.940]   and behind his or her peers,
[01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:10.140]   I would not want them to face bullying,
[01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:13.140]   to be made fun of, or to be made to feel inferior.
[01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:15.620]   And so I would homeschool them in that situation.
[01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:17.300]   But when you homeschool,
[01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:19.260]   like for example, one of my children,
[01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:24.260]   I question whether my child is responding properly
[01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:26.660]   to other authority figures.
[01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:28.700]   And so one of the problems is
[01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:31.260]   that my child has been responsive to my wife and me
[01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:32.660]   as authority figures,
[01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:37.540]   but continues to be somewhat non,
[01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:39.500]   to have trouble with other authority figures.
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:41.420]   And so I keep watching every day,
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:42.780]   thinking about what do I do?
[01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:44.300]   How do I adjust this?
[01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:46.980]   And so for now, I've intentionally hired other teachers
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:48.260]   that come into our home,
[01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:50.220]   but there have been times where I have thought,
[01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:54.220]   "Maybe I need to go ahead and enroll my child into school."
[01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:55.060]   Right?
[01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:56.500]   Because maybe that school environment
[01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:58.740]   and facing the discipline of the school environment,
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:02.060]   it would be good for humility and whatnot.
[01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:05.700]   And so you're going to watch your child
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:07.860]   and you're going to constantly think,
[01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:10.500]   "What's best for my child right now?"
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:15.500]   And so in terms of a theory or a grand framework, et cetera,
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:16.620]   that's it.
[01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:18.980]   It's a matter of looking at my child along the way.
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:20.060]   Now there's more to it.
[01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:21.660]   You'll listen to other people's stories.
[01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:24.580]   You'll think about it, but that's what parenting goes.
[01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:25.660]   You'll try something.
[01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:27.900]   You'll see, are we getting results with this?
[01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:29.060]   What should I do?
[01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:31.860]   And you have to, I think, remain open
[01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:36.700]   to really any decision along the way
[01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:38.100]   if you believe that that's what's best
[01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:39.940]   for your particular daughter.
[01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:41.540]   That's my overwhelming advice.
[01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:43.140]   Along the way, listen to other people,
[01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:45.100]   find out what they like, what they do,
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:48.580]   be open to them, and then think about their stories,
[01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:51.140]   but don't think that there is one particular thing
[01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:52.660]   that's a magical solution.
[01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:53.820]   Every child is different,
[01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:56.140]   and it's your responsibility as a parent
[01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:58.100]   to coach your child and to help your child
[01:15:58.100 --> 01:15:59.540]   to do what's best for her.
[01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:02.140]   - Perfect, thank you so much.
[01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:03.620]   - My pleasure, congratulations.
[01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:06.380]   And I would just say, I guess the other thing I would say
[01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:08.940]   to the father of a five and a half month old,
[01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:13.780]   breathe, relax, and enjoy it.
[01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:14.900]   There is no pressure.
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:18.620]   I'm convinced there are some societies
[01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:21.540]   in which we put a lot of pressure on our children,
[01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:24.620]   and this happens a lot in the United States.
[01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:26.420]   It's not the worst in the United States,
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:27.860]   but it's bad in the United States,
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:30.100]   and it's very bad in some areas.
[01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:33.820]   And I do think that it's important
[01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:36.500]   to give children time to be children,
[01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:40.100]   and to have free play, to have unstructured play,
[01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:41.540]   to have unstructured time.
[01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:44.340]   So don't get too involved in the academics too early.
[01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:46.780]   I got pretty involved in the academics early,
[01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:48.500]   and even though we were doing it at home,
[01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:50.700]   we weren't putting a lot of pressure, et cetera,
[01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:54.340]   but we just learned, with four children now
[01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:55.420]   and going through the years,
[01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:58.100]   I've learned that each child is different.
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:00.460]   It's important to do what the child is ready for
[01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:02.460]   at the right time, but not to try to fit
[01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:05.260]   into some standard mode or model
[01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:08.460]   that has everything done at a certain time.
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:10.100]   So that's my recommendation to you.
[01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:12.420]   And with that, we go to what will be
[01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:15.180]   our final caller here in California.
[01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:16.420]   The other two callers dropped off,
[01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:17.900]   and so you're gonna round us out today.
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:18.740]   Welcome to the show.
[01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:19.940]   How can I serve you today?
[01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:22.220]   - Oh, beautiful.
[01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:23.060]   Thank you, Joshua.
[01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:23.900]   How you doing?
[01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:24.740]   - Very well.
[01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:25.580]   How are you?
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:26.420]   - I'm doing very well.
[01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:28.020]   All right, let me get into this.
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:31.700]   So I've been at a company for about five years now,
[01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:35.060]   and two years of that, two or three years, I was full-time.
[01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:37.020]   Since then, I've been part-time.
[01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:40.740]   The owner of the business wants me to come back full-time.
[01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:42.500]   He wants me to do the grunt work,
[01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:44.460]   help him build the business up.
[01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:46.780]   And then in Promise, he said he wants me
[01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:49.700]   to eventually move into an operations role
[01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:52.100]   within the company, the corporate company.
[01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:54.780]   And he wants to give me equity within the company.
[01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:57.180]   And so my question to you is,
[01:17:57.180 --> 01:18:00.420]   I trust him from the five years I've been with him,
[01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:04.420]   but from my standpoint,
[01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:07.220]   what should I ask for in terms of writing?
[01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:08.780]   'Cause this is just a future Promise.
[01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:10.900]   This is probably two more years of work.
[01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:13.460]   In terms of writing to get the equity,
[01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:15.460]   and in terms of writing to get the role
[01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:18.580]   that will eventually be an operational standpoint role.
[01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:20.180]   Is there anything that you can tell me
[01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:22.780]   that will make this an operational standpoint role?
[01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:24.900]   Is there anything that I can do
[01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:28.060]   to make this a legit Promise?
[01:18:28.060 --> 01:18:29.460]   - What kind of company is this?
[01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:31.060]   And tell me a little bit about the numbers
[01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:32.540]   of what you're making right now,
[01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:33.380]   what he wants you to make
[01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:35.220]   if you come back full-time, et cetera.
[01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:38.940]   - So in the veterinarian field,
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:41.540]   and I would be a technician.
[01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:44.660]   And numbers-wise, we get paid by,
[01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:47.100]   we clean teeth, we get paid by the animal.
[01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:49.060]   And I'd probably make around 100K
[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:52.220]   a worker for the first year that I'm back.
[01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:54.260]   Once I get on full-time
[01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:56.860]   and become a salaried employee with him,
[01:18:56.860 --> 01:19:00.540]   I'd be making upwards of 100, 200, something like that,
[01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:03.700]   depending on how far the business can go.
[01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:05.700]   - And you are excited about this opportunity?
[01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:07.260]   You think this would be a good fit for you,
[01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:09.060]   and you trust your boss from working with him
[01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:09.940]   for five years?
[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:12.300]   - Yes, sir.
[01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:13.140]   - Okay.
[01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:15.380]   Well,
[01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:17.380]   (sighs)
[01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:22.740]   you could, so first,
[01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:26.780]   you can put in place some paperwork.
[01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:30.900]   The question generally with paperwork
[01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:33.940]   is whether it helps you or hurts you.
[01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:38.260]   In the US American culture, at this point in time,
[01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:40.300]   we are very paperwork-intensive.
[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:45.100]   The challenge is that just because you have paperwork,
[01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:47.580]   doesn't necessarily mean that
[01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:51.220]   the paperwork is performed on.
[01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:52.060]   Perhaps,
[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:55.780]   I lent somebody money recently.
[01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:57.660]   I try to never lend people money.
[01:19:57.660 --> 01:19:59.180]   I try to give 'em money or say no,
[01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:01.300]   but I've lent people money.
[01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:03.500]   And when I did it,
[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:06.540]   I made sure to write it down,
[01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:08.620]   exactly what was needed.
[01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:12.620]   But I wouldn't actually try to
[01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:15.820]   enforce what was written down in a contract
[01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:17.220]   in a court of law,
[01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:20.140]   because how am I gonna,
[01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:21.740]   am I gonna do that to this person?
[01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:24.020]   Am I gonna actually go there?
[01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:26.820]   And so, there are times when people do go there,
[01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:29.260]   when they go ahead and bring litigation
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:32.580]   to try to force a performance of a contract.
[01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:34.020]   And that's what contracts are for,
[01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:35.180]   and I think that's what courts are for.
[01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:37.100]   I think that is one of the most important
[01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:38.380]   functions of government,
[01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:42.180]   is the judicial branch to bring a court system
[01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:43.140]   where you can have a judge,
[01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:45.380]   and in some cases a jury, hear a case,
[01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:48.620]   and then force the performance on a contract of some kind.
[01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:49.940]   That's important.
[01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:52.420]   So the contract is important.
[01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:55.900]   However, a lot of times, if you go into a contract,
[01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:58.180]   I kind of say, well, there's the contract,
[01:20:58.180 --> 01:21:00.220]   and then there's what's reality.
[01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:03.620]   And so, a lawyer would probably say,
[01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:05.940]   get this contract perfectly right.
[01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:08.460]   But sometimes I personally, from my perspective,
[01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:11.140]   I think, why am I writing out this contract?
[01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:13.940]   So, why would you first put something down on paper?
[01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:15.260]   I think regardless, you need to have
[01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:17.220]   something written down on paper.
[01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:18.060]   The first thing you need to do
[01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:19.860]   is you need to have expectations.
[01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:24.860]   People, even smart people, often forget what they said.
[01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:26.500]   I do.
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:27.420]   We all do.
[01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:28.980]   And so, writing something down
[01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:31.340]   forces us to communicate clearly.
[01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:35.460]   So, I will, my advice to somebody who's starting a business
[01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:37.540]   is you talk about what, you know, your Ds,
[01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:40.060]   what happens in the case of the death
[01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:41.260]   of one of the business partners,
[01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:43.500]   or the disability of one of the business partners,
[01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:45.500]   or the divorce of one of the business partners,
[01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:47.140]   and the dissolution of the business,
[01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:49.380]   or, you know, what do you do
[01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:51.860]   if the business fails and goes bankrupt?
[01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:53.940]   And so, you wanna write down a contract,
[01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:54.780]   and you wanna write it through
[01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:56.740]   to make sure there's clear communication.
[01:21:56.740 --> 01:21:58.460]   And you always do that communication in writing,
[01:21:58.460 --> 01:21:59.460]   so you have a piece of paper to say,
[01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:00.860]   this is what we're agreeing on now,
[01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:02.860]   and then if you need to, you point back and say,
[01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:04.380]   this is what we agreed to.
[01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:05.700]   So, that's the first goal.
[01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:07.420]   So, you could, at the very least,
[01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:10.260]   you should talk to him, and you should say,
[01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:13.340]   I wanna make sure that I understand what we're agreeing to,
[01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:16.340]   I wanna make sure that this is the expectation,
[01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:18.780]   and you write those things down.
[01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:22.580]   And you, and then sometimes you sign them
[01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:23.980]   as an actual contract, you know,
[01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:26.400]   you indicate somehow that we're both present.
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:28.020]   Sometimes you just file a memo.
[01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:29.900]   So, if somebody, you know, says to you
[01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:31.820]   certain, certain things, what you'll often do
[01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:33.580]   is you'll sit down and you'll file a memo with them.
[01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:34.760]   You'll send them an email.
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:37.220]   As we discussed yesterday, here's what you agreed to do,
[01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:38.980]   ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, here's what I agreed to do,
[01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:40.940]   ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, here's what's gonna be done
[01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:42.140]   if we don't do what we agreed on,
[01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:43.500]   ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, et cetera.
[01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.460]   Just wanted to make sure that my notes
[01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:49.200]   from yesterday's meeting were clean and agreed, et cetera.
[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:51.140]   So, that's kind of the standard point.
[01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:52.660]   So, I'd say the most important thing,
[01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:54.660]   why you need to write things down with him
[01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:58.060]   is to clarify exactly what he expects of you,
[01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:00.420]   exactly what performance looks like for you,
[01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:02.900]   and then to get an idea of what he's talking about,
[01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:04.540]   what numbers he's looking for.
[01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:09.460]   You could go to something more formal, right?
[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:12.260]   So, he could write out a contract for you
[01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:16.540]   and say, if you'll do this amount of work,
[01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:17.980]   these two years of work,
[01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:20.240]   and if we hit these certain benchmarks,
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:22.880]   then here is what we'll have.
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:24.940]   The only reason I'm not saying start with that
[01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:26.660]   is sometimes that's hard to do, right?
[01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:28.140]   I work with business owners
[01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:31.660]   and they have highly valued employees
[01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:33.140]   that they try to compensate,
[01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:36.060]   but it's, first of all, can be very expensive
[01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:38.860]   to go ahead and draw up a formal document,
[01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:41.140]   a formal contract, and so often they're slow to do it
[01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:42.700]   'cause the legal fees, et cetera,
[01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:45.060]   and then things can change very, very quickly.
[01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:46.620]   And so, if you trust him,
[01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:47.780]   and if this is a good fit for you,
[01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:50.680]   and if he's paying you enough money to make things work,
[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:52.980]   then I think it would make sense to do that.
[01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:58.340]   You're gonna have to lean on him, though,
[01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:00.300]   in terms of what he's willing to do
[01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:03.940]   to make things attractive for you.
[01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:05.340]   So, you can write things down,
[01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:07.580]   you can send him a memo after your meeting,
[01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:09.580]   you can say, "I just wanna make sure we're clear.
[01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:11.100]   "Is this what you're agreeing to?"
[01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:14.900]   But in terms of him actually getting a lawyer
[01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:16.760]   and writing up a formal employment contract
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:19.500]   and formally saying, "If you perform these certain duties
[01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:20.780]   "and here's how we know you performed them,
[01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:23.940]   "then I'm going to gift you 15% of the company,"
[01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:25.400]   et cetera, on this date,
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:27.980]   then you're gonna have to depend on his willingness
[01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:29.020]   to actually do that.
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:30.060]   - Gotcha.
[01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:33.380]   Gotcha, okay.
[01:24:33.380 --> 01:24:35.660]   Thank you, sir.
[01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:37.700]   Yeah, that makes total sense, okay.
[01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:41.660]   And I think it would be more of an agreement anyways.
[01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:44.060]   - A formal agreement or an informal agreement?
[01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:45.980]   - Informal.
[01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:48.540]   Just because of the fact that this is all based
[01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:50.460]   on the business growing.
[01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:52.740]   And so, how can you really say,
[01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:54.300]   "Okay, if a business grows past this,
[01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:55.820]   "then you get this position."
[01:24:55.820 --> 01:24:57.820]   It's kind of like, "Well, I'm gonna have to
[01:24:57.820 --> 01:25:00.020]   "and it's kind of like what hearsay."
[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:03.580]   But yeah, I understand what you're saying.
[01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:04.420]   - Right.
[01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:05.260]   So that's why I tried to just say
[01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:08.020]   is that one of the simplest things you should do
[01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:10.180]   is as you're having these conversations,
[01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:12.060]   you should document them.
[01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:15.220]   And you need to feel out the relationship
[01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:17.820]   to figure out what's the right way to document them.
[01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:23.660]   I wouldn't try to force him to sign a contract necessarily.
[01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:26.180]   And I think that that's where if you trust him,
[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:27.420]   you're gonna have to trust him.
[01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:29.140]   At the end of the day, we all trust one another
[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:31.300]   and I'm not opposed to trusting people.
[01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:33.700]   But I would try to document things
[01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:36.620]   to make sure that our understanding is clear.
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:38.180]   I believe that that helps.
[01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:39.700]   That helps in any relationship
[01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:41.620]   to make sure that we have a clear understanding.
[01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:43.780]   Here's what you're willing to commit to,
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:45.540]   here's what I'm willing to commit to.
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:47.500]   So at the very least, you might do that
[01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:49.720]   in a form of a memo, an email,
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:53.340]   and just have things written down
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:55.540]   so that your communication is clear.
[01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:57.260]   And I think that that's often a good test
[01:25:57.260 --> 01:25:58.420]   for whether or not this will be
[01:25:58.420 --> 01:26:00.520]   a good working relationship in the future.
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:04.420]   If I think about the times
[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:08.220]   when I've gotten involved in dumb businesses,
[01:26:08.220 --> 01:26:10.740]   when I've been scammed and cheated out of money,
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:14.580]   when I've been employed by people who were untrustworthy
[01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:16.360]   and yet I swallowed everything,
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:18.380]   some of the time, I mean,
[01:26:18.380 --> 01:26:20.300]   none of the time did I have written documentation.
[01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:22.900]   A couple of those guys I think would have agreed to anything
[01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:24.200]   because they were just swindlers
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:26.180]   and I got hoodwinked by them.
[01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:28.180]   But I think it doesn't hurt you to write things down
[01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:30.660]   and at least helps you to know I'm not being crazy
[01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:31.980]   if they're not performing.
[01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:36.300]   So definitely write it down, get agreement,
[01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:39.300]   and at the very least, in the form of an email,
[01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:42.060]   the memo to him stating, do you agree,
[01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:43.820]   is this what you've said to me,
[01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:45.140]   is this what you're communicating to me
[01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:47.840]   as far as your offer, so that you have that record.
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:51.580]   - Perfect, yeah, and in the meantime,
[01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:54.060]   I mean, it's not like I've been screwed out of a deal,
[01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:55.580]   I'm still making money.
[01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:58.300]   - Right, and that's important.
[01:26:58.300 --> 01:26:59.500]   And one thing you should expect
[01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:01.100]   is you should generally expect
[01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:03.860]   you're never going to have control of this company.
[01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:06.460]   And so that's one thing you should think about
[01:27:06.460 --> 01:27:09.580]   is yes, you're making money, but you need to make money now,
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:11.180]   but you're never gonna control this company.
[01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:13.340]   So let's say he makes you a very generous offer
[01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:16.180]   and he says, hey, if we do these certain things,
[01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:18.460]   I'll give you 40% of the company.
[01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:20.180]   That would probably be more than I would expect
[01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:21.460]   based upon what you're describing this,
[01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:23.900]   but okay, 40% of the company.
[01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:26.660]   You're never going to be in control of the company.
[01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:28.380]   You might be a trusted leader,
[01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:30.440]   you might be a manager, et cetera,
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:33.140]   but at the end of the day, you can always be fired
[01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:36.620]   and you're never gonna control the company, which is fine.
[01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:39.140]   We all take jobs that pay us a good amount of money
[01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:41.420]   and we don't control the company, we just do our job.
[01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:42.940]   But don't think that just because
[01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:44.540]   you have a little bit of equity in the company
[01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:47.260]   that you're going to be in control of the company.
[01:27:47.260 --> 01:27:49.900]   I think one of the things that disappoints some people
[01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:52.740]   is they're building their way up in their career,
[01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:57.180]   they find somebody who says, who recognizes their value
[01:27:57.180 --> 01:27:59.220]   and that person comes to them and says,
[01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:01.620]   listen, I think you should come and work with me
[01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:03.180]   and not only will I pay you a salary,
[01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:05.140]   but I'll give you equity in the company.
[01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:06.220]   That's great.
[01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:08.100]   It can give you extra compensation,
[01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:09.880]   it can allow you to have a performance incentive
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:11.860]   for being involved in it, et cetera.
[01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:14.380]   But if you recognize yourself as the kind of person
[01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:17.420]   who just needs to be in charge, who wants to be in charge,
[01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:20.900]   who wants to have the control over your destiny,
[01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:23.180]   and if you think that that's important to you,
[01:28:23.180 --> 01:28:26.020]   don't think that just because you have equity in the company
[01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:28.260]   that that's going to do it for you.
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:29.340]   I warn you about that simply
[01:28:29.340 --> 01:28:30.820]   because that's been something for me.
[01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:33.060]   Like years ago when I was younger, I would have thought,
[01:28:33.060 --> 01:28:35.380]   man, if somebody just give me equity, then it'd be fine.
[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:37.200]   But what I've since learned about myself
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:40.280]   is that I like to be in charge, I like to be in control.
[01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:41.860]   Not because I'm a control freak
[01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:43.540]   or an authoritarian or something,
[01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:46.820]   but I like to have the opportunity that comes with control
[01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:49.260]   and I like to be free in my decisions.
[01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:51.380]   And so I've often thought, there was a guy,
[01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:52.860]   when I started Radical Personal Finance,
[01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:56.100]   there was a guy who already had a very established brand
[01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:57.680]   in the personal finance space.
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:03.020]   He made me an offer, he saw my potential,
[01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:05.260]   he saw what I brought to the table.
[01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:08.020]   I would probably have made more money,
[01:29:08.020 --> 01:29:10.180]   a lot more money working with him
[01:29:10.180 --> 01:29:12.760]   than doing what I have done.
[01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:15.820]   But I would never have been happy doing what I did,
[01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:17.700]   sorry, going and working with him,
[01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:19.420]   even though I would have made more money,
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:21.340]   because I would have felt like
[01:29:21.340 --> 01:29:23.340]   I wasn't doing what I wanted to do
[01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:25.700]   and it would have put me behind in my career.
[01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:27.020]   Because I would have worked with him
[01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:28.780]   and the longer I worked with him,
[01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:31.060]   those golden handcuffs would have gotten heavier
[01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:32.000]   and heavier and heavier
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.660]   and yet I still would have been stuck,
[01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:36.460]   feeling like I have to hide behind his brand,
[01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:38.540]   I have to do what I believe he wants me to do
[01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:40.540]   because he owns the company.
[01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:42.420]   And he never would have given me,
[01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:43.780]   he never would have sold the company to me,
[01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:46.400]   never would have given me control of the company,
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:47.820]   because he started it.
[01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:50.180]   And we would have always been two, in that sense,
[01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:52.420]   two alphas, fighting with each other.
[01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:55.420]   And so taking that offer would have been a mistake,
[01:29:55.420 --> 01:29:57.300]   even if it made me more money.
[01:29:57.300 --> 01:29:59.220]   So it doesn't sound like that's the case for you.
[01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:01.360]   It sounds like this is gonna be a great fit for you.
[01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:03.260]   But if you think that that might be the case,
[01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:05.740]   if you think that, you know what, I need to do this,
[01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:09.220]   then just be careful because you get in deep sometimes
[01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:11.780]   and those golden handcuffs become very heavy
[01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:13.100]   and you get accustomed to the money,
[01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:14.180]   you get accustomed to the life
[01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:15.980]   and then it's harder to break free.
[01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:17.820]   And so if you think that five years from now
[01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:19.020]   you're gonna break free,
[01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:23.080]   then you might take this deal
[01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:24.360]   and you might do it for a few years
[01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:27.400]   or you might just say no to it and do something yourself
[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:29.780]   because if that's the kind of personality you have,
[01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:31.480]   you need to pay attention to that.
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:35.280]   Otherwise, this can be a great way to make a lot of money
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:37.240]   and be involved in a business with very little risk
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:39.200]   and can be an awesome solution for you.
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:41.960]   - Perfect, thank you, sir.
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:43.080]   I appreciate your input.
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:48.080]   - My pleasure and I wish you a very wonderful day.
[01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:49.320]   Our other callers hung up,
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:53.240]   so that means that our call, our show is shorter for today.
[01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:55.780]   So as a wrap up here, what do I want to say to you?
[01:30:55.780 --> 01:31:02.600]   I don't think I have anything to say.
[01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:04.100]   We've had an interesting show,
[01:31:04.100 --> 01:31:07.680]   some technical financial options,
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:09.360]   some interesting business ideas,
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:11.000]   and some interesting discussions.
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.280]   So I hope that you'll take these ideas.
[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:14.800]   I guess the only thoughtful thing
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:16.040]   that I would add in conclusion
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:19.200]   would just be simply learn from other people's stories
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:22.200]   and you'll be able to make better decisions for yourself.
[01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:24.140]   And if you'll do that consistently over time,
[01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:25.400]   things will be better.
[01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:26.920]   I would love to talk to you next week.
[01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:27.760]   If you would like to do that,
