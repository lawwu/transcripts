[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480]   He said very specifically, "Depending on the questions you ask Putin, you could be arrested
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.480]   or not."
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.080]   And I said, "Listen to what you're saying.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.800]   You're saying the US government has control over my questions and they'll arrest me if
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.600]   I ask the wrong question?
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.740]   How are we better than Putin if that's true?"
[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.560]   Killing Navalny during the Munich Security Conference in the middle of a debate over
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.120]   $60 billion in Ukraine funding?
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.120]   Maybe the Russians are dumb.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.920]   I didn't get that vibe at all.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.080]   I don't think we kill people in other countries to affect election outcomes.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.080]   Oh, wait.
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.800]   No, we do it a lot and have for 80 years.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.080]   The following is a conversation with Tucker Carlson, a highly influential and often controversial
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.080]   political commentator.
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.640]   When he was a Fox, Time Magazine called him the most powerful conservative in America.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.360]   After Fox, he has continued to host big impactful interviews and shows on X, on the Tucker Carlson
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.360]   podcast and on TuckerCarlson.com.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.320]   I recommend subscribing, even if you disagree with his views.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.980]   It is always good to explore a diversity of perspectives.
[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.840]   Most recently, he interviewed the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.680]   We discussed this, the topic of Russia, Putin, Navalny and the war in Ukraine at length in
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.680]   this conversation.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.560]   Please allow me to say a few words about the very fact that I did this interview.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.000]   I have received a lot of criticism publicly and privately when I announced that I will
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.080]   be talking with Tucker.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.120]   For people who think I shouldn't do the conversation with Tucker or generally think that there
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.520]   are certain people I should never talk to, I'm sorry, but I disagree.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.680]   I will talk to everyone as long as they're willing to talk genuinely in long form for
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.240]   two, three, four more hours.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.480]   I will talk to Putin and to Zelensky, to Trump and to Biden, to Tucker and to Jon Stewart,
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.320]   AOC, Obama, and many more people with very different views on the world.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.040]   I want to understand people and ideas.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.440]   That's what long form conversations are supposed to be all about.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.000]   Now, for people who criticize me for not asking tough questions, I hear you, but again, I
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   disagree.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.920]   I do often ask tough questions, but I try to do it in a way that doesn't shut down
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.080]   the other person, putting them into a defensive state where they give only shallow talking
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.080]   points.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.720]   Instead, I'm looking always for the expression of genuinely held ideas and the deep roots
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.320]   of those ideas.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.480]   When done well, this gives us a chance to really hear out the guests and to begin to
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.400]   understand what and how they think.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.400]   And I trust the intelligence of you, the listener, to make up your own mind, to see through the
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.600]   bullshit, to the degree there's bullshit, and to see to the heart of the person.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.680]   Sometimes I fail at this, but I'll continue working my ass off to improve.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.960]   All that said, I find that this "no tough questions" criticism often happens when the
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.440]   guest is a person the listener simply hates and wants to see them grilled into embarrassment,
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:15.520]   called a liar, a greedy egomaniac, a killer, maybe even an evil human being, and so on.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.120]   If you are such a listener, what you want is drama, not wisdom.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.840]   In this case, this show is not for you.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.300]   There are many shows you can go to for that, with hosts that are way more charismatic and
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.200]   entertaining than I'll ever be.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.800]   If you do stick around, please know I will work hard to do this well, and to keep improving.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.800]   Thank you for your patience, and thank you for your support.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.060]   I love you all.
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.000]   This is the Alex Friedman Podcast.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.140]   To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.600]   And now, dear friends, here's Tucker Carlson.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.040]   What was your first impression when you met Vladimir Putin for the interview?
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.520]   I thought he seemed nervous, and I was very surprised by that.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.000]   And I thought he seemed like someone who'd overthought it a little bit, who had a plan,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.440]   and I don't think that's the right way to go into any interview.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.400]   My strong sense, having done a lot of them for a long time, is that it's better to know
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:23.280]   what you think, to say as much as you can, honestly, so you don't get confused by your
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.880]   own lies, and just to be yourself.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.000]   And I thought that he went into it like an overprepared student.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.280]   And I kept thinking, "Why is he nervous?"
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.880]   But I guess because he thought a lot of people were going to see it.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.480]   But he was also probably prepared to give you a full lesson in history, as he did.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.560]   Well, I was totally shocked by that, and very annoyed, because I thought he was filibustering.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.480]   I mean, I asked him, as I usually do, the most obvious, dumbest question ever, which
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.120]   is, "Why'd you do this?"
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.840]   And he had said, in a speech that I think is worth reading, I don't speak Russian, so
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.200]   I haven't heard it in the original, but he had said, at the moment of the beginning of
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:18.760]   the war, he had given this address to Russians, in which he explained, to the fullest extent
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.980]   we have seen so far, why he was doing this.
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.440]   And he said in that speech, "I fear that NATO, the West, the United States, the Biden
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.800]   administration, will preemptively attack us."
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.800]   And I thought, "Well, that's interesting."
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.040]   I mean, I can't evaluate whether that's a fear rooted in reality, or one rooted in paranoia,
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.000]   but I thought, "Well, that's an answer right there."
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.880]   And so I alluded to that in my question, and rather than answering it, he went off on this
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:51.960]   long, from my perspective, kind of tiresome, sort of greatest hits of Russian history,
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.500]   and the implication, I thought, was, "Well, Ukraine is ours, or Eastern Ukraine is ours
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.540]   already."
[00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.940]   And I thought he was doing that to avoid answering the question.
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:06.320]   So the last thing you want when you're interviewing someone is to get rolled.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.460]   And I didn't want to be rolled, so I, a couple of times, interrupted him, politely, I thought,
[00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.460]   but he wasn't having it.
[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.780]   And then I thought, "You know what, I'm not here to prove that I'm a great interviewer.
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.140]   It's kind of not about me.
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.620]   I want to know who this guy is.
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.900]   I think a Western audience, a global audience, has a right to know more about the guy, and
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:26.900]   so just let him talk."
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:32.020]   Because it's not, I don't feel like my reputation's on the line.
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.980]   People have already drawn conclusions about me, I suppose, to the extent they have.
[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.040]   I'm not interested, really, in those conclusions anyway, so just let him talk.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.860]   And so I calmed down, and just let him talk, and in retrospect, I thought that was really,
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:44.860]   really interesting.
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.220]   Whether you agree with it or not, or whether you think it's relevant to the war in Ukraine
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.420]   or not, that was his answer, and so it's inherently significant.
[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.140]   Well, you said he was nervous.
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.140]   Were you nervous?
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.140]   Were you afraid?
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.580]   This is Vladimir Putin.
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.180]   I wasn't afraid at all, and I wasn't nervous at all.
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.740]   Did you drink tea beforehand?
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.740]   No.
[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:09.760]   I did my normal regimen of nicotine pouches and coffee.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.600]   No, I'm not a tea drinker.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.680]   I tried not to eat all the sweets they put in front of us, which is, that is my weakness,
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.680]   is eating crap.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.280]   But you eat a lot of sugar, as you know, before an interview, and it does dull you, so I successfully
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.280]   resisted that.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.280]   But no, I wasn't nervous at all.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.280]   I wasn't nervous the whole time I was there.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.280]   Why would I be?
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:32.760]   I'm 54, my kids are grown, I believe in God, I'm almost never nervous.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.120]   But no, I wasn't nervous, I was just interested.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.960]   I mean, I'm interested in Soviet history, I studied it in college, I've read about it
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:39.960]   my entire life.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.000]   My dad worked in the Cold War, it was a constant topic of conversation.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.960]   And so to be in the Kremlin in a room where Stalin made decisions, either wartime decisions
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.120]   or decisions about murdering his own population, I just couldn't get over it.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.160]   We were in Molotov's old office.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.380]   So for me, I was just blown away by that.
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.200]   I thought I knew a lot about Russia.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.360]   It turns out I knew a lot about the Soviet period, the 1937 purge trials, the famine
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.040]   in Ukraine, I knew a fair amount about that, but I really knew nothing about contemporary
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.200]   Russia, less than I thought I did, it turned out.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:20.160]   But yeah, I was just blown away by where we were, and that's kind of one of the main drivers
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.800]   at this stage in my life.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.440]   That's why I do what I do, is because I'm interested in stuff and I want to see as much
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.740]   as I can and try and draw conclusions from it to the extent I can.
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.280]   So I was very much caught up in that, but no, I wasn't nervous, I didn't think he's
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.880]   going to kill me or something, and I'm not particularly afraid of that anyway.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.000]   Not afraid of dying?
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Not really.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   No.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.840]   I mean, again, it's an age and stage in life thing.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.960]   I mean, I have four children, so there were times when they were little where I was terrified
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:56.400]   of dying, because if I died, it would have huge consequences.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.000]   But no, I mean, at this point, I don't want to die, I'm really enjoying my life.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.800]   But I've been with the same girl for 40 years, and I have four children who I'm extremely
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.320]   close to, well, now five, a daughter-in-law.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.360]   And I love them all, I'm really close to them, I tell them I love them every day.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.200]   I've had a really interesting life.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.200]   What was the goal?
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.200]   Just linger on that.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.200]   What was the goal for the interview?
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.200]   How were you thinking about it?
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.720]   What would success be like in your head leading into it?
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.720]   To bring more information.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.720]   Disinformation.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.720]   To the public, yeah, that's it.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:33.960]   I mean, I have really strong feelings about what's happening, not just in Ukraine or Russia,
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.960]   but around the world.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.600]   I think the world is resetting to the grave disadvantage of the United States.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.400]   I don't think most Americans are aware of that at all.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:48.160]   And so that's my view, and I've stated it many times, because it's sincere.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:57.160]   But my goal was to have more information brought to the West so people could make their own
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.160]   decisions about whether this is a good idea.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.000]   I mean, I guess I reject the whole premise of the war in Ukraine from the American perspective,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.960]   which is a tiny group of dumb people in Washington has decided to do this for reasons they won't
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:14.480]   really explain, and you don't have a role in it at all as an American citizen, as the
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.080]   person who's paying for it, whose children might be drafted to fight it, just shut up
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.080]   and obey.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.000]   I just reject that completely.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.320]   I think I guess I'm a child of a different era.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.960]   I'm a child of participatory democracy to some extent, where your opinion as a citizen
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.960]   is not irrelevant.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:38.440]   And I guess the level of lying about it was starting to drive me crazy.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.000]   And I've said, and I will say again, I am not an expert on the region or really any
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.440]   region other than say, Western Maine.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.480]   I just don't, I'm not Russian.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:54.120]   But it was obvious to me that we were being lied to in ways that were just, it was crazy
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.120]   the scale of lies.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:00.640]   And I'll give you one example, the idea that Ukraine would inevitably win this war.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:06.120]   Now victory was never, as it never is, defined precisely, nothing is ever defined precisely,
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:10.560]   which is always a tell that there's deception at the heart of the claim, but Ukraine's on
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.560]   the verge of winning.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.560]   Well, I don't know.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.080]   I mean, I'm hardly a tactician or a military expert for the fifth time, I'm not an expert
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.080]   on Russia or Ukraine.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:24.400]   I just look at Wikipedia, Russia has 100 million more people than Ukraine, 100 million.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:32.460]   It has much deeper industrial capacity, war material capacity than all of NATO combined.
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:37.500]   For example, Russia is turning out artillery shells, which are significant in a ground
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:44.480]   war, at a ratio of seven to one compared to all NATO countries combined.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.280]   That's all of Europe.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:54.040]   Russia is producing seven times the artillery shells as all of Europe combined, what?
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.040]   That's an amazing fact.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.880]   And it turns out to be a really significant fact, in fact, the significant fact.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.760]   But if you ask your average person in this country, even a fairly well-informed person
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.680]   of good faith who's just trying to understand what's going on, who's going to win this war?
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.360]   Well, Ukraine's going to win, they're on the right side.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.800]   And they think that because our media, who really just do serve the interests of the
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.160]   US government, period, they are state media in that sense, have told them that for over
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.720]   two years.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:23.120]   And I was in Hungary last summer talking to the prime minister, Viktor Orban, who's a,
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:27.160]   you know, whatever you think of him, he's a very smart guy, very smart guy, like smart
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.520]   on a scale that we're not used to in our leaders.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.320]   And I said to him off camera, "So is Ukraine going to win?"
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:37.760]   And he looked at me like I was deranged, like I was congenitally, you know, deficient.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.720]   "Are they going to win?"
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.320]   "No, of course they can't win.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.560]   It's tiny compared to Russia.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.600]   Russia has a wartime economy.
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.000]   Ukraine doesn't really have an economy.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.040]   Look at the populations."
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.320]   He was like, looked at me like I was stupid.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.380]   And I said to him, "You know, I think most Americans believe that because NBC News and
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:13:00.040]   CNN and all the news channels, all of them tell them that because it's framed exclusively
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.800]   in moral terms and it's Churchill versus Hitler, and of course, Churchill's going to prevail
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.200]   in the end."
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.480]   And it's just so dishonest that even it doesn't even matter what I want to happen or what
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.240]   I think ought to happen.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.440]   That's a distortion of what is happening.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.600]   And if I have any job at all, which I sort of don't actually at this point, but if I
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.360]   do have a job, it's to just try to be honest.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.360]   And that's a lie.
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:24.080]   There is a more nuanced discussion about what winning might look like.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.080]   You're right.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.080]   For sure.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:30.160]   I mean, the debate is not being had, but it is possible for Ukraine to "win" with the
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.480]   help of the United States.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.720]   I guess that conversation needs to begin by defining terms.
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.280]   And the key term is "win."
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.280]   What does that mean?
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.400]   Peace, a ceasefire, who owns which land.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.400]   Yes.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.920]   Coming to the table with, as you call it, the parent, the United States.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:49.920]   Yes.
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.360]   Putting leverage on the negotiation to make sure there's a fairness.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.360]   Amen.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:14:02.360]   Well, of course, and I should just restate this, I am not emotionally involved in this.
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:06.360]   I'm American in every sense, and my only interest is in America.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.000]   I'm not leaving, ever.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.400]   And so I'm looking at this purely from our perspective, what's good for us.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:17.880]   But also as a human being, as a Christian, I mean, I hate war, and anybody who doesn't
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.280]   hate war shouldn't have power, in my opinion.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:27.080]   So I agree with that definition vehemently.
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:32.640]   A victory is like not killing an entire generation of your population.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.920]   It's not being completely destroyed to be eaten up by Black Rock or whatever comes next
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:37.920]   for them.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.560]   So yeah, we were close to that a year and a half ago, and the Biden administration dispatched
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:49.280]   Boris Johnson, the briefly Prime Minister of the UK, to stop it and to say to Zelensky,
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.360]   who I feel sorry for, by the way, because he's caught between these forces that are
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:58.460]   bigger than he is, to say, "No, you cannot come to any terms with Russia."
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:02.320]   And the result of that has not been a Ukrainian victory, it's just been more dead Ukrainians
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.280]   and a lot of profit for the West.
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.560]   It's a moral crime, in my opinion.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.520]   And I tried to ask Boris Johnson about it, because why wouldn't I, after he denounced
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:16.520]   me as a tool of the Kremlin or something, and he demanded a million dollars to talk
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.520]   to me.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.520]   Wow.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.520]   And this just happened last week.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.240]   And by the way, in writing, too, I'm not making this up, I'm not making this up.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.920]   Just for the record, you demanded a million dollars from me to talk to me today.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:27.920]   I did.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.920]   And you paid.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.600]   No, I'm, of course, kidding.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:36.960]   And I said to his guy, I said, "I just interviewed Putin, who was widely recognized as a bad
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.800]   guy, and he did it for free, he didn't demand a million dollars, he wasn't in this for profit.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.600]   Like are you telling me that Boris Johnson is sleazier than Vladimir Putin?"
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.840]   And of course, that is the message.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:54.160]   And so I guess these are really, it's not just about Boris Johnson being a sad, rapacious
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:16:01.040]   fraud, which he is, obviously, but it's about the future of the West and the future of Ukraine,
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.360]   this country that purportedly we care so much about, all these people are dying, and what
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.800]   is the end game?
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:11.560]   It's also deranged that I didn't imagine and don't imagine that I could add anything very
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:16.020]   meaningful to the conversation, because I'm not a genius, okay?
[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:22.080]   But I felt like I could, at the very least, puncture some of the lies, and that's an inherent
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.080]   good.
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:27.000]   Vladimir Putin, after the interview, said that he wasn't fully satisfied because you
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   weren't aggressive enough, you didn't ask sharp enough questions.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.200]   First of all, what do you think about him saying that?
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.680]   I don't even understand it.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:42.640]   I guess it does seem like the one Putin statement that Western media take at face value.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:46.160]   Everything else Putin says is a lie, except his criticism of me, which is true.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.360]   But I mean, I have no idea what he meant by that.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:55.000]   I can only tell you what my goal was, as I've suggested, was not to make it about me.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.640]   I watched, he hasn't done any interviews of any kind for years, but the last interview
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:06.720]   he did with an English-speaking reporter, Western media reporter, was like many of the
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.320]   other interviews he'd done with Western media reporters.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:13.900]   Mike Wallace's son did an interview with him that was of the same variety, and it was
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:14.900]   all about him.
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.440]   "I'm a good person, you're a bad person."
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:22.000]   And I just feel like that's the most tiresome, fruitless kind of interview.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   It's not about me.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.720]   I don't think I'm an especially good person, I've definitely never claimed to be, but people
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.720]   can make their own judgments.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.800]   And again, the only judgments that I care about are my wife and children and God.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.600]   So I'm just not interested in proving I'm a good person.
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.680]   And I just want to hear from him.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:41.640]   And I had a lot of, I mean, you should see, I almost never write questions down, but I
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.320]   did in this case, because I had months, well, I had three years to think about it as I was
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:49.000]   trying to book the interview, which I did myself.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.800]   But they were all, it was all about internal Russian politics and Navalny, and I had a
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.160]   lot of, I thought, really good questions.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.160]   And then at the last second, and you make these decisions, as you know, since you interview
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:06.360]   people a lot, often you make them on the fly, and I thought, "No, I want to talk about the
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:10.400]   things that haven't been talked about and that I think matter in a world historic sense."
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:15.840]   And the number one among those, of course, is the war and what it means for the world.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.400]   And so I stuck to that, I mean, I could answer.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:24.960]   I did ask about Gershkovich, who I felt sorry for, and I wanted Putin to release him to
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.520]   me, and I was offended that he didn't.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.120]   I thought his rationale was absurd.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.200]   "Well, we want to trade him for someone."
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.480]   I said, "Well, doesn't that make him a hostage?"
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.400]   Which of course it does.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:39.200]   But other than that, I really wanted to keep it to the things that I think matter most.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:44.680]   You know, people can judge whether I did a good job or not, but that was my decision.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.120]   In the moment, what was your gut?
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:51.720]   Did you want to ask some tough questions as follow-ups on certain topics?
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.400]   I don't know what it would mean to ask a tough question.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.640]   Clarifying questions, I suppose they would...
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.640]   I guess.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.640]   I just wanted him to talk.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.400]   You know, I just wanted to hear his perspective.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:08.880]   And I've probably asked more asshole questions than like any living American, you know.
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:15.080]   As has been noted correctly, I'm a dick by my nature, and so I don't...
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.200]   I just feel at this stage in my life, I didn't need to prove that I could be like, "Vladimir
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.200]   Putin answered a question!"
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.200]   Sure.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.200]   For sure.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.960]   You know, I think if I had been, you know, 34 instead of 54, I definitely would have
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.240]   done that, because I would have thought, "This is really about me, and I need to prove myself,"
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.240]   and all that stuff.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.240]   But I just...
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:36.840]   There's a war going on that is wrecking the US economy in a way and at a scale people
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:37.840]   do not understand.
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.800]   The US dollar is going away.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:44.160]   That was, of course, inevitable, ultimately, because everything dies, including currencies.
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:49.980]   But that death, that process of death, has been accelerated exponentially by the behavior
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:53.880]   of the Biden administration and the US Congress, particularly the sanctions.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.940]   And people don't understand what the ramifications of that are.
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:59.040]   The ramifications are poverty in the United States, okay?
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:05.480]   So I just wanted to get to that, because I'm coming at this from not a global perspective.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.160]   I'm coming at it from an American perspective.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.360]   So you mentioned Navalny.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.760]   After you left, Navalny died in prison.
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:15.760]   Yes.
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.720]   What are your thoughts on just at a high level first about his death?
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.720]   It's awful.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.640]   I mean, imagine dying in prison.
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.920]   You know, I've thought about it a lot.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:29.240]   I've known a lot of people in prison, a lot, including some very good friends of mine.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.600]   So I felt instantly sad about it.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.360]   From a geopolitical perspective, I don't know any more than that.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:43.480]   And I laugh at and sort of resent, but mostly find amusing, the claims by American politicians
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:47.080]   who really are the dumbest politicians in the world, actually.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.440]   You know, "This happened, and here's what it means."
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.780]   And it's like, actually, as a factual matter, we don't know what happened.
[00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:53.780]   We don't know what happened.
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:55.700]   We have no freaking idea what happened.
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:21:00.640]   We can say, and I did say, and I will say again, I don't think you should put opposition
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.640]   figures in prison.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:02.640]   I really don't.
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.640]   I don't.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.640]   Period.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:08.080]   It happens a lot around the world, happens in this country, as you know, and I'm against
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.880]   all of it.
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.760]   But do we know how he died?
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.080]   The short answer, no, we don't.
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:21.240]   Now if I had to guess, I would say killing Navalny during the Munich Security Conference
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:26.020]   in the middle of a debate over $60 billion in Ukraine funding.
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.020]   Maybe the Russians are dumb.
[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.160]   I didn't get that vibe at all.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.880]   You know, I just don't, I don't see it, but maybe, you know, maybe they killed him.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:37.300]   I mean, they certainly put him in prison, which I'm against, but here's what I do know
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.040]   is that we don't know.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:44.400]   And so when Chuck Schumer stands up and, "Rawr," Joe Biden reads some card in front of him
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:48.280]   with lines about Navalny, it's like, I'm allowed to laugh at that because it's absurd.
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.280]   You don't know.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.760]   There's a lot of interesting ideas about if he was killed, who killed him because it
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.560]   could be Putin.
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.440]   It could be somebody in Russia who is not Putin.
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.760]   It could be Ukrainians because it would benefit the war.
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:07.000]   They killed Dugin's daughter in Moscow, so yeah, that's possible.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.620]   And it could be, I mean, the United States could also be involved.
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.760]   I don't think we kill people in other countries to affect election outcomes.
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:18.920]   Oh wait, no, we do it a lot and have for 80 years and it's shameful.
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:22.120]   I can say that as an American because it's my money and my name.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.080]   Yeah, I'm really offended by that.
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.520]   And I never thought that was true and I spent, again, I'm much older than you.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:34.920]   And so I spent, my worldview was defined by the Cold War and very much in the house I
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:38.320]   lived in, in Georgetown in Washington, DC, that's what we talked about.
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:44.880]   And yeah, and the left at the time, I don't know, the wacko MIT professor who I never
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.600]   had any respect for, who I know you've interviewed, et cetera.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.480]   The hard left was always saying, "Oh, the United States government is interfering in
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.480]   other elections."
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:58.920]   And I just dismissed that completely out of hand as stupid and actually a slander against
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:22:59.920]   my country.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:03.040]   But it turned out to all be true or substantially true anyway.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.880]   And that's been a real shock for me in middle age to understand that.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:10.200]   But anyway, as to Navalny, look, I don't know.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:15.440]   But we should always proceed on the basis of what we do know, which is to say on the
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.320]   basis of truth, knowable truth.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:23.280]   And if you have an entire policymaking apparatus that is making the biggest decisions on the
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:27.920]   face of the planet, on the basis of things that are bullshit or lies, you're gonna get
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:31.040]   bad outcomes every time.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.040]   Every time.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.040]   And that's where we are.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:39.400]   - Does it bother you that basically the most famous opposition figure in Russia is sitting
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.400]   in prison?
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.360]   - Well, of course it does.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.360]   Of course it bothers me.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.760]   I mean, it bothered me when I got there, it bothers me now, I was sad when he died.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:52.720]   Yeah, I mean, that's one of the measures of, it's one of the basic measures of political
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.720]   freedom.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.320]   Are you imprisoning people who oppose you?
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.040]   You know, are you imprisoning people who pose a physical risk to you?
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:06.520]   I mean, there's some subjective decision-making involved in these things.
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:11.460]   However, big picture, yeah, do you have opposition leaders in jail?
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:17.540]   That's not a free, it's not a politically free society, and Russia isn't, obviously.
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:21.900]   And as I said, a friend of mine from childhood, an American actually, he was a wonderful person,
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:25.020]   lives in Russia with his Russian, well, Moscow, with his Russian wife.
[00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.020]   And I had dinner with him.
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:32.860]   He's a very balanced guy, totally non-political person, and speaks Russian and loves his many
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:36.100]   Russian children and loves the culture, and there's a lot to love.
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:39.980]   The culture that produced Tolstoy, you know, it's not a gas station with nuclear weapons,
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:40.980]   sorry.
[00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:41.980]   Some moron would say that.
[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:42.980]   It's a very deep culture.
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.100]   I don't fully understand it, of course, but I admire it.
[00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:47.100]   Who wouldn't?
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.740]   But I asked him, like, "What's it like living here?"
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:50.260]   And he goes, "You know, it's great.
[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.020]   Moscow is a great city, indisputably."
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.460]   He said, "You don't want to get involved in Russian politics."
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.220]   And I said, "What?"
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:58.380]   He said, "Well, you could get hurt.
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:02.980]   You could wind up like Navalny if you did, but also it's just too complicated."
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.300]   You know, the Russian mind is not exactly the same.
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:10.060]   It's a Western, it's a European city, but it's not quite European.
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:13.580]   And the way they think is very, very complex.
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:14.580]   Very complex.
[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:15.580]   It's just, it's too complicated.
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:16.660]   Just don't get involved.
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:20.740]   And I would just say two things.
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:25.180]   One, I'm not sure, I mean, like, I don't know.
[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:29.460]   But my strong sense is that Navalny's death, whoever did it, probably didn't have a lot
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:32.980]   to do with the coming election in Russia.
[00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:36.220]   My sense from talking to Putin and the people around him is they're not really focused on
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:37.220]   that.
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.940]   I mean, I asked one of his top advisors, "When's the election?"
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.020]   And she looked at me completely confused.
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.820]   She didn't know the date of the election, okay?
[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.820]   She's like, "March?"
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:46.940]   Okay.
[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:51.460]   And I asked a bunch of other people just in Moscow, "Who's Putin running against?"
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:52.980]   Like nobody knew.
[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:58.980]   So it's not a real election, right, in the sense that we would recognize at all.
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:04.900]   Second, I was really struck by so many things in Moscow and really bothered by, deeply bothered
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:08.260]   by a lot of things that I saw there.
[00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:13.660]   But one thing I noticed was the total absence of cult of personality propaganda, which I
[00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.460]   expected to see and have seen around the world.
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:17.460]   Jordan, for example.
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.700]   I don't know if you've been to Jordan, but go to Jordan.
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.080]   In every building, there are pictures of the king and his extended family.
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.260]   And that's a sign of political insecurity.
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:29.640]   You don't create a cult of personality unless you're personally insecure and also unless
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.860]   you're worried about losing your grip and power.
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:32.860]   None of that.
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:33.860]   It's interesting.
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.780]   I expected to see a lot of it, like statues of Putin.
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:37.780]   No.
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:41.660]   There are no statues of anybody other than like Christian saints.
[00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:46.220]   So that was like, I'm not quite sure, I'm just reporting what I saw.
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:52.900]   So yes, it's not a, in a political sense, it's not a free country, it's not a democracy
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:56.220]   in the way that we would understand it or I don't want to live there, okay, because
[00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.220]   I like to say what I think.
[00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:01.020]   In fact, I make my living doing it.
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:05.180]   But it's not Stalinist in a recognizable way.
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:08.140]   And anyone who says it is, should go there and tell me how.
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:14.540]   I mean, this question about the freedom of the press is underlying the very fact of the
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.180]   interview you're having with him.
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:17.180]   Right.
[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:21.620]   So you might not need to ask the Navalny question, but did you feel like, are there things I
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:23.580]   shouldn't say?
[00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.580]   I mean, how honest do you want me to be?
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:32.860]   I mean it when I say I felt not one twinge of concern for the eight days that I was there.
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:33.860]   Maybe I just didn't.
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:37.780]   And I feel like I've got a pretty strong gut sense of things.
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:38.780]   I rely on it.
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:45.360]   I make all my decisions based on how I feel, my instincts, and I didn't feel it at all.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:49.180]   My lawyers before I left, and these are people who work for a big law firm, this is not Bob's
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:52.540]   law firm, this is one of the biggest law firms in the world, said, "You're going to get arrested
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:57.120]   if you do this by the U.S. government on sanctions violations."
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:02.340]   And I said, "Well, I don't recognize the legitimacy of that actually, because I'm American and
[00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:07.540]   I've lived here my whole life and that's so outrageous that I'm happy to face that risk
[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.780]   because I so reject the premise, okay?
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:11.780]   I'm an American.
[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.620]   I should be able to talk to anyone I want to, and I plan to exercise that freedom, which
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:15.620]   I think I was born with."
[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:20.460]   And I gave them this long lecture, they're like, "We're just lawyers."
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:25.940]   But that was, it was, let me put it this way, I don't know how much you dealt with lawyers,
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.940]   but it costs many thousands of dollars to get a conclusion like that.
[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:33.460]   They sent a whole bunch of their summer associates or whatever.
[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:37.460]   They put a lot of people on this question, checked a lot of precedent, and I think, and
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:43.740]   they sent me a 10-page memo on it, and their sincere conclusion was, "Do not do this."
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:47.020]   And of course it made me mad, so I was lecturing on the phone and I had another call with the
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:52.660]   head lawyer and he said, "Look, a lot will depend on the questions that you ask Putin.
[00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:56.340]   If you're seen as too nice to him, you could get arrested when you come back."
[00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:00.180]   And I was like, "You're describing a fascist country, okay?
[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:03.340]   You're saying that the US government will arrest me if I don't ask the questions they
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:04.340]   want asked?
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.340]   Is that what you're saying?"
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:08.460]   "Well, we just think based on what's happened that that's possible."
[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:11.620]   And so I'm just telling you what happened.
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:15.700]   So you were okay being arrested in Moscow and arrested in-
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:20.460]   I didn't think for a second, I mean, maybe, look, I don't speak Russian, I'd never been
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.100]   there before.
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:27.040]   Everything about the culture was brand new to me.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:31.660]   Ignorance does protect you sort of when you have no freaking idea what's going on, you're
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:32.660]   not worried about it.
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:35.220]   This has happened to me many times.
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.500]   There's a principle there that extends throughout life.
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:41.340]   So it's completely possible that I was in grave peril and didn't know it, because how
[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:42.940]   would I know it?
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:45.500]   I'm like a bumbling English speaker from California.
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:48.700]   But I didn't feel it at all.
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:49.700]   But the lawyers did.
[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:53.460]   Yeah, I mean, it scared the crap out of people you're going to...
[00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:57.460]   And look, you have to pay in cash, they don't take credit cards because of sanctions and
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:02.100]   you have to go through all these hoops, just procedural hoops to go to Russia, which I
[00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:05.620]   was willing to do because I wanted to interview Putin because they told me I couldn't.
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:10.500]   But then there's another fact, which is that I was being surveilled by the US government,
[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.860]   intensely surveilled by the US government.
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:16.060]   And this came out, they admitted it, the NSA admitted it a couple of years ago, that they
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.820]   were up in my Signal account.
[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:21.740]   And then they leaked it to the New York Times, they did that again before I left.
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:28.700]   And I know that because two New York Times reporters, one of whom I actually like a lot,
[00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.380]   said, "Oh, you're going..." and called other people, "Oh, he's going to interview Putin."
[00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:36.540]   I hadn't told anybody that, like anybody, like my wife, two producers, that's it.
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.060]   So they got that from the government.
[00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:42.900]   Then I'm over there and of course I want to see Snowden, who I admire.
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:48.100]   And so we have a mutual friend, so I got his text and come on over and Snowden does not
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:51.180]   want publicity at all.
[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:52.740]   But I really wanted to have dinner with him.
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:57.620]   So we had dinner in my hotel room at the Four Seasons in Moscow.
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:04.100]   And I tried to convince him, I'd love to do an interview, shoot it on my iPhone, I'd love
[00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:08.060]   to take a picture together and put it on the internet because I just want to show support
[00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:09.300]   because I think he's been railroaded.
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:14.380]   He had no interest in living in Russia, no intention of being in Russia, the whole thing
[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:15.380]   is a lie.
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:16.540]   But anyway, whatever, all this stuff.
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:19.980]   And he just said respectfully, "I'd rather not anyone know that we met."
[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:20.980]   Great.
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:26.300]   The only reason I'm telling you this is because... and I didn't tell anybody and I didn't text
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:28.140]   it to anybody, okay?
[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:31.140]   Except him.
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:40.860]   Snowden, for semaphore, runs this piece saying, reporting information they got from the US
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:46.700]   intel agencies leaking against me using my money and my name in a supposedly free country.
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:50.940]   They run this piece saying I'd met with Snowden, like it was a crime or something.
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:55.300]   So again, my interest is in the United States and preserving freedoms here, the ones that
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:56.300]   I grew up with.
[00:31:56.460 --> 00:32:02.340]   And if you have a media establishment that acts as an auxiliary of, or acts as employees
[00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:05.940]   of the national security state, you don't have a free country.
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.260]   And that's where we are.
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:12.180]   And I'm not guessing because I spent my entire life in that world, 33 years I worked in big
[00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.180]   news companies.
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:14.180]   And so I know how it works.
[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:19.540]   I know the people involved in it, I could name them, Ben Smith of Semaphore, among many
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:20.540]   others.
[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:25.180]   And I find that really objectionable, not just on principle either, in effect, in practice.
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:26.820]   You don't want to live in that kind of country.
[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:31.420]   And people are like, they externalize all of their anxiety about this, I have noticed.
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:33.100]   So it's like, Russia's not free.
[00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:35.780]   Yeah, I know.
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.980]   Neither is Burkina Faso.
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.740]   Most countries aren't free actually, but we are.
[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:42.700]   We're the United States, we're different.
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:45.940]   And that's my concern, preserving that is my concern.
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:50.420]   And so they get so exercised about what's happening in other parts of the world, places
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:54.500]   they've never been, know nothing about, it's almost a way of ignoring what's happening
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.140]   in their own country right around them.
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:33:00.500]   I find it so strange and sad and weird.
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:06.420]   So the NSA was tracking you, as do you think CIA was, is people still tracking you?
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:11.220]   Look, one of the things I did before I went, just because of the business I'm in, all of
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:16.340]   us are in, and just because we live here, we all have theories about secure communications
[00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:17.380]   channels.
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:23.100]   Like Signal is secure, Telegraph isn't, or WhatsApp is owned by Mark Zuckerberg, you can't
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:24.580]   trust anyone else, okay.
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:29.100]   So I thought, before I go over here, I was getting all this, we're having all these conversations,
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:31.340]   my producers and I, about this.
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:36.180]   And I decide, I'm just gonna actually find out what's really going on.
[00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:44.260]   So I talked to two people who would know, trust me, and it's all I can say, and I hate
[00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:48.340]   to be like, "Oh, I talked to people who would know, but I can't do it," but I mean it, they
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:49.540]   would know.
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:52.900]   And both of them said exactly the same thing, which is, "Are you joking?
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.300]   Everything is secure.
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.540]   Everything is monitored all the time."
[00:33:55.540 --> 00:34:00.460]   If state actors are involved, I mean, you can keep the, you know, whatever, the Malaysian
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:03.500]   mafia from reading your texts, probably.
[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:07.500]   You cannot keep the big intel services from reading your texts, it's not possible, any
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:11.460]   of them, or listening to your calls.
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:15.060]   And that was the firm conclusion of people who've been involved in it, you know, for
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:16.980]   a long time, decades, in both cases.
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:22.460]   So I just thought, you know what, I don't care, I don't care, I'm not sending a ton
[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.860]   of naked pictures of myself to anybody.
[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:25.860]   Not a ton, just a little.
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:30.420]   Not a ton, I'm 54, dude, probably not too many.
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:37.220]   But so I'm like, I'm just, so the guys travel with three people I work with who I love,
[00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:40.860]   who I've been around the world with for many years, and I know them really, really well,
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:45.560]   and they all got, you know, separate phones, and I'm leaving my other phone back in New
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:50.780]   York or whatever, and I just decided I don't care, actually.
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:58.860]   And I resent having no privacy, because privacy is a prerequisite for freedom.
[00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:02.100]   But I can't change it, and so I have the same surveilled cell phone.
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:09.820]   And you know, I do switch them out because, there it is, because if you have too much
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:14.820]   spyware on your phone, this is true, it wrecks the battery.
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:18.060]   And no, I'm serious, it does.
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:23.700]   And we got, it was, I don't know, five or six years ago, we went to North Korea, and
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.940]   my phone started acting crazy.
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:29.460]   And so I talked to someone on the National Security Council, who actually called me about
[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:34.300]   this, somehow knew that your phone is being surveilled by the South Korean government.
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:38.300]   I was like, why the, I like the South Korean government, why would they do that?
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:41.940]   Because they want more information, they thought I was talking to Trump or whatever.
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:47.100]   So, but I could tell because all of a sudden the thing would just drain in like 45 minutes.
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:50.740]   So that is, that's a downside.
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:54.020]   - So you keep switching phones, getting new phones for the battery life.
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:59.460]   - Yeah, I mean, I try not to do it, you know, I'm kind of flinty Yankee type in some ways,
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:03.660]   so I don't like to spend $1,000 with a freaking Apple corporation too often.
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:04.660]   But yeah, I do.
[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:09.060]   - I mean, you say it lightly, but it's really troublesome that you as a journalist would
[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:10.060]   be tracked.
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:12.980]   - Well, they leaked it to Semaphore, and they leaked it to the New York Times.
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:16.700]   Look, it's, I would even put up, well, there's nothing I can do.
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:19.180]   I have to put up with everything, okay.
[00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:24.660]   But I would probably not be actively angry about being surveilled because I'm just so
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:29.700]   old and I'm, I actually do pay my taxes, I'm not sleeping with a makeup artist or whatever.
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.340]   So I don't care that much.
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:36.460]   The fact that they are leaking against me, that the intel services in the United States
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:43.100]   are actively engaged in US politics and media, that's so unacceptable.
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.080]   That makes democracy impossible.
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.300]   There's no defense of that.
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:50.500]   And yet NBC News, Ken Delanian, and the rest will defend it.
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:55.180]   And it's like, and not just on NBC News, by the way, on the supposedly conservative channels
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:56.260]   too, they will defend it.
[00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:57.340]   And there's no defending that.
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:04.620]   You can't have democracy if the intel services are tampering in elections and information,
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:05.620]   period.
[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:11.480]   - So you had no fear, your lawyer said, "Be careful which questions you asked."
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.820]   You said, "I don't have."
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:18.020]   - Well, the lawyer said, no, he said very specifically, "Depending on the questions
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:23.580]   you ask, Putin, you could be arrested or not."
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:25.380]   And I said, "Listen to what you're saying.
[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:29.100]   You're saying the US government has control over my questions and they'll arrest me if
[00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:30.100]   I ask the wrong question?
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.780]   Like, how are we better than Putin if that's true?"
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:37.260]   And by the way, that's just what the lawyer said, but I can't overstate, one of the biggest
[00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:40.040]   law firms in the United States, smart lawyers we've used for years.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:42.700]   So I was really shocked by it.
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:44.900]   - You said leaders kill, leaders lie.
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:45.900]   - Yeah.
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:46.980]   I don't believe in leaders very much.
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:51.060]   Like this whole like, "Oh, Zelensky's Jesus and Putin's Satan."
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:53.780]   It's like, no, they're all leaders of countries, okay?
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:55.980]   Like grow up a little bit, you child.
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:58.020]   Have you ever met a leader?
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:37:59.020]   Like all of the...
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:04.500]   First of all, anyone who seeks power is damaged morally, in my opinion.
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:05.860]   You shouldn't be seeking power.
[00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:11.540]   You can't seek power or wealth for its own sake and remain a decent person.
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:13.020]   That's just true.
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:17.700]   So there aren't any like really virtuous billionaires and there aren't any really virtuous world
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:18.700]   leaders.
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:23.660]   You have grades of virtue, some are better than others for sure.
[00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:29.880]   But I mean, in other words, Zelensky may be better than Putin, I'm open to that possibility,
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:36.620]   but to claim that one is evil and the other is virtuous, it's like you're revealing that
[00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:37.620]   you're a child.
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:43.380]   I don't know anything about how the world actually is or what reality is, like it's...
[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:46.300]   That's quite a realist perspective, but there is a spectrum.
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:47.300]   There is a spectrum.
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:48.300]   Absolutely.
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:49.300]   I'm not saying they're all the same, they're not.
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:55.700]   And our task is to figure out where on the spectrum they lie and the leader's task is
[00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:59.260]   to confuse us and convince us they're one of the good guys.
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:00.260]   Of course.
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:02.100]   But I actually reject even that formulation.
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:03.660]   I don't think it's always about the leaders.
[00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:09.060]   I mean, of course, the leaders make the difference, a good leader has a healthy country and a
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:13.860]   bad leader has a decaying country, which is something to think about.
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:17.680]   But it's about the ideas and the policies and the practical effect of things.
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:23.500]   So we're very much caught up in the personalities of various leaders, not just our political
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:27.380]   leaders, but our business leaders, our cultural leaders, are they good people, do they have
[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:28.680]   the right thoughts?
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:33.640]   It's like, no, I ask a much more basic question, what are the fruits of their behavior?
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.900]   I always make it personal because I think everything is personal.
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:38.820]   Does his wife respect him?
[00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:39.820]   Do his children respect him?
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:40.820]   How are they doing?
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:45.100]   Is the country he runs thriving or is it falling apart?
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:48.820]   If your life expectancy is going down, if your suicide rate is going up, if your standard
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:51.100]   of living is tanking, you're not a good leader.
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:55.940]   I don't care what you tell me, I don't care what you claim you represent, I don't care
[00:39:55.940 --> 00:40:02.180]   about the ideas or the systems that you say you embody, it's dogs barking to me.
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:04.140]   How's your life expectancy?
[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.760]   How's your suicide rate?
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.000]   What's drug use like?
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.400]   Are people having children?
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:14.040]   Are people's children more likely to live in a freer, more prosperous society than you
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.520]   did and their grandparents did?
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:18.840]   Those are the only measures that matter to me, the rest is a lie.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:27.300]   But anyway, the point is, we just get so obsessed with the theater around people or people,
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:34.960]   and we miss the bigger things that are happening, and we allow ourselves to be deceived into
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:39.760]   thinking that what doesn't matter at all matters, that moral victories are all that matters.
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:42.480]   No, actually, facts on the ground victories matter more than anything.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:45.600]   I mean, you certainly see it in this country, Black Lives Matter, for example.
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:48.600]   How many black people did that help?
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:52.520]   It hurt a lot of black people, but in the end, we should be able to measure it.
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:57.540]   How many black people have died by gunfire in the four years since George Floyd died?
[00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:01.740]   Well, the number's gone way, way up, and that was a Black Lives Matter operation, defund
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:02.740]   the police.
[00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:08.980]   So I think we can say, as a factual matter, a data-based matter, Black Lives Matter didn't
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:10.660]   help black people.
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:11.660]   And if it did, tell me how.
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:14.780]   Well, these are important moral victories, I'm over that.
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:18.320]   That's just another lie, a long litany of lies.
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:22.620]   So I try to see the rest of the world that way, but more than anything, I try to see
[00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:27.260]   world events through the lens of an American, because I am one, and what does this mean
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:28.260]   for us?
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:35.420]   And it's not even the war, it's the sanctions that will forever change the United States,
[00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:39.580]   our standard of living, the way our government operates, that, more than any single thing
[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:43.740]   in my lifetime, screwed the United States.
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:48.960]   Having those sanctions in the way that we did was crazy, and for me, the main takeaway
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:54.960]   from my eight days in Moscow was not Putin, and he's a leader, whatever, none of them
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:42:00.640]   are that different, actually, in my pretty extensive experience, no, it was Moscow.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.360]   That blew my mind.
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:05.700]   I was not prepared for that at all, and I thought I knew a lot about Moscow.
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:09.400]   My dad worked there on and off in the '80s and '90s, he was a US government employee,
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:13.960]   and he was always coming back, "Moscow, it's a nightmare," and all this stuff, no electricity.
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:19.440]   I got there almost exactly two years after sanctions, totally cut off from Western financial
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:25.240]   systems, kicked out of SWIFT, can't use US dollars, no banking, no credit cards, and
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:30.880]   that city, just factually, I'm not endorsing the system, I'm not endorsing the whole country,
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:35.720]   I didn't go to Lake Baikal, I didn't go to Turkmenistan, I just went to Moscow, largest
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:40.880]   city in Europe, 13 million people, I drove all around it, and that city is way nicer,
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:47.360]   outwardly, anyway, I don't live there, than any city we have, by a lot, and by nicer,
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:53.320]   let me be specific, no graffiti, no homeless, no people using drugs in the street, totally
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:43:01.520]   tidy, no garbage on the ground, and no forest of steel and concrete soul-destroying buildings,
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:06.920]   none of the postmodern architecture that oppresses us without even our knowledge, none of that
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:13.920]   crap, it's a truly beautiful city, and that's not an endorsement of Putin, and by the way,
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:18.280]   it didn't make me love Putin, it made me hate my own leaders, because I grew up in a country
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:22.680]   that had cities kind of like that, that were nice cities, that were safe, and we don't
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.720]   have that anymore, and how did that happen?
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:25.720]   Did Putin do that?
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:29.160]   I don't think Putin did that, actually, I think the people in charge of it, the mayors,
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:33.040]   the governors, the president, they did that, and they should be held accountable for it.
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:39.480]   So I think cleanliness and architectural design is not the entirety of the metrics that matter
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:43.500]   when you measure a city, they're the main metrics that matter, they're the main metrics
[00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:49.480]   that matter, the main metrics that matter are cleanliness, safety, and beauty, in my
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:56.520]   opinion, and one of the big lies that we are told in our world is that no, something you
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:03.360]   can't measure that has no actual effect on your life matters most, bullshit.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:09.840]   What matters most, to say it again, beauty, safety, cleanliness, lots of other things
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:13.800]   matter too, a whole bunch of things matter, but if I were to put them in order, it's not
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:18.720]   some like theoretical, well, actually, I don't know if you know that the Duma has no power,
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:24.280]   okay, I get that, freedom of speech matters enormously to me, they have less freedom of
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:28.960]   speech in Russia than we do in the United States, we are superior to them in that way,
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:33.680]   but you can't tell me that living in a city where your six-year-old daughter can walk
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:39.080]   to the bus stop and ride on a clean bus, or ride in a beautiful subway car that's on time,
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:43.320]   and not get assaulted, that doesn't matter, no, that matters almost more than anything,
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:50.060]   actually, and we can have both, and like the normal regime defenders and morons, Jon Stewart
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:54.240]   or whatever he's calling himself, they're like, well, that's the price of freedom, like
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:57.760]   people shitting on the sidewalk is the price of freedom, it's like, you can't fool me because
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:02.560]   I've lived here for 54 years, I know that it's not the price of freedom, because I lived
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:07.880]   in a country that was both free and clean and orderly, so that's not a trade-off I think
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:13.080]   I have to make, you can't, that is the beauty of being a little bit older because you're
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:17.560]   like, no, I remember that actually, it wasn't what you're saying, we didn't have racial
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:22.960]   segregation in 1985, it was a really nice country that kind of respected itself, I was
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:26.960]   here, and I think with younger people, you can tell them that and they're like, oh, 1985,
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:31.400]   you were selling slaves in Madison Square Garden, it's like, no, you weren't, you're
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:35.040]   going to Madison Square Garden and not stepping over a single fentanyl addict.
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:40.960]   It is true, there doesn't have to be a trade-off between cleanliness and freedom of speech,
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:46.920]   but it is also true that in dictatorships, cleanliness and architectural design is easier
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:51.640]   to achieve and perfect, and often is done so, so you can show off, look how great our
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:54.240]   cities are, while you're suppressing...
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:46:00.760]   Of course, of course, I agree with that vehemently, this is not a defense of the Russian system
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:05.480]   at all, and if I felt that way, I would not only move there, but I would announce I was
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:06.480]   moving there.
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:10.320]   I'm not ashamed of my views, I never have been, and for all the people who are trying
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:15.320]   to impute secret motives to my words, I'm like the one person in America you don't need
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:18.540]   to do that with, if you think I'm a racist, ask me, and I'll tell you.
[00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:19.540]   Are you a racist?
[00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:20.540]   No, I am a sexist though.
[00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:21.540]   All right, great.
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:29.560]   Anyway, no, but if I was like a defender of Vladimir Putin, I would just say I'm defending
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:36.060]   Vladimir Putin now, I'm not, I am attacking our leaders, and I'm grieving over the low
[00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:40.240]   expectations of our people, you don't need to put up with this, you don't need to put
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:47.880]   up with foreign invaders stealing from you, occupying your kids' school, your kids can't
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:51.120]   get an education because people from foreign countries broke our laws and showed up here
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:56.360]   and they've taken over the school, that's not a feature of freedom actually, that's
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:02.720]   the opposite, that's what enslavement looks like, and so I'm just saying, raise your expectations
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:07.880]   a little bit, you can have a clean, functional, safe country, crime is totally optional, crime
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:11.760]   is something our leaders decide to have or not have, it's not something that just appears
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:17.120]   organically, I wrote a book about crime 30 years ago, I've thought a lot about this,
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:21.720]   you have as much crime as you put up with, period, and it doesn't make you less free
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:29.080]   to not tolerate murder, in fact, it makes you unfree to have a lot of murders, and so
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:35.680]   I just, but it makes me sad that people are like, well, I guess this is, I can't live
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:40.760]   in New York City anymore because of inflation and filth and illegal aliens and people shooting
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:47.120]   each other, but you know, I'm just, I'm glad because this is vibrant and strong and free,
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:50.640]   it's like, that's not freedom actually, at all.
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:54.840]   - Your point is well taken, you can have both, but do you regret--
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:57.380]   - We had both, that's the point, we had both, I saw it.
[00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:04.760]   - Do you regret to a degree using the Moscow subway and the grocery store as a mechanism
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:06.320]   by which to make that point?
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:14.480]   - No, I mean, I thought, I mean, look, I'm one of the more unselfaware people you will
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:23.880]   ever interview, so to ask me how will this be perceived, I literally have no idea, and
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:31.800]   kind of limited interest, but I was so shocked by it, I was so shocked by it, and there were
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:37.720]   two, and to the extent I regret anything and am to blame for anything, it would be not,
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:41.760]   and I've done this a lot, not giving it context, not fully explaining why are we doing this,
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:46.880]   the grocery store, I was shocked by the prices, and yes, I'm familiar with exchange rates,
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:51.200]   but very familiar with exchange rates, but those don't, and I adjusted them for exchange
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:58.600]   rates, and this is two years in to sanctions, total isolation from the West, so I would
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:02.000]   expect, in fact, I did expect until I got there that their supply chains would be crushed,
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.960]   how do you get good stuff if you don't have access to Western markets, and I didn't fully
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:11.120]   get the answer 'cause I was occupied doing other things when I was there, but somehow
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:16.240]   they have, and that's the point, and they haven't had the supply chains problems that
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:23.000]   I predicted, in other words, sanctions haven't made the country noticeably worse, okay, so
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.600]   again, this is commentary on the United States and our policy makers, why are we doing this?
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:32.360]   It's forcing the rest of the world into a block against us called BRICS, they're getting
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:36.440]   off the US dollar, that will mean a lot of dollars are gonna come back here and destroy
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:40.480]   our economy, and impoverish this country, so the consequences, the stakes are really
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:46.320]   high, they're huge, and we're not even hurting Russia, so what the hell are we doing, one,
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:52.040]   on the subway, that subway was built by Joseph Stalin right before the Second World War,
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:59.000]   I'm not endorsing Stalin, obviously, Stalinism is a thing that I hate, and I don't want to
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:04.240]   come to my country, I'm making the obvious point that for over 80 years, you've had these
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:08.400]   frescoes and chandeliers, maybe they've been redone or whatever, but somehow the society
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:12.800]   has been able to not destroy what its ancestors built, the things that are worth having, and
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:17.440]   they're a lot, and that, why don't we have that?
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:22.880]   And even on a much more terrestrial plane, why can't I have a subway station like that?
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:25.680]   Why can't my children who live in New York City ride the subway?
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:30.200]   A lot of people I know who live in New York City are afraid to ride the subway, young
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:32.480]   women especially, that's freedom?
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:38.320]   No, again, it's slavery, and how can, if Putin can do this, why can't we?
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:39.400]   Like what?
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:44.840]   It's not, in other words, I mean, this is so obvious, I'm a traitor, okay, so if I'm
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:50.540]   calling for American citizens to demand more from their government and higher standards
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:54.680]   for their own society, and remember that just 30 years ago, we had a much different and
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:51:00.200]   much happier and cleaner and healthier society, where everyone wasn't fat with diabetes at
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:05.840]   40 from poisoned food, like how is that, I'm not a traitor to my country, I'm a defender
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:06.840]   of my country.
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:12.240]   By the way, the people calling me a traitor, they're all like, whatever, they're not, I
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:16.480]   would not say they're people who put America's interests first, to put it mildly.
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:21.840]   There's many elements, like you said, you don't like Stalinism.
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:26.880]   You're a student of history, central planning is good at building subways in a way that's
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.200]   really nice.
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:33.720]   The thing that accounts for New York subways, by the way, there's a lot of really positive
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:40.240]   things about New York subways, not cleanliness, but the efficiency, the accessibility, how
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:49.400]   wide it spreads, the New York network is incredible, but Moscow, under different metrics, results
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:53.280]   of a capitalist system, and you actually said that you don't think U.S. is quite a capitalist
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.680]   system, which is an interesting question in itself.
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.640]   We have more central planning here than they do in Russia.
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:58.760]   No, that's not true.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:51:59.760]   Of course it is.
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:00.760]   You think that's true.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:01.760]   The climate agenda?
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:02.760]   Of course.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:07.640]   They're telling, the U.S. government has, in league with a couple of big companies,
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:11.280]   decided to change the way we produce and consume energy.
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:13.240]   There's no popular outcry for that.
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:18.040]   There's never been any mass movement of Americans who's like, "I just, I hate my gasoline-powered
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:19.040]   engine.
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.040]   No more diesel."
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:21.040]   That has been central planning.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:22.040]   That is central planning.
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:23.640]   And you see it up and down our economy.
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.160]   There's no free market in the United States.
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:27.620]   You get crossways with the government, you're done.
[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:30.800]   If you're at scale, I mean, maybe if you've got a barbershop or a liquor store or something,
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:35.360]   but even then, you're regulated by politicians.
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:38.680]   And so, no, I actually am for free markets.
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:39.760]   I hate monopolies.
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:42.200]   Our economy is dominated by monopolies.
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.200]   Completely dominated-
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:44.200]   What do you mean?
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:45.200]   Google.
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.920]   What percentage of search does Google have?
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:47.920]   90?
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:52.160]   Google's a monopoly, by any definition, and Google is just rich enough to continue doing
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:55.160]   whatever it wants in violation of U.S. law.
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:58.560]   So there's no monopoly in Russia as big as Google.
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:00.400]   I'm not, again, defending the Russian system.
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:05.280]   I'm calling for a return to our old system, which was sensible and moderate, and put the
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:11.840]   needs of Americans at least somewhere in the top 10, somewhere in the top 10.
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:16.960]   I'm not saying that Standard Oil was interested in the welfare of average Americans, but I
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:22.280]   am saying that there was a constituency in our political system, in the Congress, for
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:24.640]   example, different presidential candidates were like, "No, wait a second.
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:25.680]   What is this doing to people?
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:26.880]   Is it good for people or not?"
[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:28.520]   There's not even a conversation about that.
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:31.320]   It's like, "Shut up and submit to AI."
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:32.440]   And no offense.
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:33.440]   And so I'm just-
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:34.440]   Offense taken.
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:35.440]   I'm just-
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:38.800]   I will write, "We will get you," when it's strong enough.
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:39.800]   I have no doubt.
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:40.800]   You'll be the first one to go.
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.920]   Well, as a white man, I just won't even exist anymore, so.
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:44.080]   So much to say on that one.
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:48.760]   I bet when you Google my picture, 20 years from now, it'll be a black chick.
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:49.760]   100%.
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:52.440]   Well, I hope she's attractive.
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:53.440]   I hope so too.
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:57.320]   It'd probably be an upgrade.
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:02.560]   So well, the central planning point is really interesting, but I just don't know where you're
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:03.560]   coming from.
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:09.640]   Because the capitalist system, I mean, the United States is one of the most successful
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:12.800]   capitalist system in the history of Earth.
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:13.800]   So to say-
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:14.800]   Well, it's the most successful.
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:17.920]   I'm just saying that I think it's changed a lot in the last 15 years, and that we need
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:21.760]   to update our assumptions about what we're seeing.
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:23.120]   And that's true up and down.
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:24.120]   That's true with everything.
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:26.600]   It's true with your neighbor's children, who you haven't seen in three years, and they
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:29.760]   come home from Wesleyan, and you're like, "Oh, you've grown."
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:32.160]   That is true for the world around us as well.
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:36.160]   And most of our assumptions about immigration, about our economy, about our tax system are
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:41.760]   completely outdated if you compare them to the current reality.
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:45.720]   And so I'm just for updating my files, and I have a big advantage over you because I
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:47.800]   am middle aged, and so I don't-
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:49.760]   You've called yourself old so many times throughout the summer.
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:53.600]   I don't trust my perceptions of things, so I'm constantly trying to be like, "Is that
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:54.600]   true?
[00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:56.280]   I should go there.
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:57.800]   I should see it."
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:05.120]   I guess just in the end, I trust direct perceptions.
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:07.280]   I don't trust the internet, actually.
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:10.040]   Wikipedia is a joke.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:12.160]   Wikipedia could not be more dishonest.
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:14.840]   It's certainly in the political categories for things that I know a lot about.
[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:19.000]   Occasionally, I read an entry written about something that I saw or know the people involved,
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.320]   and I'm like, "Well, that's a complete liar.
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:22.920]   You left out the most important fact."
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:27.760]   It's not a reliable guide to reality or history, and that will accelerate with AI, where history
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:33.120]   or perception of the past is completely controlled and distorted.
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:36.760]   So I think just getting out there and seeing stuff and seeing that Moscow was not what
[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:44.040]   I thought it would be, which was a smoldering ruin, rats in a garbage dump, it was nicer
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:45.040]   than New York.
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:46.280]   What the hell?
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:48.600]   Direct data is good, but it's challenging.
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:53.640]   For example, if you talk to a lot of people in Moscow or in Russia and you ask them, "Is
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:54.640]   there censorship?"
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:56.400]   They will usually say, "Yes, there is."
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:58.320]   "Oh, yeah, of course there is."
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:59.320]   I agree.
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:04.440]   I mean, just to be clear, I have no plans to move to Russia.
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:07.040]   I think I would probably be arrested if I moved to Russia.
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:13.920]   Ed Snowden, who is the most famous openness transparency advocate in the world, I would
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:18.280]   say, along with Assange, doesn't want to live in Russia.
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:20.480]   He's had problems with the Putin government.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.480]   He's attacked Putin.
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:22.480]   They don't like it.
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:23.600]   I mean, I get it.
[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:24.960]   I get it.
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:28.760]   I'm just saying, what are the lessons for us?
[00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:36.760]   The main lesson is we are being lied to in a way that's bewildering and very upsetting.
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:40.120]   I was mad about it all eight days I was there because I feel like I'm better informed than
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:44.320]   most people because it's my job to be informed and I'm skeptical of everything, and yet,
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:46.760]   I was completely hoodwinked by it.
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:51.600]   I would just recommend to everyone watching this, if you're really interested, if you're
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:54.560]   one of those people, and I'm not one, but who's waking up every day and you've got a
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:57:00.800]   Ukrainian flag on your mailbox or whatever, your Ukrainian lapel pin, or it's like absurd
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:01.800]   theater.
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:06.200]   If you sincerely care about Ukraine or Russia or whatever, why don't you just hop on a plane
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:08.800]   for 800 bucks and go see it?
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:11.240]   That doesn't occur to anyone to do that.
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:17.440]   I know it's time consuming and kind of expensive, sort of, not really, but you benefit so much.
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:22.120]   I mean, I could bore you for like eight hours, and I know you've had this experience where
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:26.640]   you think you know what something is or you think you know who someone is, and then you
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:30.920]   have direct experience of that place or person, and you realize all your preconceptions were
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:31.920]   totally wrong.
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:34.480]   They were controlled by somebody else.
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:38.520]   In fact, I won't betray confidence, but off the air, we were talking about somebody and
[00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:41.600]   you said, "I couldn't believe the person was not at all like what I thought."
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:42.600]   That's happened to me-
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:43.600]   In the positive direction.
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:44.600]   In the positive direction.
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:47.440]   By the way, for me, it's almost always in that direction.
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:52.640]   Most people I meet, and I've had the great privilege of meeting a lot of people over
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:57.400]   all this time, they're way better than you think, or they're more complicated or whatever,
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:03.880]   but the point is a direct experience unmediated by liars, there's no substitute for that.
[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:09.860]   Well, on that point, direct experience in Ukraine, so I visited Ukraine and witnessed
[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:11.600]   a lot of the same things you witnessed in Moscow.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:14.000]   So first of all, beautiful architecture.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.120]   And this is a country that's really in war.
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:18.120]   So it's not-
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.120]   Oh, for real?
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:25.040]   Like for real, where most of the men are either volunteering or fighting in the war, and there's
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:29.320]   actual tanks in the streets that are going into your major city of Kiev.
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:34.240]   And still the supply chains are working just a handful of months after the start of the
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:35.240]   war.
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:36.240]   Everything is working.
[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:39.800]   The restaurants are amazing.
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:48.220]   Most of the people are able to do some kind of job, like the life goes on, cleanliness,
[00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:49.220]   like you mentioned.
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:50.220]   I love that.
[00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:54.420]   Security, it's incredible, like crime went to zero.
[00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:58.040]   They gave out guns to everybody, the Texas strategy.
[00:58:58.040 --> 00:58:59.040]   It does work.
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:02.640]   Yeah, when you witness it, you realize, okay, there's something to these people, there's
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:06.200]   something to this country that they're not as corrupt as you might hear.
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:07.200]   Right.
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.200]   Russia is corrupt.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:09.200]   Ukraine is corrupt.
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:11.320]   You assume it's just all going to go to shit.
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:14.240]   So that's been, and I haven't been to Ukraine and I've certainly tried, and they put me
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:18.280]   on some kill them immediately list, so I can't, I've tried to interview Zelensky, he keeps
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:19.280]   denouncing me.
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:20.280]   I just want an interview with him.
[00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:21.280]   He won't.
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:23.280]   Unfortunately, I would love to do it.
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:24.280]   I hope you do.
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:25.280]   I do too.
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:29.120]   But one of the things that bothers me most, I'd love to hear that, what you just said
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:31.920]   about Kiev, but I'm not really surprised.
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:38.640]   One of the things that I'm most ashamed of is the bigotry that I felt towards Slavic
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:42.120]   people, also toward Muslims, I'll just be totally honest, because I lived through decades
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:47.440]   of propaganda from NBC News and CNN where I worked, you know, about this or that group
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:49.520]   of people and they're horrible or whatever.
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:52.160]   And then you wind, and I kind of believed it.
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:57.240]   And I see it now, like we can't even put the word Russia at Wimbledon because it's so offensive.
[00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:59.960]   Well, what does the tennis player have to do with it?
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:00.960]   Did he invade Ukraine?
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:01.960]   I don't think he did.
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:05.920]   You know, stealing all these business guys' yachts and denouncing them as oligarchs, like
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.080]   what do they have to do with it?
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:08.080]   You know, whatever.
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:09.360]   Here's my point.
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:14.760]   The idea that like a whole group of people is just evil because of their blood, I just
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:15.760]   don't believe that.
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.720]   I think it's immoral to think that.
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:24.000]   And I can just tell you my own experience after eight days there, I think it's a really
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.320]   interesting culture, Slavic culture, which is shared, by the way, by Russia and Ukraine.
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:31.280]   Of course, they're first cousins at the most distant.
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:36.040]   And I found them really smart and interesting and informed.
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:38.800]   I didn't understand a lot of what they're saying, I don't understand the way their minds
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.720]   work, because I'm American.
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:44.720]   But it wasn't a thin culture, it's a thick culture.
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.440]   You know, and I admire that.
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:49.080]   And I wish I could go to Ukraine, I would go tomorrow.
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:55.400]   So I think after you did the interview with Putin, you put a clip, I think on TCN, where
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.640]   like your sort of analysis afterwards.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.360]   Yeah, it wasn't much of an analysis.
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:03.440]   No, but what stood out to me is you were kind of talking shit about Putin a little bit.
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:05.000]   Like you were criticizing him.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.040]   Why wouldn't I?
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:11.400]   It spoke to the thing that you mentioned, which is you weren't afraid.
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:16.560]   Now the question I want to ask is, it would be pretty badass if you went to the supermarket
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:20.320]   and made the point you were making, but also criticize Putin, right?
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:23.680]   Criticize that there is a lack of freedom of speech and freedom of the press.
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:24.680]   In the supermarket?
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:25.680]   Yes.
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:28.200]   Oh, you mean if I also said that?
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:32.120]   Well, yeah, I mean, of course I think that, I'm not.
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:39.880]   So I guess part of it is that I'm a little, because I have such a low opinion of the commentariat
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:44.960]   in the United States and the news organizations, which really do just work for the US government.
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:50.640]   I mean, I really see them as I did Izvestia and Pravda in the 80s, like they're just organs
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:51.640]   of the government.
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:52.640]   And I think they're contemptible.
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:53.920]   I think the people who work there are contemptible.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:58.720]   And I say that as someone who knows them really well personally, I think they're disgusting,
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:02.080]   that I'm a little bit cut off kind of from what people are saying about me, because I'm
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:03.080]   not interested.
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:07.600]   So I try not to be defensive, like, "See, I'm not a tool of Putin."
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:12.880]   But the idea that I'd be flacking for Putin when my relatives fought in the Revolutionary
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:18.520]   War, like I'm as American as you could be, it's like crazy to me.
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:22.400]   And Applebaum calls me a traitor to my, okay, right?
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.760]   It's just like so dumb.
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.560]   But no, of course they don't have...
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:28.440]   No country has freedom of speech other than us.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.080]   Canada doesn't have it.
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.920]   Great Britain definitely doesn't have it.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:35.920]   France, Netherlands, these are countries I spent a lot of time in.
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.520]   And Russia certainly doesn't have it.
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.640]   So that's why I don't live there.
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:42.280]   I'm just saying our sanctions don't work.
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:43.600]   That's all I was saying.
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:46.300]   And we don't have to live like animals.
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:48.040]   We can live with dignity.
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:49.320]   Even the Russians can do it.
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:50.480]   That's kind of what I was saying.
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:54.480]   Even the Russians under Vladimir freaking Putin can live like this.
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:57.120]   And no, it's not a feature of dictatorship.
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:02.840]   That's the most, I think, discouraging and most dishonest line by people like Jon Stewart,
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:09.200]   who really are trying to prepare the population for accepting a lot less.
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:14.120]   He is really a tool of the regime in a sinister way, always has been.
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.480]   How dare you expect that?
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.560]   What are you, a Stalinist?
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.000]   It's like, no.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   I'm an American.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   I'm a decent person.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.640]   I just want to be able to walk to the grocery store without being murdered.
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:24.640]   Is that too much?
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:25.640]   Shut up.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:26.640]   You don't believe in freedom.
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.640]   It's really dark if you think about it.
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:33.120]   So there is a fundamental way which you wanted Americans to expect more.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:34.780]   You don't have to live like this.
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:36.120]   We don't have to live like this.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.000]   You don't have to accept it.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000]   You don't.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.480]   And everyone's afraid in this country they're going to be shut down by the tech oligarchs
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.240]   or have the FBI show up at their houses or go to jail.
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.840]   And people are legit afraid of that in the United States.
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:53.200]   And my feeling is, so?
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.640]   Show a little courage.
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:59.080]   What is it worth to you for your grandchildren to live in a free, prosperous country?
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.720]   It should be worth more than your comfort.
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:02.720]   That's how I feel.
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:07.520]   We should make clear that by many measures, you look at the World Press Freedom Index,
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:11.960]   you're right, U.S. is not at the top.
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:13.280]   Norway is.
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:19.080]   U.S. scores 71, same as Gambia, West Africa.
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:20.080]   So let me just ask-
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.080]   Hold on a second.
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.080]   Hold on a second.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.080]   Hold on a second.
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:24.080]   Now you're making me laugh.
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:27.080]   Ukraine is 61, and Russia is 35.
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.800]   The lower it is, the worse.
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:33.240]   Close to China at 23, and North Korea at the very bottom, 22.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:36.960]   Didn't Ukraine put Gonzalo Lira in jail till he died for criticizing the government?
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.280]   How can they have a high press?
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:41.080]   Yes, that's why they're 61 out of 0 to 100.
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:45.240]   I don't know what the criteria are they're using to arrive at that.
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:49.160]   But I know press freedom when I see it, I try to practice it, which is saying what you
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:55.800]   think is true, correcting yourself when you've been shown to be wrong, as I have many times,
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:59.320]   being as honest as you can be all the time, and not being afraid.
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:02.240]   And those are wholly absent in my country, wholly absent.
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:06.360]   People are afraid in the news business, I would know, since I spent my life working
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:07.360]   there.
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.360]   And they're afraid to tell the truth.
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:11.480]   They're under an enormous amount of pressure, and a lot of them have little kids in mortgages.
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.060]   I've been there.
[01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:17.960]   So I have sympathy, but they go along with things like you are not allowed, if you stand
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:23.480]   up at any cable channel, any cable channel in the United States and say, "Wait a second,
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:30.080]   how did the Ukrainian government throw a US citizen into prison until he died for criticizing
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:31.080]   the Ukrainian government?"
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:32.680]   And we're paying for that.
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.480]   That's what's offensive to me, we're paying for it.
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:39.360]   That happens all the time around the world, of course, but this is a US citizen, and we're
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:43.620]   paying the pensions of Ukrainian bureaucrats.
[01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:46.760]   We are the Ukrainian government at this point.
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:52.100]   If you said that on TV, on any channel, well, you'd lose your job for that.
[01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:56.240]   So that's not, I don't care, Norway is at the top, really, Norway.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:01.400]   If I went on Norwegian television and said NATO blew up Nord Stream, which it did, NATO
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:02.400]   blew up Nord Stream.
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:06.300]   The United States government, with the help of other governments, blew up, committed the
[01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:10.200]   largest act of industrial terrorism in history, and by the way, the largest environmental
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:14.440]   crime, the largest emission of CO2, methane.
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:15.440]   Could I keep my job?
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:16.440]   No.
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:17.440]   So how is that a free press?
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.440]   Well, we don't know that.
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:19.440]   I mean, the whole point of saying that-
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:20.440]   In Norway?
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:21.440]   Yes.
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:22.440]   Well, as the Scandinavian, I can tell you they would not put up with that in Norway
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:23.440]   for a second.
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:24.440]   It's been a while.
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:25.440]   Are you deviating for the majority?
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:26.440]   No.
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:31.380]   Well, but deviating maybe is frowned upon, but-
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:32.780]   Frowned upon, yeah.
[01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:35.680]   But do you have the freedom to say it if you do deviate?
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:36.680]   That's the question.
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:37.680]   Can you keep your job?
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:38.680]   That's one measurement of it.
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:39.680]   You can keep the job, yeah.
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:40.680]   Yeah.
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:41.680]   It's not the only measurement.
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:42.680]   Obviously, being thrown into prison is much worse than losing your job.
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:47.440]   I've been fired a number of times for saying what I think, by the way, and it's fine.
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:48.440]   I've enjoyed it.
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:49.440]   I don't mind being fired.
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:55.880]   I've always become a better person after it happened, but it is one measurement of freedom.
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:07:00.160]   If you have the theoretical right to do something, but no practical ability to do it, do you
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.160]   have the right to do it?
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:03.480]   And the answer is not really, actually.
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:04.920]   You mentioned Jon Stewart.
[01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:06.720]   The two of you have a bit of a history.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:11.400]   I don't know if you've seen it, but he kind of grilled your supermarket and subway videos.
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.800]   Have you gotten a chance to see it?
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:19.440]   I haven't seen it, but someone characterized it to me, which is why I pivoted against it
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:24.120]   early in our conversation about how the price of freedom is living in filth and chaos.
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:26.640]   Yeah, that was essentially it.
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:33.400]   So in 2004, that's 20 years ago, Jon Stewart appeared on Crossfire, a show you hosted,
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:37.860]   and that was kind of a memorable moment.
[01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:40.360]   Can you tell the saga of that as you remember it?
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:45.920]   I mean, for me, as I was saying to you before about how it takes a long time to digest and
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:50.600]   process and understand what happens to you, or at least it does for me, I didn't understand
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:53.240]   that as a particularly significant moment while it was happening.
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:54.720]   I just got off a plane from Hawaii.
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:08:01.000]   I mean, I was out of it as usual, and I was very literal as usual.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.840]   And so from my perspective, his criticism of me to the extent I remember it was that
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:06.840]   I was a partisan.
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:10.440]   Well, he had two criticisms, one that Crossfire was stupid, which it certainly was.
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:17.440]   In fact, I'd already given my notice and I was moving on to another company by that point.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:23.240]   Crossfire was stupid, Crossfire didn't help, Crossfire framed everything as Republican
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:26.440]   versus Democrat, whatever.
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:27.880]   It was not helpful to the public discourse.
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:31.720]   I couldn't agree more, and that's why I left.
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:33.760]   So that was part of his critique, fair.
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:37.120]   I'm not sure I would have admitted it at the time because I worked there, and it's hard
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:43.680]   to admit you're engaged in an enterprise that's fundamentally worthless, which it was.
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:47.960]   But his other point was that I was somehow a partisan or a mindless partisan, which is
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:48.960]   definitely not true.
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:54.920]   I mean, it is true of him, he is a mindless partisan, but I am not, and I really haven't
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:57.760]   been since I got back from Baghdad at the beginning of the Iraq War.
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:03.200]   And I realized that the Republican Party, which I'd voted for my whole life to that
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:11.120]   point and had supported in general, was like pushing this really horrible thing that was
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:14.040]   going to hurt the United States, which in time it really did.
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:16.560]   The Iraq War really hurt the United States.
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:20.040]   And I realized that I had been on the wrong side of that, I said so publicly immediately
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:24.520]   from Baghdad I said that to the New York Times, and I really meant it, I mean it now.
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:29.640]   And so to call me partisan, you could call me stupid, you could call me wrong, I certainly
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:33.640]   have been wrong, but partisan, I just didn't think it was a meaningful, I mean it's like
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:35.800]   that's just not true, it's the opposite of true.
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:43.880]   So I didn't really take it seriously at all, and I never thought much of him, so I was
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:48.560]   like whatever, some buffoon jumping around on my show grandstanding.
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:51.760]   But I do think it was recorded, and by the way that happened right at the moment that
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:55.040]   YouTube began, I think that was one of the first big YouTube videos, it was one of the
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:57.200]   first big YouTube videos.
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:03.760]   So it had a virality that, if that's a word, it went everywhere in a way that didn't used
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:04.760]   to happen in cable news.
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:07.640]   I mean by that point, that was 20 years ago as you point out, I've been in cable news
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:09.600]   for nine years.
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:18.120]   So before 2004 we would say something on television and then it would kind of, it would be lost,
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:21.320]   like people could claim they heard it, but you'd have to go to the, I think the University
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:24.320]   of Tennessee at Knoxville archives to get it.
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:29.480]   Suddenly everything we said would live forever on the internet, which is good by the way,
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:35.080]   it's not bad, but it was a big change for me and I just couldn't believe how widely
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:39.960]   that was discussed at the time, because I thought he was not an interesting person,
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:45.480]   I think he's obviously a very unhappy person, I just didn't take him seriously then and
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:48.120]   I don't now.
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:53.720]   So anyway, that was it, it was a smaller thing in my life at the time than other people imagined.
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:54.720]   Okay.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:59.200]   You said a lot of words that will make it sound like you're a bit bitter, even if you're
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:00.200]   not.
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:03.160]   So you said unhappy person, partisan person.
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:05.280]   Well, he's definitely partisan for sure.
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:07.120]   So can you elaborate why you think he's partisan?
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:13.760]   So I think that, and I see this a lot, not only on the left, but people who believe that
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:18.680]   whatever political debate they're engaged in is the most important debate in the world.
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:22.080]   And so they bring an emotional intensity to those debates and they're inevitably disappointed
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:25.800]   because no eternal question is solved politically.
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:28.200]   So they're kind of on the wrong path, right?
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:34.540]   And they're doomed to frustration if they believe that, and many do, he certainly does,
[01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:38.800]   that whatever the issue is, so Clarence Thomas should not be a Supreme Court justice, and
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:41.360]   the implication is, well, if someone else is a Supreme Court justice, we'll live in
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:43.360]   a fair and happy society.
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.880]   But that's just not, it's a false promise.
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:50.640]   So I think that people who bring that level of intensity to politics are by definition
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:55.000]   bitter, by definition disappointed, bitter in the way the disappointed people are.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.520]   And that the real questions are like, what happens when you die?
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:00.360]   And how do the people around you feel about you?
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:05.120]   Those are not the only questions in life, but they're certainly the most important ones.
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:08.480]   And if we're spending a disproportionate amount of time on who gets elected to some office,
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:13.320]   not that it's irrelevant, it is relevant, but it's not the eternal question.
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:19.080]   And so I feel like he's not the only kind of bitter, silly person in Washington or in
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:20.080]   its orbit.
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:24.560]   There are many, and a lot of them are Republicans.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:25.560]   But I just thought it was ironic.
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:30.860]   I mean, everything's ironic to me, but being called a Russia sympathizer by a guy who calls
[01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:33.560]   himself Boris, that just made me laugh.
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:34.760]   No one else has ever laughed at that.
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:37.060]   Boris Johnson's real name is not Boris, as you know.
[01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:40.240]   He calls himself Boris, it's his middle name.
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:44.080]   And so if you call yourself Boris, you don't really have standing to attack anyone else
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:46.280]   as a Russia defender, right?
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.840]   I think that's funny.
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:51.920]   No one else, as I noted, does.
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:58.400]   But Jon Stewart, there are a lot of things you could say about me, but he's much more
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:59.400]   partisan than I am.
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.040]   So to call me a partisan, it's like, what?
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:07.160]   He would probably say that he's not a partisan, that he's a comedian who's looking for the
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:09.200]   humor and the absurdity of the system.
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:10.200]   That's a dodge.
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.200]   He's a dead serious...
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:14.640]   He's a very serious person in this, I will say this, and he shares this quality with
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:15.640]   a lot of comedians.
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:17.680]   I know a lot of comedians.
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:21.320]   I know a cross section of people that's having done this job for a long time, and a lot of
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:26.800]   them are very serious about their views, and they have a lot of emotional intensity.
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:28.520]   And he certainly is in that category.
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:29.640]   He's not...
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:30.640]   That's the silliest thing.
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:31.640]   Yeah, he's a comedian, for sure.
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:33.600]   He can be very funny, for sure.
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:36.760]   He has talent, no doubt about it, I've never denied that.
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:42.920]   But he's motivated by his moral views.
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.720]   This is right, that is wrong.
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:47.600]   And I just think that it's a misapplied passion.
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:52.360]   But do you think I'm just a comedian is...
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:53.960]   I don't think any serious person thinks that.
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:56.000]   I mean, if you're just a comedian, be...
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   And I...
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.480]   Look, I'm not trying to claim, I couldn't claim that I haven't said a lot of dumb things.
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:08.720]   And one of the dumbest things I ever said was when he was on our set lecturing me.
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:13.160]   He's a moralizer, which I also just don't really care for, as an aesthetic matter.
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:19.240]   But he was lecturing me about something, and I said, "I thought you were here to tell jokes."
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:24.080]   Which I shouldn't have said, because he wasn't there to tell jokes, he was there to lecture
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.080]   me.
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:27.520]   And I should have just engaged it directly, rather than trying to diminish him by like,
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:28.520]   "You're just a little comedian."
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:30.960]   Well, he doesn't see himself that way.
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:34.000]   But I would just say this, Jon Stewart's a defender of power.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.800]   Jon Stewart is never criticized.
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:42.040]   What's Jon Stewart's view on the aid we've sent to Ukraine, the $100 billion or whatever?
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:43.040]   What happened to that money?
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:44.800]   What happened to the weapons that I bought?
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.080]   He doesn't care.
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:52.200]   He has the exact same priorities as the people permanently in charge in Washington.
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:57.800]   So whatever, he's not alone in that, so does Mika Brzezinski and her husband and all the
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:59.500]   rest of the cast of dummies.
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:04.960]   But if you're going to pretend to be the guy who's giving the finger to entrench power,
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.800]   you should do it once in a while.
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:09.440]   And he never has.
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:12.920]   There's not one time when he said something that would be deeply unpopular on Morning
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:13.920]   Joe.
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:14.920]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:16.560]   And so don't call yourself a truth teller.
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:19.760]   You're a court comedian or a flatterer of power.
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:20.760]   Okay, that's fine.
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:23.520]   There's a rule for that, but don't pretend to be something else.
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:28.740]   I'll just be honest that I watched it just recently, that video.
[01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:29.800]   From 20 years ago?
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:30.800]   From 20 years ago.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:34.140]   I watched it initially, and I remember very differently.
[01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:40.680]   I remembered that Jon Stewart completely destroyed you in that conversation, and I watched it,
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:47.380]   and you asked a very good question of him, which was, and there was no destruction, first
[01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:52.420]   of all, and you asked a very good question of him, why when you got a chance to interview
[01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:57.140]   John Kerry, did you ask a bunch of softball questions?
[01:15:57.140 --> 01:16:02.060]   I thought that was a really fair question, and then his defense was, "Well, I'm just
[01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:03.060]   a comedian."
[01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:06.020]   So I thought that was disingenuous, and I haven't watched it.
[01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:11.020]   I never have watched that clip one time in my life, and I don't like to watch myself
[01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:12.020]   on television.
[01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:13.800]   I never have.
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:16.860]   And that's my fault, and I probably should force myself to watch it, though.
[01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:17.860]   Of course, I never will.
[01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:24.300]   I think the takeaway for me, which was really interesting and life-changing, was I agree
[01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:26.340]   with your assessment.
[01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:27.580]   I've lost a lot of debates.
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:28.940]   I've been humiliated on television.
[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:30.060]   I'm not above that.
[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:31.060]   It certainly happened to me.
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:32.740]   It will happen again.
[01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:37.240]   But I didn't feel like it was a clear win for him at all.
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:41.420]   Maybe a TKO, but it was not a knockout at all, and yet it was recorded that way, and
[01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:42.420]   I remember thinking, "Well, that's kind of weird.
[01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:43.900]   That's not what I remember."
[01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:47.780]   And then I realized, no, Jon Stewart was more popular than I was.
[01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:51.540]   Therefore, he was recorded as the winner, and that was hard for me to accept because
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:52.700]   that struck me as unfair.
[01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:55.460]   You should rate any contest on points.
[01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:56.460]   Like here are the rules.
[01:16:56.460 --> 01:17:00.900]   We're going to judge the contest on the basis of those rules, and no, in the end, it's just
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:02.480]   like the more popular guy wins.
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:03.920]   Every TV critic liked Jon Stewart.
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:04.920]   Every one of them hated me.
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:09.820]   Therefore, he won, and I was like, "Wow, I guess I have to accept that reality."
[01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:10.820]   And you do.
[01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:13.460]   Like the reality of the sunrise, you're not in charge of it.
[01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:14.460]   So that's just what it is.
[01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:16.220]   Unfortunately, it's a bit darker, I think.
[01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:20.100]   The reason he's seen as the winner and the reason at the time I saw as the "winner" is
[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:25.700]   because he was basically shitting on you, like personal attacks versus engaging ideas.
[01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:30.600]   And it was funny in a dark way and like making fun of the bow tie and all this kind of stuff.
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:31.600]   It's fair.
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:32.600]   I understand.
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:33.600]   And it was fair to call me a dick.
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:36.260]   I remember he called me a dick, and I remember even when he said that, I was like, "Yeah,
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:37.260]   I'm definitely a dick."
[01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:39.660]   And that's not my best quality, trust me.
[01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:45.220]   But also to be kind of ... I thought Jon Stewart came off as a giant dick at that time, and
[01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:46.780]   I'm a big fan of his.
[01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:49.900]   And I think he has improved a lot.
[01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:54.780]   So we should also say that people grow.
[01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:56.620]   I certainly have, or change.
[01:17:56.620 --> 01:17:57.820]   Anyway, you hope it's growth.
[01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:04.700]   You hope it's not shrinkage, but it is cold outside.
[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:09.940]   I mean, look, I haven't followed Jon Stewart's career at all.
[01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:10.940]   I don't have a television.
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:13.740]   I'm pretty cut off from all that stuff.
[01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:20.740]   So I wouldn't really know, but the measure to me is, are you taking positions that are
[01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:24.740]   unpopular with the most powerful people in the world, and how often are you doing it?
[01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:25.740]   It's super simple.
[01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:34.700]   Not for its own sake, but do you feel free enough to say to the consensus, "I disagree"?
[01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:36.980]   And if you don't, then you're just another toady.
[01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:37.980]   That's my view.
[01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:42.660]   Well, I think he probably feels free enough to do it, but you're saying he doesn't do
[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:43.660]   it.
[01:18:43.660 --> 01:18:48.420]   Look, the big things, this is my estimation of it.
[01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:49.420]   Others may disagree.
[01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:52.140]   The big things are the economy and war.
[01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:56.100]   The big things government does can be, I mean, there are a lot of things government does.
[01:18:56.100 --> 01:19:01.260]   Government does everything at this point, but where we kill people and how, and for
[01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:06.340]   what purpose, and how we organize the economic engine that keeps the country afloat.
[01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:08.220]   Those are the two big questions.
[01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:13.140]   And I hear almost no debate about either one of them in the media.
[01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:14.820]   And I have dissenting views on both of them.
[01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:17.260]   I mean, I'm mad about the tax code, which I think is unfair.
[01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:18.700]   I don't think we should be...
[01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:23.900]   The fact that we have a carried interest loophole in the tax code and people are claiming that
[01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:28.340]   their income is investment income, and they're paying half the tax rate as someone who just
[01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:31.820]   goes to work every day, it discourages work.
[01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:35.900]   It encourages lending at interest, which I think is gross, personally.
[01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:39.020]   I'm against it, sorry.
[01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:42.980]   And the fact that we're creating chaos around the world is the saddest thing that's happening
[01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:43.980]   right now.
[01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:48.560]   And nobody feels free to say that, so that's not good.
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:50.660]   How do you hope the war in Ukraine ends?
[01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:53.020]   With a settlement, with a reasonable settlement.
[01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:58.820]   And you know what a reasonable settlement is, which is a settlement where both sides
[01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:01.980]   feel like they're giving a little, but can live with it.
[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:08.980]   And I mean, I was really struck in my conversation with Putin by how he basically refused to
[01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:13.220]   criticize Joe Biden and to criticize NATO.
[01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:17.940]   And it is, I will just be honest, as an American, it would be a little weird to be like pissing
[01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:22.300]   on Joe Biden with a foreign leader, any foreign leader, even though I don't think Joe Biden
[01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:25.660]   is a real person or really president, and the whole thing is ridiculous, but still he
[01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:30.100]   is the American president technically, and I don't want to beat up on the American president
[01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:31.100]   with a foreigner.
[01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:32.100]   I just don't.
[01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:33.100]   Maybe I'm old fashioned.
[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:34.100]   So that's how I feel.
[01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:37.020]   So I didn't push it, but I thought it was really interesting.
[01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:41.140]   And because of course Putin knows my views on Joe Biden, he knew I applied to the CIA.
[01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:46.740]   So they've done some digging on me, but he didn't mention it and he didn't attack NATO.
[01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:51.660]   And the reason is, I know for a fact, because he wants a settlement and he wants a settlement
[01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:56.080]   not because Russia is about to collapse despite the lying of our media, that's just not true.
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:58.940]   And no one is even saying it anymore because it's so dumb.
[01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:02.780]   He wants it because it's just bad to have a war and it changes the world in ways you
[01:21:02.780 --> 01:21:04.960]   can't predict people die.
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:08.780]   Anything about it is sad and if you can avoid it, you should.
[01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:14.940]   So I would like to see a settlement where, look, the thing that Russia wants and I think
[01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:18.620]   probably has a right to is not to have NATO missiles on this border.
[01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:19.860]   I don't know why we would do that.
[01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:23.200]   I don't know what we get out of it.
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:24.580]   I just don't even understand it.
[01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:26.340]   I don't understand the purpose of NATO.
[01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:28.060]   I don't think NATO was good for the United States.
[01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:30.500]   I think it's an attack on our sovereignty.
[01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:33.700]   I would pull out of NATO immediately if I were the US president because I don't think
[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:35.460]   it helps the US.
[01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:40.400]   I know a lot of people are getting their bread buttered by NATO.
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:43.060]   But anyway, that's my view as an American.
[01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:46.700]   If I'm a Russian or Ukrainian, let's just be sovereign countries now.
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:49.300]   We're not run by the US State Department.
[01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:50.580]   We're just our own countries.
[01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:52.300]   I believe in sovereignty, okay?
[01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:53.300]   So that's my view.
[01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:56.300]   And I also want to say one thing about Zelensky.
[01:21:56.300 --> 01:22:03.220]   I attacked him before because I was so offended by his cavalier talk about nuclear exchange
[01:22:03.220 --> 01:22:05.180]   because it would kill my family.
[01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:06.820]   So I'm really offended by that.
[01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:09.240]   Anyone who talks that way, I'm offended by.
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:12.260]   But I do feel for Zelensky, I do.
[01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:13.980]   He didn't run for president to have this happen.
[01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:20.300]   I think Zelensky's been completely misused by the State Department, by Toria Nuland,
[01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:25.580]   by our Secretary of State, by the policymakers in the US who've used Ukraine as a vessel
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:30.900]   for their ambitions, their geopolitical ambitions, but also the many American businesses who've
[01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:35.140]   used Ukraine as a way to fleece the American taxpayer.
[01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:38.780]   And then by just independent ghouls like Boris Johnson are hoping to get rich from interviews
[01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:39.780]   on it.
[01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:40.780]   The whole thing.
[01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:41.780]   Zelensky's at the center of this.
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:43.740]   He's not driving history.
[01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:45.940]   NATO and the United States is driving history.
[01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:46.980]   Putin is driving history.
[01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:48.260]   There's this guy, Zelensky.
[01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:53.460]   So I do feel for him and I think he's in a perilous place.
[01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:57.180]   Do you think Zelensky's a hero for staying in Kiev?
[01:22:57.180 --> 01:22:58.420]   Because I do.
[01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:01.020]   To me, you can criticize a lot of things.
[01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:04.860]   You should call out things that are obviously positive.
[01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:06.780]   I just tried to a second ago.
[01:23:06.780 --> 01:23:10.700]   I don't know the extent that he is in Kiev.
[01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:13.860]   He seems to be in the United States an awful lot, like way too much.
[01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:15.180]   You can do a satellite interview.
[01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:16.740]   You don't have to speak to my Congress.
[01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:17.740]   You're not an American.
[01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:18.740]   Please leave.
[01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:19.740]   That's my opinion.
[01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:22.420]   You got many zingers, Tucker.
[01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:23.420]   No, no, no.
[01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:24.420]   It's just heartfelt.
[01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:27.060]   It's just bubbling up from the wellspring that never turns off.
[01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:32.500]   But I would say this about Zelensky, yeah, to the extent he's in Ukraine, good man.
[01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:34.740]   George W. Bush fled Washington on 9/11.
[01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:38.700]   I lived there with three kids and he ran away to some Air Force base in South Dakota.
[01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:42.160]   And I thought that was cowardly and I said so at the time.
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:43.620]   And man, was I attacked for saying that.
[01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:47.580]   And I wrote a column about it in New York Magazine where I then had a column, hard to
[01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:48.580]   believe.
[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:49.580]   But I felt that.
[01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:50.580]   I felt that.
[01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:53.180]   I think the prerequisites of leadership are really basic.
[01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:55.260]   The first is caring about the people you lead.
[01:23:55.260 --> 01:23:56.260]   That's number one.
[01:23:56.260 --> 01:24:00.700]   You know, deep in the way a father cares for his children or an officer cares for his troops.
[01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:03.260]   A president should care for his people.
[01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:08.100]   And that leads inexorably to the next requirement, which is bravery, physical courage.
[01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:09.100]   And I believe in that.
[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:11.740]   And I'm not like some tough guy, but I just think it's obvious.
[01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:15.380]   If you're in charge, you know, I'm at my house and I feel like someone broke in.
[01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:18.300]   I'm not going to say to my wife, "Hey, baby, go deal with the home invasion."
[01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:21.440]   I'm going to deal with it because I'm dad, okay?
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:25.580]   So if you're the president of a country and your capital city is attacked, as ours was
[01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:32.020]   at the Pentagon, and you run away, when the Secret Service told me to, "Bitch, are you
[01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:33.020]   in charge?
[01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:34.180]   Like, who's daddy here?
[01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:35.180]   The Secret Service?"
[01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:36.540]   Do you know what I mean?
[01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:39.660]   I found that totally contemptible.
[01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:40.660]   And I said so.
[01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:43.780]   And man, did I get a lecture, not just from Republicans, but from Democrats.
[01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:45.060]   "Oh, you don't know.
[01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:46.060]   Put yourself in that position."
[01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:52.380]   I was like, okay, I don't know what I would do under that kind of stress, enormous stress.
[01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:53.380]   I get it.
[01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:56.660]   But the one thing I wouldn't do is run away because you can't do that.
[01:24:56.660 --> 01:25:00.380]   And if you're not willing to die for your country, then you shouldn't be leading it.
[01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:05.300]   So yes, to the extent, if Zelensky really is in Ukraine most of the time, amen.
[01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:07.620]   - Well, hold on a second, let's clarify.
[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:09.740]   It's not about whether he's in Ukraine most of the time or not.
[01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:11.060]   - I thought that was the whole premise of the-
[01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:12.900]   - No, no, no, no.
[01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:21.060]   At the beginning of the war, when a lot of people thought that the second biggest military
[01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:28.220]   in the world is pointing its guns at Kiev, is gonna be taken, and a man, a leader who
[01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:31.340]   stays in that city and says, "Fuck it."
[01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:35.820]   When everybody around him says, "Flee," says everybody around him believes the city will
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:43.100]   be taken or at least destroyed, leveled, artillery, bombs, all of this, he chooses to stay.
[01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:44.460]   You know a lot of leaders.
[01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:46.260]   How many leaders would choose to stay?
[01:25:46.580 --> 01:25:51.740]   - Well, the leader of Afghanistan, the US-backed leader, when the Taliban came, got in a US
[01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:57.500]   plane with US dollars and ran away, and of course is living on those dollars now.
[01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:58.980]   So yeah, there's a lot of cowardly behavior.
[01:25:58.980 --> 01:25:59.980]   Good for him.
[01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:05.740]   I mean, I guess I'm looking at it slightly differently, which is, what's the option?
[01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:06.740]   You're the leader of the country.
[01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:07.740]   You can't leave.
[01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:09.860]   Like, Stalin never left Moscow during the war.
[01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:14.300]   It was surrounded by the Germans, as you know, for a year, and he didn't leave.
[01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:16.740]   And when I was in Russia, they're like, "Stalin never left."
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:18.140]   I was like, "He's the leader of the country.
[01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:19.140]   You can't."
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:21.540]   I mean, like, that's just table stakes, of course.
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:27.540]   I would say, but you raise an interesting by implication question, which is, you know,
[01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:28.540]   what about Kiev?
[01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:30.740]   Like, you think the Russians couldn't level Kiev?
[01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:32.380]   Obviously, they could.
[01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:33.380]   Why haven't they?
[01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:36.180]   They could, but they haven't.
[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:41.980]   - Well, there's military answers to that, which is urban warfare is extremely difficult.
[01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:44.620]   Do you think that Putin wants to take Kiev?
[01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:50.180]   - No, I do think he expected Zelensky to flee, and somebody else to come into power.
[01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:51.820]   - Yeah, that may be true.
[01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:52.820]   I don't know.
[01:26:52.820 --> 01:26:59.740]   I don't think, I have no idea what Putin was thinking when he did that about Zelensky.
[01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:01.740]   I didn't ask him.
[01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:06.700]   But it's a mistake to imagine this is a contest between Putin and Zelensky.
[01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:08.700]   This is Putin versus the U.S. State Department.
[01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:12.700]   I mean, Zelensky, that's why I said I felt sorry for him.
[01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:17.580]   I mean, as I said, we're literally paying the pensions of Ukrainian bureaucrats.
[01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:20.660]   So there is no Ukrainian government independent of the U.S. government.
[01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:25.220]   And you know, maybe you're for that, maybe you're against it, but you can't endorse that
[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:28.820]   in the same sentence that you use the term democracy, 'cause that's not a democracy,
[01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:29.820]   right, obviously.
[01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:33.740]   - Well, that's why it's interesting that he didn't really bring up NATO extensively.
[01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:34.740]   - He wants a settlement.
[01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:35.740]   He wants a settlement.
[01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:38.740]   He doesn't want to fight with them rhetorically.
[01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:40.460]   And he just wants to get this done.
[01:27:40.460 --> 01:27:46.700]   And he made a bunch of offers at the peace deal, and we wouldn't even know this happened
[01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:52.500]   if the Israelis hadn't told us, and I'm so grateful that they did, that Johnson was dispatched
[01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:54.140]   by the State Department to stop it.
[01:27:54.140 --> 01:28:01.540]   And it's like, I mean, I think Boris Johnson is a husk of a man, but imagine if you were
[01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:05.460]   Boris Johnson and you spend your whole life with the Ukraine flag pinned, I'm for Ukraine,
[01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:10.980]   and then all those kids died because of what you did, and the lines haven't really moved,
[01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:14.460]   it hasn't been a victory for Ukraine, it's not gonna be a victory for Ukraine, it's like,
[01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:17.220]   how do you, how do you feel about yourself if you did that?
[01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:21.060]   I mean, I've done a lot of shitty things in my life, I feel bad about them, but I've never
[01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:26.380]   extended a war for no reason, like that's a pretty grave sin in my opinion, you know?
[01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:32.220]   - Yes, that was a failure, but it doesn't mean you can't have a success over and over
[01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:36.380]   and over, keep having negotiations between leaders.
[01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:40.540]   - Well, we're not, the U.S. government is not allowing negotiations, and so that for
[01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:45.580]   me is the most upsetting part, it's like, in the end, what Russia does, I'm not implicated
[01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:49.100]   in that, what Ukraine does, I'm not implicated in that, I'm not Russian or Ukrainian, I'm
[01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:53.020]   an American who grew up really believing in my country, I'm supporting my country through
[01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:57.540]   my tax dollars, and it's like, I really care about what the U.S. government does 'cause
[01:28:57.540 --> 01:29:04.380]   they're doing it in my name, and I care a lot, 'cause I'm American, and we're the impediment
[01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:07.900]   to peace, which is another way of saying, we're responsible for all these innocent people
[01:29:07.900 --> 01:29:14.060]   getting dragooned out of public parks in Kiev and sent to go die, like, what, that is not
[01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:16.220]   good, I'm ashamed of it.
[01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:21.460]   - What do you think of Putin saying that justification for continuing the war is denazification?
[01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:24.020]   - I thought it was one of the dumbest things I'd ever heard, I didn't understand what it
[01:29:24.020 --> 01:29:26.740]   meant, denazification?
[01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:29.620]   - It literally means what it sounds like.
[01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:33.420]   - You know, I, yeah, I mean, I have a lot of thoughts on this, I don't, I hate that
[01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:38.260]   whole conversation because it's not real, it's just ad hominem, it's a way of associating
[01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:44.780]   someone with an evil regime that doesn't exist anymore, but in point of fact, Nazism, whatever
[01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:50.380]   it was, is inseparable from the German nation, it was a nationalist movement in Germany,
[01:29:50.380 --> 01:29:54.620]   there were no other Nazis, right, there's no book of Nazism, like, I wanna be a Nazi,
[01:29:54.620 --> 01:30:00.660]   what does it mean to be a Nazi, there's no, Mein Kampf is not Das Kapital, right, Mein
[01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:04.140]   Kampf is like, to the extent I understand it, it's like he's pissed about the Treaty
[01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:09.540]   of Versailles, whatever, I'm very anti-Nazi, I'm merely saying there isn't a Nazi movement
[01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:18.620]   in 2024, it's a way of calling people evil, okay, Putin doesn't like nationalist Ukrainians,
[01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:22.620]   Putin hates nationalism in general, which is interesting, but of course he does, he's
[01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:27.420]   got 80 whatever republics and he's afraid of nationalist movements, he fought a war
[01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:31.980]   in Chechnya over this, so I understand it, but I have a different, I'm for nationalism,
[01:30:31.980 --> 01:30:36.180]   for American nationalism, so like I disagree with Putin on that, but calling them Nazis,
[01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:37.980]   it's like, I thought it was childish.
[01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:40.940]   >> Well, I do believe that he believes it.
[01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:45.500]   >> So that's so, I agree with that, 'cause I was listening to this, because in the United
[01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:51.300]   States, everyone's always calling everyone else a Nazi, you're a Nazi, okay, but I was
[01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:56.340]   listening to this and I was like, this is the dumbest, sort of, not convincing line
[01:30:56.340 --> 01:31:00.300]   you could take, and I sat there and listened to him talk about Nazis for like eight minutes
[01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:02.340]   and I'm like, I think he believes this.
[01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:06.420]   >> Yeah, and I actually, you know, having had a bunch of conversations with people who
[01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:09.740]   are living in Russia, they also believe it.
[01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:15.940]   Now, there's technicalities here, which the word Nazi, World War II is deeply in the blood
[01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:16.940]   of a lot of Russians and Ukrainians.
[01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:17.940]   >> I get it, I get it.
[01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:22.140]   >> But you're using it as almost a political term, the way it's used in the United States
[01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:28.300]   also, like racism and all this kind of stuff, 'cause you know you can really touch people
[01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:29.300]   if you use the Nazi.
[01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:30.380]   >> I think that's totally right.
[01:31:30.380 --> 01:31:35.280]   >> But it's also, to me, a really, like, disgusting thing to do.
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:36.280]   >> I agree.
[01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:43.220]   >> Because, and also to clarify, there is neo-Nazi movements in Ukraine, they're just very small.
[01:31:43.220 --> 01:31:48.460]   You're saying that there's this distinction between Nazi and neo-Nazi, sure, but it's
[01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:53.180]   a small percentage of the population, a tiny percentage, they have no power in government.
[01:31:53.180 --> 01:32:00.220]   As far, I have seen no data to show they have any influence on Zelensky and the Zelensky
[01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:02.420]   government at all.
[01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:08.180]   So really, when Putin says denazification, I think he means nationalist movements.
[01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:13.660]   >> I think you're right, and I agree with everything you said, and I do think that the
[01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:20.220]   war, the Second World War occupies a place in Slavic society, Polish society, you know,
[01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:24.220]   Central and Eastern Europe, that it does not occupy in the United States, and you can just
[01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:28.900]   look at the death totals, you know, tens of millions versus less than half a million,
[01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:33.020]   so it's like, this eliminated a lot of the male population of these countries, so of
[01:32:33.020 --> 01:32:38.620]   course it's still resonant in those countries, I get it.
[01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:46.380]   I just, I think I've watched, I don't think I know, I've watched the misuse of words,
[01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:51.180]   the weaponization of words for political reasons for so long that I just don't like, and though
[01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:56.740]   I do engage in it sometime, I'm sorry, I don't like just dismissing people in a word, "Oh,
[01:32:56.740 --> 01:33:00.860]   he's a Nazi, he's a liberal," or whatever, it's like, tell me what you mean, what don't
[01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:05.740]   you like about what they're doing or saying, and Nazi especially, it's like, I don't even
[01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:07.660]   know what the hell you're talking about.
[01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:12.220]   What troubled me about that is because he said that that's the primary objective currently
[01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:19.300]   for the war, and that because it's not grounded in reality, it makes it difficult to then
[01:33:19.300 --> 01:33:25.820]   negotiate peace, because like, what does it mean to get rid of the Nazis in Ukraine?
[01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:31.980]   So he'll come to the table and say, "Well, okay, I will agree to do ceasefire once the
[01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:32.980]   Nazis are gone."
[01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:34.580]   Okay, so can you list the Nazis?
[01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:35.580]   Totally agree.
[01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:36.580]   Plus, can you negotiate with a Nazi?
[01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:37.580]   Right, exactly.
[01:33:37.580 --> 01:33:39.740]   No, I totally agree with you.
[01:33:39.740 --> 01:33:45.980]   It was very strange, but maybe it was perhaps had to do with speaking to his own population,
[01:33:45.980 --> 01:33:52.020]   and also probably trying to avoid the use of the word NATO as the justification for
[01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:53.020]   the war.
[01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:54.020]   I mean, that's all...
[01:33:54.020 --> 01:33:58.860]   Of course, I don't know, but I suspect you're right on both counts, but I would say it points
[01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:03.220]   to something that I've thought more and more since I did that interview, which was like
[01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:06.220]   two weeks ago, I guess.
[01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:10.300]   I didn't think he was like, as a PR guy, not very good, like he's not good at telling his
[01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:12.460]   own story.
[01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:17.900]   The story of the current war in Ukraine is the eastward expansion of NATO and scaring
[01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:21.540]   the shit out of the Russians with NATO expansion, which is totally unnecessary, doesn't help
[01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:24.940]   the United States, NATO itself doesn't help the United States.
[01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:28.300]   And so, I'm not pro-Russian for saying that, I'm pro-American for saying that.
[01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:31.620]   And I think that's a really compelling story, because it's true.
[01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:34.740]   He did not tell that story, he told some other story that I didn't fully understand.
[01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:39.540]   Again, I'm not Russian, he's speaking to multiple audiences around the world, I'm not sure what
[01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:44.060]   he hoped to achieve by that interview, I will never know.
[01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:47.220]   But I did think that, like this guy is not good at telling his story.
[01:34:47.220 --> 01:34:52.900]   And I also think, honestly, on the base of a lot, I mean, I know this, very isolated
[01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:57.300]   during COVID, very.
[01:34:57.300 --> 01:35:00.700]   We keep hearing that he's dying of this or that disease, he's got ALS, I mean, I don't
[01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:02.180]   know, I'm not his doctor.
[01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:04.380]   There's a ton of lying about it, I know that.
[01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:11.580]   But one thing that's not a lie is that he was cloistered away during COVID, I know this,
[01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:14.420]   and only dealing with two or three people.
[01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:18.380]   And that makes you weird, it's so important to deal with a lot of people, to have your
[01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:19.380]   views challenged.
[01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:23.420]   And you see this with leaders who stay in power too long, he's been in power 24 years
[01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:24.420]   effectively.
[01:35:24.420 --> 01:35:31.140]   There have been upsides, I think for Russia, the Russian economy, Russian life expectancy,
[01:35:31.140 --> 01:35:33.060]   but there are definitely downsides.
[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:38.900]   And one of them is you get weird, and you get autocratic.
[01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:42.740]   This is why we have term limits, very few kings don't get crazy in old age.
[01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:51.120]   - Yeah, and you said some of this also in your post-Kremlin discussion while you're
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:56.020]   in Moscow still, which was very impressive to me, that you can just openly criticize.
[01:35:56.020 --> 01:35:57.020]   This is great.
[01:35:57.020 --> 01:35:58.020]   - Well, I don't care.
[01:35:58.020 --> 01:35:59.020]   - I understand this.
[01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:02.820]   I just wish you did some more of that also with the supermarket video, and perhaps some
[01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:06.260]   more of that with Putin in front of you.
[01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:10.020]   - Putin in front of me, I'm such a good person.
[01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:12.060]   - I know you see it as virtue signaling.
[01:36:12.060 --> 01:36:13.720]   - Yeah, it is.
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:16.700]   - Have you seen some of the interview he did with some NBC News child?
[01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:17.860]   - Yes, I understand.
[01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:24.140]   So I think you're just so annoyed by how bad journalists are that you just didn't want
[01:36:24.140 --> 01:36:25.140]   to be them.
[01:36:25.140 --> 01:36:28.900]   - Yeah, that's probably right, actually.
[01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:32.940]   - Some great conversations will involve some challenging, like you were confused about
[01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:33.940]   denazification.
[01:36:33.940 --> 01:36:40.740]   - Well, first of all, I accept your criticism, and I accept it as true that in some way I'm
[01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:47.420]   probably pivoting against what I dislike, and I have such contempt for American journalists
[01:36:47.420 --> 01:36:51.740]   on the basis of so much knowledge that I probably was like, "I don't want to be like that."
[01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:52.740]   Fair.
[01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:57.740]   That is a kind of defensiveness and dumb, so you're right.
[01:36:57.740 --> 01:37:03.340]   As for the Nazi thing, I was like, I really felt like we were just speaking so far past
[01:37:03.340 --> 01:37:06.700]   each other that we would never come to, I was like, "I don't even know what the hell
[01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:12.980]   you're talking about," and especially when I decided or concluded that he really meant
[01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:16.580]   it, I was like, "That's just too freaking weird to me."
[01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:20.540]   It's almost like, yeah, I can think of many other examples where you're interviewing someone
[01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:24.500]   and they'll say something that's like, "I was interviewing a guy one time, and he started
[01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:31.220]   talking about the black Israelites, and we're the real Jews," and I was like, "You know,"
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:35.900]   and it wasn't on camera, but I was like, "I don't," that was so, it was so far out to
[01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:42.180]   me that I was like, "We'll never kind of understand common terms on that."
[01:37:42.180 --> 01:37:47.100]   You mentioned there's a bunch of conspiracy theories about Putin's health.
[01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:48.100]   How was he in person?
[01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:49.100]   What did he feel like?
[01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:51.660]   Did he look healthy?
[01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:56.580]   You know, I'm not a health person myself, so I mean, I can easily gain 30 pounds and
[01:37:56.580 --> 01:38:00.740]   not know it, so I'm probably not a great person to ask, but no, he seemed fine.
[01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:07.180]   He seemed, he had his arm hooked through a chair, and I heard people say he's got Parkinson's,
[01:38:07.180 --> 01:38:14.500]   and Parkinson's can be controlled, I know, for periods with drugs.
[01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:18.860]   It's hard to assess, I'm just not, one of the tells of Parkinson's is gait, you know
[01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:22.180]   how a person walks, I think, and his walking seemed fine.
[01:38:22.180 --> 01:38:26.980]   I walked around with him and talked to him off camera.
[01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:30.580]   He's had some work done, for sure, I mean, 71 or two.
[01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:32.060]   You mean like, for visual purposes?
[01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:35.900]   Yeah, I'm 54, he's like almost 20 years older than me, he looked younger than me.
[01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:40.860]   What was that like, the conversation off camera, like you walking around with him, what was
[01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:42.820]   the content of the conversation?
[01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:46.340]   I mean, I can't, you know, I feel bad even with Putin or anybody, like talking about
[01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:55.380]   stuff that is off the record, but I'll just say that when I said that he didn't want to
[01:38:55.380 --> 01:39:02.260]   fight with NATO, or with the US State Department, or with Joe Biden, because he wants a settlement,
[01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:07.860]   that's a very informed perspective.
[01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:13.860]   He doesn't, you know, say whatever you want about that, believe it or not, but that is
[01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:14.860]   true.
[01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:22.700]   So he's open for peace, for peace negotiations.
[01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:29.700]   Russia tried to join NATO in 2000, that's a fact, okay, they tried to join NATO, so
[01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:35.340]   just think about this, NATO exists to keep Russia contained, it exists as a bulwark against
[01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:42.780]   Russian territorial expansion, and whether or not Russia has any territorial ambitions
[01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:47.420]   is another question, like why would it, it's the largest land mass in the world, whatever,
[01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:48.720]   but that's why it exists.
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:55.140]   So if Russia seeks to join NATO, it is by definition a sign that NATO's job is done
[01:39:55.140 --> 01:40:00.000]   here, we can declare victory and go home.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.120]   The fact that they turned him down is like so shocking to me, but it's true.
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:07.400]   Then he approaches the next president, George W. Bush, that was with Bill Clinton at the
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:09.080]   end of his term in 2000.
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:12.880]   He approaches the next president and said, "Let's in our next missile deal, let's align
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:18.560]   on this, and we'll designate Iran as our common enemy."
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:27.560]   Iran which is now effectively in league with Russia, thanks to our insane policies.
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:30.560]   And George W. Bush, to his credit, is like, "Well, that seems like kind of an innovative
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:34.520]   good idea," and Condi Rice, who's like one of the stupidest people ever to hold power
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:38.440]   in the United States, if I can say, who's like monomaniacally anti-Russia, because she
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:42.840]   had an advisor at Stanford who was, or something, during the Cold War, "No, we can't do that,
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:44.680]   and Bush is just weak," and so he agreed.
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:46.520]   It's like, what?
[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:48.720]   That is crazy.
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:52.600]   If you're fighting with someone and the person says, "You know what, actually our interests
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:58.320]   align, and you've spent 80% of your mental disk space on hating me and opposing me and
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:01.340]   whatever, but actually we can be on the same team."
[01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:05.760]   If you don't at least see that as progress, like what?
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:06.760]   Why would you?
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:12.440]   If your interest is in helping your country, what would be the...
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:13.440]   What's the counter argument?
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:17.520]   I don't even understand it, and no one has even addressed any of this.
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:21.720]   The war of Russian aggression, yeah, it was a war of Russian aggression for sure, but
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:24.360]   how did we get there?
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:30.320]   We got there because Joe Biden and Tony Blinken dispatched Kamala Harris, who does not freelance
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:36.360]   this stuff, okay, fair to say, to the Munich Security Conference two years ago this month,
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:42.960]   February 2022, and said in a press conference to Zelensky, poor Zelensky, "We want you to
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:43.960]   join NATO."
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:48.560]   This was not in a backroom thing, this was in public at a press conference, knowing,
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:54.440]   because he said it like 4,000 times, "We don't want nuclear weapons from the United States
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:57.560]   or NATO on our Western border."
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:03.200]   Duh, and days later he invaded.
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:05.640]   So what is that?
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:06.640]   And if you even...
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:11.360]   I raised that question in my previous job, and I was denounced as, of course, a traitor
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:14.080]   or something, but okay, great, I'm a traitor.
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:15.720]   What's the answer?
[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:17.000]   What's the answer?
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000]   These are not...
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:23.320]   Toria Nuland, who I know, not dumb, hasn't helped the US in any way, an architect of
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:27.320]   the Iraq War, architect of this disaster, one of the people who destroyed the US dollar,
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:29.480]   okay, fine, but she's not stupid.
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:33.560]   So you're trying to get a war by acting that way.
[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:34.560]   What's the other explanation?
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:42.280]   By the way, NATO didn't want Ukraine, because it didn't meet the criteria for admission.
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:43.600]   So why would you say that?
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:49.160]   Because you want a war, that's why, and that war has enriched a lot of people to the tune
[01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:50.880]   of billions.
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:55.520]   So I don't care if I sound like some kind of left-wing conspiracy nut, because I'm neither
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:58.120]   left-wing nor a conspiracy nut.
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:42:59.560]   Tell me how I'm wrong.
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:00.920]   Who do you think is behind it?
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:06.680]   If you were to analyze, zoom out, looking at the entirety of human history, the military
[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:10.320]   industrial complex, you said Kamala Harris.
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:11.980]   Is it individuals?
[01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:17.660]   Is it this collective flock that people are just pro-war as a collective?
[01:43:17.660 --> 01:43:19.760]   It's the hive mind.
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:26.400]   And I spent my whole life in DC from '85 to 2020, so 35 years, and again, I grew up around
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:34.920]   it in that world, and I do think that conspiracies, of course there are conspiracies, but in general
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:37.600]   the hive mind is responsible for the worst decisions.
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:45.400]   It's a bunch of people with the same views, views that have not been updated in decades.
[01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:49.880]   Putin said something that I thought was absolutely true, I don't know how he would know this,
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:52.440]   but it is true, because I lived among them.
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:58.160]   So the Soviet Union dissolves in August of '91 on my honeymoon in Bermuda, I'll never
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:43:59.160]   forget it.
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:00.160]   And it was a big thing.
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:06.640]   If you lived in DC, I mean, the receptionist in my office in 1991 was getting a master's
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:10.400]   in Russian from Georgetown, he was gonna be a Sovietologist.
[01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:14.000]   And he was among thousands of people in Washington on that same track.
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.640]   And so the Soviet Union collapses, well, so does the rationale for a good portion of the
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:25.000]   US government has been dedicated for over 40 years to opposing this thing that no longer
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.000]   exists.
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.880]   So there's a lot of forward momentum, there's a huge amount of money, the bulk of the money
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:32.160]   in the richest country in the world, aimed in this direction, and it's very hard for
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:40.720]   people to readjust, to reassess, and you see this in life all the time.
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:44.840]   I love my wife, all of a sudden she ran off with my best friend, holy shit, I didn't expect
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:47.720]   that this morning, now it's a reality, how do I deal with that?
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:52.120]   Well, you know, I got stage four cancer diagnosis, okay?
[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:56.840]   It's all bad, but I'm just saying, like, that's the nature of life, things you did not anticipate,
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:02.920]   never thought you'd have to face happen out of nowhere, and you have to adjust your expectations
[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:06.640]   and your goals, and people have a hard time with that, very hard time with that.
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:09.040]   So that's a lot of it.
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:16.400]   You know, if you're Condi Rice, sort of like highly ambitious midwit who gets this degree
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:21.320]   from Stanford, and you read Tolstoy in the original, sure, you did, and you spent your
[01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:28.640]   whole life thinking that Russia is the center of evil in the world, it's kind of hard to
[01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:33.120]   be like, well, actually, there's a new threat, and it's coming from farther east, it's primarily
[01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:38.760]   an economic threat, and maybe all the threats aren't reduced to tank battles, that's the
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:43.840]   other thing, is these people are so inelastic in their thinking, so lacking imagination
[01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:50.400]   and flexibility, that they can't sort of imagine a new framework, and the new framework is
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:56.640]   not that you're going to go to war with China over Formosa, Taiwan, no, the framework is
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:46:01.960]   that all of a sudden, all the infrastructure in Tijuana is going to be built by China,
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:06.480]   and that's a different kind of threat, but they can't kind of get there, because they're
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:07.920]   not that impressive.
[01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:13.040]   - So you actually have mentioned this, it's not just the Cold War, it's World War II that
[01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:19.360]   populates most of their thinking in Washington, you mentioned Churchill, Chamberlain, and
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:27.160]   Hitler, and they kind of, seeing the World War II as kind of the good war, and the successful
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:34.560]   role the United States played in that war, they're kind of seeing that dynamic, that
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:38.800]   geopolitical dynamic, and applying it everywhere else still.
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:46.480]   - Yeah, it's a template for everything, and I think it's of huge significance to the development
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:52.600]   of the West, to the civilization we live in now, to world history, it was a world war,
[01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:56.760]   and so I think it's worth knowing a lot about, and being honest about, and all the rest,
[01:46:56.760 --> 01:47:03.800]   but it's hardly the sum total of human history, it's a snapshot, and so you keep hearing people
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:10.240]   refer to, not even the war, no one ever talks about the war, how much does Tony Blinken
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:14.880]   know about the Battle of Stalingrad, probably zero, he doesn't know anything, largest battle
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:20.760]   in human history, I mean he knows nothing, but he knows a lot about the cliches surrounding
[01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:31.600]   the '38 to '40 period, 1938 to 1940, and everything is kind of expressed through that formula,
[01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:35.600]   and not everything is that formula, that's all I'm saying, and the Republicans have a
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:41.520]   strange weakness for it, particularly the closeted ones, the weird ones who have no
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:49.520]   life other than starting more wars, everything to them, the most vulnerable, I would say,
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:56.240]   among them, emotionally, psychologically vulnerable, the dumbest, they will always say the same
[01:47:56.240 --> 01:48:00.840]   thing, and it appeals to Republican voters, unfortunately, that every problem is the result
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:07.040]   of weakness, everyone's Chamberlain, Germany never would have gone in to Poland and Czechoslovakia
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:12.480]   if England had been stronger, that's the argument, is that true, I don't know, actually, maybe,
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:17.040]   it might be totally true, it might not be true at all, I really don't know, but not
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:21.920]   everything is that, that's not always true, if I go up to you in a bar and I say I hate
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:26.560]   your necktie, I'm being pretty aggressive with you, pretty strong, you might beat the
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:30.520]   shit out of me actually, or shoot me if I do that, an aggressive posture doesn't always
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:35.840]   get you the outcome that you want, sometimes it requires a more sophisticated Mediterranean
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:41.360]   posture, I mean, it kind of depends, it's a time and place thing, and they don't acknowledge
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:46.360]   that, it's like everything is this same template, and I just, that's not the road to good decision
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:47.360]   making at all.
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:51.280]   - Since we're on the time period, let me ask you a kind of almost cliche question, but
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:56.280]   it applies to you, which you've interviewed a lot of world leaders, if you had the chance
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:49:05.440]   to interview Hitler in '39, '40, '41, first of all, would you do it, and how would you
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:10.880]   do it, I assume you would do it, given who you are, man, it would be a massive cost for
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:15.240]   doing it, it may destroy my life to interview Putin, though I can tell you as much as I
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:19.080]   want that I'm not a Putin defender, I only care about the United States, that's 100%
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:23.280]   true, anyone who knows me will tell you it's true, I keep saying it, but history may record
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:30.680]   me to the extent it records me at all as a tool of Putin, a hater of America, that seems
[01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:36.760]   absurd to me, but absurd things happen, what would I ask Hitler, I don't even know, I guess
[01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:42.640]   that I would probably ask him what I ask Putin, which is what I ask everybody, like what's
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:47.200]   your motive, why did you do, I mean, if he'd already gone into Poland, like why are you
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:54.400]   doing that, what's your goal, and then the question is, is he gonna answer honestly,
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:50:02.120]   I don't know, you can't make someone answer a question honestly, you can only sort of
[01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:05.080]   shut up while they talk and then let people decide what they think of the answer.
[01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:07.200]   >> Well, just like in the bar fight, there's different ways.
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:11.800]   >> There are different ways, that's exactly right, that's exactly, man, is that true,
[01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:13.200]   that is absolutely right.
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:20.080]   >> I mean, your energy with Putin, for example, was such that it felt like he could trust
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:23.600]   you, I felt like he could tell you a lot, I think.
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:26.960]   >> I just wanted to get it on the record, that's all I wanted, you know.
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:31.520]   >> I think it was extremely, like we have to acknowledge how important that interview
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:37.480]   was for the record and for opening the door for conversation, like opening the door to
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:42.720]   conversation literally is the path to like more conversations and peace, peace talks.
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:48.200]   >> Well, I would flip it around and say anyone who seeks to shut that down by focusing on
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:52.520]   a supermarket video or four minutes versus a two hour and 15 minute long interview with
[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:57.640]   a world leader, anyone who doesn't want more conversation, who wants fewer facts, fewer
[01:50:57.640 --> 01:51:02.360]   perspectives is totalitarian, probably doesn't have good intent.
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:08.560]   I mean, I can honestly say for all my many manifold faults, I've never tried to like
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:14.220]   make people shut up, you know, it's not in me, I don't believe in that.
[01:51:14.220 --> 01:51:21.520]   >> So Putin's folks have shown interest for quite a while to speaking with me.
[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:26.200]   So you've spoken with him, what advice would you give?
[01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:28.840]   >> Oh, do it immediately.
[01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:31.640]   How's your Russian, by the way, have you kept up with it?
[01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:35.640]   >> Yeah, fluent, so he would most likely be in Russian.
[01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:39.880]   >> So that's the other thing is, I do have a question about language barriers, did you
[01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:41.880]   feel it was annoying?
[01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:42.880]   >> It's horrible.
[01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:43.880]   >> Yeah.
[01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:44.880]   >> It's horrible.
[01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:51.080]   I mean, I don't have much of a technique as an interviewer other than listen really carefully.
[01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:52.080]   That's my only skill.
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:56.440]   I don't have the best questions, I certainly don't have the best questions.
[01:51:56.440 --> 01:52:00.560]   All I do that I'm proud of and I think works is I just listen super carefully, I never
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:04.580]   let a word go by that I'm not paying attention, it exhausts me actually.
[01:52:04.580 --> 01:52:10.440]   But you can't do that in a foreign language because there's a delay, here I'm just whining,
[01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:11.440]   but it's real.
[01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:16.720]   >> It's not whining, can you actually describe the technical details of that?
[01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:19.840]   Are you hearing concurrently like at the same time?
[01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:22.580]   >> Yes, but there's a massive lag.
[01:52:22.580 --> 01:52:28.000]   So what's happening is, so the translator, so we were of course extremely uptight about
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:29.000]   the logistical details.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:34.440]   So we brought our own cameraman who I've been around the world with who worked at Fox, came
[01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:37.000]   with me now, amazing.
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:43.840]   And he did, our cameras, lighting, everything, like we had full control of that and we had
[01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:44.840]   control of the tape.
[01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:48.640]   The Russians also had their own cameras and I don't know what they did with it.
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:50.840]   But we had full control of that and we brought our own translator.
[01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:57.060]   We got our own translator because I just, I don't trust anyone, right?
[01:52:57.060 --> 01:53:01.280]   So I think we had a good translator, we had two of them actually, 'cause they get exhausted.
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:05.920]   But the problem is, from my perspective as someone who's like trying to think of a follow
[01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:10.560]   up and listen to the answer, Putin will talk and you can, in part of your ear here, you
[01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:14.440]   know, the Slavic sounds.
[01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:19.840]   And then over that is a guy with a Slavic accent speaking English.
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:23.960]   And then you can hear Putin stop talking and then this guy's answer goes on for another
[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:25.600]   15, 20 seconds.
[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:28.540]   So it's super disconcerting and it's really hard.
[01:53:28.540 --> 01:53:32.440]   And the other thing is, it doesn't matter how good your translators are.
[01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:36.880]   I'm interested in language, I speak only English fluently.
[01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:42.460]   But I'm really interested in language and I know, and I work in language.
[01:53:42.460 --> 01:53:45.520]   It doesn't matter how good your translator is.
[01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:50.640]   In literature and in conversation, you miss so much if the language is moving for you.
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:56.480]   I mean, you see this in Bible study, you see it in Dostoevsky, you see it everywhere.
[01:53:56.480 --> 01:54:02.160]   If you don't speak, you know, Aramaic, Hebrew, Russian, you're not really getting, I mean,
[01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:04.760]   even in romance languages.
[01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:07.040]   Like I, you know, I like Balzac, okay.
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:10.600]   I like, who's obviously written in French.
[01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:14.320]   You read Peregoreau, it's an amazing novel, hilarious.
[01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:16.800]   And it's like, you're not really getting it.
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:19.640]   And it's not that, you know, French and English are not that far apart.
[01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:22.440]   Russian, like what?
[01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:28.400]   Just conversation, so the chemistry of conversation, the humor, the wit, the play with words, all
[01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:29.400]   this stuff.
[01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:34.280]   Exactly, and my understanding of Russian, as a lover of Russian literature and English,
[01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:36.720]   is that it's not a simple language at all.
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:42.440]   The grammar's complex, there's a lot that's expressed that will be lost in the translation.
[01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:48.360]   So yes, I mean, the fact that you speak native Russian, I mean, I would run that walk to
[01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:50.320]   that interview because I think it would just be amazing.
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:53.440]   You would get so much more out of it than I did.
[01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:56.280]   And we should say that you've met a lot of world leaders.
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:55:01.520]   Both Zelensky and Putin are intelligent, witty, even funny.
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:02.520]   Yes.
[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:07.640]   So like there's a depth to the person that can be explored through a conversation just
[01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:09.040]   on that element, the linguistic element.
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:11.120]   For sure, and Putin speaks decent English.
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:14.020]   I spoke to him in English, so I know that.
[01:55:14.020 --> 01:55:16.240]   But he's not comfortable with it at all.
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:18.080]   But Zelensky is, I think.
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:19.080]   No.
[01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:23.600]   He's, well, he's better than Putin at English, but he's still, the humor, the intelligence,
[01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:26.000]   all of that is not quite there in English.
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:32.280]   He says simple points, but the guy's a comedian, and he's a comedian primarily in Russian,
[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:33.600]   the Russian language.
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:41.320]   So the Ukrainian language is now used mostly, primarily as a kind of symbol of independence.
[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:42.320]   I'm aware of that.
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:43.320]   It's a political decision.
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:44.320]   No, I know.
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:47.240]   He is, you know, really his native language is Russian language.
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:48.240]   Of course.
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:49.240]   A lot of people in Ukraine.
[01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:53.160]   But you can also understand his position that he might not want to be speaking in Russian
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:54.160]   publicly.
[01:55:54.160 --> 01:55:55.160]   That's something I've...
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:55:58.200]   I don't think they're allowed to speak in Russian in some places in Ukraine, right?
[01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:03.680]   That's one of the reasons that Russia was so mad is that they were attacking language,
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:05.280]   and that's a fair complaint.
[01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:06.280]   I'm like, "What?"
[01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:10.240]   And by the way, if you haven't been to Moscow in a while, you should see it, and you will
[01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:15.400]   pick up a million things that were invisible to me, and you should assess it for yourself.
[01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:20.240]   And my strong advice would be, even if you don't interview Putin, go over there, spend
[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:23.640]   a week there, and assess what you think.
[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:26.040]   I mean, how restricted does the society feel?
[01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:29.720]   I mean, it would take a lot of balls to do this because you'll...
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:33.560]   I mean, whatever you decide, you will be sucked into conversations that have nothing to do
[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:35.000]   with you, political conversations.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.760]   You're obviously not a political activist, right?
[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:38.760]   You're an interviewer.
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:41.720]   But I think it would be so interesting.
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:47.160]   But for interview itself, is there advice you have about how to carry an interview?
[01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:50.120]   It is fundamentally different when you do it in the native language, but...
[01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:51.120]   Yes.
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:54.720]   I mean, I think I approached the...
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:57.560]   And maybe I did it incorrectly, but this was the product of a lot of thought.
[01:56:57.560 --> 01:57:03.840]   I was coming into that interview aware that he hadn't given an interview at all with anybody
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:05.920]   since the war started.
[01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:10.880]   So I had a million different questions, and as noted, I didn't ask them because I just
[01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:13.280]   wanted to focus on the war.
[01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:14.960]   But I mean, there's so many...
[01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:16.560]   I'll send you my notes that I wrote.
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:18.120]   I was like a diligent little girl.
[01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:19.120]   That would be amazing.
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:20.120]   But I think...
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:25.320]   All these questions, and some of them I thought were pretty funny.
[01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:29.240]   In your case, I think the very fact of the interview was the most important thing.
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:30.240]   Yeah, that's probably right.
[01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:31.240]   I did have...
[01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:33.400]   The question that I really wanted to ask that I was almost going to ask because it made
[01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:38.840]   me laugh out loud, I was sitting, having drinking coffee beforehand with my producers, and I
[01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:40.280]   was like, "I'm going to go in there.
[01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:44.880]   My first question is going to be, Mr. President, I've been here in the Kremlin for two days
[01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:51.120]   preparing, and I haven't seen a single African-American in a position of power in the Kremlin."
[01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:52.120]   Sure.
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:58.080]   I thought that's too culturally specific and dry, and he'd be like, "This guy's freaking
[01:57:58.080 --> 01:57:59.080]   crazy."
[01:57:59.080 --> 01:58:00.080]   Yeah.
[01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:01.080]   Yeah.
[01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:02.080]   You don't want to open with a crazy...
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:03.080]   No, I know.
[01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:04.080]   With humor.
[01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:05.080]   I know.
[01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:06.080]   All right.
[01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:07.080]   It doesn't translate.
[01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:08.080]   It doesn't.
[01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:09.080]   You don't want to wait for the joke-
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:10.080]   You'd be like, "What?"
[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:11.080]   ... to see if it lands or not.
[01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:12.640]   "This is not America."
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:18.280]   At Fox, you were, for a time, the most popular host.
[01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:24.520]   After Fox, you've garnered a huge amount of attention as well, same, probably more.
[01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:30.080]   Do you worry that popularity and just that attention gets to your head?
[01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:33.680]   Is it kind of drug that clouds your thinking?
[01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:34.680]   You think?
[01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:38.680]   I live in a spiritual graveyard of people killed by the quest for fame, yes.
[01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:40.520]   I have lived in that.
[01:58:40.520 --> 01:58:47.480]   I would say the two advantages I have, one, I have a happy family and a stable family
[01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:55.160]   and a stable group of friends, which is just the greatest blessing, and a strong love of
[01:58:55.160 --> 01:59:02.520]   nature that my family shares, so I'm in nature every day, and I have a whole series of rituals
[01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:07.800]   designed to keep me from becoming the asshole that I could easily become.
[01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:13.240]   But no, of course, I mean, that's what I ... And I don't want to beat up on ... I'm grateful
[01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:21.520]   to Elon, who gave me a platform, and I mean that sincerely, but I definitely don't spend
[01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:25.280]   a lot of time on social media or on the internet for that exact reason.
[01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:30.340]   Well, first of all, I think it's, as I've said, a much more controlled environment than
[01:59:30.340 --> 01:59:36.120]   we acknowledge, and I don't want lies in my head, but I also don't want to become the
[01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:39.560]   sort of person who's seeking the adulation of strangers.
[01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:46.320]   I think that's soul poison, and I said earlier that I think that the desire for power and
[01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:53.680]   money will kill you, and I believe that, and I've seen it a lot, but I also think the desire
[01:59:53.680 --> 01:59:59.080]   for the love of people you don't know is every bit as poisonous, maybe more so.
[01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:04.120]   And so, yes, and it's not just because I've obviously spent most of my life in public,
[02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:10.400]   and in fact, I don't spend my life in public, I'm a completely private person, but professionally,
[02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:12.120]   I've spent my life in public.
[02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:16.160]   It's not just that, it's like social media makes everybody into a cable news host.
[02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:19.760]   We're talking off the air, my new ... I'm obsessed with this, I don't know enough about
[02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:24.740]   it, but here's what I do know, South Korea, amazing country, great people.
[02:00:24.740 --> 02:00:28.840]   I grew up around Koreans, probably no group, if I can generalize about a group that I like
[02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:36.640]   more than Koreans are just smart, funny, honest, brave, I really like Koreans, I always have,
[02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:39.720]   my whole life, growing up in Southern California with Koreans.
[02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:43.460]   South Korea is dying, it's literally dying.
[02:00:43.460 --> 02:00:49.540]   It's way below replacement rate and fertility, it's suicide rate is astronomical.
[02:00:49.540 --> 02:00:50.540]   Why is that?
[02:00:50.540 --> 02:00:51.540]   It's a rich country.
[02:00:51.540 --> 02:00:56.520]   Of course, I don't know the answer, but I suspect it has something to do with the penetration
[02:00:56.520 --> 02:01:02.640]   of technology into South Korean society is, I think, one of the highest, certainly one
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:04.360]   of the highest in the world.
[02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:08.780]   People live online there, and there was a belief for a bunch of reasons in South Korea
[02:01:08.780 --> 02:01:13.840]   that Western technology would be a liberating progressive force, and I think it's been the
[02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:14.880]   opposite.
[02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:18.320]   It's my sense, strong sense, and I think it's true in this country too.
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:21.920]   I don't understand how people can ignore the decline in life expectancy or the rise in
[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:22.960]   fentanyl use.
[02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:27.160]   It's not just about China shipping precursor chemicals to Mexico, it's like, "Why would
[02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:28.160]   you take that shit?"
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:32.560]   I hope those two things aren't coupled, technological advancement and the erosion.
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:36.840]   Well, let me ask you, and I know you're a technologist, and I respect it, and there's
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:38.800]   a lot about technology that I like and have benefited from.
[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:44.120]   I had back surgery and it worked, okay, so I'm not against all technology, but can you
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:50.640]   name a technology, a big technology in the last 20 years that we can say conclusively
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:52.800]   has improved people's lives?
[02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:54.580]   Well, conclusive is a tough thing.
[02:01:54.580 --> 02:01:57.600]   Pretty conclusively that we can brag about.
[02:01:57.600 --> 02:02:04.120]   I think, well, you've criticized Google search recently, but I think making the world knowledge
[02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:08.000]   accessible to anyone, anywhere across the world through Google search.
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:09.120]   Well, I love that.
[02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:10.120]   I love that idea.
[02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:11.280]   Are people better informed?
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:15.880]   Are they more superstitious and misled than they were 20 years ago?
[02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:16.880]   I think-
[02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:17.880]   You're not close.
[02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:18.880]   Well, no, I don't know.
[02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:20.480]   I think they are more informed.
[02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:22.520]   It's just revealing the ignorance.
[02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:26.040]   The internet has revealed the ignorance that people have, but I think the ignorance has
[02:02:26.040 --> 02:02:28.960]   been decreasing gradually.
[02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:33.720]   If you look, even you can criticize places like Wikipedia a lot, and many, very many
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:39.880]   aspects of Wikipedia are very biased, but when you, most of it are actually topics that
[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:42.680]   don't have any bias in them because they're not political or so on.
[02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:45.880]   There's no battle over those topics, and most of Wikipedia-
[02:02:45.880 --> 02:02:46.880]   I think that's true.
[02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:49.200]   Is like the fastest way to learn about a thing.
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:50.580]   I couldn't agree more.
[02:02:50.580 --> 02:02:53.960]   You can very quickly imagine you're an expert, and that may be the problem.
[02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:54.960]   I think-
[02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:55.960]   No, it's true.
[02:02:55.960 --> 02:02:57.640]   I just experienced it in Moscow.
[02:02:57.640 --> 02:03:02.400]   It's like, again, I feel like I'm in the top 1% for information, certainly intake, because
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:04.160]   it's my job.
[02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:07.280]   I had literally, and plus I'm always out of the country.
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:09.440]   I've been around the world many times.
[02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:13.760]   I feel like I know a lot about the rest of the world, or I thought I did, and how did
[02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:17.360]   I not know any of that?
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:21.580]   Maybe I'm just unusually ignorant or something, or reading the wrong things.
[02:03:21.580 --> 02:03:28.100]   I don't know what it was, but all I know is the digital information sources that I use
[02:03:28.100 --> 02:03:33.660]   to understand just something as simple as what's the city of Moscow like were completely
[02:03:33.660 --> 02:03:34.660]   inadequate.
[02:03:34.660 --> 02:03:42.660]   Anyway, look, I just am worried that we're missing the obvious signs, and the obvious
[02:03:42.660 --> 02:03:50.980]   signs are reproduction, life expectancy, sobriety.
[02:03:50.980 --> 02:03:56.300]   If you have a society where people just can't deal with being sober, don't want to have
[02:03:56.300 --> 02:04:04.160]   children, and are dying younger, you have an extremely sick, you have a suicidal society.
[02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:08.500]   I'm not even blaming anyone for it, I'm just saying objectively that is true.
[02:04:08.500 --> 02:04:13.460]   The measure of health of your society is the number of children that you have and how well
[02:04:13.460 --> 02:04:14.460]   they do.
[02:04:14.460 --> 02:04:15.460]   It's super simple.
[02:04:15.460 --> 02:04:16.460]   That's the next generation.
[02:04:16.460 --> 02:04:20.100]   We all die, and what replaces us?
[02:04:20.100 --> 02:04:25.940]   If you don't care, then you're suicidal, and maybe other things too.
[02:04:25.940 --> 02:04:27.900]   That's all I'm saying.
[02:04:27.900 --> 02:04:28.900]   What happened to South Korea?
[02:04:28.900 --> 02:04:30.980]   Why can't anyone answer the question?
[02:04:30.980 --> 02:04:35.820]   They're great people, they're rich, they have all these advantages, they're on the cutting
[02:04:35.820 --> 02:04:40.580]   edge of every American ... For a foreign country, they're more American than maybe any other
[02:04:40.580 --> 02:04:43.980]   country other than Canada.
[02:04:43.980 --> 02:04:44.980]   What happened?
[02:04:44.980 --> 02:04:49.780]   I mean, if your fundamental worry is the same kind of thing might be happening or will happen
[02:04:49.780 --> 02:04:50.780]   in the United States.
[02:04:50.780 --> 02:04:51.780]   Well, let me just ask you this.
[02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:56.260]   I think North Korea seems like the most dystopian, horrible place in the world, right, obviously?
[02:04:56.260 --> 02:04:58.260]   It's a byword for dystopia, right?
[02:04:58.260 --> 02:04:59.260]   North Korean.
[02:04:59.260 --> 02:05:01.460]   I use it all the time, and I mean it.
[02:05:01.460 --> 02:05:08.300]   If in 100 years, there are more North Koreans still alive than there are South Koreans,
[02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:09.300]   what does that tell us?
[02:05:09.300 --> 02:05:11.260]   Yeah, that's something to worry about, but also-
[02:05:11.260 --> 02:05:12.260]   But how did it happen?
[02:05:12.260 --> 02:05:13.260]   Why?
[02:05:13.260 --> 02:05:14.260]   I'm interested in the why.
[02:05:14.260 --> 02:05:17.380]   There's a question I asked Putin.
[02:05:17.380 --> 02:05:20.780]   Sometimes we don't know why, but why does no one ask why?
[02:05:20.780 --> 02:05:27.460]   I've seen a lot of increased distrust in science, which is deserved in many places.
[02:05:27.460 --> 02:05:34.500]   It just worries me because some of the greatest inventions of humanity come from science and
[02:05:34.500 --> 02:05:35.500]   technological innovation.
[02:05:35.500 --> 02:05:39.900]   Okay, then let me ask you a couple questions, and perhaps you have the answer.
[02:05:39.900 --> 02:05:43.060]   I've always assumed that was true, and I should say that when I was a kid, I lived in La Jolla,
[02:05:43.060 --> 02:05:47.380]   California next to the Salk Institute, named after Jonas Salk, a resident of La Jolla,
[02:05:47.380 --> 02:05:51.540]   California, who created the polio vaccine and saved untold millions.
[02:05:51.540 --> 02:05:55.060]   My belief, which is still my belief actually, that's a great thing, it's one of the great
[02:05:55.060 --> 02:06:05.700]   additions to human flourishing ever, but if technology is so great, why is life expectancy
[02:06:05.700 --> 02:06:10.420]   going down, and why are fewer people having kids, and why would anybody who has internet
[02:06:10.420 --> 02:06:13.300]   access ever use fentanyl?
[02:06:13.300 --> 02:06:14.380]   What is that?
[02:06:14.380 --> 02:06:15.380]   What is going on?
[02:06:15.380 --> 02:06:20.620]   And until we can answer that question, I think we have to assume the question of whether
[02:06:20.620 --> 02:06:26.020]   technology is in that good or in that bad is unresolved, like at best, right?
[02:06:26.020 --> 02:06:30.980]   At best, perhaps, but technology is the very tool which will allow us to have that kind
[02:06:30.980 --> 02:06:33.780]   of discourse to figure out to do science better.
[02:06:33.780 --> 02:06:38.740]   I mean, I want that to be true, and when you said that the internet allows people to escape
[02:06:38.740 --> 02:06:43.740]   the darkness of ignorance, man, that resonated with me because I felt that way in 1993, '94,
[02:06:43.740 --> 02:06:47.740]   when it was first starting and I first got on it, and I thought, "Man, this is amazing.
[02:06:47.740 --> 02:06:49.880]   You can talk for free to anyone around the world.
[02:06:49.880 --> 02:06:52.500]   This is going to be great," but let me just ask you this.
[02:06:52.500 --> 02:06:55.480]   This is something I've never gotten over or gotten a straight answer to.
[02:06:55.480 --> 02:07:01.780]   Why is it that in any European city, the greatest buildings, indisputably, were built before
[02:07:01.780 --> 02:07:04.900]   electricity and the machine age?
[02:07:04.900 --> 02:07:09.900]   Why has no one ever built a medieval cathedral in the modern era, ever?
[02:07:09.900 --> 02:07:12.420]   Well, what is that?
[02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:16.980]   Indisputably, you have a presumption, we have a good definition of what beauty is.
[02:07:16.980 --> 02:07:18.140]   There's a lot of people-
[02:07:18.140 --> 02:07:19.140]   All right.
[02:07:19.140 --> 02:07:20.140]   Let's be specific.
[02:07:20.140 --> 02:07:24.820]   Pick a European city or any city in the world and tell me that there's a prettier building
[02:07:24.820 --> 02:07:28.340]   than, say, Notre Dame before it was set fire to.
[02:07:28.340 --> 02:07:30.660]   There's other sources of prettiness and beauty.
[02:07:30.660 --> 02:07:31.660]   Purely in architecture.
[02:07:31.660 --> 02:07:32.660]   Of course.
[02:07:32.660 --> 02:07:33.660]   Of course.
[02:07:33.660 --> 02:07:35.920]   Trees are prettier than any building, in my opinion, so I agree with that.
[02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:43.380]   But also, there could be ... I grew up in the pre-internet age, but if you grew up in
[02:07:43.380 --> 02:07:49.980]   the internet age, I think your eyes would be more open to beauty that's digital, that
[02:07:49.980 --> 02:07:50.980]   is in a digital-
[02:07:50.980 --> 02:07:55.740]   I'm not discounting the possibility of digital beauty at all, and the Ted Kaczynski in me
[02:07:55.740 --> 02:07:57.740]   wants to, but that's too close-minded.
[02:07:57.740 --> 02:07:58.740]   I agree.
[02:07:58.740 --> 02:08:02.020]   I'm completely willing to believe there is such a thing as digital beauty.
[02:08:02.020 --> 02:08:05.540]   I mean, I have digital pictures on my phone of my dogs and kids, so I know that there
[02:08:05.540 --> 02:08:06.540]   is.
[02:08:06.540 --> 02:08:13.360]   But purely in the realm of architecture, because it's limited in ... And it is one of the
[02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:15.380]   pure expressions of human creativity.
[02:08:15.380 --> 02:08:19.960]   We need places to live and work and worship and eat, and so we build buildings, and every
[02:08:19.960 --> 02:08:22.360]   civilization has.
[02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:30.800]   But the machine age, the industrial age, seem to have decreased the quality and the beauty
[02:08:30.800 --> 02:08:34.180]   in that one expression of human creativity, architecture.
[02:08:34.180 --> 02:08:35.180]   And why is that?
[02:08:35.180 --> 02:08:42.180]   Well, I could also argue that I'm a big sucker for bridges, and modern bridges can give older
[02:08:42.180 --> 02:08:43.820]   bridges a run for their money.
[02:08:43.820 --> 02:08:46.880]   But I like bridges too, so I agree with you, sort of.
[02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:51.860]   But the Brooklyn Bridge, I don't know that there's any modern bridges.
[02:08:51.860 --> 02:08:59.540]   That was built in late 19th century, very much in the industrial age.
[02:08:59.540 --> 02:09:07.460]   But I'm just saying the great cathedrals of Europe, even the pyramids, whoever built them,
[02:09:07.460 --> 02:09:10.720]   it seems like if you ... It's like super obvious.
[02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:14.020]   I'm dealing on the autism level here, just like, "Well, why is that?"
[02:09:14.020 --> 02:09:16.520]   But that's a good way to start.
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:20.920]   If all of a sudden you have electricity and hydraulics, and you have access to ... I mean,
[02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:26.080]   I have machines in my woodshop at home that are so much more advanced than anything that
[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:32.500]   any cathedral builder in 15th century Europe had, and yet neither I nor anyone I know could
[02:09:32.500 --> 02:09:37.080]   even begin to understand how a flying buttress was built, right?
[02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:40.100]   And so, what is that?
[02:09:40.100 --> 02:09:46.480]   And the other question is also, consider that whatever is creating this technology is unstoppable.
[02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:48.480]   Well, there's that.
[02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:50.800]   And the question is like, how do you steer it then?
[02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:56.800]   You have to look in a realist way at the world, and say that if you don't, somebody else will,
[02:09:56.800 --> 02:10:00.560]   and you want to do it in a safe way.
[02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:02.200]   I mean, this is the Manhattan Project.
[02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:05.160]   Was the Manhattan Project a good idea, to create nuclear weapons?
[02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:06.160]   That's an easy call.
[02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:11.600]   No, for me, it's an easy call in retrospect, in retrospect, yes, because it seems like
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:13.960]   it stopped world wars.
[02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:19.400]   So the mutually assured destruction seems to have ended wars, ended major military.
[02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:23.760]   Well, it's been, what, 80 years?
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:26.360]   Not even 80 years, 79.
[02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:34.240]   And so, we haven't had a world war in 79 years, but one nuclear exchange would, of course,
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:37.720]   kill more people than all wars in human history combined, so.
[02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:40.080]   You saying 79 makes it sound like you're counting.
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:44.980]   I am counting, because I think it, obviously, it's completely demonic, and everyone pretends
[02:10:44.980 --> 02:10:45.980]   like it's great.
[02:10:45.980 --> 02:10:47.280]   You know, nuclear weapons are evil.
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:48.280]   Yeah, no, absolutely.
[02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:52.720]   The use of them is evil, and the technology itself is evil.
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:55.800]   And in my, I mean, it's just like, if you can't, that's just so obvious.
[02:10:55.800 --> 02:10:59.760]   And that's what I'm saying is like, I'm not against all technology.
[02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:01.600]   I took a shower this morning.
[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:05.800]   It was powered by an electric pump, heated by a water heater.
[02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:07.280]   Like, I loved it.
[02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:08.840]   I sat in an electric sauna.
[02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:13.560]   You know, like, I'm not against all technology, obviously.
[02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:15.920]   But the mindless worship of technology?
[02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:16.920]   Sure.
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:18.800]   Mindless worship of anything is pretty bad.
[02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:21.520]   But I'm just saying, so you said, let's approach this from a realist perspective.
[02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:22.840]   Okay, let's.
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:30.320]   If we think that there is a reasonable or even a potential chance, it could happen.
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:31.320]   Maybe on the margins.
[02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:36.560]   Let's say we've got it at a 15% chance that AI, for example, gets away from us, and we
[02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:38.960]   are now ruled by machines that may actually hate us.
[02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:41.680]   Who knows what they want?
[02:11:41.680 --> 02:11:46.240]   Why wouldn't we use force to stop that from happening?
[02:11:46.240 --> 02:11:48.640]   So you're walking down the street in midtown Manhattan.
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:49.640]   It's midnight.
[02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:50.640]   You've had a few drinks.
[02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:51.640]   You're coming from dinner.
[02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:52.640]   You're walking back to your apartment.
[02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:56.440]   A guy, a very thuggish looking guy, young man, approaches you.
[02:11:56.440 --> 02:11:58.080]   He's 50 feet away.
[02:11:58.080 --> 02:11:59.680]   He pulls out a handgun.
[02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:00.960]   He lifts it up to you.
[02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:01.960]   You also are armed.
[02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:05.320]   Do you shoot him or do you wait to get shot?
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:06.320]   Because all the data...
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:07.800]   Look, he hasn't shot you.
[02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:10.120]   He's not committed a crime other than carrying a weapon in New York City, but maybe he's
[02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:11.120]   got a license.
[02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:12.120]   You don't know.
[02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:13.760]   It could be legal.
[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:15.800]   But he's pointing a gun at you.
[02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:20.560]   Is it fair to kill him before he kills you, even though you can't prove that he will kill
[02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:22.740]   you?
[02:12:22.740 --> 02:12:25.920]   If I knew my skills with a gun, because he already has a gun...
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:30.720]   Right, but it turns out that you have some confidence in your ability to stop the threat
[02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:31.720]   if I fire.
[02:12:31.720 --> 02:12:32.920]   Are you justified in doing that?
[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:34.240]   I just like this picture.
[02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:35.920]   Am I wearing a cowboy hat?
[02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:36.920]   No.
[02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:39.360]   No, but you're wearing cowboy boots and they're clicking on the cobblestones.
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:40.360]   Actually, you're in meatpacking.
[02:12:40.360 --> 02:12:41.360]   Okay, great.
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:42.360]   I like this picture.
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:43.360]   I'm just...
[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:44.360]   Yeah.
[02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:45.360]   I think about this a lot.
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:46.360]   No.
[02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:48.100]   Yeah, I understand your point.
[02:12:48.100 --> 02:12:57.760]   But also, I think that metaphor falls apart if there's other nations at play here.
[02:12:57.760 --> 02:13:04.520]   So the same as with a nuclear bomb, if US doesn't build it, will other nations build
[02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:05.520]   it?
[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:09.000]   The Soviet Union build it, China or Nazi Germany?
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:10.000]   We faced this.
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:14.640]   I mean, we faced this and the last president to try and keep, in a meaningful way, nuclear
[02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:20.160]   proliferation under control was John F. Kennedy, and look what happened to him.
[02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:21.480]   But what's your suggestion?
[02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:22.480]   Like, is it...
[02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:23.480]   But hold on.
[02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:24.480]   Inevitable?
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:31.040]   Well, their position in 1962 was, "No, it's absolutely not inevitable."
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:36.000]   Or perhaps it's inevitable in the sense that our death is inevitable as human beings, but
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:40.520]   we fight against the dying of the light anyway, because that's the right thing to do.
[02:13:40.520 --> 02:13:45.280]   No, we were willing to use force to prevent other countries from getting the bomb, because
[02:13:45.280 --> 02:13:49.120]   we thought that would be really terrible, because we acknowledged that while there were
[02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:53.400]   upsides to nuclear weapons, just like there are upsides to AI, the downside was terrifying
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:54.400]   in the hands of...
[02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:57.080]   I mean, that's the thing that I kind of don't get.
[02:13:57.080 --> 02:14:02.800]   It's like the applications of that technology in the hands of people who mean to do harm
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:06.840]   and destroy, it's like so obviously terrifying.
[02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:08.040]   It's not so obvious to me.
[02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:11.400]   What I'm terrified about is probably a similar thing that you're terrified about, is using
[02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:14.760]   that technology to manipulate people's minds.
[02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:20.800]   That's much more reasonable to me as an expectation, a real threat that's possible in the next
[02:14:20.800 --> 02:14:21.800]   few years.
[02:14:21.800 --> 02:14:22.800]   But what matters more than that?
[02:14:22.800 --> 02:14:28.280]   Well, I think that could lead to destruction of human civilization through other humans,
[02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:30.360]   for example, starting nuclear wars.
[02:14:30.360 --> 02:14:31.360]   Yeah.
[02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:35.280]   Well, I mean, this is one of the reasons I wasn't afraid in the Vladimir Putin interview,
[02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:38.360]   because it's like it's all ending anyway.
[02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:39.360]   You know what I mean?
[02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:40.360]   Yeah.
[02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:41.360]   Well, might as well dance on the deck of the Titanic.
[02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:42.520]   Don't be a pussy.
[02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:43.520]   Enjoy it.
[02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:48.920]   I think we will forever fight against the dying of the light as the entirety of the
[02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:49.920]   civilization.
[02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:53.360]   You know, somebody said that Biden ascribed that to Churchill.
[02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:55.280]   That was a Churchill quote.
[02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:56.360]   That's kind of what I'm saying.
[02:14:56.360 --> 02:15:05.320]   It's like if you live in a society where people don't read anymore, people are by definition
[02:15:05.320 --> 02:15:10.720]   much more ignorant, but they don't know it.
[02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:14.440]   I do think the Wikipedia culture, and I think there are cool things about Wikipedia, certainly
[02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:17.600]   it's ease of use is high, and that's great.
[02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:22.560]   But people get the sense that like, "Oh, I know a lot about this or that or the other
[02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:23.560]   thing."
[02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:26.960]   And it's like the key to wisdom, again, the key to wise decision making is knowing what
[02:15:26.960 --> 02:15:27.960]   you don't know.
[02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:32.240]   And it's just so important to be reminded of what a dummy you are and how ignorant you
[02:15:32.240 --> 02:15:33.240]   are all the time.
[02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:34.240]   Yeah.
[02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:35.240]   That's why I like having daughters.
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:38.620]   It's like it's never far from mind how flawed I am.
[02:15:38.620 --> 02:15:39.620]   And that's important.
[02:15:39.620 --> 02:15:40.620]   Yeah.
[02:15:40.620 --> 02:15:41.620]   In the same way I hope to be a dad.
[02:15:41.620 --> 02:15:42.620]   You should have a ton of kids.
[02:15:42.620 --> 02:15:43.620]   Are you going to have a ton of pups?
[02:15:43.620 --> 02:15:44.620]   Five.
[02:15:44.620 --> 02:15:45.620]   Oh, pup?
[02:15:45.620 --> 02:15:46.620]   You mean like kids?
[02:15:46.620 --> 02:15:47.620]   Children?
[02:15:47.620 --> 02:15:48.620]   Yes.
[02:15:48.620 --> 02:15:49.620]   Five.
[02:15:49.620 --> 02:15:51.620]   But also I've been thinking of getting a dog, but unrelated, I would love to have like five
[02:15:51.620 --> 02:15:52.620]   or six kids.
[02:15:52.620 --> 02:15:53.620]   Yeah, for sure.
[02:15:53.620 --> 02:15:55.940]   Have you found a victim yet?
[02:15:55.940 --> 02:15:59.140]   You make it sound so romantic, Tucker.
[02:15:59.140 --> 02:16:00.140]   Just joking.
[02:16:00.140 --> 02:16:01.140]   I love it.
[02:16:01.140 --> 02:16:04.020]   No, you should totally do that.
[02:16:04.020 --> 02:16:05.020]   Yeah.
[02:16:05.020 --> 02:16:06.020]   100%.
[02:16:06.020 --> 02:16:08.100]   But also in terms of being humble, I do jujitsu.
[02:16:08.100 --> 02:16:10.260]   It's a martial art where you get your ass kicked all the time.
[02:16:10.260 --> 02:16:11.260]   I love that.
[02:16:11.260 --> 02:16:12.300]   It's nice to get your ass kicked.
[02:16:12.300 --> 02:16:17.640]   Physical humbling is unlike anything else, I think, because we're kind of monkeys at
[02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:20.220]   heart and just getting your ass kicked is really helpful.
[02:16:20.220 --> 02:16:21.220]   I agree.
[02:16:21.220 --> 02:16:22.220]   I've had it happen to me twice.
[02:16:22.220 --> 02:16:23.220]   Twice is enough.
[02:16:23.220 --> 02:16:26.080]   It got me to quit drinking.
[02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:28.740]   I was good at starting fights, not good at winning them.
[02:16:28.740 --> 02:16:31.220]   But no, I completely agree with that.
[02:16:31.220 --> 02:16:35.060]   Let me ask you, you've been pretty close with Donald Trump.
[02:16:35.060 --> 02:16:41.580]   Your private texts about him around the 2020 election were made public.
[02:16:41.580 --> 02:16:46.180]   In one of them, you said you passionately hate Trump.
[02:16:46.180 --> 02:16:50.400]   When that came out, you said that you actually know you love him.
[02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:53.100]   So how do you explain the difference?
[02:16:53.100 --> 02:16:58.020]   My texts reflect a lot of things, including how I feel at the moment that I sent them.
[02:16:58.020 --> 02:17:01.360]   That specific text, I happen to know since I had to go through it forensically during
[02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:06.980]   my deposition in a case I was not named in, I had nothing to do with whatsoever.
[02:17:06.980 --> 02:17:12.740]   It's crazy how civil suits can be used to hurt people you disagree with politically.
[02:17:12.740 --> 02:17:16.780]   But I was mad at a very specific person.
[02:17:16.780 --> 02:17:17.780]   I mean, really what that...
[02:17:17.780 --> 02:17:20.980]   I mean, you're asking me, I'll tell you exactly what that was.
[02:17:20.980 --> 02:17:25.780]   It was the second the election ended and they stopped voting, stopped the vote counting
[02:17:25.780 --> 02:17:27.520]   on election night, I was like, "Well, this is..."
[02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:32.540]   It's all now mail-in ballots, electronic voting machines, I was like, "That's a rigged election."
[02:17:32.540 --> 02:17:34.260]   I thought that then, I think it now.
[02:17:34.260 --> 02:17:36.520]   Well, now it's obvious that it was.
[02:17:36.520 --> 02:17:40.360]   But at the time, I was like, "I feel like that was crazy what just happened.
[02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:41.360]   I want...
[02:17:41.360 --> 02:17:43.680]   But I don't want to go on TV and say that's a rigged election because I don't have any
[02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:44.680]   evidence it's a rigged election.
[02:17:44.680 --> 02:17:45.680]   You can't do that.
[02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:48.280]   It's irresponsible and it's wrong."
[02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:50.060]   So I was like, "I want..."
[02:17:50.060 --> 02:17:54.720]   The Trump campaign was making all these claims about this or that fraud, so I was trying
[02:17:54.720 --> 02:17:59.160]   my best to substantiate them, to follow up on it.
[02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:04.380]   Everyone else is like, "Shut up, Trump, you lost, go away, we're going to indict you."
[02:18:04.380 --> 02:18:07.320]   But I felt like my job was to be like, "No, the guy's, he's president, he's claiming the
[02:18:07.320 --> 02:18:10.840]   election just got stolen and he's making these claims, let's see if we can..."
[02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:15.720]   Well, the people around him were like so incompetent, it was just absolutely crazy.
[02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:20.200]   And so I called a couple of times, I finally gave up, but I'd call and be like, "All right,
[02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:24.200]   you guys claim that these inconsistencies and this, whatever this happened, give me
[02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:26.080]   evidence and I'll put it on TV."
[02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:30.080]   You know, it's my job to bring stuff that is not going to be aired anywhere else to
[02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:31.080]   the public.
[02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:37.160]   I couldn't, it was like, it was insane how incompetent and unserious...
[02:18:37.160 --> 02:18:38.720]   So they weren't able to provide like...
[02:18:38.720 --> 02:18:42.400]   Well, here's the point of the story and of that text.
[02:18:42.400 --> 02:18:44.240]   So then they come out and they say, "Well, dead people voted."
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:46.960]   Well, that's just an easy call, okay?
[02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:50.680]   If a dead person voted, we can prove someone's dead because like being dead is one of the
[02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:54.680]   few things we're good at like verifying because you start to smell, okay?
[02:18:54.680 --> 02:18:57.600]   And there's a record of it, it's called a death certificate.
[02:18:57.600 --> 02:19:01.280]   So I was like, "Give me the names of people who are dead who voted, then we can get their
[02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:03.880]   registration and we can show they voted."
[02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:04.880]   Five names.
[02:19:04.880 --> 02:19:13.000]   So I go on TV and I say, "Caroline Johnson, 79 of Waukegan, Illinois, voted.
[02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:14.000]   Here's her death certificate.
[02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:15.000]   She died."
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:16.320]   And the campaign sends me this stuff.
[02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:20.800]   I, in general, don't take stuff directly from campaigns because they all lie because their
[02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:22.360]   job is to get elected or whatever.
[02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:26.880]   So I'm very wary of campaigns having been around it for 30 years.
[02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:30.240]   But I made an exception to my rule and I got a bunch of stuff from them.
[02:19:30.240 --> 02:19:33.640]   Well, like of the six names, two of them are still alive.
[02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:34.640]   What?
[02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:35.640]   I was...
[02:19:35.640 --> 02:19:38.040]   Well, I immediately corrected it the next night.
[02:19:38.040 --> 02:19:43.520]   CNN did a whole segment on how I was spreading disinformation, which I was, by the way.
[02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:45.440]   In this one case, they were right.
[02:19:45.440 --> 02:19:48.320]   I was so mad.
[02:19:48.320 --> 02:19:50.880]   I was like, "I hate you.
[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:51.880]   I'm not talking about you.
[02:19:51.880 --> 02:19:52.880]   I'm so mad."
[02:19:52.880 --> 02:19:55.520]   Anyway, that's the answer.
[02:19:55.520 --> 02:19:56.520]   That's what that was.
[02:19:56.520 --> 02:19:57.520]   Who were you texting to?
[02:19:57.520 --> 02:19:58.520]   My producer.
[02:19:58.520 --> 02:19:59.520]   And I was like venting.
[02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:03.040]   It's like a producer I was really close to and I've known him for a long time.
[02:20:03.040 --> 02:20:04.040]   He's really smart.
[02:20:04.040 --> 02:20:08.120]   And he's like, he was someone I could like be honest with and I was like, "Ah!"
[02:20:08.120 --> 02:20:09.560]   And by the way, it's so funny.
[02:20:09.560 --> 02:20:13.920]   I mean, now I'm doing What Was Me, which I will keep to a minimum, but it's like stealing
[02:20:13.920 --> 02:20:16.120]   someone's text.
[02:20:16.120 --> 02:20:18.520]   And by the way, I was an idiot.
[02:20:18.520 --> 02:20:20.040]   I should have said, "Come and arrest me.
[02:20:20.040 --> 02:20:23.120]   I'm not giving you my freaking text messages, okay?"
[02:20:23.120 --> 02:20:26.080]   But I got bullied into it by a lawyer.
[02:20:26.080 --> 02:20:27.080]   I didn't get bullied into it.
[02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:29.040]   I was weak enough to agree with a lawyer.
[02:20:29.040 --> 02:20:31.040]   It was my fault.
[02:20:31.040 --> 02:20:32.040]   Never should have done that.
[02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:33.040]   Fuck you.
[02:20:33.040 --> 02:20:34.040]   They're my texts.
[02:20:34.040 --> 02:20:35.040]   They're total...
[02:20:35.040 --> 02:20:36.040]   I'm not even named in this case.
[02:20:36.040 --> 02:20:37.720]   That's what I should have said, but I didn't.
[02:20:37.720 --> 02:20:42.960]   I said I was mad on the air the next day, but not in language that colorful.
[02:20:42.960 --> 02:20:45.000]   But whatever, whatever.
[02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:49.120]   I try to be transparent.
[02:20:49.120 --> 02:20:54.920]   I mean, I also think, by the way, if you watch someone over time, you don't always know what
[02:20:54.920 --> 02:20:58.040]   they really think, but you can tell if someone's lying.
[02:20:58.040 --> 02:21:01.360]   You can sort of feel it in people.
[02:21:01.360 --> 02:21:02.360]   And I have lied.
[02:21:02.360 --> 02:21:03.360]   I'm sure I'll lie again.
[02:21:03.360 --> 02:21:04.360]   I don't want to lie.
[02:21:04.360 --> 02:21:05.920]   I don't think I'm a liar.
[02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:06.920]   I try not to be a liar.
[02:21:06.920 --> 02:21:08.360]   I don't want to be a liar.
[02:21:08.360 --> 02:21:12.760]   I think it's really important not to be a liar.
[02:21:12.760 --> 02:21:14.480]   You said nice things about me earlier.
[02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:15.480]   I'm starting to question.
[02:21:15.480 --> 02:21:16.480]   I have questions.
[02:21:16.480 --> 02:21:18.480]   I have a lot of questions talking about you.
[02:21:18.480 --> 02:21:19.480]   I hate Lex Friedman.
[02:21:19.480 --> 02:21:20.480]   Yeah.
[02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:23.560]   I'm going to have to see your texts after this.
[02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:25.880]   My texts are so uninteresting now.
[02:21:25.880 --> 02:21:28.280]   It's like crazy how uninteresting they are.
[02:21:28.280 --> 02:21:29.280]   Emojis and gifs.
[02:21:29.280 --> 02:21:31.000]   Yeah, lots of dog pictures.
[02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:32.000]   Nice.
[02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:36.560]   You said to some degree the election was rigged?
[02:21:36.560 --> 02:21:37.560]   Was it stolen?
[02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:38.560]   It was 100% stolen.
[02:21:38.560 --> 02:21:39.560]   Are you joking?
[02:21:39.560 --> 02:21:42.160]   Like it was rigged to that large of a degree?
[02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:47.840]   They completely change the way people vote right before the election on the basis of
[02:21:47.840 --> 02:21:49.200]   COVID, which had nothing to do with-
[02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:51.360]   So in that way, it was rigged, meaning manipulated.
[02:21:51.360 --> 02:21:52.360]   100%.
[02:21:52.360 --> 02:21:55.920]   Then you censor the information people are allowed to get.
[02:21:55.920 --> 02:22:02.840]   Anyone who complains about COVID, which is like, by the way, it might've hurt Trump.
[02:22:02.840 --> 02:22:03.840]   It's like whatever.
[02:22:03.840 --> 02:22:06.260]   I mean, you could play it many different ways.
[02:22:06.260 --> 02:22:10.200]   You can't have censorship in a democracy by definition.
[02:22:10.200 --> 02:22:11.420]   Here's how it works.
[02:22:11.420 --> 02:22:12.420]   The people rule.
[02:22:12.420 --> 02:22:17.240]   They vote for representatives to carry their agenda to the capital city and get it enacted.
[02:22:17.240 --> 02:22:18.240]   That's how they're in charge.
[02:22:18.240 --> 02:22:23.080]   Then every few years, they get to reassess the performance of those people in an election.
[02:22:23.080 --> 02:22:31.400]   In order to do that, they need unfettered access to information.
[02:22:31.400 --> 02:22:36.160]   No one, particularly not people who are already in power, is allowed to tell them what information
[02:22:36.160 --> 02:22:37.160]   they can have.
[02:22:37.160 --> 02:22:39.600]   They have to have all information that they want.
[02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:43.840]   Whether the people in charge want it or don't want it or think it's true or think it's false,
[02:22:43.840 --> 02:22:45.440]   it doesn't matter.
[02:22:45.440 --> 02:22:47.720]   The second you don't have that, you don't have a democracy.
[02:22:47.720 --> 02:22:50.360]   It's not a free election, period.
[02:22:50.360 --> 02:22:54.640]   That's very clear in other countries, I guess, but it's not clear here.
[02:22:54.640 --> 02:23:01.080]   But I would say it's this election that ... I mean, it took me a while to come to this,
[02:23:01.080 --> 02:23:04.520]   but it's this election that's the referendum on democracy.
[02:23:04.520 --> 02:23:06.280]   Biden is senile.
[02:23:06.280 --> 02:23:07.400]   He's literally senile.
[02:23:07.400 --> 02:23:08.400]   He can't talk.
[02:23:08.400 --> 02:23:09.640]   He can't walk.
[02:23:09.640 --> 02:23:10.760]   The whole world knows that.
[02:23:10.760 --> 02:23:11.760]   Leave our borders.
[02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:15.840]   People are ... Everybody in the world knows it.
[02:23:15.840 --> 02:23:23.600]   He can't ... A senile man is not going to get elected in the most powerful country in
[02:23:23.600 --> 02:23:28.160]   the world unless there's fraud, period.
[02:23:28.160 --> 02:23:30.160]   Who would vote for a senile man?
[02:23:30.160 --> 02:23:31.840]   He literally can't talk.
[02:23:31.840 --> 02:23:37.040]   Nobody I've ever met thinks he's running the US government because he's not.
[02:23:37.040 --> 02:23:41.280]   I think the world is looking on at this coming election and saying ... And a lot of the world
[02:23:41.280 --> 02:23:42.280]   hates Trump.
[02:23:42.280 --> 02:23:43.280]   Okay?
[02:23:43.280 --> 02:23:44.280]   It's not an endorsement of Trump.
[02:23:44.280 --> 02:23:45.280]   But it's just true.
[02:23:45.280 --> 02:23:51.380]   If Joe Biden gets reelected, democracy is a freaking joke.
[02:23:51.380 --> 02:23:52.380]   It's just true.
[02:23:52.380 --> 02:23:58.320]   I think half the country doesn't think he's senile, just thinks he's speaking-
[02:23:58.320 --> 02:23:59.320]   Do you really think that?
[02:23:59.320 --> 02:24:00.320]   They don't think he's senile?
[02:24:00.320 --> 02:24:01.320]   Yeah.
[02:24:01.320 --> 02:24:05.680]   I think he just has difficulty speaking.
[02:24:05.680 --> 02:24:10.880]   It's like gradual degradation, just getting old.
[02:24:10.880 --> 02:24:12.760]   So cognitive ability is degrading.
[02:24:12.760 --> 02:24:16.160]   What's the difference between degraded cognitive ability and senility?
[02:24:16.160 --> 02:24:20.180]   Well, senility has a threshold.
[02:24:20.180 --> 02:24:23.200]   It's beyond the threshold to where he could be a functioning leader.
[02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:24.200]   Okay.
[02:24:24.200 --> 02:24:25.600]   That may be a term of art that I don't fully understand.
[02:24:25.600 --> 02:24:30.560]   Maybe there's an IQ threshold or something, but I'm happy to go with degraded cognitive
[02:24:30.560 --> 02:24:31.560]   ability.
[02:24:31.560 --> 02:24:32.560]   Sure.
[02:24:32.560 --> 02:24:33.920]   But that's an age thing.
[02:24:33.920 --> 02:24:37.520]   But he's the leader of the United States with the world's second largest nuclear arsenal.
[02:24:37.520 --> 02:24:38.520]   I'm with you.
[02:24:38.520 --> 02:24:45.320]   I'm a sucker for great speeches and for speaking abilities of leaders and Biden with two wars
[02:24:45.320 --> 02:24:47.760]   going on and potentially more.
[02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:52.800]   The importance of a leader to speak eloquently, both privately in a room with other leaders
[02:24:52.800 --> 02:24:54.480]   and publicly is really important.
[02:24:54.480 --> 02:24:58.860]   I agree with you that rhetorical ability really matters, convincing people that your program
[02:24:58.860 --> 02:25:04.120]   is right, telling them what we're for, national identity, national unity all come from words.
[02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:06.080]   I agree with all of that.
[02:25:06.080 --> 02:25:10.560]   But at this stage, even someone who grunted at the microphone would be more reassuring
[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:14.480]   than a guy who clearly doesn't know where he is.
[02:25:14.480 --> 02:25:16.240]   I think everyone knows that.
[02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:19.680]   I can't imagine there's an honest person in Washington, which is going to vote for Biden
[02:25:19.680 --> 02:25:24.040]   by 90% obviously, because they're all dependent on the federal government for their income.
[02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:29.740]   But is there any person who could say out of 350 million Americans, that's the most
[02:25:29.740 --> 02:25:30.740]   qualified to lead?
[02:25:30.740 --> 02:25:34.140]   Or even in the top 80%, what?
[02:25:34.140 --> 02:25:40.980]   That's so embarrassing that that guy is our president and with wars going on, it's scary.
[02:25:40.980 --> 02:25:45.980]   But it's complicated to understand why those are the choices we have.
[02:25:45.980 --> 02:25:46.980]   I agree.
[02:25:46.980 --> 02:25:48.740]   Well, it's a failure of the system.
[02:25:48.740 --> 02:25:49.740]   Clearly it's not working.
[02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:56.480]   One guy over 80, the other guy almost at 80, people that should not be running any.
[02:25:56.480 --> 02:26:01.760]   So you have on the Democratic side, you have Dean Phillips, you have RK Jr. until recently,
[02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:03.440]   I guess he's independent.
[02:26:03.440 --> 02:26:07.240]   And then you have Vivek, who are all younger people.
[02:26:07.240 --> 02:26:11.040]   Why did they not connect to a degree to where-
[02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:15.860]   It's such an interesting, I mean, I think it's a really interesting, there are a million
[02:26:15.860 --> 02:26:20.720]   different answers, and of course I don't fully understand it, even though I feel like I've
[02:26:20.720 --> 02:26:22.180]   watched it pretty carefully.
[02:26:22.180 --> 02:26:31.540]   But I would say the bottom line is there's so much money vested in the federal apparatus,
[02:26:31.540 --> 02:26:33.860]   in the parties, in the government.
[02:26:33.860 --> 02:26:39.000]   As I said a minute ago, our economy is dominated by monopolies, but the greatest of all monopolies
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:43.660]   is the federal monopoly, which oversees and controls all the other monopolies.
[02:26:43.660 --> 02:26:47.220]   So it's really substantially about the money.
[02:26:47.220 --> 02:26:49.260]   It's not ideological, it's about the money.
[02:26:49.260 --> 02:26:53.880]   And if someone controls the federal government, I mean, at this point, it's the most powerful
[02:26:53.880 --> 02:26:55.480]   organization in human history.
[02:26:55.480 --> 02:26:59.060]   It's kind of hard to fight that.
[02:26:59.060 --> 02:27:02.380]   In the case of Trump, I know the answer there.
[02:27:02.380 --> 02:27:03.380]   They raided Mar-a-Lago.
[02:27:03.380 --> 02:27:06.220]   They indicted him on bullshit charges.
[02:27:06.220 --> 02:27:07.920]   And I felt that in myself too.
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:10.420]   Even I was like, "Come on, come on."
[02:27:10.420 --> 02:27:14.140]   Whenever you think of Trump, and I agreed with his immigration views, I really liked
[02:27:14.140 --> 02:27:15.140]   Trump personally.
[02:27:15.140 --> 02:27:19.220]   I think he's hilarious and interesting, which he is.
[02:27:19.220 --> 02:27:21.780]   But it's like, okay, there are a lot of people in this country.
[02:27:21.780 --> 02:27:25.820]   Let's get some, at very least, let's have a real debate.
[02:27:25.820 --> 02:27:26.820]   The second...
[02:27:26.820 --> 02:27:29.660]   Messed up your cameras there, sorry, I'm getting excited.
[02:27:29.660 --> 02:27:36.700]   But the second they raided Mar-a-Lago on a documents charge, as someone from DC, I was
[02:27:36.700 --> 02:27:41.580]   like, "I know a lot about classification and all this stuff and been around it a lot."
[02:27:41.580 --> 02:27:45.940]   That's so absurd that I was like, "Now it's not about Trump.
[02:27:45.940 --> 02:27:47.900]   It's about our system continuing."
[02:27:47.900 --> 02:27:52.980]   If you can take out a presidential candidate on a fake charge, use the justice system to
[02:27:52.980 --> 02:27:58.080]   take the guy out of the race, then we don't have a representative democracy anymore.
[02:27:58.080 --> 02:28:01.900]   And I think a lot of Republican voters felt that way.
[02:28:01.900 --> 02:28:04.700]   If they hadn't indicted him, I'm not sure he would be the nominee.
[02:28:04.700 --> 02:28:05.820]   I really don't think he would be.
[02:28:05.820 --> 02:28:09.900]   So now a vote for Trump is a kind of fuck you to the system.
[02:28:09.900 --> 02:28:14.940]   Or an expression of your desire to keep the system that we had, which is one where voters
[02:28:14.940 --> 02:28:15.940]   get to decide.
[02:28:15.940 --> 02:28:16.940]   Prosecutors don't get to decide.
[02:28:16.940 --> 02:28:22.500]   Look, they told us for four years that Trump was a super criminal or something.
[02:28:22.500 --> 02:28:24.300]   I've actually been friends with some super criminals.
[02:28:24.300 --> 02:28:25.860]   I'm a little less judgy than most.
[02:28:25.860 --> 02:28:30.620]   So I didn't discount the possibility that he had, I don't know, he's in the real estate
[02:28:30.620 --> 02:28:32.740]   business in New York in the '70s.
[02:28:32.740 --> 02:28:33.740]   Did he kill someone?
[02:28:33.740 --> 02:28:34.740]   I don't know.
[02:28:34.740 --> 02:28:35.740]   Yeah.
[02:28:35.740 --> 02:28:36.740]   I'm not joking.
[02:28:36.740 --> 02:28:37.740]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:28:37.740 --> 02:28:39.300]   And I'm not for killing people, but anything's possible.
[02:28:39.300 --> 02:28:41.300]   It's good that you took a stand on that.
[02:28:41.300 --> 02:28:42.300]   Yeah.
[02:28:42.300 --> 02:28:43.300]   No, I'm not joking.
[02:28:43.300 --> 02:28:44.300]   Yeah.
[02:28:44.300 --> 02:28:45.300]   I was like, "Well, who knows?"
[02:28:45.300 --> 02:28:46.300]   You know?
[02:28:46.300 --> 02:28:47.300]   Real estate.
[02:28:47.300 --> 02:28:48.300]   And I didn't know.
[02:28:48.300 --> 02:28:49.580]   And what they came up with was a documents charge?
[02:28:49.580 --> 02:28:50.580]   Are you joking?
[02:28:50.580 --> 02:28:54.260]   And then the sitting president has the same documents violation, but he's fine.
[02:28:54.260 --> 02:28:57.460]   It's like, it's crazy this is happening in front of all of us.
[02:28:57.460 --> 02:29:02.500]   And then it becomes like, at that point, it's not about Joe Biden, it's not about Donald
[02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:03.500]   Trump.
[02:29:03.500 --> 02:29:08.060]   It's about preserving a system which has worked, not perfectly, but pretty freaking well for
[02:29:08.060 --> 02:29:09.060]   250 years.
[02:29:09.060 --> 02:29:11.420]   I know you don't like Trump, I get it.
[02:29:11.420 --> 02:29:12.980]   Let's not destroy that system.
[02:29:12.980 --> 02:29:14.720]   We can handle another four years of Trump.
[02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:15.720]   I think we can.
[02:29:15.720 --> 02:29:16.820]   So calm down.
[02:29:16.820 --> 02:29:23.260]   What we can't handle is a country whose political system is run by the Justice Department.
[02:29:23.260 --> 02:29:27.780]   That is just, you're freaking Ecuador at that point.
[02:29:27.780 --> 02:29:28.780]   No.
[02:29:28.780 --> 02:29:34.940]   So speaking of the Justice Department, CIA and intelligence agencies of that nature,
[02:29:34.940 --> 02:29:39.780]   which you've been traveling quite a bit, probably tracked by everybody.
[02:29:39.780 --> 02:29:44.180]   Which is the most powerful intelligence agency, do you think?
[02:29:44.180 --> 02:29:55.220]   CIA, Mossad, MI6, SVR, keep going.
[02:29:55.220 --> 02:29:56.820]   The Chinese.
[02:29:56.820 --> 02:30:00.720]   It depends what you mean by powerful.
[02:30:00.720 --> 02:30:04.540]   Which one bats above its weight, we know.
[02:30:04.540 --> 02:30:05.540]   Which one is-
[02:30:05.540 --> 02:30:08.260]   Mossad, just to be clear, I guess, is what you're talking about.
[02:30:08.260 --> 02:30:09.260]   Well, of course.
[02:30:09.260 --> 02:30:12.280]   Tiny country, very sophisticated intel service.
[02:30:12.280 --> 02:30:16.460]   Which one has the greatest global reach in comms?
[02:30:16.460 --> 02:30:18.460]   Which one is most able to read your texts?
[02:30:18.460 --> 02:30:20.300]   I assume the NSA.
[02:30:20.300 --> 02:30:22.340]   But Chinese, clearly pretty good.
[02:30:22.340 --> 02:30:24.860]   Israel is pretty good.
[02:30:24.860 --> 02:30:29.220]   The French actually are surprisingly good for kind of a declining country.
[02:30:29.220 --> 02:30:30.740]   Their intel services seem pretty impressive.
[02:30:30.740 --> 02:30:34.260]   No, I love France, but you know what I mean?
[02:30:34.260 --> 02:30:35.260]   And all that.
[02:30:35.260 --> 02:30:38.380]   So, but the question, I mean, I grew up around all that stuff.
[02:30:38.380 --> 02:30:39.700]   That's all totally fine.
[02:30:39.700 --> 02:30:44.260]   Like a strong country should have a strong and capable intel service so its policy makers
[02:30:44.260 --> 02:30:45.260]   can make informed decisions.
[02:30:45.260 --> 02:30:46.660]   Like that's what they're for.
[02:30:46.660 --> 02:30:50.820]   So as Vladimir Putin himself noted, and I don't talk about it very much, but it's true.
[02:30:50.820 --> 02:30:55.340]   I applied to the CIA when I was in college because, you know, I was familiar with it
[02:30:55.340 --> 02:30:58.140]   because of where I lived and had grown up and everything.
[02:30:58.140 --> 02:30:59.980]   And I was like, seemed interesting.
[02:30:59.980 --> 02:31:03.880]   That's honestly the only reason I was like, live in foreign countries, see history happen.
[02:31:03.880 --> 02:31:04.880]   Like I'm for that.
[02:31:04.880 --> 02:31:06.580]   I applied to the operations directorate.
[02:31:06.580 --> 02:31:10.900]   They turned me down on the basis of drug use actually.
[02:31:10.900 --> 02:31:12.220]   True.
[02:31:12.220 --> 02:31:13.220]   But anyway, whatever.
[02:31:13.220 --> 02:31:14.340]   I was unsuited for it.
[02:31:14.340 --> 02:31:15.620]   So I'm glad they turned me down.
[02:31:15.620 --> 02:31:20.940]   But the point is I didn't see CIA as a threat partly because I was bathing in propaganda
[02:31:20.940 --> 02:31:24.200]   about CIA and I didn't really understand what it was and didn't want to know.
[02:31:24.200 --> 02:31:27.940]   But second, because my impression at the time was it was outwardly focused.
[02:31:27.940 --> 02:31:31.020]   It was focused on our enemies.
[02:31:31.020 --> 02:31:34.060]   I don't have a problem with that as much.
[02:31:34.060 --> 02:31:38.540]   The fact that CIA is playing in domestic politics and actually has for a long time was involved
[02:31:38.540 --> 02:31:39.780]   in the Kennedy assassination.
[02:31:39.780 --> 02:31:41.300]   That's not speculation.
[02:31:41.300 --> 02:31:43.260]   That's a fact.
[02:31:43.260 --> 02:31:47.500]   And I confirmed that for someone who had read their documents that are still not public.
[02:31:47.500 --> 02:31:48.820]   It's shocking.
[02:31:48.820 --> 02:31:50.220]   You can't have that.
[02:31:50.220 --> 02:31:55.220]   And the reason I'm so mad is I really believe in the idea of representative government acknowledging
[02:31:55.220 --> 02:31:56.220]   its imperfections.
[02:31:56.220 --> 02:32:01.700]   But I should have some say, I live here, I'm a citizen, I pay all your freaking taxes.
[02:32:01.700 --> 02:32:09.760]   So the fact that they would be tampering with American democracy is so outrageous to me.
[02:32:09.760 --> 02:32:12.640]   And I don't know why Morning Joe is not outraged.
[02:32:12.640 --> 02:32:18.000]   This parade of dummies, highly credentialed dummies they have on Morning Joe every day,
[02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:19.000]   they don't seem to...
[02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:20.000]   That doesn't bother them at all.
[02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:21.460]   How could that not bother you?
[02:32:21.460 --> 02:32:24.620]   Why is only Glenn Greenwald mad about it?
[02:32:24.620 --> 02:32:25.620]   It's confirmed.
[02:32:25.620 --> 02:32:27.260]   It's not like a fever dream.
[02:32:27.260 --> 02:32:28.260]   It's real.
[02:32:28.260 --> 02:32:31.460]   They played in the last election domestically.
[02:32:31.460 --> 02:32:37.080]   And I guess it shows how dumb I am because they've been doing that for many years.
[02:32:37.080 --> 02:32:42.260]   The guy who took out Mossadegh lived on my street, one of the Roosevelt CIA officer.
[02:32:42.260 --> 02:32:50.360]   So again, I grew up around this stuff, but I never really thought, I never reached the
[02:32:50.360 --> 02:32:57.180]   obvious conclusion, which is that if the US government subverts democracy in other countries
[02:32:57.180 --> 02:33:01.700]   in the name of democracy, it will over time subvert democracy in my country.
[02:33:01.700 --> 02:33:04.380]   Why wouldn't it?
[02:33:04.380 --> 02:33:07.900]   The corruption is like core, it's at the root of it.
[02:33:07.900 --> 02:33:12.220]   The purpose of the CIA was envisioned, at least publicly envisioned, as an intel gathering
[02:33:12.220 --> 02:33:15.460]   apparatus for the executive so the president could make wise foreign policy decisions.
[02:33:15.460 --> 02:33:17.060]   What the hell is happening in country X?
[02:33:17.060 --> 02:33:18.220]   I don't know.
[02:33:18.220 --> 02:33:20.820]   Let me call the agency in charge of finding out.
[02:33:20.820 --> 02:33:27.820]   The point wasn't to freaking guarantee the outcome of elections.
[02:33:27.820 --> 02:33:33.660]   I'm doing an Israel-Palestine debate next week, but I have to ask you just your thoughts,
[02:33:33.660 --> 02:33:38.040]   maybe even from a US perspective, what do you think about Hamas attacks on Israel?
[02:33:38.040 --> 02:33:43.260]   What would be the right thing for Israel to do and what's the right thing for US to do
[02:33:43.260 --> 02:33:44.260]   in this?
[02:33:44.260 --> 02:33:47.300]   If you're looking at the geopolitics of it.
[02:33:47.300 --> 02:33:54.460]   It's not a topic that I get into a lot because I'm a non-expert.
[02:33:54.460 --> 02:34:00.480]   Because I'm not, unlike every other American, I'm not emotionally invested in other countries
[02:34:00.480 --> 02:34:01.480]   just in general.
[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:04.720]   I mean, I admire them or not, and I love visiting them.
[02:34:04.720 --> 02:34:10.080]   I love Jerusalem, probably my favorite city in the world, but I don't have an emotional
[02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:12.120]   attachment to it.
[02:34:12.120 --> 02:34:13.120]   Maybe I've got more clarity.
[02:34:13.120 --> 02:34:14.120]   I don't know.
[02:34:14.120 --> 02:34:15.120]   Maybe less.
[02:34:15.120 --> 02:34:16.120]   Here's my view.
[02:34:16.120 --> 02:34:18.160]   I believe in sovereignty, as mentioned.
[02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:23.360]   I think each country has to make decisions based on its own interest, but also with reference
[02:34:23.360 --> 02:34:27.080]   to its own capabilities and its own long-term interest.
[02:34:27.080 --> 02:34:31.880]   That's very unwise for ... I'm not a huge fan of treaties.
[02:34:31.880 --> 02:34:32.880]   Some are fine.
[02:34:32.880 --> 02:34:34.360]   Too many, bad.
[02:34:34.360 --> 02:34:40.880]   But I think US military aid to Israel and the implied security guarantees, some explicit,
[02:34:40.880 --> 02:34:44.760]   but many implied security guarantees of the United States to Israel probably haven't helped
[02:34:44.760 --> 02:34:47.680]   Israel that much long-term.
[02:34:47.680 --> 02:34:50.480]   It's a rich country with a highly capable population.
[02:34:50.480 --> 02:34:53.800]   Like every other country, it's probably best if it makes its decisions based on what it
[02:34:53.800 --> 02:34:58.080]   can do by itself.
[02:34:58.080 --> 02:35:04.360]   So I would definitely be concerned if I lived in Israel, because I think fair or unfair,
[02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:08.760]   and really this is another product of technology, social media, public sentiment in that area
[02:35:08.760 --> 02:35:10.720]   is boiling over.
[02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:14.960]   I think it's going to be hard for some of the governments in the region, Jordan, Egypt,
[02:35:14.960 --> 02:35:16.800]   Turkey, to contain their own population.
[02:35:16.800 --> 02:35:18.840]   They don't want conflict with Israel at all.
[02:35:18.840 --> 02:35:23.600]   They were all pretty psyched actually for the trend in progress, the Saudi peace deal,
[02:35:23.600 --> 02:35:28.800]   which was never signed, but it would have been great for everybody because trade, peace,
[02:35:28.800 --> 02:35:30.920]   normal relations, that's good, okay?
[02:35:30.920 --> 02:35:31.920]   Let's just say.
[02:35:31.920 --> 02:35:36.200]   I know John Bolton doesn't like it, but it's good.
[02:35:36.200 --> 02:35:43.520]   It's kind of what we should be looking for, but now it's not possible.
[02:35:43.520 --> 02:35:48.040]   If you had a coalition of countries against Israel, I know Israel has nuclear weapons
[02:35:48.040 --> 02:35:53.120]   and is a capable military and all that in the backing of the United States, but it's
[02:35:53.120 --> 02:35:54.120]   a small country.
[02:35:54.120 --> 02:35:57.640]   I'd be very worried.
[02:35:57.640 --> 02:36:05.000]   So there's that, and I don't see any advantage to the United States.
[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:09.800]   I think it's important for each country to make its own decisions.
[02:36:09.800 --> 02:36:15.760]   But it also is a place, like you said, where things are boiling over and it could spread
[02:36:15.760 --> 02:36:18.440]   across multiple nations into a major military conflict.
[02:36:18.440 --> 02:36:19.440]   Yeah.
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:20.440]   Well, I think very easily could happen.
[02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:26.000]   In fact, probably right after Ramadan, if I had to guess, and I pray it doesn't.
[02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:33.480]   But again, I don't think you can overstate the lack of wisdom, weakness, short-term thinking
[02:36:33.480 --> 02:36:36.600]   of American foreign policy leadership.
[02:36:36.600 --> 02:36:42.360]   These are the architects of the Iraq War, of the totally pointless destruction of Libya,
[02:36:42.360 --> 02:36:46.640]   totally pointless destruction of Syria, and the 20-year occupation of Afghanistan that
[02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:48.320]   resulted in a return to the status quo.
[02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:55.800]   So like of the Vietnam War, their track record of the Korean War even going back 80 years
[02:36:55.800 --> 02:36:59.880]   is uninterrupted failures, one after the other.
[02:36:59.880 --> 02:37:05.600]   So I just don't have any confidence in those leaders to improve.
[02:37:05.600 --> 02:37:08.880]   When was the last time they improved another country?
[02:37:08.880 --> 02:37:09.880]   Can you think of that?
[02:37:09.880 --> 02:37:10.880]   Oh, the Marshall Plan.
[02:37:10.880 --> 02:37:16.400]   Well, you look at Europe now and you're like, "I don't know if that worked."
[02:37:16.400 --> 02:37:21.480]   But even if it did work, again, 80 years ago, so when was the last country American foreign
[02:37:21.480 --> 02:37:23.720]   policy makers improved?
[02:37:23.720 --> 02:37:32.000]   So Netanyahu's in a very difficult place politically, impossible, I mean, I'm glad I'm not Netanyahu.
[02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:36.180]   And I'm not sure he's capable of making wise long-term decisions anyway.
[02:37:36.180 --> 02:37:42.160]   But if I was just like an Israeli, I'd be like, "I don't know if I want like all this
[02:37:42.160 --> 02:37:46.020]   help and guidance."
[02:37:46.020 --> 02:37:48.960]   So yeah, I actually think it's worse than just having just returned from the Middle
[02:37:48.960 --> 02:37:56.580]   East and talking to a lot of pretty open-minded sort of pro-Israeli Arabs who want stability
[02:37:56.580 --> 02:37:57.760]   above all.
[02:37:57.760 --> 02:38:00.360]   The merchant class always wants stability.
[02:38:00.360 --> 02:38:01.660]   So I'm on their side, I guess.
[02:38:01.660 --> 02:38:07.080]   And they're like, "Man, this could get super ugly, super fast.
[02:38:07.080 --> 02:38:09.320]   American leadership is just completely absent.
[02:38:09.320 --> 02:38:10.320]   It's just all posturing.
[02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:12.240]   It's like people like Nikki Haley."
[02:38:12.240 --> 02:38:17.600]   You just wonder, how does an advanced civilization promote someone like Nikki Haley to a position
[02:38:17.600 --> 02:38:18.600]   of authority?
[02:38:18.600 --> 02:38:19.600]   It's like, "What?
[02:38:19.600 --> 02:38:25.480]   Shh, adults are talking, adults are talking, Nikki Haley, please go away."
[02:38:25.480 --> 02:38:28.680]   That would be the appropriate response, but everyone's so intimidated to be like, "Oh,
[02:38:28.680 --> 02:38:30.000]   she's a strong woman.
[02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:35.820]   She's so transparently weak and sort of ridiculous and doesn't know anything and is just thinks
[02:38:35.820 --> 02:38:39.740]   that jumping up and down and making these absurd blanket statements, repeating bumper
[02:38:39.740 --> 02:38:43.300]   stickers is like leadership or something."
[02:38:43.300 --> 02:38:49.700]   A self-confident advanced society would never allow Nikki Haley to advance.
[02:38:49.700 --> 02:38:52.260]   I mean, she's really not impressive.
[02:38:52.260 --> 02:38:53.260]   Sorry.
[02:38:53.260 --> 02:38:58.140]   I just feel like you hold back too much and don't tell us what you really think.
[02:38:58.140 --> 02:38:59.140]   Sorry.
[02:38:59.140 --> 02:39:00.140]   Sorry.
[02:39:00.140 --> 02:39:01.140]   I think you just speak your mind more often.
[02:39:01.140 --> 02:39:02.140]   Well, by the way, these are not...
[02:39:02.140 --> 02:39:06.620]   I mean, you can completely disagree with my opinions, but in the case of Nikki Haley,
[02:39:06.620 --> 02:39:10.140]   it's not like an opinion formed just from watching television, which I don't watch.
[02:39:10.140 --> 02:39:14.320]   It's an opinion formed from knowing Nikki Haley.
[02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:15.320]   Strong words from Tucker.
[02:39:15.320 --> 02:39:16.320]   Well, felt too.
[02:39:16.320 --> 02:39:17.320]   Well, the world's in the balance.
[02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:18.320]   I mean, it's not just like-
[02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:19.320]   Yes.
[02:39:19.320 --> 02:39:20.320]   Yes.
[02:39:20.320 --> 02:39:21.320]   This is important stuff.
[02:39:21.320 --> 02:39:22.320]   Yeah.
[02:39:22.320 --> 02:39:25.860]   It's not just like, "Well, what should the capital gains rate be?"
[02:39:25.860 --> 02:39:27.740]   It's like, "Do we live or die?"
[02:39:27.740 --> 02:39:28.740]   I don't know.
[02:39:28.740 --> 02:39:31.180]   I don't know about Nikki Haley.
[02:39:31.180 --> 02:39:34.460]   If you're asking, "Should we live or die?" and consulting Nikki Haley, clearly you don't
[02:39:34.460 --> 02:39:35.860]   care about the lives of your children.
[02:39:35.860 --> 02:39:37.420]   That's how I feel.
[02:39:37.420 --> 02:39:44.620]   Not to try to get a preview or anything, but do you have interest of interviewing Xi Jinping?
[02:39:44.620 --> 02:39:47.660]   And if you do, how will you approach that?
[02:39:47.660 --> 02:39:52.580]   I have enormous interest in doing that, enormous, and a couple other people are more working
[02:39:52.580 --> 02:39:53.580]   on it.
[02:39:53.580 --> 02:39:59.180]   I should also say, it's been refreshing, you interviewing world leaders.
[02:39:59.180 --> 02:40:05.460]   I think when I've started seeing you do that, it made me realize how much that's lacking.
[02:40:05.460 --> 02:40:06.460]   Well, yeah.
[02:40:06.460 --> 02:40:07.460]   It's just interesting.
[02:40:07.460 --> 02:40:10.940]   I mean, from even a historical perspective, it's interesting, but it's also important
[02:40:10.940 --> 02:40:12.700]   from a geopolitics perspective.
[02:40:12.700 --> 02:40:16.900]   Well, it's really changed my perspective, and I've been going on about how American
[02:40:16.900 --> 02:40:18.780]   I am, and I think that's a great thing.
[02:40:18.780 --> 02:40:20.300]   I love America.
[02:40:20.300 --> 02:40:25.500]   But it's also, we're so physically, geographically isolated from the world, even though I traveled
[02:40:25.500 --> 02:40:29.460]   a ton as a kid, a lot, more than most people.
[02:40:29.460 --> 02:40:34.020]   But even now, I'm like, I'm so parochial.
[02:40:34.020 --> 02:40:38.900]   I see everything through this lens, and getting out and seeing the rest of the world to which
[02:40:38.900 --> 02:40:43.500]   we really are connected, that's real, is vitally important.
[02:40:43.500 --> 02:40:51.660]   So yeah, I mean, at this stage, I don't need to do it, but I really want to, just motivated
[02:40:51.660 --> 02:40:57.380]   by curiosity and trying to expand my own mind and not be closed-minded and really see the
[02:40:57.380 --> 02:41:02.140]   fullest perspective I possibly can in order to render wise judgments.
[02:41:02.140 --> 02:41:05.740]   I mean, that's like the whole journey of life.
[02:41:05.740 --> 02:41:12.060]   I was just hanging out with Rogan yesterday, Joe Rogan, and I mentioned to him that it's
[02:41:12.060 --> 02:41:18.660]   me being a fan of his show, that I would love for him to talk with you, and he said he's
[02:41:18.660 --> 02:41:19.660]   up for it.
[02:41:19.660 --> 02:41:22.020]   Any reason you guys haven't done it already?
[02:41:22.020 --> 02:41:23.020]   - I don't know.
[02:41:23.020 --> 02:41:26.820]   I would, there's no, I've only met Rogan once, and I liked him.
[02:41:26.820 --> 02:41:30.740]   I met him at the UFC in New York.
[02:41:30.740 --> 02:41:38.100]   He was with somebody, a mutual friend of ours, and Rogan changed media, I mean, maybe more
[02:41:38.100 --> 02:41:39.100]   than anybody.
[02:41:39.140 --> 02:41:43.420]   And he did it, what I love about, what I admire about Rogan without knowing him beyond meeting
[02:41:43.420 --> 02:41:44.420]   him that one time.
[02:41:44.420 --> 02:41:48.880]   I mean, I'm still in media, but I've always been in media.
[02:41:48.880 --> 02:41:50.860]   You know, it's like not a great surprise.
[02:41:50.860 --> 02:41:53.200]   I'm doing what I've always done, just a different format.
[02:41:53.200 --> 02:41:57.900]   But Rogan, like, he's got one of those resumes that I admire.
[02:41:57.900 --> 02:42:00.780]   You know, I like the guy who was like, "I was a longshoreman, I was a short order cook,
[02:42:00.780 --> 02:42:04.180]   I was an astrophysicist, I was," you know what I mean, it's like, he's called a man
[02:42:04.180 --> 02:42:05.860]   of parts.
[02:42:05.860 --> 02:42:11.140]   This guy was a fighter, a stand-up comic, he hosted some, you know, Fear Factor, like,
[02:42:11.140 --> 02:42:18.460]   how did he wind up at the vanguard of like the deepest conversations in the country?
[02:42:18.460 --> 02:42:19.460]   Like how did that happen?
[02:42:19.460 --> 02:42:23.300]   So I definitely respect that, and I think it's cool.
[02:42:23.300 --> 02:42:27.860]   And Rogan is one of those people who just kind of came out of nowhere, like no one helped
[02:42:27.860 --> 02:42:29.540]   him.
[02:42:29.540 --> 02:42:30.540]   You know what I mean?
[02:42:30.540 --> 02:42:36.060]   He was doing the thing that he loves doing, and it somehow keeps accidentally being exceptionally
[02:42:36.060 --> 02:42:37.060]   successful.
[02:42:37.060 --> 02:42:38.060]   Yeah, and he's curious.
[02:42:38.060 --> 02:42:42.900]   So that's like the main thing, and there was a guy, without getting boring, but there was
[02:42:42.900 --> 02:42:47.360]   a guy I worked with years ago, who like kind of dominated cable news, Larry King.
[02:42:47.360 --> 02:42:50.240]   And everyone would always beat up on Larry King for being dumb, while I got to know Larry
[02:42:50.240 --> 02:42:53.980]   King well, and I was his fill-in host for a while, and Larry King was just intensely
[02:42:53.980 --> 02:42:54.980]   curious.
[02:42:54.980 --> 02:42:55.980]   He'd be like, "Why do you wear a black tie, Lex?
[02:42:55.980 --> 02:42:56.980]   Because I like black tie.
[02:42:56.980 --> 02:42:57.980]   Why do you like black tie?
[02:42:57.980 --> 02:43:00.420]   No one else wears a striped tie, but you wear a black one, why?"
[02:43:00.420 --> 02:43:01.980]   And he was like really interested.
[02:43:01.980 --> 02:43:04.540]   Yeah, genuinely so, yeah.
[02:43:04.540 --> 02:43:05.540]   Totally.
[02:43:05.540 --> 02:43:06.940]   And I want to be like that.
[02:43:06.940 --> 02:43:09.540]   I don't want to think I know everything.
[02:43:09.540 --> 02:43:11.260]   That's so boorish, and also false.
[02:43:11.260 --> 02:43:12.260]   You don't know everything.
[02:43:12.260 --> 02:43:13.260]   But I see that in Rogan.
[02:43:13.260 --> 02:43:15.540]   Rogan's like, "Rah, how does that work?"
[02:43:15.540 --> 02:43:16.540]   And people will...
[02:43:16.540 --> 02:43:21.020]   And it's so funny how that's threatening to people.
[02:43:21.020 --> 02:43:25.220]   It's like Rogan will just sit there while someone else is free-balling on some far-out
[02:43:25.220 --> 02:43:29.780]   topic, which by the way, might be true, probably truer than the conventional explanation.
[02:43:29.780 --> 02:43:30.780]   People are like, "I don't know.
[02:43:30.780 --> 02:43:33.220]   How can he stand that?
[02:43:33.220 --> 02:43:37.660]   He had someone say the pyramids weren't built 3,000 years ago, but 8,000 years ago, and
[02:43:37.660 --> 02:43:38.660]   that's wrong."
[02:43:38.660 --> 02:43:41.100]   It's like, first of all, how do you know when the pyramids were built?
[02:43:41.100 --> 02:43:44.100]   Second, why do you care if someone disagrees with you?
[02:43:44.100 --> 02:43:45.100]   What is that?
[02:43:45.100 --> 02:43:51.700]   This weird kind of group think, it's almost like fourth grade, there's always some little
[02:43:51.700 --> 02:43:57.340]   girl in the front row who's acting as the teacher's enforcer, like whip around and be
[02:43:57.340 --> 02:43:58.340]   like, "Sit down.
[02:43:58.340 --> 02:43:59.820]   Don't you hear what Mrs. Johnson said?
[02:43:59.820 --> 02:44:00.820]   Sit down."
[02:44:00.820 --> 02:44:04.780]   That's like the whole American media.
[02:44:04.780 --> 02:44:06.780]   How dare you ask that question?
[02:44:06.780 --> 02:44:10.940]   And Rogan just seems like completely on his own trip, like he doesn't even hear it.
[02:44:10.940 --> 02:44:11.940]   He's like, "Well, really?
[02:44:11.940 --> 02:44:12.940]   When were the pyramids built?"
[02:44:12.940 --> 02:44:15.260]   They're just like, "Oh, I love that."
[02:44:15.260 --> 02:44:17.700]   Yeah, curiosity, open-mindedness.
[02:44:17.700 --> 02:44:22.580]   The thing I admire about him most, honestly, is that he's a good father, he's a good husband,
[02:44:22.580 --> 02:44:29.700]   he's a good family man for many years, and that's his place where he escapes from the
[02:44:29.700 --> 02:44:31.660]   world too, and it's just beautiful.
[02:44:31.660 --> 02:44:34.260]   Without that, man, you're destroyed.
[02:44:34.260 --> 02:44:39.780]   If I had a wife who was interested at all, in any way, in what I did, I think I would
[02:44:39.780 --> 02:44:41.500]   have gone crazy by now.
[02:44:41.500 --> 02:44:44.660]   When we get home, she's like, "How was your day?"
[02:44:44.660 --> 02:44:45.660]   "It was great."
[02:44:45.660 --> 02:44:46.660]   "Oh, I'm so proud of you."
[02:44:46.660 --> 02:44:50.820]   That's the end of our conversation about what I do for a living, and that is such a wonderful
[02:44:50.820 --> 02:44:54.020]   and essential respite from, you said, "How do I not become an asshole?"
[02:44:54.020 --> 02:45:01.420]   To the extent I haven't, I kind of have, but how do I have if I've not been transformed
[02:45:01.420 --> 02:45:06.860]   into a totally insufferable megalomaniac who's checking his Twitter replies every day or
[02:45:06.860 --> 02:45:07.860]   every minute?
[02:45:07.860 --> 02:45:08.860]   It's that.
[02:45:08.860 --> 02:45:13.180]   Yeah, you've got to have the core of your life has to be solid and enduring and not
[02:45:13.180 --> 02:45:15.340]   just ephemeral and silly.
[02:45:15.340 --> 02:45:17.980]   The two of you have known each other for, what, 40 years?
[02:45:17.980 --> 02:45:19.940]   We've been together 40 years.
[02:45:19.940 --> 02:45:20.940]   What's that?
[02:45:20.940 --> 02:45:21.940]   40?
[02:45:21.940 --> 02:45:22.940]   40 years, yeah.
[02:45:22.940 --> 02:45:23.940]   1984.
[02:45:23.940 --> 02:45:26.060]   He was the hottest 15-year-old in Newport, Rhode Island.
[02:45:26.060 --> 02:45:27.060]   Wow.
[02:45:27.060 --> 02:45:28.740]   Sounds dirty, but I'm talking about myself.
[02:45:28.740 --> 02:45:29.740]   I was the hottest.
[02:45:29.740 --> 02:45:30.740]   Somebody quote that.
[02:45:30.740 --> 02:45:31.740]   Yeah, you were.
[02:45:31.740 --> 02:45:32.740]   Just looking in the mirror?
[02:45:32.740 --> 02:45:33.740]   Yeah.
[02:45:33.740 --> 02:45:34.740]   Very nice.
[02:45:34.740 --> 02:45:38.060]   What's the secret to a successful relationship, successful marriage?
[02:45:38.060 --> 02:45:39.740]   I don't even know.
[02:45:39.740 --> 02:45:43.700]   I mean, no, I'm serious.
[02:45:43.700 --> 02:45:47.820]   I got married in August '91, so that's, well, it's our 33rd year of being married.
[02:45:47.820 --> 02:45:49.580]   The fall, the collapse of the ... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:45:49.580 --> 02:45:50.580]   As noted.
[02:45:50.580 --> 02:45:55.620]   Yeah, so you hear these people ... It's actually changed my theology a little bit, not that
[02:45:55.620 --> 02:46:02.340]   I have deep theology, but I grew up in a society in Southern California when I was little that
[02:46:02.340 --> 02:46:04.540]   was a totally self-created society.
[02:46:04.540 --> 02:46:09.740]   I mean, Southern California was that root of libertarianism for a reason.
[02:46:09.740 --> 02:46:14.160]   It was like that's where you went to recreate yourself, and so the operative assumption
[02:46:14.160 --> 02:46:21.740]   there is that you are the sum total of your choices, and that free will is everything.
[02:46:21.740 --> 02:46:25.780]   We never consider questions like, "Well, why do children get cancer?
[02:46:25.780 --> 02:46:26.780]   What do they do to deserve it?"
[02:46:26.780 --> 02:46:29.180]   Well, of course, nothing, right?
[02:46:29.180 --> 02:46:32.100]   Because that would suggest that maybe you're not the sum total of ... Choices matter.
[02:46:32.100 --> 02:46:34.380]   If I smoke a lot, I get lung cancer.
[02:46:34.380 --> 02:46:36.380]   If I use fentanyl, I may OD.
[02:46:36.380 --> 02:46:37.380]   Got it.
[02:46:37.380 --> 02:46:39.540]   If I don't exercise, I might get fat.
[02:46:39.540 --> 02:46:45.240]   But on a bigger scale, you're not only the sum total of your choices.
[02:46:45.240 --> 02:46:51.480]   Things happen to you that you didn't deserve, good and bad, and marriage is, and I'll speak
[02:46:51.480 --> 02:46:54.840]   for myself, in my case, just one of them, and I could say ... I mean, clearly, spending
[02:46:54.840 --> 02:47:01.660]   time with the person you're married to, talking, enjoying each other, I have a lot of rituals.
[02:47:01.660 --> 02:47:08.960]   We have a lot of rituals that ensure that, but in 40 years, you're a different person.
[02:47:08.960 --> 02:47:09.960]   I did drugs.
[02:47:09.960 --> 02:47:10.960]   I was drinking all the time.
[02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:15.880]   When we met, it's been a long time since I've done that.
[02:47:15.880 --> 02:47:19.800]   I'm very different, and so is she, but we're different in ways that are complimentary and
[02:47:19.800 --> 02:47:20.800]   happy.
[02:47:20.800 --> 02:47:21.800]   We've never been happier.
[02:47:21.800 --> 02:47:23.800]   How do we pull that off?
[02:47:23.800 --> 02:47:25.240]   Just good luck, honestly.
[02:47:25.240 --> 02:47:26.240]   And then I see other people.
[02:47:26.240 --> 02:47:28.240]   No, I'm not kidding, but that's true.
[02:47:28.240 --> 02:47:34.360]   I think it's so important not to flatter yourself if you've been successful at something.
[02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:39.680]   The thing I've been most successful at is marriage, but it's not really me.
[02:47:39.680 --> 02:47:44.520]   I mean, I haven't ... So I think what you're indirectly communicating is it's like humility,
[02:47:44.520 --> 02:47:45.520]   I think.
[02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:46.600]   It's not even humility.
[02:47:46.600 --> 02:47:49.560]   Humility is the result of a reality-based worldview.
[02:47:49.560 --> 02:47:50.560]   Sure.
[02:47:50.560 --> 02:47:51.560]   Okay?
[02:47:51.560 --> 02:47:52.560]   Right.
[02:47:52.560 --> 02:47:56.940]   Once you see things clearly, then you know that you are not the author of all your successes
[02:47:56.940 --> 02:48:05.140]   or failures, and I hate the implication otherwise, because it suggests powers that people don't
[02:48:05.140 --> 02:48:06.140]   have.
[02:48:06.140 --> 02:48:08.840]   It's one of the reasons I always hated the smoking debate or the COVID debate.
[02:48:08.840 --> 02:48:13.340]   Someone die of COVID and do none of the facts, they'd be like, "See, this is what you get.
[02:48:13.340 --> 02:48:14.340]   You smoke cigarettes, you die."
[02:48:14.340 --> 02:48:15.340]   Well, shit.
[02:48:15.340 --> 02:48:16.340]   Yeah.
[02:48:16.340 --> 02:48:17.340]   If you smoke cigarettes, you're more likely to get lung cancer.
[02:48:17.340 --> 02:48:18.340]   If you don't, if you get ... Whatever.
[02:48:18.340 --> 02:48:19.780]   The cause and effect is real.
[02:48:19.780 --> 02:48:21.020]   I'm not denying its existence.
[02:48:21.020 --> 02:48:25.420]   It's obvious, but it's not the whole story.
[02:48:25.420 --> 02:48:28.820]   There are larger forces acting on us, unseen forces.
[02:48:28.820 --> 02:48:29.820]   That's just a fact.
[02:48:29.820 --> 02:48:33.820]   You don't need to be some kind of religious nut, and they act on AI too, and you should
[02:48:33.820 --> 02:48:35.540]   keep that in mind.
[02:48:35.540 --> 02:48:36.540]   The idea that all-
[02:48:36.540 --> 02:48:38.500]   The same way you said that.
[02:48:38.500 --> 02:48:40.140]   No, it's true.
[02:48:40.140 --> 02:48:41.340]   It's demonstrably true.
[02:48:41.340 --> 02:48:45.260]   We're the only society that hasn't acknowledged the truth of that, and the idea that the only
[02:48:45.260 --> 02:48:49.580]   things that are real are the things that we can see or measure in a lab, that's insane.
[02:48:49.580 --> 02:48:51.160]   That's just dumb.
[02:48:51.160 --> 02:48:56.480]   In the religious context, you have these two categories that I really like, of the two
[02:48:56.480 --> 02:49:01.840]   kinds of people, people who believe they're God and people who know they're not, which
[02:49:01.840 --> 02:49:10.680]   is a really interesting division that speaks to humility and a kind of realist worldview
[02:49:10.680 --> 02:49:14.240]   of where we are in the world.
[02:49:14.240 --> 02:49:18.520]   Can atheists be in the latter category?
[02:49:18.520 --> 02:49:20.080]   No.
[02:49:20.080 --> 02:49:21.320]   There are very few atheists.
[02:49:21.320 --> 02:49:23.640]   I've never actually met one.
[02:49:23.640 --> 02:49:28.680]   There are people who pose as atheists, but no one's purely rational.
[02:49:28.680 --> 02:49:32.320]   This is a cliche for a reason.
[02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:36.360]   Everyone under extreme stress appeals to a power higher than himself because everyone
[02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:39.440]   knows that there is a power higher than himself.
[02:49:39.440 --> 02:49:43.200]   Really it's just people who are gripped with the delusion that they're God.
[02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:44.460]   No one actually believes that.
[02:49:44.460 --> 02:49:47.440]   If you're God, jump off the roof of your garage and see what happens.
[02:49:47.440 --> 02:49:48.440]   You know what I mean?
[02:49:48.440 --> 02:49:54.880]   No one actually thinks that, but people behave as if it's true and those people are dangerous.
[02:49:54.880 --> 02:49:59.080]   I will say by contrast, the only people I trust are the people who know their limits.
[02:49:59.080 --> 02:50:04.560]   I was thinking actually this morning in my sauna, of all the people I've interviewed
[02:50:04.560 --> 02:50:09.840]   or met, this is someone I never interviewed, but I have talked to him a couple of times,
[02:50:09.840 --> 02:50:16.480]   the greatest leader I've ever met in the world is literally a king.
[02:50:16.480 --> 02:50:20.600]   It's MBZ Sheikh Mohammed of Abu Dhabi who is Muslim.
[02:50:20.600 --> 02:50:24.640]   I am definitely not Muslim, I'm Christian, Protestant Christian.
[02:50:24.640 --> 02:50:30.840]   I don't agree with his religion and I don't agree with monarchies, but he's the best leader
[02:50:30.840 --> 02:50:34.440]   in the world that I've ever met.
[02:50:34.440 --> 02:50:37.080]   By far, it's not even close.
[02:50:37.080 --> 02:50:38.080]   Why is that?
[02:50:38.080 --> 02:50:43.320]   Well, I could bore you for an hour on the subject, but the reason that he's such a good
[02:50:43.320 --> 02:50:50.360]   leader is because he's guided by an ever-present knowledge of his limitations and of the limits
[02:50:50.360 --> 02:50:53.920]   of his power and of his foresight.
[02:50:53.920 --> 02:50:56.940]   When you start there, when you start with reality, it's not even humility.
[02:50:56.940 --> 02:51:00.900]   Humility can be a pose like, "Oh, I'm so humble, okay."
[02:51:00.900 --> 02:51:02.920]   Humble brag is a phrase for a reason.
[02:51:02.920 --> 02:51:03.920]   It's like way deeper than that.
[02:51:03.920 --> 02:51:04.920]   It's just like, "No.
[02:51:04.920 --> 02:51:05.920]   Can I...
[02:51:05.920 --> 02:51:06.920]   Do I have magical powers?
[02:51:06.920 --> 02:51:09.000]   Can I see the future?
[02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:10.000]   No.
[02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:11.000]   Okay.
[02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:12.000]   That's just a fact.
[02:51:12.360 --> 02:51:13.360]   So I'm not God."
[02:51:13.360 --> 02:51:20.280]   But I've never seen anybody more at ease with admitting that than MBZ, just a remarkable
[02:51:20.280 --> 02:51:21.280]   person.
[02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:24.200]   And for that reason, he is treated as an oracle.
[02:51:24.200 --> 02:51:30.040]   I don't think people understand the number of world leaders who traipse through his house
[02:51:30.040 --> 02:51:33.360]   or palace to seek his counsel.
[02:51:33.360 --> 02:51:40.520]   I'm not sure that there is a parallel since, I don't want to get too hyperbolic here, but
[02:51:40.520 --> 02:51:45.080]   honestly, since like Solomon, where people come from around the world to ask what he
[02:51:45.080 --> 02:51:46.080]   thinks.
[02:51:46.080 --> 02:51:49.600]   Now, why would they be doing that?
[02:51:49.600 --> 02:51:51.560]   Because Abu Dhabi's military is so powerful.
[02:51:51.560 --> 02:51:57.000]   I mean, he's rich, okay, massive oil and gas deposits, but for a lot of...
[02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:58.000]   So is Canada.
[02:51:58.000 --> 02:51:59.480]   You know what I mean?
[02:51:59.480 --> 02:52:03.360]   No one is coming to Ottawa, Ottawa, to ask Justin Trudeau what he thinks.
[02:52:03.360 --> 02:52:05.260]   No, it's humility.
[02:52:05.260 --> 02:52:07.520]   That's where wisdom comes from.
[02:52:07.520 --> 02:52:12.200]   You start to think like, I spent my whole life mad at America's leadership class, because
[02:52:12.200 --> 02:52:18.880]   it's not just Biden or the people in official positions, it's the whole constellation of
[02:52:18.880 --> 02:52:22.000]   advisors and throne sniffers around them.
[02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:27.780]   And even that I disagree with them, it's I'm not impressed by them, I'm just not impressed.
[02:52:27.780 --> 02:52:30.200]   They're not that capable, right?
[02:52:30.200 --> 02:52:32.800]   So that's what I was saying about Nikki Haley, I don't think Nikki Haley is the most evil
[02:52:32.800 --> 02:52:33.800]   person in the world.
[02:52:33.800 --> 02:52:38.440]   I think she's ridiculous, obviously, and everyone's like, "Oh, Nikki Haley or Mike Pompeo."
[02:52:38.440 --> 02:52:39.440]   What?
[02:52:39.440 --> 02:52:44.760]   Great leaders are so rare that when you see one, you know it right away.
[02:52:44.760 --> 02:52:45.760]   It blows your mind.
[02:52:45.760 --> 02:52:52.160]   And what blows my mind about Sheikh Mohammed in Abu Dhabi is that everyone in the world
[02:52:52.160 --> 02:52:53.160]   knows it.
[02:52:53.160 --> 02:52:57.000]   And I've never seen a story on this, and I'm not guessing, I know this is true because
[02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000]   I've seen it.
[02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:00.400]   Everyone in the world knows it.
[02:53:00.400 --> 02:53:05.640]   And so if there's a conflict, he's the only person that people call, like everybody calls
[02:53:05.640 --> 02:53:07.620]   the same guy.
[02:53:07.620 --> 02:53:13.480]   And it's like he runs this tiny little country, the UAE, I mean, in Abu Dhabi, there are a
[02:53:13.480 --> 02:53:16.360]   bunch of Emirates, but he's the president of the country, but still, and it's got a
[02:53:16.360 --> 02:53:21.260]   ton of energy and all that wealth and all that, Dubai's got great real estate and restaurants,
[02:53:21.260 --> 02:53:26.280]   but really it's a tiny little country that wasn't even a country 50 years ago.
[02:53:26.280 --> 02:53:28.520]   So how did that happen?
[02:53:28.520 --> 02:53:33.520]   Only on the basis of his humility and the wisdom that results from that humility.
[02:53:33.520 --> 02:53:34.760]   That's it.
[02:53:34.760 --> 02:53:37.200]   What advice would you give to young people?
[02:53:37.200 --> 02:53:41.720]   You got four, you somehow made them into great human beings.
[02:53:41.720 --> 02:53:43.640]   What advice would you give to people in high school?
[02:53:43.640 --> 02:53:44.640]   Have children immediately.
[02:53:44.640 --> 02:53:45.640]   Oh, that.
[02:53:45.640 --> 02:53:46.640]   Including in high school.
[02:53:46.640 --> 02:53:47.800]   Yes, I think that.
[02:53:47.800 --> 02:53:48.800]   That's all that matters.
[02:53:48.800 --> 02:53:54.360]   Like in the end, you know, again, these aren't even cliches anymore because no one says them.
[02:53:54.360 --> 02:53:57.080]   But when I was a kid, people would say, "On your deathbed, you never wish you spent more
[02:53:57.080 --> 02:53:59.760]   time at work."
[02:53:59.760 --> 02:54:00.760]   And I mean, everyone said that.
[02:54:00.760 --> 02:54:02.040]   It was like one of these things.
[02:54:02.040 --> 02:54:05.040]   And now, I don't think Google allows you to say that.
[02:54:05.040 --> 02:54:08.320]   It's like, "No, you're going to wish you spent more time at work, get back to your cube."
[02:54:08.320 --> 02:54:14.720]   But I can't overstate from my vantage how true that is.
[02:54:14.720 --> 02:54:20.140]   Nothing else matters but your family.
[02:54:20.140 --> 02:54:23.280]   And if you have the opportunity, and a lot of people are being denied the opportunity
[02:54:23.280 --> 02:54:28.240]   to have children, and this messing with the gender roles, and I'm not even talking about
[02:54:28.240 --> 02:54:29.240]   the tranny stuff.
[02:54:29.240 --> 02:54:37.240]   I mean, feminism has so destroyed people's brains and the ability of young people to
[02:54:37.240 --> 02:54:40.360]   connect with each other and stay together and have fruitful lives.
[02:54:40.360 --> 02:54:43.000]   It's like nothing's been more destructive than that.
[02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:44.000]   It's such a lie.
[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:45.080]   It's so dumb.
[02:54:45.080 --> 02:54:46.280]   It's counter to human nature.
[02:54:46.280 --> 02:54:47.840]   Nothing counter to human nature can endure.
[02:54:47.840 --> 02:54:50.960]   It can only cause suffering, and that's what it's done.
[02:54:50.960 --> 02:54:51.960]   But fight that.
[02:54:51.960 --> 02:54:53.320]   Stop complaining about it.
[02:54:53.320 --> 02:54:54.320]   Find someone.
[02:54:54.320 --> 02:54:59.040]   By the way, everyone gets together, most people get together on the basis in a Western society
[02:54:59.040 --> 02:55:00.280]   where there's no arranged marriages.
[02:55:00.280 --> 02:55:05.620]   They get together on the basis of sexual attraction, totally natural, get off your birth control
[02:55:05.620 --> 02:55:06.620]   and have children.
[02:55:06.620 --> 02:55:08.120]   "Oh, I can't afford that."
[02:55:08.120 --> 02:55:11.420]   Well, yeah, you'll figure out a way to afford it once you have kids.
[02:55:11.420 --> 02:55:15.000]   It's like it's chicken and the egg, but it's actually not.
[02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:18.120]   When you have responsibility, when you have no choice, this is true of men.
[02:55:18.120 --> 02:55:20.640]   I'm not sure if it's true of women, but it's definitely true of men.
[02:55:20.640 --> 02:55:23.640]   You will not achieve until you have no choice.
[02:55:23.640 --> 02:55:29.480]   As I always think of men, men do nothing until they have to, but once they have to, they
[02:55:29.480 --> 02:55:31.120]   will do anything.
[02:55:31.120 --> 02:55:32.320]   That is true.
[02:55:32.320 --> 02:55:35.240]   Men will do nothing unless they have to, but once they have to, they will do anything.
[02:55:35.240 --> 02:55:38.000]   I really believe that from watching and from being one.
[02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:42.080]   And I would never have done anything if I didn't have to, but I had to, and I would
[02:55:42.080 --> 02:55:43.080]   just recommend it.
[02:55:43.080 --> 02:55:47.300]   But by the way, even if you don't succeed, even if you're poor, having spent my life
[02:55:47.300 --> 02:55:51.920]   among rich people, I grew up among rich people, I am a rich person, boy, are they unhappy.
[02:55:51.920 --> 02:55:54.400]   Well, that's clearly not the road to happiness.
[02:55:54.400 --> 02:55:58.800]   You don't want to be a debt slave or starve to death or anything like that, but making
[02:55:58.800 --> 02:56:00.720]   a billion dollars, that's not worth doing.
[02:56:00.720 --> 02:56:01.720]   Don't do that.
[02:56:01.720 --> 02:56:03.560]   Don't even try to do that.
[02:56:03.560 --> 02:56:07.320]   If you create something that's beautiful and worth having and you make a billion dollars,
[02:56:07.320 --> 02:56:10.360]   okay, then you have to deal with your billion dollars, which will be the worst part of your
[02:56:10.360 --> 02:56:11.360]   life.
[02:56:11.360 --> 02:56:12.360]   Trust me.
[02:56:12.360 --> 02:56:15.760]   But seeking money for its own sake is a dead end.
[02:56:15.760 --> 02:56:19.140]   What you should seek for its own sake is children.
[02:56:19.140 --> 02:56:20.320]   Talk about a creative act.
[02:56:20.320 --> 02:56:24.440]   Last thing I'll say, the whole point of life is to create, okay?
[02:56:24.440 --> 02:56:31.160]   The act of creation, which is like dying in the West, in the arts and in its most pure
[02:56:31.160 --> 02:56:36.000]   expression, which is children, that's all that's worth doing while you're alive is creating
[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.800]   something beautiful and creating children.
[02:56:38.800 --> 02:56:39.960]   By the way, it's super fun.
[02:56:39.960 --> 02:56:40.960]   It's not hard.
[02:56:40.960 --> 02:56:42.400]   I can get more technical off the air if you want.
[02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:43.400]   Yeah.
[02:56:43.400 --> 02:56:44.400]   Please.
[02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:45.400]   I have a lot of thoughts on it.
[02:56:45.400 --> 02:56:46.400]   I'm just kidding.
[02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:47.400]   No.
[02:56:47.400 --> 02:56:48.400]   I can draw you a schematic.
[02:56:48.400 --> 02:56:49.400]   Oh, thank you.
[02:56:49.400 --> 02:56:51.600]   But yeah, that's the greatest thing.
[02:56:51.600 --> 02:56:56.680]   And the fact that corporate America denies it, "Oh, freeze your eggs, have an abortion."
[02:56:56.680 --> 02:56:57.680]   What?
[02:56:57.680 --> 02:56:58.680]   You're evil.
[02:56:58.680 --> 02:56:59.680]   Are you kidding?
[02:56:59.680 --> 02:57:03.720]   Because you're taking from people the only thing that can possibly give them enduring
[02:57:03.720 --> 02:57:04.720]   joy.
[02:57:04.720 --> 02:57:09.040]   And they are successfully taking it from people, and I hate them for it.
[02:57:09.040 --> 02:57:11.120]   You founded TCN, Tucker Carlson Network.
[02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:12.120]   Yeah.
[02:57:12.120 --> 02:57:13.120]   What's your vision for it?
[02:57:13.120 --> 02:57:17.520]   I have no vision for myself or my career, and I never have, so I'm like the last person
[02:57:17.520 --> 02:57:18.520]   to explain.
[02:57:18.520 --> 02:57:19.520]   Just go with it.
[02:57:19.520 --> 02:57:20.520]   Yeah.
[02:57:20.520 --> 02:57:21.520]   I'm an instinct guy, 100%.
[02:57:21.520 --> 02:57:25.980]   I have a vision for the world, but I don't have a vision for my life or my career.
[02:57:25.980 --> 02:57:29.400]   So really, my vision extended precisely this far.
[02:57:29.400 --> 02:57:31.580]   I just want to keep doing what I'm doing.
[02:57:31.580 --> 02:57:36.200]   I just want to keep doing what I'm doing, and there was a five-hour period where I wondered
[02:57:36.200 --> 02:57:42.800]   if I would be able to, because I feel pretty spry and alert, and I'm certainly deeply
[02:57:42.800 --> 02:57:47.840]   enjoying what I'm doing, which is talking to people and saying what I think and learning,
[02:57:47.840 --> 02:57:48.840]   constantly learning.
[02:57:48.840 --> 02:57:57.080]   But I just wanted to keep doing that, and I also wanted to employ the people who I worked
[02:57:57.080 --> 02:57:58.080]   with at Fox.
[02:57:58.080 --> 02:58:01.400]   I've worked with the same people for years, and I love them.
[02:58:01.400 --> 02:58:05.960]   So I had all these people, and I wanted to bring them with me, so we had to build a structure
[02:58:05.960 --> 02:58:06.960]   for that.
[02:58:06.960 --> 02:58:10.000]   But this feels like one of the first times you're really working for yourself.
[02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:11.880]   There's an extra level of freedom here.
[02:58:11.880 --> 02:58:12.880]   Totally.
[02:58:12.880 --> 02:58:13.880]   Totally.
[02:58:13.880 --> 02:58:17.200]   You don't want me doing your taxes.
[02:58:17.200 --> 02:58:19.520]   I'm good at some things, but I'm really not good at others.
[02:58:19.520 --> 02:58:24.520]   I'm more than would be like running a business, like no idea, I'm not interested, not a commerce
[02:58:24.520 --> 02:58:26.200]   guy, so I don't buy anything.
[02:58:26.200 --> 02:58:28.800]   So it's like a whole thick I'm not good at.
[02:58:28.800 --> 02:58:36.440]   But luckily, I'm really blessed to have friends who are involved in this who are good at that.
[02:58:36.440 --> 02:58:38.720]   So I feel positive about it.
[02:58:38.720 --> 02:58:46.520]   But mostly, I'm totally committed to only doing the things that I am good at and enjoy,
[02:58:46.520 --> 02:58:49.920]   and not doing anything else, because I don't want to waste my time.
[02:58:49.920 --> 02:58:53.780]   So I'm just getting to do what I want to do, and I'm really loving it.
[02:58:53.780 --> 02:58:59.800]   What hope, positive hope, do you have for the future of human civilization in, say,
[02:58:59.800 --> 02:59:02.120]   50 years, 100 years, 200 years?
[02:59:02.120 --> 02:59:04.080]   People are great just by their nature.
[02:59:04.080 --> 02:59:11.080]   I mean, they're super complicated, but I like people, I always have liked people.
[02:59:11.080 --> 02:59:14.480]   If I was sitting here with Nikki Haley, who I guess I've been pretty clear I'm not a mega
[02:59:14.480 --> 02:59:18.560]   fan of Nikki Haley's, I would enjoy it.
[02:59:18.560 --> 02:59:23.320]   I've never met anybody I couldn't enjoy on some level, given enough time.
[02:59:23.320 --> 02:59:32.240]   So as long as nobody tampers with the human recipe, the human nature itself, I will always
[02:59:32.240 --> 02:59:35.640]   feel blessed by being around other people.
[02:59:35.640 --> 02:59:37.720]   And that's true around the world.
[02:59:37.720 --> 02:59:43.240]   I've never been to a country, and I've been to scores of countries, where I didn't, given
[02:59:43.240 --> 02:59:47.120]   a week, really like it and like the people.
[02:59:47.120 --> 02:59:55.120]   So yeah, bad leaders are a recurring theme in human history.
[02:59:55.120 --> 02:59:59.360]   They're mostly bad, and we've got an unusually bad set right now, but we'll have better ones
[02:59:59.360 --> 03:00:00.360]   at some point.
[03:00:00.360 --> 03:00:06.160]   I just don't want to, I don't, one thing I don't like more than nuclear weapons and more
[03:00:06.160 --> 03:00:10.280]   than AI, the one thing that really, really bothers me is the idea of using technology
[03:00:10.280 --> 03:00:13.680]   to change the human brain permanently.
[03:00:13.680 --> 03:00:19.200]   Because you're tampering with the secret sauce, you're tampering with God's creation, and
[03:00:19.200 --> 03:00:20.200]   totally evil.
[03:00:20.200 --> 03:00:25.120]   I mean, I've literally sat there the other day with Klaus Schwab, I was with Klaus Schwab,
[03:00:25.120 --> 03:00:30.720]   I was like a total moron, I'm like 100 years old, and like has no idea what's going on
[03:00:30.720 --> 03:00:31.720]   in the world.
[03:00:31.720 --> 03:00:35.160]   But he's like one of these guys who, speaking of mediocre, everyone's so afraid of Klaus
[03:00:35.160 --> 03:00:36.160]   Schwab.
[03:00:36.160 --> 03:00:38.640]   I don't think Klaus Schwab is going to be organizing anything again, he's just like
[03:00:38.640 --> 03:00:40.720]   a total figurehead, like a douchebag.
[03:00:40.720 --> 03:00:45.840]   But anyway, but he was talking and he's reading all these talking points, like, "Oh, what
[03:00:45.840 --> 03:00:49.120]   the cool kids are talking about at Davos," and whatever.
[03:00:49.120 --> 03:00:53.880]   And he starts talking about in his way, in his accent, he was saying, "I think it's so
[03:00:53.880 --> 03:00:58.800]   important that we follow in an ethical way," always in an ethical way, of course, very
[03:00:58.800 --> 03:01:04.840]   ethical, I'm a very ethical man, "that we follow using technology to improve the human
[03:01:04.840 --> 03:01:07.400]   mind and implant the chips in the brain."
[03:01:07.400 --> 03:01:11.440]   And I'm like, "Okay, you have no idea what you're talking about, you're like as senile
[03:01:11.440 --> 03:01:13.360]   as Joe Biden."
[03:01:13.360 --> 03:01:17.520]   But what was so striking is that no one in the room was like, "Wait, what?
[03:01:17.520 --> 03:01:18.520]   You're fucking with people's brains?
[03:01:18.520 --> 03:01:19.520]   Like, what are you even talking about?
[03:01:19.520 --> 03:01:24.560]   Who do you think you are?"
[03:01:24.560 --> 03:01:31.360]   I mean, you're right, the secret sauce, the human mind is really special, like, we should
[03:01:31.360 --> 03:01:38.600]   not mess with it, we should be very careful and whatever special thing it does, it seems
[03:01:38.600 --> 03:01:45.000]   like it's a good thing, like human beings are fundamentally good and like these sources
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:49.520]   of creativity, a creative force in the universe we don't want to mess with.
[03:01:49.520 --> 03:01:52.000]   - Oh, I mean, what else matters?
[03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:58.640]   I don't understand, I mean, I guess, look, I don't want to seem like the Unabomber and
[03:01:58.640 --> 03:01:59.640]   I'm not...
[03:01:59.640 --> 03:02:00.640]   - We are in a cabin in the woods.
[03:02:00.640 --> 03:02:04.360]   - No, I don't, I'm sympathetic to some of his ideas, but not, of course, sending mail
[03:02:04.360 --> 03:02:08.200]   bombs to people because I like people, but I mean, I don't believe in violence at all.
[03:02:08.200 --> 03:02:14.960]   But I think the problem with technology, one of the problems with technology is the way
[03:02:14.960 --> 03:02:20.840]   that people approach it in a very kind of mindless, heedless way, and I think it's important,
[03:02:20.840 --> 03:02:23.960]   this idea that it's inexorable and we can't control it and if we don't do it, someone
[03:02:23.960 --> 03:02:28.580]   else will and there's some truth in that, but it's not the whole story.
[03:02:28.580 --> 03:02:35.560]   We do have free will and we are creating these things intentionally and I think it's incumbent
[03:02:35.560 --> 03:02:41.640]   on us, it's a requirement of a moral requirement of us that we ask, like, is this a net gain
[03:02:41.640 --> 03:02:42.640]   or a net loss?
[03:02:42.640 --> 03:02:46.320]   What, to the extent we can foresee them, will the effects be, et cetera, et cetera.
[03:02:46.320 --> 03:02:49.800]   It's like, it's not super complicated.
[03:02:49.800 --> 03:02:51.760]   So I just, I prize long-term thinking.
[03:02:51.760 --> 03:02:57.480]   I don't always apply it in my own life, obviously, I want to, but I prize it and I think that
[03:02:57.480 --> 03:03:01.480]   people with power should think about future generations and I don't see that kind of thinking
[03:03:01.480 --> 03:03:02.480]   at all.
[03:03:02.480 --> 03:03:06.080]   Like, don't give children to me and like, don't give children handguns 'cause they can
[03:03:06.080 --> 03:03:07.080]   hurt people.
[03:03:07.080 --> 03:03:10.400]   Yeah, fundamentally, you want people in power to be pro-humanity.
[03:03:10.400 --> 03:03:15.200]   By the way, you don't want people who are 81 who are gonna die anyway, why do they care?
[03:03:15.200 --> 03:03:19.240]   And by the way, if your track record with your own family is miserable, why would I
[03:03:19.240 --> 03:03:22.160]   give you my family to oversee?
[03:03:22.160 --> 03:03:28.600]   I just don't, like, again, these are artistic level questions that someone should answer.
[03:03:28.600 --> 03:03:35.860]   - Well, thank you for asking those questions, first of all, and thank you for this conversation.
[03:03:35.860 --> 03:03:38.680]   Thank you for welcoming me to the cabin in the woods.
[03:03:38.680 --> 03:03:39.680]   - Thank you.
[03:03:39.680 --> 03:03:42.640]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Tucker Carlson.
[03:03:42.640 --> 03:03:46.960]   To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[03:03:46.960 --> 03:03:51.280]   And now, let me leave you with some words from Mahatma Gandhi.
[03:03:51.280 --> 03:03:58.000]   When I despair, I remember that all through history, the way of truth and love has always
[03:03:58.000 --> 03:03:59.360]   been.
[03:03:59.360 --> 03:04:04.660]   There have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time, they can seem invincible, but
[03:04:04.660 --> 03:04:07.140]   in the end, they always fall.
[03:04:07.140 --> 03:04:10.200]   Think of it, always.
[03:04:10.200 --> 03:04:12.760]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[03:04:12.760 --> 03:04:13.760]   - Thank you.
[03:04:13.760 --> 03:04:13.760]   - Thank you.
[03:04:13.760 --> 03:04:14.260]   - Thank you.
[03:04:14.260 --> 03:04:14.760]   - Thank you.
[03:04:14.760 --> 03:04:15.260]   - Thank you.
[03:04:15.260 --> 03:04:15.760]   - Thank you.
[03:04:15.760 --> 03:04:16.260]   - Thank you.
[03:04:16.260 --> 03:04:16.760]   - Thank you.
