[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.160]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.920]   of the Everyday Educator podcast.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.640]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.040]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.280]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.120]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.560]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.760]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.880]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.880]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.400]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.560]   But don't forget,
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.920]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.920]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.880]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.400]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.560]   Well, listeners, I am super glad to welcome you back.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.600]   I have Katie Beth Pearson with me again today
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.320]   because we did not get done with our chat from this time.
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.320]   I want you to know also that I have had a lot of questions
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.040]   forwarded to me in the last six months
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.800]   about our very newest resource,
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.480]   Scribblers at Home Recipes from Lifelong Learners.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.060]   There are lots of folks out there,
[00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.880]   like through practicum season
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.200]   and through some of the big media pushes,
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.960]   there have been lots of folks wondering how to use it,
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.240]   when to use it, who should use it,
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.880]   why does everybody think it's so wonderful?
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.880]   And so today, we are gonna explore those ideas a bit
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.820]   as we continue to chat with Katie Beth,
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.120]   because honestly, I think Scribblers
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.340]   can really help families find some answers
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.740]   to the questions that they're asking
[00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.740]   about homeschooling at the beginning,
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.360]   homeschooling in the middle,
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.800]   and homeschooling as our kids get older.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.960]   I think Scribblers can help us as families
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.720]   sort out our priorities and set some real goals,
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.620]   not just for academics, but for family life.
[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.040]   I really think Scribblers can both help us get started
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.620]   and stay the course of learning for a lifetime.
[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.520]   So we're gonna poke into it a little bit.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.800]   In the context of the conversation
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.000]   that Katie Beth and I were having last time,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.460]   just about homeschooling,
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.640]   about what is the most humbling aspect
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.580]   of this homeschooling journey?
[00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.060]   What's the greatest joy?
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.140]   What's the biggest surprise?
[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.240]   Katie Beth, these are the takeaways
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.100]   that I had from our talk last time,
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.200]   that it won't be easy, but it will be rewarding,
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:02.120]   that wrestling with big ideas is good for everybody,
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.880]   for kids and teenagers and grownups,
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.280]   that getting to know your kids by heart
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.320]   is maybe the best gift of homeschooling,
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.200]   and that reading together and exploring the world
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.440]   and talking about God is what homeschooling joy
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.620]   is all about.
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.200]   So those takeaways, Katie Beth,
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.560]   have led me to ask you this question.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.560]   What do you already know about Scribblers?
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.360]   Because a lot of what you said echoed for me
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.300]   what I know Scribblers at Home is really about.
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.300]   So let me ask you, I know that your kids are teenagers now.
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.360]   Do you know much about Scribblers?
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.920]   Oh, you know, I didn't at first.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.480]   I saw the name Scribblers and I thought,
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.840]   my kids are teenagers.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.440]   Why in the world would I glance upon this book,
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.580]   much less own a copy?
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.060]   But then I kept reading the title
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.220]   and I saw recipes for it and I thought,
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.200]   you know what, sometimes even as an adult,
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.200]   I have to go back to the grammar of things
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.660]   because maybe I thought I understood a topic
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.860]   and then I find myself in deeper conversations
[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.980]   about that topic and I have to circle back around
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.680]   and go back to the basics and make sure,
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.600]   do I understand really well whatever that topic is
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.080]   so I can expand my knowledge base.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.580]   And so I grabbed a copy of the Scribblers myself.
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.440]   Even though we're a teenager household
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.440]   and I'm an adult, but I just can't put this book down.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.540]   It is so beautifully laid out
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.360]   and it has such wonderful visuals
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.360]   and I love the simplicity of the recipes
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.960]   that are inside of it because they're approachable.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.000]   Even for teenagers where I can look at them and go,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.540]   hey, the power just went out and we're all bored.
[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.520]   Let's open to a random page in this book
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.180]   and do one of the recipes just to spend time together
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.120]   because we can't do our research project without internet
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.620]   or you've already used all of the books on our bookshelf
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.880]   and you need to pick a couple more things
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.280]   that technology is required.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.240]   So let's just do one of these over here
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.500]   and enjoy that time together.
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.660]   - That's really neat.
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.500]   That's really neat that you picked it up.
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.500]   I keep having questions from product sales specialists
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.060]   out in the field saying, hey, people are wondering
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.700]   if this is just supposed to be for the little kids.
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.900]   Can I sell this to challenge families?
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.980]   And I'm like, of course, of course,
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.980]   because what so many parents, even in our pilot studies,
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:17.140]   what a lot of parents discovered was that the chart pages
[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:23.400]   are absolutely awesome for parents who are trying to get
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.440]   a big picture view of all of the things,
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.340]   all of the pieces of information, all of the skills
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:39.340]   that we as parents are trying to load into our kids.
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.740]   Strand by strand, these charts give parents
[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.820]   a really good picture of what is coming
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.820]   and what that information looks like as it builds.
[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:59.100]   And so I can see lots of challenge parents wanting the book
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:04.180]   just because all the charts, hey, I've had people say,
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.340]   I want this book because all those charts that I need
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.980]   are in one place and I don't have to go looking for it.
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.980]   - I have already tabbed this book with some of the charts
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.500]   that I think would be helpful for my students
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.820]   this academic year, right?
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.320]   We talked last time about wrestling with something
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.980]   and just kind of digging your heels in
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.260]   and stubbornly dominating that wrestling match
[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.700]   and making sure that you don't give up.
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.940]   One of my daughters still struggles with Latin verbs
[00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.740]   and lo and behold, you have a beautiful chart
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.940]   that explains why you need to understand
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.540]   the four principle parts of a Latin verb
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.740]   and what the differences between the tenses
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.500]   and the conjugations are.
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.700]   And it sums up pages upon pages upon pages
[00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.500]   of the Henley book and just a couple of charts
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.260]   in Scribblers that she can flip through and reference it
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:10.720]   as she continues her wrestling match in her weekly studies.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.340]   So had I not picked this up,
[00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.140]   she would have still been wrestling,
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.860]   but her wrestling match would have been more exhausting
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.260]   and I don't know if she would have lost hope
[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.640]   and questioned whether she should just do just enough.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.860]   Does that make sense?
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.340]   - It does make sense.
[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:33.340]   I know that for me, sometimes as a grownup,
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.300]   I just want to know all the things.
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.300]   Okay, so tell me, as grownups,
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.180]   we need to see the big picture.
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.940]   Like I need to see all of the pieces
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.400]   and where I'm going with all of the pieces.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.260]   And so I think for us as parents,
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.860]   the charts are very reassuring because we can see,
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.820]   okay, so this is the whole piece of pie.
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.060]   I'm not asking my child necessarily
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.100]   to see the whole piece of pie,
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.100]   certainly not to chew up the whole piece of pie,
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.260]   but as the parent in charge, I need to see it.
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.180]   I think as our children grow,
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:15.760]   so challenge students probably have more of that view
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.260]   of the chart that parents have
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.940]   than the view that little kids have.
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.180]   So I think for our challenge students,
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:27.060]   it is really helpful to see the big picture of it.
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.300]   And I always taught, when we were developing Scribblers,
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:35.300]   I told people the activities are for the kids.
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:39.860]   The charts are for the parents and it's twofold.
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:44.860]   The charts help the parents reclaim the education
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.300]   that we missed, right?
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.820]   So these are the pieces that you really need.
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:55.820]   But the charts also give the parents the vision
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:01.140]   of where all of these pegs of information
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.680]   are taking our children.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:08.600]   The chart is the culmination of all the pegs
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.860]   and all the skills that we pour into our children
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.240]   as they grow.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.540]   - Yeah, I love the idea.
[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.040]   First of all, where was this
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.100]   when my kids were Scribblers age?
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.300]   - I know. - Right?
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.000]   - We were all just trying to figure out what we didn't have.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.720]   That's where it was. - I know.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:30.720]   But it's wonderful in that the layout of the recipe
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.340]   tells you your serving suggestion,
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.460]   which is basically, is this an activity I can do in the car?
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.780]   Is this an activity I do in the backyard?
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.680]   Is this, where am I gonna do this, right?
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.420]   And then you get all of your ingredients together
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.500]   and you follow the steps.
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:52.500]   It's beautifully designed in an approachable way.
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.860]   So that way you can do it with your littlest learners
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.620]   who may not understand what the chart is
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.720]   and they're not expected to.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.200]   - Most of the activities don't even suggest
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.800]   that you show your littlest learners the chart at all.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.960]   - No, it's more of a, oh mom,
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.400]   I don't remember what a polyhedron is.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.120]   Can I, oh, let me take a look at this chart.
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.320]   That's what it is.
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.800]   And I can use that word while playing with my toddler
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.120]   or playing with my younger child.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.280]   But I don't have to hold them accountable
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:30.460]   to remembering or understanding or mastering that knowledge.
[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:34.360]   I'm just sprinkling those big chewy words
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.840]   into their vocabulary so that it's not scary
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.960]   when I need to hold them accountable.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.120]   But I can remember what I learned
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.660]   when I was being held accountable to that knowledge.
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:50.020]   And that chart's beautiful to keep me in check
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.520]   because there are some things I learned in school
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.880]   I have not used since.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.000]   But that doesn't mean that I should shy away
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.040]   from introducing that information to my own children.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.240]   But then as my kids got older and into the challenge years,
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.920]   I did have to start holding them accountable
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.420]   to the understanding of the information
[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.420]   so they can use those charts just as much as I do.
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.480]   - I love it.
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.600]   I love what you've said because it does give families
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.420]   the understanding of what is the recipe for
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.880]   and what is the chart for.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.160]   There is, I know you have your scribblers
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.900]   in front of you too.
[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:37.760]   There's a literature spread on page 90
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.280]   that's called the Plays the Thing.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.340]   And okay, so if you open it up,
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:48.020]   all of the recipes are on the left-hand side of the spread
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.240]   and all the charts are on the right.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.200]   Well, the chart, which is for parents,
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.760]   is all about the parts of a drama.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.600]   Drama is one of the three genres of literature
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.520]   along with poetry and prose.
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.120]   And so this gives all the parts of the drama.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:12.060]   So it gives actors, script, act, scene, dialogue,
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.760]   stage, set, theater, costumes, props,
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.940]   with definitions of what all of those things are.
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:23.940]   So you get the big 50 cent word, the dialogue, okay?
[00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:28.860]   And then, but what does that have to do with my kids?
[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.720]   Well, like you said, you are bringing them along
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.400]   toward understanding of what a play is
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.120]   by letting them experience it.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:46.120]   So the activity tells you to read a story
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:51.360]   and we suggest The Frog Prince from Old World Echoes,
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.040]   but you could read any favorite story
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.920]   from your own book or a library book.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.720]   And then what you're gonna do with your children
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.140]   is explore how the story might be presented as a drama.
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:07.680]   So you discuss the characters by asking them questions.
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.120]   So you ask your kids, what does that character look like?
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.360]   What do they wear?
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.500]   What's their attitude like?
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.240]   So, and then you're just asking your children questions.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.420]   So how would you know that they were rich?
[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:24.060]   How would that characteristic manifest itself
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:28.200]   in costumes or clothing or facial expressions?
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:33.200]   You know, if it was a hwani princess,
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.040]   or if she was a shy princess,
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.660]   how would you show that?
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:42.120]   You ask your children, 'cause they know those things.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.980]   What do you think that they would be?
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.780]   Then you discuss the plot by asking more questions.
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:50.640]   So what does the princess do first?
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.740]   And when does she meet the frog?
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.920]   And what does the frog ask?
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.240]   And what happens next?
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.320]   And then with your child, you doing the writing,
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.860]   if you have a pre-writing or a slow writer,
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:06.520]   you make a list of all the things that happened
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.200]   in the story in order.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.820]   Then, depending on the age or abilities of your children,
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:16.120]   you create a play that retells the story.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.160]   You can write the story down or not.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.780]   You can make costumes or not.
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:24.200]   You can perform it for an audience or not.
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.800]   See how open-ended all of this is?
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.920]   But then you ask them, after you do that,
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.360]   you sit back and you ask some thinking questions.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.640]   It's all about conversation with your children.
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.480]   So are there lessons to be learned?
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.060]   Do you think the princess learned anything?
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:46.060]   Could we learn anything by studying what happened to her?
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:50.020]   What kind of lessons did the frog learn from his actions?
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.240]   What do we learn from the king's actions?
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.320]   You could even ask, would you like to be like the princess?
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.420]   Would you like to be like the frog?
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:02.340]   And the cool thing about scribblers is
[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:05.960]   you can look at this recipe and you think, that was fun.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.580]   And now my children know a new word.
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:13.580]   They know costumes, they know dialogue, they know scene.
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.440]   I wrote it down and told them that it was the script.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.060]   So they've learned some new words and we had a fun time,
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.740]   but what did that really do?
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:26.460]   Well, the cool thing is that this will give you the yield.
[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.760]   The recipe tells you what you and your children
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.080]   are getting out of this.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.560]   And for this activity, what the yield is,
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.560]   a deeper understanding of narrative skills.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.520]   So look, you thought you were playing with your kids,
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.680]   but you are giving them a deeper understanding
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:48.180]   of narrative skills by engaging in a different way
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.340]   of telling a story.
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:54.520]   So what you did with your children after you read the story,
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.400]   and then you ask what happened first
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.040]   and what happened next, deconstructing the story
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:04.000]   in order to put it together in a different form,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.480]   in the form of a play, gives the children the opportunity
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.100]   to see the lessons that character development
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.280]   of a story might offer.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.540]   The lessons sometimes, you know as parents,
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.180]   we always are looking to teach a lesson
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:23.080]   and our kids sometimes know that.
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.220]   I just wanna hear the story,
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.840]   I don't want it to teach me anything.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.120]   I had, my kids said that to me.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:33.120]   But listen, y'all, the lessons are sometimes more winsome
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:37.080]   when children discover them on their own.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.480]   As you're just asking them questions,
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.040]   not about themselves and what they would do,
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.460]   when you're asking them questions
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.580]   about what did the character do,
[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.920]   and then what happened to the character,
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.440]   and what did the character learn,
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.040]   the lessons are more winsome
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.620]   when they come upon them themselves.
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.600]   And so, look, what's the big deal about that?
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.860]   Well, it helped us as parents feel good
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:07.080]   about what we know about a play,
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.960]   'cause we could study that chart.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.880]   It helped us have a great conversation
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.460]   and a fun time with our kids.
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:19.640]   It helped them learn to tell and retell a story
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.640]   and look at different parts of it
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:26.200]   and think about other people's reactions
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.420]   and other people's actions.
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:33.000]   But at the bottom of the recipe is one of my favorite parts.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.640]   It's called Tips and Hints.
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.720]   And this recipe's tips and hints say,
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.720]   do we ever judge someone by the way they present themselves,
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:48.200]   their clothing, their facial expressions, or their words?
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.600]   Do we make assumptions about others based on expectations
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.040]   from past experiences?
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.480]   How does God judge us?
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.560]   How should we evaluate one another?
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:05.520]   Paul offers us some insights in Galatians 2.6.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.180]   As many parents through the years have maintained,
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:13.320]   actions speak louder than words.
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.840]   So the tips and hints gives us,
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.800]   a lot of times, a spiritual application
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.340]   or a deeper thinking for us as parents
[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.860]   to see where can this, how can this help me
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:29.940]   train my child's character?
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:34.100]   How can it help me turn them to what God wants them to be,
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.140]   as well as teach them about drama?
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.340]   And that's a fun thing.
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.420]   That's a cool thing for scribblers to do.
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:48.420]   I think it was a big undertaking
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:53.620]   for one piece of, or one resource to do,
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:57.460]   but that's what it tries to do.
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:01.280]   It tries to help parents engage their kids
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:06.280]   in fun activities that have meaning.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.380]   - Yeah, you know, and looking at this,
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.280]   I could absolutely see my 17-year-old
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:15.980]   and my 13-year-old and then my husband and myself
[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:20.020]   doing this for anything, doing it with a children's story,
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:24.480]   doing it with Shakespeare, doing it for some book
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.720]   that we've read on a larger scale
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:31.460]   and thinking more deeply about the ethical problems
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.660]   that they will see in the world.
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.820]   What choices did they make that you don't agree with?
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.280]   Why don't you agree with those choices?
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.420]   And we are a playful family.
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.500]   So yeah, we could get caught up in some costumes
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.700]   in the living room and do some silly voices
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:49.660]   and things like that.
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.240]   And I think it expands.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:57.120]   It helps that mother of a preschooler
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.980]   or father of a preschooler who's looking
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.540]   at their young learner and thinking,
[00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.140]   "What do I do with you?"
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:10.660]   You're clumsy, you're slow,
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:14.300]   you don't understand many of the concepts of the world.
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.280]   And I want to teach you these things,
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.440]   but how do I get there?
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.340]   And so you open up your scribblers,
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:24.700]   the recipes from lifelong learners,
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.220]   you can find a recipe, see what the yield is,
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.580]   which is really, that's what I look at.
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.160]   One of the first things I look at,
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.200]   'cause I want to see what am I running towards
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.240]   when we do this activity, right?
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.800]   What am I trying to accomplish?
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.000]   Or what's the point?
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.780]   I have a lot of friends that are like,
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.060]   "What's the point of this activity?
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:47.940]   "This feels like it's just a time waster."
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.880]   So I love that you incorporated the yield
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.440]   for each of these recipes so that I can get my heart set
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.880]   and understand what we're running towards
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:01.880]   and then start playing with your kids and be comforted.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:06.520]   And the fact that play is still learning
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:10.440]   because you're still educating your children,
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.780]   even though they're not taking a test or a pop quiz,
[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.540]   maybe they're not even doing book work,
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:19.520]   but they're still learning something.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.200]   And it's something that can both be academic in nature
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.560]   because they're gonna use that information moving forward,
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.520]   but it's also heart learning,
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.360]   thinking about right from wrong,
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:35.560]   thinking about who did something
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.600]   that could have been done better.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.560]   And that's education as well.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.280]   - Yeah, I have always said that play
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.880]   is the work of childhood.
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:47.760]   And I think that so many of us,
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:52.600]   when we begin schooling our children at home,
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.360]   it's natural, kids like to play
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.920]   and we like to play with them, it's fun.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.600]   But so many moms and dads,
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.760]   especially when they start out feel guilty,
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.880]   if they get to the end of the day and they look back
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.400]   and they think, wow, what we mostly did was play.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.400]   I am a terrible homeschooler.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:16.320]   And what I, scribblers was, because that's,
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.240]   I remember having those thoughts, Katie Beth,
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.060]   you said, where was this when our kids were little?
[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:24.520]   We were living it, we were living the angst of that moment.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.840]   You look back and what do I have to show for the day?
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.120]   A bunch of play, what a failure am I?
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.680]   And I knew that parents were feeling that.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:38.020]   And what we want to say to them through scribblers is look,
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:41.800]   your play has a purpose.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:46.660]   And if you, every activity in scribblers is fun.
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:50.180]   It looks from a child's side of the activity,
[00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:51.400]   it's gonna look like play.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.000]   I mean, there are relay races in here.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.240]   You get to beat on pieces of furniture
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.600]   or on your lap, you get to march in place,
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.520]   you get to run around, you get to make a mess.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:08.120]   It absolutely looks like and is play.
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:11.520]   But what scribblers does is show you how the play
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:16.520]   you're doing with your children is intentionally building
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:21.760]   into them and you the skills that they need
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:25.760]   to grow and expand their understanding of the world
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:30.560]   and what they can do with the skills they're gaining.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.800]   So they think that they're just,
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:40.360]   they are just learning to clap out.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.000]   There's a phonics, there's a phonics.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:43.840]   I don't even remember what the name
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:46.300]   of the activity is over the recipe.
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:49.500]   There's a phonics where you clap out your names,
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.820]   Katie Beth, okay?
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.000]   And every child can do that.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.840]   They don't know the word syllabication
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.480]   and lots of us frankly do not know the word syllabication.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:05.480]   But all of us can clap out suspense, jello, chocolate pudding
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:09.720]   you can clap it out.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.600]   Kids think that they just get to beat on things
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.040]   or clap rhythms of words.
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.880]   But what they're learning is that words have syllables
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:23.360]   and that is eventually gonna help them spell words.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:27.060]   English words and foreign language words.
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:31.940]   And so what looks like play is becoming a skill
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:36.160]   that will help them grow and learn as they go on.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.040]   And so that's one of the things that I love
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:43.000]   about Scribblers is that it helps us feel good
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.180]   about playing with our kids.
[00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.280]   - Absolutely, I'm actually looking at that recipe.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.960]   It's called the rhythm of words
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:53.580]   and the syllabication chart is wonderful.
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:58.560]   I don't think I ever learned the formal rules
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.280]   of the breakdown for syllables.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.840]   But this chart tells me that, right?
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:07.480]   So when I was teaching my own children
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.920]   that at the very beginning of their learning,
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.200]   they're trying to make these sounds
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:16.440]   that they're looking at on a page connect with the letters
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:20.940]   and they don't know where the syllables fall or lie.
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:24.800]   And, you know, definition's my favorite
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.320]   of the five common topics.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.360]   I know we're not supposed to have favorite children,
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.300]   but definition's my favorite.
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.160]   And I love that a lot of these charts
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.480]   are just full of definitions or explanations.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:39.980]   And it's a helpful chart for me as the mom
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:44.820]   to remind myself how to guide my learner, my student.
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:49.320]   Okay, when you see that there's two consonants side by side,
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.080]   we're going to split our syllables right there.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.640]   So now let's try this word again, bubbles.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.860]   Where do you hear the syllables?
[00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:00.560]   And walk them through it so that they have their own memory
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.020]   as they're learning their words.
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:06.900]   But then, yeah, what kid doesn't love making loud noises?
[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:11.500]   - Oh yes, permission to make a loud sound during school.
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:16.000]   - Absolutely, so whacking a board or a pot or your hands
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.240]   or the back of the car seat as you're driving down the road
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.820]   and getting your bodies in play
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:25.480]   does not make it any less educational for them.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:28.720]   In fact, I would argue that because it invokes
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.680]   more of their senses, it solidifies it better.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.060]   And it's fun.
[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:36.580]   - And it's fun, absolutely.
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:37.960]   It is absolutely fun.
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.940]   I love what you've said.
[00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:41.760]   It's a really good way to look at the chart.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:46.300]   The chart helps parents guide the children.
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:49.840]   The chart, parents, will give you words.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:53.680]   It will give you words to explain the concepts
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.520]   that you're trying to put into your children.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:00.380]   And sometimes it gives us words to explain concepts
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.440]   that we're a little fuzzy on.
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.600]   Or we know, but like there are lots of things
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.480]   that my kids would ask me and I would say,
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.940]   well, I can explain it to you,
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.460]   but I have to use a lot of words because I'm kind of go,
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:14.820]   I'm wandering around in my mind,
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:18.100]   gathering up all of the pieces that belong to this
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:19.940]   and organizing as I go.
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.640]   And sometimes all that does is confuse our kids.
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:26.820]   So the chart actually gives you words,
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:30.440]   succinct ways of explaining things.
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.780]   And that can be a real blessing.
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.180]   That can be a real blessing.
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.480]   I wanna just, before we run out of time,
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.020]   I want to talk about the beginning.
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:42.520]   I've had lots of people say, I love scribblers,
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.240]   but yeah, I didn't read the introduction.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:49.080]   And it makes me so sad because the introduction
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:54.080]   really helps you get a handle on why am I doing this?
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.920]   Why am I homeschooling?
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:01.040]   And if you begin with the end in mind,
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.460]   you have a much calmer journey.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:08.840]   There's suggestions in there of just ask questions
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:13.840]   of yourself and your spouse as you get ready to homeschool.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:16.440]   What is your family's purpose?
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.600]   What are your family's priorities?
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:24.520]   How does education fit into your purpose and priorities?
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.640]   Lots of us begin homeschooling
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.920]   and it's years before we think,
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:32.260]   wow, does this kind of education really fit
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:37.260]   what we believe God's made us to do and be in our community?
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:41.300]   You actually kind of need to know that first
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.660]   in order to design the education
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:47.800]   that's gonna fit his purpose for your life.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:52.540]   You can ask questions like, what do your little ones need?
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.180]   What do your middle children need?
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.440]   What do your older kids need?
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:00.360]   What will prepare your children for lifelong learning?
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.360]   Now, I know that when we start out,
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.900]   I remember thinking I've got to teach them to read
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:09.200]   and they need to know enough math not to be embarrassing
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.140]   and to be able to organize their own lives
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:14.740]   and I want them to know history and all that stuff.
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:19.580]   I did not think at the outset,
[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:22.460]   what will make my children lifelong learners?
[00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:24.060]   What will help them love?
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:29.060]   Now, as we went, I did think I need to keep them curious
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:33.900]   because I had discovered that that was
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:37.560]   what kept me and my husband learning.
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:40.140]   We kept being curious about things
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:42.960]   and so I knew that that was one of the ways
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:47.800]   I could keep them learning, if I could keep them curious.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.740]   But Scribblers is full of good questions.
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:53.680]   How do you promote wonder and excitement
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.780]   and constant curiosity?
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.380]   Think about that ahead of time
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:01.360]   and you will have a better chance of doing that thing.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:07.060]   - Yeah, I really like that within your introduction,
[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:11.160]   you challenged the reader to create their own family
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.860]   mission statement, right?
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.260]   When we first started homeschooling,
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:21.260]   I was not running away from the public school.
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:25.220]   I was running toward a conviction
[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:27.100]   that was placed on my heart
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.660]   and I think putting that to words and saying,
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.420]   why is this a conviction of my heart?
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.380]   What is the purpose of what I'm gonna do?
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:38.620]   'Cause I'm gonna be honest with you, Lisa,
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:43.620]   18 years is a long time to see any kind of results.
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:47.380]   That is a long time to wait, yes.
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:50.900]   And so I'm a box checker,
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:54.260]   but I'm also a person that likes to celebrate
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:56.540]   when something has finished.
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:58.580]   And so I love vacuuming the floors
[00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:02.900]   'cause I can see results when I'm done vacuuming my floors.
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:07.140]   But when I'm wrestling with phonics or Latin verbs
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:12.140]   or even formal lab reports for chemistry,
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:16.060]   it's not very easy to see the results right away
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:19.780]   and you're trying to figure out what is going on.
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:23.540]   So turning back to our family mission statement
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:26.780]   and reminding ourselves what is the point
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:28.780]   of me homeschooling my children?
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:33.780]   Why was this important enough for me to prioritize my time,
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:38.980]   my energy, my money into pouring into my children's education
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:44.300]   rather than whatever the alternative might look like.
[00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:49.300]   So when you have those seasons, which we get every year,
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:54.740]   my season starts around February when it's too cold
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:56.040]   to do anything outside.
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.580]   And here in North Carolina,
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:01.340]   it's too wet and cold to do anything outside.
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:04.060]   It doesn't have fun snow for us to play with.
[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:07.980]   It's gross, wet, cold mud.
[00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:09.580]   And so we're stuck inside.
[00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:12.940]   There's not a lot going on as far as like family
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:17.940]   celebrations or vacations or even like holidays anymore.
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:22.180]   And it's just those dreary days of homeschooling
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:24.620]   where my kids have started to feel
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.500]   like they're hitting a wall.
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.680]   They don't feel like they're growing anymore.
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:32.480]   I don't feel like I'm actually reaching them anymore.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.760]   I turn and look at our family's mission statement
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:38.860]   and our schoolhouse's mission statement.
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:42.340]   And I remind myself why we're doing this
[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:46.460]   and what we're running towards so I can reset my heart
[00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:49.800]   and my children's understanding of the beauty
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.540]   of perseverance in those seasons.
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.540]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:56.040]   That is so wise.
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:00.500]   And it is very important, like you said,
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:05.500]   when the doldrums come to have that statement written down
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:10.760]   somewhere that you can go back and reflect.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.120]   No, this is why I'm doing it.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:17.800]   And the introduction of Scribblers helps families
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.820]   wrestle through those ideas,
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.060]   what belongs in a mission statement.
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:25.400]   It helps you consider really practical things
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:29.880]   like what are some ways we can start the days together
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.560]   that will lead us toward our mission?
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:35.760]   What are some ways that we can end the day together
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:39.760]   so that our hearts are one and we can reflect with gladness
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.100]   on what God has brought us through?
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:47.800]   It helps us to consider things that are not academic
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:52.120]   but are part of our family rhythms,
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.240]   are part of the culture of learning
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.800]   that homeschoolers are trying to build.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.880]   Things like what is living in a family
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.680]   gonna teach your child?
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.520]   I mean, it's not how to conjugate Latin.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.360]   - No.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:08.760]   - It's not how to map a line.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:13.760]   It's not how to debate in the Lincoln-Douglas format.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:19.560]   Living in a family should teach your children about mercy
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:24.520]   and grace and compassion and hard work
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.520]   and celebrating one another.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:30.340]   And the introduction for Scribblers helps us as a family
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:32.120]   to work through all of that.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.960]   But it's not just for beginners.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.180]   It's not just for beginning homeschoolers.
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:41.520]   And I think you've done a beautiful job of showing us that.
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:45.760]   There is a quote in the book from an early,
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.600]   from one of the pilot users who said,
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.360]   who had kids of all levels.
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:55.440]   And she was mostly gonna use Scribblers
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.260]   with her Foundation's age kids.
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:01.360]   But she says, "My Foundation's kids
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:04.120]   "loved the science activity."
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.560]   And the one she was talking about
[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:08.800]   was called Tiny Beauties in Your Backyard.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:12.080]   My Foundation's kids loved the science activity,
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:16.200]   but so did my Challenge A student.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:19.680]   And my husband even wanted in,
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:23.880]   "Maybe we will use Scribblers on Saturdays
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:27.160]   "so the whole family can enjoy it."
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.200]   And that was one of my favorite comments.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:32.040]   When she was telling us this story,
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:34.760]   she explained that she was doing the activity
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:37.360]   in the family room with her younger kids
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:41.420]   and the Challenge A student wandered by from her bedroom.
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.580]   And she's like, "Oh man, oh man.
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.740]   "I wish I had done that.
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.220]   "I have to draw pictures.
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.000]   "I have to draw diagrams.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.720]   "Man, that would be so, can I do this one with you, Mom?"
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.480]   And so she stayed and then the husband wandered,
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:58.420]   husband offered they wandered by and he was like,
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.040]   "That's what you're doing in homeschooling?
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.520]   "That kind of looks fun.
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.200]   "Could you do that at a time when I could participate?"
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:07.580]   And so we've had lots of families say,
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:10.320]   "We're gonna try to use this at a time
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.360]   "when our whole family can do it."
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.600]   I've even had people say, "This is gonna be perfect
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:18.260]   "because my parents are coming for a week
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:21.640]   "and they wanna be involved with our homeschooling,
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.020]   "but they don't know what we're doing.
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:25.760]   "I mean, they've not been writing papers and essentials,
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:27.780]   "so they don't know all that keyword outline stuff
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.880]   "and they don't know anything about those charts.
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:33.820]   "How can I, but Scribblers recipes,
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:35.460]   "they're one-offs.
[00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:38.440]   "You can open the book, pick a recipe.
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:42.040]   "Everything you need is simple and it lists what you need
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.940]   "and how long it's gonna take."
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:48.460]   That's a great way for an older sibling or a grandparent
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:53.460]   or even a babysitter to be involved with the homeschooling.
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:56.280]   And the cool thing about Scribblers
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:59.460]   is that it's not a daily curriculum.
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:03.020]   I mean, you do not have to do one activity
[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:04.740]   from each strand every day.
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.360]   In fact, that would be way too much.
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:10.080]   You need to be reading and exploring and praying
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:13.160]   and playing every day with your children.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.820]   So pick activities.
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:19.820]   They're not necessarily sequential within each strand.
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:24.640]   They sometimes, the activities will build in complexity
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.920]   and the charts kind of build in complexity,
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:30.480]   but you don't have to do it in any certain order.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.740]   And there's nothing that says
[00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:35.380]   you can't do the same activity multiple times
[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:38.240]   because there's scaling instructions in there
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:41.080]   or instructions for, or you could try it this way
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:43.640]   or you might like to try it that way.
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:46.840]   So really Scribblers is kind of cool for everybody
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.560]   because it gives you a lot to think about
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.120]   and a lot to play with.
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:53.280]   - It does.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:57.400]   And I'm looking at, it's in the phonics section
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.540]   and it's called Meet Me at the Easel.
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:02.840]   And I love this exercise
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:07.660]   because sometimes you're looking at something
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:12.320]   and you just think what you're seeing is so very obvious
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.200]   to what everybody else is seeing.
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:19.200]   So we maybe just jump over taking the time to attend
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:25.420]   to certain details or to express the things that you see.
[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:29.440]   And this simplifies that skill to be able to look
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:34.260]   at a picture and walk your students through being able
[00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:36.880]   to say what they see.
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.720]   And so again, that chart on the right,
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:41.300]   which is amazing for the parents,
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:45.760]   gives the some really great leading bits of information
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:50.000]   to say, okay, if your student is like, I see a dog.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.560]   Well, now let's ask some good questions to say,
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.320]   well, when you're looking at this picture,
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.900]   is it a painting or a photograph?
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:02.900]   Is it needle point or is it a crayon drawing?
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:06.280]   Do you see the brush strokes?
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.440]   Do you see this?
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:11.440]   Describe this better using these details.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.620]   And it allows the student to learn what kind
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:17.920]   of information is good to have,
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:21.880]   which will absolutely help them when they start in challenge
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:25.040]   with the art appreciation papers that they write.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:28.300]   And they're studying different mediums
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.120]   and different styles of art.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:34.000]   Now they have more language to say,
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.260]   oh, now I know how to describe this image
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:42.260]   and to compare it with another artist's work
[00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:43.680]   and things like that.
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.920]   It was just, sometimes I find myself in a situation
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.860]   where I just don't have the language
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:52.140]   because I think everybody else sees
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:53.820]   the exact same thing I see.
[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:56.000]   - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, that's really good.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.320]   I'm glad that you picked that activity too,
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:01.400]   because it illustrates what I was saying.
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:06.400]   That is one of the last activities
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:12.240]   in that phonics section of the cookbook.
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:17.240]   And so it is, the chart is all about art appreciation
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:20.760]   that our challenge two students will do.
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.080]   And it gives you, like Katie Beth said,
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:27.720]   the vocabulary that you as a parent or your older child
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:31.220]   would need to critique a piece of art
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:34.480]   or evaluate it or talk about it.
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:39.480]   But the recipe, the activity for your kids
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:45.980]   is about looking at the artwork in a book that you choose
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:49.380]   and talking about the picture and what's it about
[00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:52.260]   and actually calling your child to attend
[00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:55.960]   are the colors bright or are they dull?
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.800]   Are they primary colors?
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.480]   Do you like or dislike the subject?
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.040]   Look at the other parts of the picture.
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:04.480]   So you're calling them to attend.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:08.000]   And then what you're gonna do is trace the picture.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.400]   Look for the shapes,
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:13.660]   which is a very beginning drawing thing to do.
[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:19.200]   And then choose three main colors that the artists use
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:23.060]   and color with crayons the picture that you traced.
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:28.060]   And so it gives our children the opportunity
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:33.260]   to begin what they are going to work into as they grow.
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:35.540]   And that's what Scribblers does.
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:39.060]   It's just like a feast of learning for the whole family.
[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:43.620]   And it's one of the reasons that I feel so strongly about it
[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:48.380]   is that it helps us get started on the homeschool journey,
[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:51.680]   but it makes the homeschool journey a feast
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:55.120]   for all the years that we're together.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:56.580]   I love it, I love it.
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:43:01.180]   Thank you for helping me dive into Scribblers a little bit
[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:04.740]   and talk a little bit more about homeschooling
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:05.740]   through the years.
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:07.200]   Katie Beth, this has been great
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.560]   and I really do appreciate it.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.140]   - Oh, well, thank you for inviting me.
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:13.840]   I have so much fun talking with you, Lisa.
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:16.300]   - We have a great time together.
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:20.600]   - Listen, you guys, if you have never considered
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.800]   that Scribblers was for you,
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.260]   and now you've changed your mind,
[00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:29.540]   go on classicalconversationsbooks.com
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:34.540]   and you can find the Scribblers at Home recipes
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:38.260]   from lifelong learners there.
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:42.140]   It is a wonderful resource, a renewable resource,
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:45.900]   useful for all of your family for lots of years.
[00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:48.920]   And I think it'll be a blessing to your home.
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:52.320]   I've enjoyed talking to you and to you, Katie Beth,
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:56.000]   and you guys, I will see you next week.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:56.840]   Bye-bye.
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.780]   (gentle music)
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:01.840]   you
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:11.840]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
