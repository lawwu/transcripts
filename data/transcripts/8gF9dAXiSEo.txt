[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360]   Welcome back to a new week on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.360]   Pastor John, here's the question.
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.000]   What do you want to be as your final words on Twitter?
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.480]   And 140 characters, Brittany writes in to ask it, "Dear Pastor John, if you could
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.800]   say one last thing to this world, what would your message be to us?"
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.360]   In other words, what is the one sentence message, the one last tweet that is the
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.160]   most important thing we need to hear from you and why?
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.560]   I took Brittany seriously when she suggested it be one last tweet.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:42.840]   So here's my 140 character, exactly, final tweet.
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.560]   The most important thing I think the world needs to hear, tweet size.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.320]   It goes like this.
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.240]   And I had to drop a comma, frankly, too.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.400]   But you can't see that, so it doesn't really matter.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.680]   This is 140 characters, including one comma and one period.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:14.840]   "Jesus, God's son, died in the place of sinners and rose so that all who love him
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.960]   supremely might be forgiven all and have eternal joy in God."
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.480]   Now, I thought about saying instead, "Read your Bibles and pray for insight."
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:38.960]   Because there is so much that needs to be known about God that cannot be put into
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.920]   one sentence, and the only reliable source for all that needs to be known is the Bible.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.160]   So maybe the most important thing to do is not to try to sum up the Bible in 140
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.760]   characters, but to cry out to the world, "Go read, go read, go read, pray as you
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.440]   read so that you see everything that's there."
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.520]   Maybe that's the most important thing to say.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.480]   But then on second thought, there are millions and millions of people who
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.440]   don't have access to the Bible, so that the last thing I should say to them is
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.760]   probably more specific than, "Go read your Bible."
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.760]   And I think the Bible itself would want me to talk mainly about, not about the
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.000]   Bible, but about what the Bible talks about.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.680]   So that's why I wrote what I wrote.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.960]   And the reason I chose to focus the way I did was because the Apostle
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.560]   Paul already wrote that tweet.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.720]   In 1 Corinthians 15, 3 to 4, I didn't count his characters, it's close.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.640]   He said, "I deliver to you as a first importance," and I presume that
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.480]   would mean last importance also, "what I also received, that Christ died for our
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.960]   sins in accordance with the Scriptures and that he was buried, that he was raised
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.840]   on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures."
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:13.800]   So Paul says that of first importance is that Christ died for our sins and rose again.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.400]   Now, if that's a first importance for Paul, then I'm standing on firm ground
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:28.600]   in making it my last tweet, my most important thing that I say finally.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.960]   So here it is again.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.440]   I'll read it again and then just say a couple of comments about why
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.240]   I structured it the way I did.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.720]   "Jesus, God's son, died in the place of sinners and rose so that all who love
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.480]   him supremely might be forgiven all and have eternal joy in God."
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:56.240]   It seemed good and needful in our day to identify who Jesus is.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.280]   So I said, "Jesus, the son of God," or God's son, and instead of saying, "died
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.640]   for sinners," I said, "died in the place of sinners" to make explicit what I think
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.920]   Paul means, namely that this is an act of substitution, not just an exemplary act
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.960]   or an act of advocacy, but that he really took the place of sinners when he died.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:29.120]   And I included "and rose," not just died, but "and rose" because Paul did in his
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.760]   summary and because if Christ is not raised from the dead, we're still in our
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.560]   sins, there's no victory over death or wrath or the devil, there's no gospel
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.120]   without the resurrection.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.880]   The most controversial thing in my sentence, I think, is that I said the
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:54.120]   beneficiaries of this death are "all who love him supremely," rather than saying
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.080]   "all who trust him" or "all who believe in him."
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.960]   And I certainly don't mean to set this up as a way everybody should
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.360]   always present the gospel.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:13.640]   I might be wrong in choosing to emphasize loving Christ supremely instead of
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.160]   believing Christ.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:21.720]   I certainly don't want to diminish the importance of trusting him and all he
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:29.440]   promises to be for us, but in view of 2,000 years of church history and millions
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.400]   and millions of nominal Christians who would say they believe in him and have
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.120]   not experienced the slightest heart change or the slightest change in their
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:46.040]   lives and are lost, I wanted to stress the necessity of the kind of faith that
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:52.160]   really transforms people at the level of our deepest affections so that Christ is
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.800]   our supreme treasure, not just a belief ticket out of hell, which he is for so
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.800]   many people who think they're believing.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.720]   Paul says everything works together for the good of those who love God.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.480]   Love God.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.200]   Not just believe things about God.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.560]   He says at the end of 1 Corinthians, the very last verse of 1 Corinthians, "Those
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.120]   who do not love the Lord, let them be accursed."
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.440]   Not love the Lord, let them be accursed.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.320]   And James says, "The crown of life will be given to those who love him."
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.720]   And Jesus himself said, "Whoever loves mother or father more than me is not
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.920]   worthy of me."
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.280]   So I wanted to capture that.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:45.400]   And then I summed up the benefits of Jesus in saying, "Forgiven all."
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.880]   I didn't say, "Forgive all sins," just because I couldn't fit it in the 140
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.680]   characters.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:56.240]   "Forgiven all and have eternal joy in God."
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.720]   I wanted to say the negative side, all your problems, all your sins, all your
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.480]   failures are going to be canceled because Jesus died for them.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:12.120]   And then I wanted to capture the positive side, namely that once our sins are
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.120]   forgiven, we're not left in limbo.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:20.800]   We're given eternal joy that's not merely an extension of worldly happiness, but
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.800]   something far, far greater, namely joy in the all-satisfying God.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:34.760]   So Tony, I give you hereby formal permission that if I die before we get
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:41.200]   too many more of these recordings made, you may say, "John Piper said this
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.000]   should be his last tweet."
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.080]   Will do.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.960]   There it is, a preview of the capstone tweet.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.760]   And the most important thing in the universe, may we never get calloused
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.080]   to how awesome these things are.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.040]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.560]   And thank you for the question, Brittany.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.640]   And speaking of the most awesome things in the universe, we have just entered
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:07.840]   Holy Week 2017 as we move from Palm Sunday to Maundy Thursday, and then to
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.200]   Good Friday, all leading up to Easter Sunday, which is coming up soon.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.680]   It's my favorite day of the year.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:20.080]   This special week is set aside for us to focus our eyes and our attention on the
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.040]   death and the resurrection of our Savior.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.000]   And on Wednesday, we're going to do that very thing.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.280]   We're going to take a very candid look into the horrors of crucifixion from its
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.040]   historical descriptions and physical dimensions.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.560]   And then on Friday, we're going to look at Calvary from its spiritual meaning
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.920]   and theological consequences.
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.360]   That's coming up on Wednesday and Friday of this week.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.080]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.320]   Thanks for listening to the podcast and we'll see you next time.
