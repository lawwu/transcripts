[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280]   Here's a question we have received from a few different listeners recently.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.000]   They're asking this, "Pastor John, how can I fight bitterness in my life?"
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.040]   Well, that's not a foreign question to me.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:26.080]   Bitterness is usually owing to a deep wrong we've experienced, or lots of them, or even
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:33.440]   most painfully, the same one done over and over and over again.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:41.400]   And it's intensified usually by the fact that nobody really knows the depths of this besides
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.360]   you.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.720]   And therefore, the sense of injustice grows.
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.520]   If people only knew, and you can't tell them for various reasons.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:02.840]   And so it gets deeper and deeper from frustration and disappointment to anger, outbursts, to
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.200]   settled, deep, long-term bitterness.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.820]   And God really knows about this, and he really wants to help us with this.
[00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.520]   And there are four amazing things he tells us to embrace and believe and ponder in order
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.600]   to fight this.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.360]   And here's number one.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.360]   Let it sink in.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.440]   And by the way, all of these depend on God.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.040]   God makes all the difference here.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:43.920]   You can't manage bitterness successfully without God, because even if you decided, "Okay, I'm
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.480]   settling all accounts in this world on my own," you wouldn't be able to do it.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.000]   They'd slap you in jail, or something would go wrong.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.240]   You can't do it.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.400]   We cannot settle the accounts of those who've wronged us in this world.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.240]   If there's no God, there's no solution to bitterness.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.280]   So here's what God said.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:13.760]   Ponder and let it sink in that you don't deserve better than you got from God.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.600]   And I don't mean when I say that, that it was right that you got treated the way you
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.480]   did, or that they're not guilty.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.000]   They are guilty, and you shouldn't have been treated the way you were treated.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.080]   I don't mean to say that their injustice ceases to be because you don't deserve better from
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.320]   God.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.680]   All I mean is to say is we've all sinned, fall short of the glory of God, and we are
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.760]   by nature children of wrath.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:51.920]   Ephesians 2, 3, anything that happens to us from God's standpoint is not a wrong to us
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:52.920]   from Him.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.680]   It may be a wrong from others, and God disapproves of that, but it's not a wrong from Him.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.240]   And that doesn't solve the whole problem.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:08.840]   But wow, what a huge deal changer that is emotionally, because so much of my anger comes
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:17.080]   from failing to see before God Almighty I don't deserve any better from Him.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.480]   So that's my first thing.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.360]   Just know how little we deserve from God.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.840]   And now the second thing is, and realize and ponder and embrace how much we are getting
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.400]   from God, how much we've been forgiven, and at what cost.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:41.720]   This is the text that is directed directly at bitterness from Ephesians 4, 31.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.720]   Let all bitterness—and there's the word—let all bitterness be put away from you, and be
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:57.320]   tenderhearted and forgiving one another and kind because God in Christ forgave you.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:03.680]   And again in chapter 5, verse 1, be imitators of God, be loved, your love, you're loved
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.320]   as a child of God.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.320]   Walk in love.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.800]   In other words, don't walk in bitterness as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.440]   A fragrant offering, sacrifice to God.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:26.520]   So the point on this second thing is holding a grudge is a way of saying, "Christ acted
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:34.480]   toward me inadequately or foolishly when He didn't hold a grudge against me.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.480]   I have overwhelming guilt and I have overwhelming forgiveness.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.560]   How can I not extend it to others?"
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.080]   So that's the second thing.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.440]   And here's the third thing.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:05:00.720]   We need to embrace and believe and savor that in all the pain that's been done to us, God
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.320]   is working for us and not against us.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:14.040]   Second Corinthians 4, verse 17, "This light momentary affliction," and fill in the blank,
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.200]   how much has she hurt you?
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.840]   How much has he hurt you?
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.940]   How many wrongs have been done to you?
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.520]   "This light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.520]   comparison."
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.800]   That is simply amazing.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:34.400]   The question is, can we believe it, that sins against us, hurt done against us, injustices,
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:43.760]   slanders done against us, are not just something that we should forgive, but something that
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:52.320]   are actually, something that is actually producing a weight of glory greater than if they didn't
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.320]   happen to us.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:00.680]   And therefore, there's positive reason for why these things should not undo us and make
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.680]   us bitter.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.720]   God is using them.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.160]   And here's the last one.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.240]   It's surprising in one sense because people think, "Oh, maybe you shouldn't think like
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.400]   this."
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.700]   The fourth thing that God wants us to embrace and believe and savor is that nobody gets
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.240]   away with anything.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.100]   Nobody who's done you wrong will get away with it.
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:28.100]   You may think, and the world may think, they do because they're not in jail or because
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:37.120]   they haven't been, they didn't lose their job or they didn't have the accident.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:47.520]   And God says, "You need to relax here and let me be the one who takes vengeance."
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.960]   This is Romans 12, 19.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:57.520]   "Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:04.160]   For it is written, 'Vengeance is mine, I will repay.'"
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.440]   If your enemy is hungry, feed him.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.360]   You see what that says?
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:14.080]   If you have an enemy and he deserves to be punished and nobody's punishing him, nobody
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:21.120]   sees what he's done or nobody agrees with you that he's done wrong, God says he won't
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.780]   get away with it.
[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.260]   He won't.
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.960]   So you can relax because one of the reasons we feel bitter, I think, is this universe
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.760]   is not right.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.640]   It's letting people get away with murder and nothing is happening.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.640]   We scream bloody, "Justice has to be done here."
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:45.000]   And that text is to take away that anger and say, "Look, you're right.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.200]   Justice hasn't been done yet."
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.180]   And so here's the concluding surprising point.
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:08:00.400]   We don't need to seethe with vengeance because either the wrong done to us is going to be
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:07.720]   punished on the cross if those people repent, or it's going to be punished in hell more
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.680]   fully, more perfectly than anything we could do.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:18.960]   And in either case, we can lay it down and become Christ to those people, hold out forgiveness
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.480]   as long as they live.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.880]   And if they won't take it, God's going to deal with them.
