[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.080]   - Well, happy Thanksgiving week to those of you
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.680]   who listen to us in the States or in Canada.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.540]   Thanks for joining us again.
[00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.520]   Well, the Apostle Peter says of Paul's writings
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.500]   that there are some things in them
[00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.760]   that are hard to understand.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.760]   That's what he said.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.740]   That's true, but dare I also say
[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.240]   that this is also true of Peter.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.440]   There are some things in Peter that are hard to understand.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.280]   And speaking of hard texts and Peter's writings,
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.400]   we looked at 1 Peter 3.19 last time on Friday.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.060]   Today, we're back at it to ask,
[00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.560]   why does Peter say that we are saved through baptism?
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.080]   That's his claim in 1 Peter 3.21.
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.640]   Why does he say it?
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.880]   A listener named Josh wants to know.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.000]   Pastor John, hello, my question is this.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.960]   Why do we say that baptism does not save
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.140]   when 1 Peter 3.21 clearly says it does?
[00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.900]   So also writes a listener named Tom.
[00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.780]   Pastor John, hello, I sometimes meet people
[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.100]   from church backgrounds that say water baptism
[00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.660]   is necessary for salvation.
[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.940]   And they cite 1 Peter 3.21 to prove it.
[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.220]   I know that we are saved by grace through faith
[00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.260]   and not by any work of ours, including baptism.
[00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.500]   But could you help frame a response to those of us
[00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.100]   who engage with people from church traditions
[00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.420]   that believe in baptismal regeneration?
[00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.260]   - One of the great divides between, say,
[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.260]   the Roman Catholic Church and Protestant evangelicals
[00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.860]   is the way each understands how God's grace,
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.860]   God's saving grace, comes to the human soul
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.560]   in a saving way.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.700]   Protestants believe that God's saving grace
[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.060]   comes to the soul decisively by faith alone.
[00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.500]   In other words, the only act of the soul
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.460]   in the instant of new birth or in the moment
[00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.620]   of passing from spiritual death to new life,
[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.620]   in the moment of being counted righteous by God,
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.660]   being decisively adopted into his eternal family,
[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.220]   the only act of the soul in that instant,
[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.020]   which is decisive from the human side, is faith.
[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.180]   All other acts of obedience, all other acts of symbolism
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.500]   of what happens spiritually, all other acts of expression
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.280]   or demonstration or confirmation of that new birth
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.580]   or justification or adoption, all those other acts
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.220]   are the results of faith, made possible by faith.
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.300]   They are not part of faith.
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.020]   And so they are not the human instrument
[00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.020]   by which we are born again or justified or adopted.
[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.540]   Now, Roman Catholics don't see it that way.
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.540]   Rather, Roman Catholicism says that God's saving grace
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.700]   comes to the soul essentially through the physical acts
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.820]   of sacrament administered appropriately by a human priest
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.900]   or his authorized substitute.
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.000]   The two clearest examples of how this works
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.780]   are baptismal regeneration, that is, born again
[00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.720]   by means of the act of baptism,
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.100]   and transubstantiation in the Eucharist,
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.020]   that is, the bread and wine actually become,
[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.020]   get transubstantiated into physical body
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.740]   and blood of Christ.
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.060]   The actual bread you're holding in your hand
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.020]   is the very physical body of Christ,
[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.060]   the cup that you drink, the physical blood of Jesus.
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.060]   That's transubstantiation so that this physical dimension
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.660]   of imparting saving grace is preserved.
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.100]   So in baptism, the priest or his authorized representative
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.400]   applies the water to the infant,
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.400]   and by that ecclesiastical and sacramentally physical act,
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.380]   the child is saved.
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.700]   Here are the very words of the Roman Catholic Catechism,
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.700]   section two, chapter one, article one, paragraph 1213, quote,
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.740]   "Holy baptism is the basis of the whole Christian life,
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.540]   the gateway to life in the spirit,
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.140]   and the door which gives access to the other sacraments.
[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.180]   Through baptism, we are freed from sin
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.220]   and reborn as sons of God.
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.780]   We become members of Christ,
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.060]   are incorporated into the church
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.980]   and made sharers in her mission.
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.780]   Baptism is the sacrament of regeneration
[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.100]   through water in the word," close quote.
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.940]   Now, Protestant evangelicals would protest.
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.020]   That's where we get the name.
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.020]   We protest.
[00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.020]   No, we say, no, baptism does not free from sin.
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.780]   It does not cause one to be reborn.
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.380]   It does not unite to Christ in a saving way.
[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.260]   All of that happens through faith alone
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.700]   in the first instant of saving faith,
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.700]   after which all acts of obedience confirm faith
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.580]   and confirm new birth and confirm forgiveness of sins
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.420]   and confirm membership in Christ.
[00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.100]   Now, when Josh asks this question,
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.780]   he puts his finger on a couple of key Bible texts
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.820]   that underlie this evangelical position.
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.020]   For example, Galatians 2.16, he says, and I'll read it.
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.500]   "We know that a person is not justified by works of the law,
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.740]   but through faith in Jesus Christ."
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.740]   So we also have believed in Christ Jesus
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.300]   in order to be justified by faith in Christ
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.940]   and not by works of the law,
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.300]   because by works of the law, no one will be justified.
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.860]   Now, the reason this text is so important
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.820]   is that the context has to do
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.860]   with whether circumcision in that day
[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.260]   was effective for justification,
[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.820]   the way you would ask today if baptism.
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.220]   Was baptism effective for justification?
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.220]   We know that because Paul says in Galatians 5, 3, and 4,
[00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.100]   "Whoever accepts circumcision
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.180]   is obligated to keep the whole law."
[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.260]   You are severed from Christ.
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.980]   You who would be justified by the law,
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.500]   that is, by circumcision.
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.100]   In other words, the issue was,
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.140]   if the first act of true saving faith
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.180]   is the point at which justification happens,
[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.380]   then you simply can't add anything to faith
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.820]   to make it happen.
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.220]   You can't add circumcision,
[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.020]   and by implication, you can't add baptism.
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.380]   The decisive act of justification and adoption
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.860]   and new birth are performed by God
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.860]   through that first act of saving faith.
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:49.860]   Therefore, no other acts can make those divine acts happen.
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:55.980]   They've already happened at that first act of saving faith.
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.520]   So how then are we to understand baptism?
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.020]   Two passages.
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.140]   First the Colossians 1,
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.840]   and then we'll end up on the 1 Peter 1.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.500]   Here's Colossians 1, 11, and 12.
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.060]   "In Christ, you were circumcised
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.100]   with a circumcision made without hands
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.620]   by putting off the body of flesh
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.820]   by the circumcision of Christ."
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:26.860]   Now that, so far, is a picture of the new birth
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.120]   described as a kind of spiritual circumcision,
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:35.020]   the old, unbelieving, blind, rebellious self is cut away,
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:39.660]   and a new person comes into being, a new creation.
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.580]   Then he goes on now in the next verse, verse 12.
[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.500]   "Having been buried with him in baptism
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.660]   in which you were also raised with him through faith
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.340]   in the powerful working of God
[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.860]   who raised him from the dead."
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:57.100]   So here, baptism is described as an act
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:01.980]   signifying the new birth of burying the old self,
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.500]   rising from the water with the new self.
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.420]   What keeps us from misunderstanding
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:12.260]   that act as a physical cause of new birth
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.500]   is the phrase "through faith."
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.620]   You were raised with Christ through faith.
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.500]   In other words, Paul is jealous
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.900]   not to picture the physical act of baptism
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:29.060]   as the decisive cause of this new birth.
[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:34.060]   It's an acted out picture of what is happening,
[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.260]   and the spiritual effect of what is happening
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.880]   is through faith.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:44.300]   That's a really crucial phrase there in Colossians 2.12.
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:48.180]   Now, 1 Peter 3.21, I think,
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.860]   should be understood in the same way.
[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.700]   Peter has just referred to Noah's flood.
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.340]   And the rescue of eight people in the ark.
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.780]   And then he says, "Baptism, which corresponds to this,
[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.460]   now saves you not as a removal,"
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:10.580]   so he qualifies, as soon as he says "saves you,"
[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.340]   he qualifies this way,
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.260]   "not as a removal of dirt from the body,
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.220]   but as an appeal to God."
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:23.100]   Baptism as an appeal to God for a good conscience
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.820]   through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.300]   In other words, the waters of baptism
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.480]   are like the waters of Noah's flood.
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.420]   We are saved from that judgment.
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.740]   How?
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.620]   Peter clarifies and qualifies,
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.940]   lest we think it's the actual physical enactment
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.220]   of passing through the water that saves.
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.760]   He says, "Salvation happens not,"
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.260]   a big not, "as a removal of dirt from the body,
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.620]   but," and then he gives baptism a particular slant,
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:00.660]   "as an appeal to God for a good conscience."
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.500]   This appeal is an act of the heart
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:10.480]   looking away from itself and from all human instruments
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:15.780]   and calling on God, appealing to God for grace to save.
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:21.680]   This appeal is the heart's cry of faith.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.920]   That, Peter says, is the instrument
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.920]   that receives the saving grace of God.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.760]   The physical act of baptism is the parable,
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.120]   it's the drama, it's the emblem,
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:41.120]   but the reality of new birth is not physical
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.840]   and it's not received by physical acts.
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.500]   It's received by faith and faith alone.
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.920]   Then baptism follows as a beautiful,
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.080]   obedient enactment of the effects of faith.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.440]   - Yes, a beautiful, obedient enactment.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.280]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.520]   And speaking of 1 Peter 3.21,
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.180]   this text has popped up over the years
[00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:06.220]   and in two other interesting places in the podcast.
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:11.080]   One was on believer baptism and the mentally disabled.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.880]   That was APJ 305.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.700]   And then, should we baptize the dead?
[00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.800]   That's APJ 1019.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.640]   Check those out.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:24.640]   You can find APJs 305 and 1019 at askpastorjohn.com.
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.320]   Well, Thanksgiving is coming up Thursday
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.200]   and to prep for that,
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.280]   next time we are going to pray our way to Thanksgiving.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.740]   I'll explain more next time.
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.200]   I'm your host, Tony Reike.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.000]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:53.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
