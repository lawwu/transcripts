[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   Previously on Grace To You.
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.760]   What comes out of that kind of insanity that we're seeing now where you're not even dealing with reality?
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.920]   We're making laws to make the insane feel normal.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.520]   What comes out of that? All kinds of things that are not proper.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.020]   All unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil, insolent, arrogant, boastful inventors of evil,
[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.520]   disobedient to parents without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.520]   That's what you get in that culture of insanity.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.520]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:40.520]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.520]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.520]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.520]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.520]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.520]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.520]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.520]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.520]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:18.460]   I want to read just a portion of that chapter, starting maybe at verse 12.
[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.960]   "Now, Israel, what does the Lord your God require from you but to fear the Lord your
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:37.440]   God - " or, "to fear Yahweh your God, to walk in all His ways and love Him, and to serve
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.360]   Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and to keep Yahweh's commandments
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.660]   and His statutes, which I am commanding you today for your good.
[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.520]   Behold, to Yahweh your God belong heaven and the highest heavens, the earth and all that
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.400]   is in it.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.240]   Yet on your fathers did Yahweh set His affection to love them, and He chose their descendants
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.320]   after them, even you above all peoples, as it is this day.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.320]   "
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.900]   "So size your heart and stiffen your neck no longer, for Yahweh your God is the God
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.180]   of gods and the Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who does
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:30.100]   not show partiality, unlike politicians, and doesn't take a bribe."
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.200]   So wouldn't democracy fix all this?
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.200]   No.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.200]   No.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.200]   No.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.200]   No.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.200]   When God created man - I want you to follow this.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.520]   When God created man, I mean a functioning democracy; we had that.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.620]   When God created man, He created him in His image, right?
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.280]   So when you think about that, what do you think about?
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.980]   I think about it in three terms.
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:01.900]   He created him in God's image, and that first reality is that we can relate, relationships.
[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.140]   God is Trinity, right?
[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.080]   So the image of God is the ability to have God.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.080]   Relationship.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.080]   Relate.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.280]   Second is to create.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.280]   Not procreate.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.600]   Every living thing procreates, but to create something other than yourself.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:24.140]   This is where the image of God is most often seen in the massive amount of creation, from
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.440]   technology to art and everything in between that comes out of man.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.700]   Man has that component, not just to procreate.
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.080]   Monkeys don't write symphonies.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.960]   .
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.140]   But to write a symphony.
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.480]   But there's a third thing.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:49.200]   God created man in His image to relate, create, and dominate.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.200]   Dominate?
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.920]   Yes.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.100]   Back to Genesis, chapter 1.
[00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.920]   Man's king of the earth.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.640]   God said in chapter 1 of Genesis, verse 26, "Let's make man in our image."
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.840]   Here's the first thing He says, "According to our likeness, and let them rule."
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:16.000]   And He said it again in verse 28, "Let them rule."
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.460]   It's a Hebrew word, radah.
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.940]   It means to dominate by force.
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.080]   So Adam was created to be a king.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.500]   That's right.
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.960]   Adam was created to be a king.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.720]   And God's ultimate plan is for a king to reign forever, right?
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:49.200]   When men fell, when Adam fell, his crown was taken away, and Satan became king.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:55.960]   We now live, according to Acts 26, in the dominion of Satan.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:03.480]   But God promised that there would come a greater king who would crush Satan's head, but until
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.600]   he came.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:14.920]   After he came, all human history is the story of the usurper, the evil king, Satan, ruling
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:25.740]   the world through other evil kings, until the coming of the king of righteousness.
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.620]   Even the best of kings is evil.
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.820]   They're all fakes and frauds in some sense.
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.480]   They're all part of the kingdom of darkness, because the system is in the darkness.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:44.980]   We're grateful when there are rulers that are Christians.
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.720]   But the reality is that Satan rules the world.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.300]   The whole world lies in his power.
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.420]   And so it's just a series of evil kingdoms.
[00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:58.960]   They can be influenced by Christianity, but eventually they fall into evil, as we've seen.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.240]   All these kings are previews of antichrist, all of them.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.360]   Last week we saw that Saul was the king.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.900]   Saul was a preview of antichrist.
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.820]   The final world ruler.
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.300]   And John says, "Even now there are many antichrists."
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.700]   Any godless leader is an antichrist.
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:26.060]   History reflects that God designed kings to be the norm.
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.340]   And when a king is relatively good, there is blessing, because the government functions
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.240]   to punish evildoers and to protect those who do good, like Romans 13 lays it out.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:44.580]   But history reflects that kings, by God's design, are a common grace given to us, but
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:52.240]   there's no expectation that they would do what the righteous king will do, and that
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.720]   is to rule according to the will of God.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:03.420]   Evil kings then are more pictures of antichrist than they are of Christ.
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.120]   Few glimpses of pictures of Christ.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:14.820]   Even after God's own heart, 1 Samuel 13, along the way, God has some Christ-honoring rulers,
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:22.160]   but none of them can picture perfectly the final ruler, and nor can any of them crush
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.880]   Satan.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:33.000]   So even a believing ruler in a nation can't overpower the darkness, can't vanquish the
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   usurper.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   So the first one is the dream of the pagan king.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.760]   There's an illustration of this, two illustrations of this.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:51.560]   The first one comes in the book of Daniel in chapter 2, verse - well, we'll look just
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.060]   at verse 37.
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:08:01.760]   This is the dream that the pagan king has.
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.880]   Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.880]   He had these dreams.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:13.480]   "You, O king, are the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.560]   power, the strength, and the glory."
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.740]   Really.
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.900]   He was dreaming that about himself.
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.280]   That's a problem.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:30.820]   By chapter 4, he's spending seven years out in the field like a beast until he learns
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:34.560]   that the true God reigns.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:35.760]   You may think you reign.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.260]   You may think you reign as some king, but only God reigns.
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.460]   The New Testament counterpart to that is in the 12th chapter of Acts.
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:55.020]   One of the most serious warnings to evil rulers is the account of Herod, who was impressed
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.720]   with himself as Nebuchadnezzar was.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:05.640]   And so in verse 20 of Acts 12.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.440]   We are introduced to this event.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:16.920]   "On an appointed day," verse 21, "Herod put on his royal apparel, took his seat on the
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:23.520]   rostrum," or the judgment seat, "and began delivering an address to the people.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:31.700]   The people kept crying out, 'The voice of a God and not of a man!'"
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.980]   And immediately an angel of the Lord struck him because he didn't give God the glory and
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:35.520]   he was eaten by worms.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:41.460]   And he was eaten by worms and died.
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:42.420]   You know what I love about this?
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.060]   The next verse.
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:48.760]   "Let the Word of God continue to grow and to be multiplied.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.900]   The king will die; the Word will live."
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:58.320]   No matter what the king does, he will die and the Word will live.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:05.400]   When we come to the New Testament, we come to the introduction of the perfect King.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.760]   Our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:17.400]   And in Luke, chapter 1, as I told you last time, an angel comes to Mary, Gabriel, and
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.380]   says to her, verse 30, "Don't be afraid.
[00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.560]   You have found favor with God.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.520]   Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son.
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.740]   You shall call His name Jesus.
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.620]   He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High.
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:32.840]   And the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David, and He will reign over
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.280]   the house of Jacob forever.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.280]   And His kingdom will have an end."
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.940]   He will have no end.
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:46.000]   This is the enunciation that the true King has arrived.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:53.580]   And from then on, this is something very, very important to Luke.
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:58.680]   Chapter 8, verse 1, "He began going around from one city and village to another, proclaiming
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.680]   and preaching the kingdom of God."
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.960]   The kingdom had come because the King had come.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.800]   Chapter 9, "He called the twelve together, gave them power and authority over all the
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:13.720]   demons, healed diseases, and He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God."
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:21.760]   Verse 26 of that same chapter, "Whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, the Son of Man
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.720]   will be ashamed of him when he comes in His glory and the glory of the Father and of the
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.720]   holy angels.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.720]   And I say to you truthfully, there are some of those standing here who will not taste
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.840]   death until they see the kingdom of God."
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:44.440]   Chapter 10 and verse 9, "The kingdom of God has come near to you."
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:51.060]   Chapter 11, verse 20, "The kingdom of God has come upon you."
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:58.560]   Chapter 12, verse 31, "Seek His kingdom, and these will be added to you.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:04.720]   Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has chosen gladly to give you.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.720]   Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has chosen gladly to give you.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.720]   Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has chosen gladly to give you.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.720]   Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has chosen gladly to give you."
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.800]   In John 18, Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.580]   If My kingdom were of this world, My servants would fight.
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.560]   But My kingdom is not of this world."
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:26.200]   So who is in this kingdom, this kingdom of light in the midst of the kingdom of darkness?
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.020]   Those who are born again.
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:34.600]   John 3, Jesus said, "Unless you're born again, you can't see the kingdom of God."
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:40.400]   You have to be born from above.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:47.840]   To those who are regenerate and those who repent, repent, for the kingdom is here, Matthew
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.760]   4:17.
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:13:02.920]   For those who are humble and broken over their sin, hear these words of our Lord: "Blessed
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.480]   are the poor in spirit.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.860]   Blessed are the merciless, and the poor in heart.
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:07.860]   Blessed are the poor in spirit, and the poor in heart.
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:08.860]   Blessed are the poor in spirit, and the poor in heart.
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:09.860]   They shall be blessed, they shall be blessed.
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:10.860]   Blessed are the poor in spirit, and the poor in heart.
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:11.860]   Blessed are the poor in spirit, and the poor in heart.
[00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:12.860]   Blessed are the poor in spirit, and the poor in heart.
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:13.860]   Blessed are the poor in spirit, and the poor in heart.
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:14.860]   Blessed are the poor in spirit, and the poor in heart.
[00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:15.860]   Blessed are the poor in spirit, and the poor in heart.
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:16.860]   Blessed are the poor in spirit, and the poor in heart.
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:17.860]   Blessed are the poor in spirit, and the poor in heart.
[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:18.860]   Blessed are the poor in spirit, and the poor in heart.
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:19.860]   Blessed are the poor in spirit, and the poor in heart.
[00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:27.460]   for righteousness they know they don't have, they will be satisfied.
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.320]   Blessed are the merciful, they'll receive mercy.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.480]   Blessed are the pure in heart, they'll see God.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.320]   Blessed are the peacemakers, they'll be called sons of God.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.740]   Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs
[00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.960]   is the kingdom of heaven."
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.960]   What identifies you as someone in the kingdom is spiritual bankruptcy that comes to God,
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.740]   mourning over your sin, crying out for His righteousness, a righteousness that you do
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:58.200]   not possess, receiving that righteousness which manifests itself in meekness, mercy,
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:07.320]   purity, peace, and persecution.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.660]   It's also the dependent who are in the kingdom.
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.720]   Jesus said, "Unless you become like a little - " what?
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.720]   " - child."
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:39.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:50.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.720]   " - child, you will be like a little child."
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.040]   "What do you do to be delivered from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God's
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.440]   dear Son?
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.260]   You must be regenerate; that's a work from heaven.
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:13.580]   You must repent; that's a work that the Spirit does to convict you of sin and righteousness
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.480]   and judgment.
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:20.840]   You must recognize your spiritual bankruptcy and poverty, and that there is no righteousness
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:26.720]   which can at all satisfy God's requirement for a kingdom citizen.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.760]   You must understand that you are utterly dependent.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:30.720]   You have nothing to offer up.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.720]   You have nothing to offer God.
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.400]   You come like a child with no accomplishments.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:41.960]   But summing it all up, as Mark does, you have to believe the gospel.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:49.780]   You have to believe the gospel.
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.000]   The true kingdom is here.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.180]   Turn to the book of Revelation.
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:16:00.720]   We don't have time to go through all that's there, but a few minutes.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:07.320]   Look at chapter 1, verse 5.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.320]   Jesus Christ.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.400]   I love this.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:21.240]   Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the prototokos , the premier one from the dead,
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:30.720]   and the ruler of the kings of the earth, to Him who loves us and released us from the
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.900]   sins by His blood.
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:42.020]   And He has made us to be a kingdom, a kingdom of priests, which means we have direct and
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:53.560]   total access to the Holy of Holies, to His God and Father, to Him, the faithful witness,
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:58.180]   firstborn from the dead, the ruler of the kings of the earth, to Him who loves us and
[00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:00.720]   released us from our sins by His blood.
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:08.480]   To Him who made us to be a kingdom, to Him who made us priests to His God and Father,
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.900]   to Him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever.
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.660]   And everybody said, "Amen."
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.200]   This is our King.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:23.380]   This is our King.
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.440]   The kingdom is here.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.440]   The King is here.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.220]   He lives in His people.
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.720]   Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:37.140]   But the day is coming when He will come to establish His kingdom on earth.
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.940]   Listen to Revelation 11:15.
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:44.780]   "The seventh angel sounded, and there were voices, loud voices in heaven, saying, 'The
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:51.200]   kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ.'"
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.480]   Stop right there.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.800]   Right now, the kingdom of the world is not His, right?
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:00.720]   It's ruled by wicked kings.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.720]   Under the rule of Satan.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:08.460]   But the day is coming when the kingdom of the world, not just the invisible kingdom,
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:15.260]   but the visible kingdom, the world, will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ,
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:21.940]   and He will reign forever and ever.
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:30.720]   And then verse 18 says, "There'll be wrath when He comes.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:40.720]   He will destroy those who rejected Him."
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:45.720]   In the 19th chapter of Revelation, verse 11, the scene is even more dramatic.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:50.560]   "I saw heaven open, and behold, a white horse; and he who sat on it is called faithful and
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.480]   - " what?
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.980]   " - true.
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:57.320]   And in righteousness He judges and wages war.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.720]   His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.840]   He has a name written on Him which no one knows except Himself.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:08.480]   He's clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called the Word of God.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:12.940]   And the armies which are in heaven clothed in fine linen, white and clean, were following
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:14.600]   Him on white horses.
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:20.180]   From His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may strike down the nations.
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:24.040]   He will rule them with a rod of iron, and He treads the winepress of the fierce wrath
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.220]   of God the Almighty."
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:30.720]   And on His robe, and on His thigh, He's wearing a robe.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.920]   He has a name written.
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:33.920]   Say it with me.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:38.660]   "King of kings and Lord of lords."
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.980]   And every eye will see Him, will they not?
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:45.220]   Right now the King is invisible.
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:49.440]   The true King is here.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.440]   He lives in His people.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.820]   He lives in you and me.
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.040]   So how do we respond?
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.720]   If you're a non-Christian, let me say this to you: repent and be saved.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.480]   Believe in the gospel.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.480]   The King is here.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.400]   The kingdom is here.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:14.160]   Or Matthew 6:33, if you will, "Seek His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.680]   will be added to you."
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.680]   What things?
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:26.260]   "The things that you will ever need in time and eternity."
[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:30.720]   What is the reward of coming into the kingdom?
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.720]   Well, the truth will make you free.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:40.840]   Luke 22:29 and 30, "And just as My Father granted Me a kingdom, I grant you that you
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.900]   may eat and drink at My table in the kingdom."
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:50.680]   You get to be at the head table in the eternal kingdom, sit forever with Christ.
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.400]   Oh, not just at the table.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:21:00.720]   Revelation 3:21, "And sit down with Me on My throne as I sat on My Father's throne."
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:13.200]   So if you are non-Christian, the kingdom is here, the King is here.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.680]   Repent and believe the gospel.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.720]   Now what about a Christian?
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:24.460]   Well, you could take a cue from the apostle Paul.
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:30.720]   The apostle Paul, in his calling from God, showed us essentially what we all should be
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.860]   doing.
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:39.220]   He says to King Agrippa, giving his testimony in Acts 26, "I did not prove disobedient to
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:40.360]   the heavenly vision."
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:44.000]   The Lord gave me a vision, a call, and I was obedient.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   So what was that obedience?
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.400]   "I kept declaring both to those of Damascus first and also at Jerusalem, and then throughout
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.320]   all the region of Judea, and even to the Gentiles."
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:22:00.720]   From where I started in Damascus to the whole Gentile world.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.900]   I declared the message.
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.520]   And what was the message?
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:10.220]   That they should repent and turn to God.
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.460]   So you're a believer.
[00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:12.460]   What's your responsibility?
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:19.520]   The same thing, go into all the world and preach the gospel.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:24.380]   So we are unique people.
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:29.400]   First Peter 2, can't resist verses 9 and 10, "You're a chosen race, a royal priesthood,
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.720]   a holy nation.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:36.280]   You are God's own possession, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.780]   called you out of darkness into His marvelous light."
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.080]   That's why we're here.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.080]   Did you get that?
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:45.380]   "So that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.920]   into His marvelous light."
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:23:00.160]   And those excellencies are intolerable in the kingdom of lies, intolerable.
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:00.720]   You are aliens.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.380]   You're strangers.
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:15.200]   Keep your behavior excellent, even when they slander you, even when they persecute you.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:19.800]   So I would suggest that this is what we do.
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:25.720]   And blessed are you when you're persecuted, for that's evidence you're in the kingdom.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:30.720]   There's one other thing I want you to do.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:38.000]   I want to show it to you from 1 and 2 Timothy.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.740]   First Timothy, chapter 2.
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:46.220]   This is very straightforward now.
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:52.960]   First of all then, priority, I urge that in treaties and prayers, petitions and thanksgiving
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:24:00.720]   be made on behalf of all men - are you ready for this? - for kings and for all who are
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.720]   evil?
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:06.520]   So what are you supposed to be doing for the evil king and the evil empire and all his
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.520]   evil agents?
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.820]   What's your responsibility?
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:10.820]   Proclaim the truth and do what?
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:11.820]   Pray.
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:12.860]   What are you praying for?
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:14.620]   You're praying for their salvation.
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:18.720]   Verse 4, "God, it is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior to do that, because
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:22.300]   God desires all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of," what?
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:23.300]   The truth.
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.300]   So we have to proclaim the truth.
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.300]   We can't hedge.
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:26.300]   We can't compromise.
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.300]   We can't hide it.
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:28.300]   We can't soften it.
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.720]   We proclaim the truth.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:38.500]   We pray for the salvation of those in leadership.
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:47.720]   From the present and on down, 2 Timothy 2:26 - I'm sorry, 22 to 26.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.220]   "Flee youthful lusts.
[00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.880]   Pursue righteousness with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:58.100]   Be a part of the family of God, the fellowship of those who are calling on the Lord from
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.100]   a pure heart.
[00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.720]   Refuse foolish and ignorant speculation.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:09.580]   Don't get caught up in stupid arguments like evangelicalism is right now.
[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:12.760]   Refuse foolish and ignorant speculations.
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.920]   They just produce quarrels.
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:19.980]   The Lord's slave must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, able to teach, patient
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:25.460]   when wronged, with gentleness, correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:30.020]   may grant them repentance, leading to the knowledge of the truth, and they may come
[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:30.720]   to their senses."
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:35.600]   And escape from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will.
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.020]   So there we are again.
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:41.580]   We're going after people who are caught in the snare of the devil.
[00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:50.320]   That requires obedience to the commission, prayer, and the truth, because we're leading
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.400]   them to the truth.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.520]   We're bringing every thought captive to Christ.
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:00.720]   Let's pray.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:13.820]   I think of the words of Isaac Watts, who wrote the hymn that touches on this text in
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:19.760]   Revelation: "Now to the Lord that makes us know the wonders of His dying love, be humble
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:23.400]   honors paid below and strains of nobler praise above.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:29.760]   'Twas He that cleansed our foulest sins and washed us in His richest blood, 'twas He that
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:30.720]   makes us priests.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:35.240]   He that makes us kings and brings us rebels near to God.
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:42.420]   To Jesus, our atoning priest, to Jesus, our superior King, be everlasting power confessed,
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:46.960]   and every tongue His glory sung.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:52.580]   Behold on flying clouds He comes, and every eye shall see Him move, though with our sins
[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:53.960]   we pierced Him once.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:27:00.720]   Then He displays His pardoning love; the unbelieving world shall wail, while we rejoice in His
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.720]   glory.
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.720]   And the Lord will be with us in the kingdom of heaven, and we will be with Him in the
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.720]   kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:07.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:08.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:09.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:11.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:14.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:26.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:27.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:28.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:30.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:32.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:33.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:38.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:39.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:47.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:50.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:54.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:58.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.

[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:18.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:20.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:23.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:26.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:27.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.720]   And we will be with Him in the kingdom of heaven.
