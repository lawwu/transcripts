[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   Verses 4, 5, and 6. Verses 4, 5, and 6 in the eleventh chapter of the book of Numbers.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:16.800]   And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a-lusting. And the children of Israel
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:26.440]   also wept again and said, "Who shall give us flesh to eat?" We remember the fish which we
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:34.120]   did eat in Egypt freely, the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:46.240]   garlic. But now our soul is dried away. There is nothing at all beside this manna before our eyes.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:56.560]   As we come back to a consideration of this statement, this extraordinary statement, it is
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:04.000]   essential that we should hurriedly remind ourselves of the story. This particular point in the history
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.800]   of the children of Israel. Here they are, they've been brought out of the captivity of Egypt. They
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.280]   had gone down, you remember, in the time of famine when Jacob was still alive and Joseph was a man of
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.400]   importance down in Egypt. And they'd gone down and they'd settled there. But unfortunately a king
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.040]   arose who knew not Joseph. And he and his people began to become jealous of these children of
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:37.560]   Israel and began to maltreat them. They set them impossible tasks. They got them to make bricks
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.440]   without providing straw. They had to gather their own straw and they lashed them because they didn't
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.800]   produce the right number or produce them quickly enough. They were treated as slaves and as serfs
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.560]   and they were in a most pitiable condition. But God raised his servant Moses, you remember, and
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.440]   sent him to them. And they were delivered in the most amazing manner which is described in the book
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.160]   of Exodus. And they crossed the Red Sea. Their enemies attempting to follow them were drowned
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.320]   in the sea, Pharaoh and his host. And here are the children of Israel now on their way to a promised
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:20.720]   land, the land of Canaan. A land flowing with milk and honey. But almost as soon as they'd crossed
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:27.160]   the Red Sea they began to rebel against God and to grumble. And the result was that instead of
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.800]   going directly to Canaan they went a roundabout way and were kept in a wilderness for 40 years.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:40.200]   Now the story we are looking at is a story of what one of the things that happened to them in that
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.520]   wilderness. You remember that because it was a wilderness there was no food there. But God
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:54.080]   provided food for them by sending them this manna in a miraculous manner, bread from heaven, which
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:01.600]   came day by day. And here they are eating the manna and going on their journey. But you see,
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:10.320]   we are told that they, like this mixed multitude that was with them, began to lust and to ask for
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:18.920]   flesh to eat. And then they look back and they remind themselves of a part of their story in
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:27.360]   Egypt, you remember, and say, "Who will give us flesh to eat?" We see nothing before our eyes but
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:38.560]   this manna. Our souls, they say, are dried up within us. Now I'm calling attention to this
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:46.800]   episode, this particular story in the long history of these children of Israel, because, as I say,
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:55.640]   we have here such a perfect portrayal and representation of the case of mankind this
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:05.800]   very evening. The whole story is Israeli here, here's the whole trouble. Putting it as a principle,
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:14.840]   I'm putting it like this, that the real trouble with men and with the world this evening is that
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:24.800]   men does not realize the cause of his ills. That is the real explanation of everything else. Let
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:32.680]   me use the obvious comparison again. You can't hope to apply the right treatment unless you've
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:40.120]   made an accurate and a correct diagnosis. You can be pouring medicines into your patient,
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.320]   but if your diagnosis is wrong, your patient won't get better. The first thing, obviously,
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.920]   common sense, apart from anything else, dictates it. The first thing to do is to discover the cause
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.480]   of our ills. Now, it's because mankind on the whole doesn't even want to do that and objects
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:07.080]   to that and resents its being done that it is as it is. But still more, as I say, the world has
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.680]   never been so busy in treating itself and the Nostrands advocated and the panaceas proffered
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:19.240]   are almost endless and they're being multiplied year after year. Legislation comes, act of
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.600]   Parliament after act of Parliament. Never have we spent so much money on social services. We've
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:35.520]   got societies to do every conceivable thing to men and yet look at the state of the world. Look
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:44.920]   at the state of society this evening. Now, I say the whole thing is so tragic because it's so
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:51.680]   unnecessary. It isn't as if we didn't know what the real answer is because it's been here before
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.960]   us all the years in this book which we call the Bible. That's what the Bible is about. It's not
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:06.680]   a book of poetry. It's not a collection of novels. The Bible claims to be a revelation from God about
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:15.360]   this very thing, about man. What's wrong with him, what alone can put him right? That really is the
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.360]   whole business of the Bible. A lot of history and all sorts of things here, of course. Oh,
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:28.120]   that's but an illustration. The Bible takes us as we are and it describes the setting. It gives us
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.800]   the genealogies of kings and princes, tells us how they fought with one another, how they got
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.360]   married and had children and died and were buried and so on. Of course, that's all here. That's just
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:45.640]   the filling out of the picture to show us that it is real life and living. But the message you see
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:54.280]   is one and it's this. There is only one cause of all our troubles in every generation and it's
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:07:01.120]   always the same cause and there is only one cure. Now that's the essence of the biblical message.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:08.720]   So I'm calling attention to these three verses because they do give us the diagnosis in a
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:17.080]   particularly clear manner. Of course, I could give you endless texts. I vary my reading every
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.080]   Sunday night in order to show you how different parts of the Bible are really saying the same
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:27.760]   thing. But the value of this is that it's a picture which we can't very well forget, can we? We look
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:32.560]   at these children of Israel and we see them weeping and in their misery and wretchedness
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:39.280]   and we hear them crying out and saying, "Who shall give us flesh to eat? Our souls are dried up within
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:52.600]   us, dried away." Now here I say we are given the diagnosis particularly and I've been unfolding
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:59.960]   it to you. I've shown you how we are shown here very clearly that man as the result of sin has
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:07.720]   become a creature of lust, something that suddenly grips him. He talks about being master of his
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:14.480]   fate and captain of his soul and yet he's the victim of any hoarding or anybody he may meet
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:24.560]   on the street. He's the slave of sin under the dominion of Satan, fellow lusting. How true it is.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:31.840]   Can you give a guarantee of what you're going to be like during a day? You may wake up in a
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:37.880]   very equitable kindly frame and mood. Can you guarantee me you'll be like that by midnight?
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:46.800]   No, no. Passions, desires, lusts, anger, temper, they come as it were. They're within us. Men,
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:56.280]   because of sin, have become a creature of lust, desire, inordinate affection, craving. It's all
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:05.480]   here. And then last Sunday I was indicating how sin has likewise had a devastating effect upon
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:12.720]   men's mind. And this of course is terribly serious because of the importance of the mind. What a
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:18.920]   wonderful instrument the mind is, ah yes. But because of sin the mind doesn't function as it
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:26.480]   should. The Bible says that the sinner is a fool. That's its word. A fool. A foolish man. A man who
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:32.400]   doesn't think straightly and clearly. And I tried to show you how sin affects the mind in various
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:39.360]   terrible ways. But still you see we're not at the end of the story. This is the thing really that I
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:47.400]   am so anxious to bring out, that sin is such a profound thing. So protean in its manifestations.
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:55.400]   You know sin has really ruined men. It's ruined the soul. It hasn't merely affected him just in
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:03.280]   one place. The whole personality has been affected. Body, mind, and spirit, heart, understanding,
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:10.640]   everything. The whole man is a ruin and a mass of corruption. That's the biblical statement about
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:17.120]   men in sin. And so I have to go on with my story. I'm simply looking at these three verses and
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:24.480]   observing its particular statements and I see more and more this perfect exact diagnosis of
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:31.880]   the whole condition of modern men. Now then look at it. Here are these children of Israel
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:39.720]   marching on their way to the promised land. And what do I see? I see a picture of misery.
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:49.640]   The children of Israel also wept again. They're miserable and wretched and unhappy and they're
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:57.320]   weeping and they're sorry for themselves. They seem to be in a terribly bad case. What's the
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:05.480]   matter with them? Why are they like this? Look at that miserable crowd. Look at them in their
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:10.360]   wretchedness and their weeping. Why are they like that? That's the question isn't it? What's the
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:15.240]   matter with them? Ah now then let's remember that as we're looking at them, we are looking at the
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:25.040]   modern world also. Look at the modern world. Look at men as he is today. Stand on the street
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:35.280]   corners of life and listen to the still sad music of humanity. Do you hear the wail? Do you see the
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:43.400]   weeping? Do you see the unhappiness? You see it even in the newspapers which would have us believe
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:50.040]   that life is marvelous and perfect and full of joy and you see these grinning smiling faces looking
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:57.120]   at you. But look at the story, read what's true behind the scenes and see the misery and the
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:05.480]   unhappiness of it all. The man killed was it last Sunday and oh the tragedy. The woman to whom he
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:11.200]   was going to be married suddenly loses him and then the next day the picture of the man's wife
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:22.840]   who's still alive with the two little children. That's life. The apparent romance. Romance? It's
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:30.280]   misery, it's wretchedness, it's abomination. The world has never been so miserable, so sad,
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:36.200]   so unhappy. Can't you see the weeping and the wailing? What's the matter with it? It's like
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:41.960]   these children of Israel there in the desert weeping again and crying out in unhappiness.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:48.160]   I say the question is what's the cause of it? What's produced it? Why should they be like this?
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:13:03.840]   And you know the answer? All our difficulties, all our troubles, all our vexations are of our
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:14.120]   own creation. We ourselves produce them and are responsible for them. Now then I must establish
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:21.000]   that mustn't I? Well it's not a difficult thing to establish that, it's all put here in a phrase.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:31.040]   Here's the phrase at the beginning of the sixth verse. "But now they say our soul is dried away,"
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:40.760]   which can be translated like this, "our strength is dried up." That's what they said about
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:47.000]   themselves. What's it mean? Well this is their complaint. They said here we are marching through
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:56.160]   this wilderness and our strength is dried up. We're in a bad state, we're in a bad condition,
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:03.280]   we've got no energy, we've got no power, our legs are dragging and they're heavy. Why? Well
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:09.160]   because we are underfed, our nourishment isn't sufficient, our strength is dried up, our soul
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:16.200]   is dried away. Can't we have flesh from somewhere? We're on an inadequate diet, we're not being dealt
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:26.000]   with fairly, and we are miserable and we are weeping. That's what they said. And what are we
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:34.440]   to say about that? Well there's only one thing to say about it. It was a lie. There's no other word
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:43.520]   that really is adequate. It was just a simple barefaced lie. Their soul was not dried up within
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:54.080]   them. Their strength had not dried up. The manna was an adequate diet. You see later on God is able
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:59.000]   to challenge these people and there was no reply to make. You will find it in the eighth chapter
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:07.240]   of the book of Deuteronomy. This is how I read, "Thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:13.840]   thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee and to prove thee to know what was
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:19.240]   in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments or no. And he humbled thee and
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:24.160]   suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with the manna which thou knewest not. Neither did thy
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:30.640]   fathers know that he might make thee know that men doth not live by bread alone, but by every word
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:37.480]   that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth men live." Now listen, "Thy raiment waxed not old
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:48.480]   upon thee, neither did thy foot swell these forty years." The diet was adequate. There was no
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:55.080]   deficiency. The vitamins were all present. Their feet had not swollen with scurvy or with anything
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:16:00.800]   else. They were fed on manna alone and yet they were kept perfectly physically fit. There's what
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:06.840]   God tells them at the end and they can't dispute it. It's the simple truth. This statement which
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:20.640]   these men make here is a barefaced lie. It wasn't true. The diet of manna was adequate and sufficient.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:33.640]   Well then you say, "Why do they say this?" Ah, this is the whole story. Somehow or another,
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:38.640]   as I've already indicated, you can't say how these things happen like this. Ultimately it's the devil.
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:48.000]   They began to think about it and to talk about it, and the next step was, you see, that they
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   persuaded themselves about it. Now until they had done that, everything was perfectly all right and
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.120]   they were going on quite well. The manna was quite sufficient and at first they were astonished at it
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:06.720]   all, and so they might have gone on to the journey's end. But somebody, I suppose, one day
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:14.320]   began to say, "What, still manna? Can we go on living on manna? This isn't enough, obviously."
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:18.480]   And they all began to talk and they persuaded one another, and then of course they began to feel
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:26.000]   ill. Well, all right, I'm very glad you do laugh at it. It's the sort of thing we do, isn't it?
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:35.720]   Let me show you how ludicrous the thing is, but this is a bit of psychology. You may have done
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:42.600]   this, some of you, as a prank which you play upon one another. Two or three of you decide to say to
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:49.120]   a common friend, "Let's tell him when he comes in that he's not looking very well." And you keep it
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:57.240]   up, and before long the poor man is beginning to feel ill, quite definitely. Well, now you see,
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:06.320]   that's precisely what mankind as a whole does in sin. Let me give you my final proof of this.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:12.760]   Why do you think I read to you of that portion out of the third chapter of Genesis at the
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:19.680]   beginning? Well, because it is the classical statement of this very thing. Here's the story,
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:29.760]   isn't it? God made men out of nothing. He then made woman out of the men. And there He places
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:38.000]   the men and the woman in paradise, in the Garden of Eden. Perfect. Couldn't have been better. What
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:46.400]   an idyllic life it was. What an ideal life. They just had to pick the fruit and eat it. Men didn't
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:52.280]   have to plough the earth and sow and roll and harrow and all the rest of it. He didn't have
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:59.120]   to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow. Not at all. He was in paradise. You can't imagine
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:05.800]   better conditions. Everything was absolutely perfect. And men was enjoying it and enjoying
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:14.120]   his life with God. He had no complaints at all. Everything was really perfect. And then the devil
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:24.280]   came in. Came into paradise, remember? Came into this perfection. And he said to Eve, "Look here,
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:31.400]   you must be absolutely blind. Are you content with a life like this? Do you think this is good
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:38.720]   enough?" Hasn't God said something to you about not eating that tree there in the center? Which
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:43.880]   is the best of all the trees and He's preventing you. Do you think this is life? Is this really
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:50.880]   good enough for men? And he began to sow this seed, you remember? And to suggest this. And you
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:56.680]   see Eve believing it began to feel unhappy. And she began to feel that this life in the Garden of
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:01.440]   Eden wasn't after all what she'd thought it was. Indeed she began to feel it was very wrong and
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:06.480]   very miserable. And Adam agreed. They were being kept down. They were hemmed in. They were not
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:13.120]   being given a chance and an opportunity in the same surroundings. The insinuation was injected
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:17.880]   and put in and they accepted it. And they really began to feel miserable. They felt they were not
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:29.480]   being dealt with fairly. And so they ate of the prohibited fruit. And so the punishment of God
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:36.640]   came down upon them. You remember the contrast with paradise, don't you? Cursed is the ground.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:43.240]   Man is cursed. He's got to earn his bread now by the sweat of his brow. There were no thorns and
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:49.120]   briers and thistles there before. They come now. Disease enters in. Everything goes wrong. And
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:55.320]   life becomes what it's been ever since. And why did it all happen? Man has brought it all upon
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:21:07.960]   himself. And you see how it happened, don't you? It was because he believed the lie about God and
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:19.360]   about God's way of life. He turned paradise into wretchedness and misery because, I say,
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:29.160]   he believed this lie. It wasn't true. It was no more true than this statement was true. And that
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:37.000]   is the whole cause of man's wretchedness and his unhappiness. He brings it all upon himself.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:43.200]   Now let me give you a New Testament counterpart to that. There's a perfect story in the New
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:51.400]   Testament that says exactly the same thing. It's the parable of the prodigal son. Had you ever
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:22:00.720]   thought of it like that? Here you see is a father with two sons, obviously people of wealth, living
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:06.160]   in a comfortable atmosphere and surroundings, everything all right. And the father, very happy
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:12.480]   of the two boys, quite happy. And so it might have gone on. But one day you see this younger boy
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:17.960]   suddenly got an idea. I don't know where he got it from. It may have been that somebody said it to
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:24.000]   him. Somebody may have come on to him as the devil came to Eve and said, "Look here, you think that
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.640]   this sort of life is good enough for you? Are you going to spend the whole of your life in this sort
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:34.840]   of circumstances surrounding? After all you've got your father on top of you and your brother.
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:39.680]   You're the youngest son, remember? Now there had been no trouble like that before, none whatsoever.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.840]   They lived a life of love. But the suggestion was put into him, "You're being kept down. You know
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:47.880]   you're not really having a chance. If I were you, I'd clear out of this. You ask for your share of
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:53.000]   the estate and you go across the sea to that new land and there you'll really do big things and
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.360]   make a name for yourself." Now he'd been perfectly happy until that moment. But you see the seed was
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:03.000]   sown, the insinuation was made, and he believed it. And he really began to feel he was having a
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.680]   very hard time. And he said, "I must get out of this. I must really go to some place where I can
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:17.400]   have scope for my ability." And off he went. And you see we are given the picture of that poor boy
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:27.320]   sitting there in the field with the swine and trying to satisfy himself with the husks that
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:36.960]   the swine were fed on, wretched, down and out in rags, forsaken, forlorn, miserable, unhappy. Why?
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:47.320]   Because of the lie that he believed about his father and probably his brother and the life at
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:55.040]   home. He brought it all upon himself. It was because he said things he shouldn't say about
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:01.120]   the life he'd been given that all the wretchedness and the misery and the unhappiness followed.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:11.040]   There it is, you see. It's given us at the very beginning of Genesis. You find it running right
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:17.200]   through the Bible there. Our Lord pictures it in that peerless parable. My dear friends,
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:22.440]   what am I talking about? Well, I'm giving you the explanation of why life is as it is at this
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:28.360]   moment. Do you know why anybody's unhappy and wretched in the world tonight? I'll tell you.
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:36.560]   It's all due to the fact that mankind has forsaken God and forsaken God's way. It's
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:42.120]   because mankind has believed that lie and believes there's something better and that God is against
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:47.640]   us and that God is withholding and that we ourselves can make a better job of it. That's
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:53.800]   why things are as they are. It's always the same. They begin to weep and to cry. They said,
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:59.360]   "Look here, our souls are dried up within us." And you can persuade yourself of that and you
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:04.280]   begin to feel ill and you begin to feel weak and you begin to feel that you've lost your strength
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:09.480]   and your power and there's something radically wrong with you. But it's all self-suggestion.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:20.080]   It's all a lie. It isn't true. Well, of course, accompanying that is the second thing. And the
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:30.360]   second thing is this. It's because, you see, man doesn't realize that the trouble is in himself
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:40.240]   and seeks it elsewhere that all this happens to him. Now take these children of Israel at whom
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:48.280]   we are looking. It never dawned on these people for a moment that their misery and the thing that
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:54.320]   made them weep was the cause of all that was really in themselves. That never entered their
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:26:01.760]   minds, did it? They never looked at themselves at all. It was their circumstances and so on.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:07.360]   They never realized that it was in themselves. Exactly the same with that prodigal once more.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:13.400]   He never really examined himself. "Ah, the suggestion was it was the father or the brother,"
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:24.280]   and so on. And so it never occurred to them, it never dawned upon them that their real trouble
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:33.440]   was in themselves. In that wrong attitude to God, in that rebellion against God, in that something
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:41.560]   within them that rises and accepts the suggestion of the devil, this feeling, I say, that God's way
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:47.240]   is against us and that if we only go our own way all will be well. They never looked into themselves.
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:54.760]   Now that is still the essence of the whole problem, and that in turn leads to certain
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:27:02.120]   results, and I just want to hold them before you. What are these results which this dual
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:13.200]   trouble invariably leads to? Well, the first is, as I've just been hinting, that finding ourselves
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:22.040]   weeping and miserable and unhappy. The first thing we always do is to blame the circumstances.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:29.000]   "Here we are," said these people, "we are feeling miserable and we haven't got our strength. What's
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.680]   the matter with us?" "Well, it's this manner. It's always manner, and there's nothing but manner. Now
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:40.400]   if only we had flesh, but we haven't got flesh. Can't somebody give us... Ah, we remember it in
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:46.760]   Egypt, how we ate the fish which we did eat in Egypt freely. It was even given us for nothing.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:51.120]   We didn't have to pay heap any for it, and the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks,
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:28:02.480]   and the onions, and the garlic." But now, circumstances. I don't want to keep you with
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:10.040]   this, but look at yourself for a moment, my friend, and examine yourself. If you're unhappy
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:19.160]   and miserable, have you not been saying to yourself, "Yes, it's that other person. It's
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:29.880]   these other people." Or, "It's my conditions. I'm like this because of these things that have
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:39.120]   happened to me. I've never had a chance. Why should God do this to me?" Isn't that the tendency?
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:46.560]   We always blame circumstances as these people blame circumstances. There's wilderness,
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:52.440]   nothing growing, no animals can feed here, so there's no flesh for us. How can a man be right
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:57.040]   and happy and live as he'd like to? Here in this wilderness, it's this wilderness. We must do
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:08.200]   something about this. Can't somebody do it? Circumstances. Oh, I mustn't stop, I say,
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:17.040]   at this point. I've made it so often from this pulpit. I'll just put it to you once again in
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:25.680]   that profoundest bit of analysis I think that Shakespeare ever produced. "The fault, dear
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:38.160]   Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves that we are underlings. It isn't the surroundings,
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:43.800]   they were perfect in the Garden of Eden, they were perfect in the home of the prodigal son.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:50.240]   God made the world perfect. Ah, it isn't the circumstances, the surroundings,
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:58.440]   and the conditions. It's not there. It's not the environment. It's man himself."
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:06.800]   Yes, but you see, that brings me to my second one, which is this. The second consequence of
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:13.840]   this fundamental error, this believing of the original lie, is that man is guilty of
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:24.160]   this complete failure to face and to examine himself. Now, I've tried to show you how these
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:31.040]   people here, these children of Israel, never did that for a moment. It never dawned on them,
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:35.240]   you see, that the trouble was in their own hearts. It didn't occur to them to say,
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:39.240]   "Well, now wait a minute. Why are we feeling like this now? We've been on this manner now
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:43.160]   for some time. Why didn't we feel like that last week or the week before?" Oh, no,
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:47.320]   they didn't stop to think that. They didn't stop to say, "Well, now, we are feeling different today.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:51.680]   I wonder whether we are feeling different because we are different." That never occurred to them.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:55.840]   "We are feeling different," they said, "because circumstances and surroundings are different."
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:06.280]   They never looked at themselves. It's still the cause of our troubles. The main trouble with the
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:17.840]   sinner is that he never looks at himself. He never examines himself at all. Indeed,
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:24.800]   he resents bitterly any suggestion that he should do so. He regards it as annoying and
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:31.080]   as insulting. The natural man always objects to preaching about sin. "Oh," they say,
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:35.360]   "in a world like this, you're surely not going to spend all this time in analysis and investigation
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:39.400]   and in holding us up like, 'Oh, why don't you tell us about the love of God?'" They want to
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:44.160]   rush to the remedy. They dislike sin. Why? Well, it means self-examination.
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:59.200]   Are you unhappy and miserable and very sorry for yourself? And have you been just blaming
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:03.920]   other people or things or circumstances and surroundings? Let me ask you a simple question.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:11.000]   Have you really stopped to examine yourself at all? Ah, but we don't, do we? You see,
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:18.920]   what sin does is this. It makes us protect self. And we are all experts at protecting ourselves.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:24.520]   We erect a camouflage around ourselves. We'll go out, we'll invite people in, we'll read,
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:29.600]   we'll look at this or that, we'll do anything rather than spend an evening with self and
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:36.360]   rarely face ourselves honestly. Of course, it's a very painful procedure. I admit it. I agree,
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:42.080]   it's extremely painful. It's a rather unpleasant sight that any one of us gets when we rarely look
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:53.000]   at ourselves in a mirror of truth. And that's why we don't do it. We defend ourselves and we are
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:00.160]   experts at it. If somebody makes an accusation, there's always a good explanation. And then,
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:05.440]   of course, we go on and we pity ourselves. "Oh, I like to look at these people here. They're so
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:12.720]   typical of men in sin. The children of Israel also wept again. They say, 'I'm having an awful time.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:23.880]   What have I done to deserve this?'" Can't you see yourself? "Pity poor me. Nobody understands me.
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:30.440]   Nobody's kind to me. They're all so selfish and they never think of me at all." Isn't this the
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:36.280]   language? Oh, how we weep to ourselves and how we coddle ourselves and how sorry we are for
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:41.360]   ourselves. What a hard time we are having. How cruel life has been to us. Oh, I'm not
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:50.520]   caricaturing it. God knows we are all guilty of this very thing. We never suspect that our
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:59.360]   troubles are mainly due to ourselves. You see, the Apostle Paul puts it all so perfectly in the
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:07.400]   second chapter of his epistle to the Romans, where he says that people who see a thing so
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:15.960]   plainly and so clearly in others don't see it in themselves. We spend our time, he says,
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:23.280]   either accusing or excusing one another. Now, we say, "Look at that man. Look what he's doing."
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:28.400]   And we're doing exactly the same thing. "Ah, but we, of course, this is different, you know." You
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:34.080]   see it in the other and you condemn him. The same thing is true about you and you don't see it.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:45.800]   Take the classical instance of David. "David saw that other man's wife and he coveted her. And he
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:51.880]   brought about the death of that man, he murdered him in order that he might have his wife. And he
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:57.720]   thought this was very good. Yes, but God was displeased and he sent Nathan the prophet to him,
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:03.480]   and Nathan being a very clever man knew it was no use challenging David directly. So he said,
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:08.080]   "King, I've got something to tell you. Something terrible has happened. You know, there's a man
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:14.360]   there," he said, "who's got a number of sheep. And there's another little man who's got just one
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:20.520]   pet lamb. And some friends came to visit this wealthy man. And instead of killing one of his
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:26.040]   own, do you know, he actually took the pet lamb of that little man and gave it there as a feast
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:30.760]   for this friend who'd called on him. What a terrible thing," said David. "Look here, get hold
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:34.920]   of that man. We must punish him in the most condign manner. This thing is unthinkable."
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:42.360]   David saw the thing very plainly and clearly when it was put in terms of sheep and what another man
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:52.080]   had done. And then Nathan the prophet said unto him, "Thou art the man. That's precisely what you
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:36:00.800]   did when you took Bathsheba to yourself." Oh, but my dear friends, you see, this is the thing we
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.120]   won't do. As these people never looked at themselves, they said, "It's there. It's the
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:09.920]   lack of flesh. It's outside us. It's environment." They were all right. They were not having a
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:17.160]   chance. Circumstances were not being kind to them. And so I say the world today evades the real
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:29.760]   problem which is in us. It is our rebellion against God. It is our coveting. It is our
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:36.760]   lusting. It's this evil that sin has produced in our minds. Here it is laid open before us.
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:42.880]   And then the next step is this, of course. It invariably leads to ingratitude towards God.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:49.280]   Look at these wretched children of Israel. Here they are. Do they praise God? If they had gone
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:53.600]   to God and said, "Well, oh God, you were very kind to us when you brought us out of Egypt,
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:58.440]   and you've conquered our enemies, and you've brought us through the Red Sea, and we are free
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:02.920]   men, but you know we're getting a little bit tired of the manor. Can't you graciously..."
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:10.760]   Not a word of praise, not of thanksgiving. As if God had never done anything for them at all.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:18.400]   They just say, "This is too bad. Nothing but this manor. Who will give us flesh to eat?"
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:27.160]   Not a syllable of thanksgiving, not a word of praise to God. Isn't that mankind in sin?
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:37.120]   You let a war come, and you'll find people who never mention the name of God saying,
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:41.840]   "If there is a God, why does he allow this sort of thing?" Or they'll say,
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:49.600]   "Look at that spastic child. Is that your God?" Men and women talk about God only to
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:56.360]   complain against him. Never a word of thanks, the base ingratitude of sin.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:04.600]   Have you ever thought of that, my friend? You see, these children of Israel forgot all about
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:11.840]   the goodness. They forgot all about the blessings. Subject as they were to the lust,
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:20.360]   and thinking only for the moment, and forgetting the past, they blame God and express this
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:31.240]   complaint. But what of you, my friend? What of you? Do you count your blessings? Do you
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:39.920]   thank God for his goodness? Do you know that it's God who's given you life, and the health
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:47.080]   that you've enjoyed, and food, and clothing, and strength, and all the best and the most
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:53.560]   glorious things in life? God-ordained matrimony, and the home, and the family.
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:59.360]   These are not human inventions. Men haven't created these institutions. It's God. They're
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:05.640]   all the free gifts of God, and he showers upon these things upon us day by day, the
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:11.400]   rain and the sunshine. Do you know if he withheld them, the world would starve? They're all
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:18.360]   the gifts of God, and all the blessings you enjoy. When did you last thank him?
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:31.000]   You're the base in gratitude of sin. And that leads to the last thing, which is this.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:37.960]   This whole attitude to God, of course, ever leads to the materialistic outlook. They said
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:43.400]   if only somebody gave us flesh, all would be well. That's the one thing that's needed,
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:54.000]   flesh to eat, materialism. I leave you to work it out for yourselves.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:01.240]   But isn't it a terrible and an appalling thing to realize that there are people who
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:10.680]   quite honestly think and believe that if only they had plenty of money to buy themselves
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:17.360]   a house and a motor car and a television and various other things, that they'd be perfectly
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:26.200]   and completely happy? Isn't the impression being given that the real needs of men are
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:33.920]   all material? And if only we can have safety and security. Don't misunderstand me. Yes,
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:39.620]   but I say, if you begin to live on them, if you say that's all, if you say if only we
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:50.160]   had these, then all will be well. I say that's the road to hell.
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:58.360]   And that is why that last hymn we sang was so perfectly right and so perfectly true.
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:06.080]   We ought to thank God that thorns and briars remain in life to remind us that this isn't
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:15.840]   the only world and that men liveth not by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:21.320]   out of the mouth of God. Do you really believe that if you could wave or somebody else could
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:28.040]   wave a magic wand and give you all this money, what if you won that football pool after all
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:37.920]   and got your seventy-five thousand, would all be well? Is that really enough for men?
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:46.920]   Can men be satisfied merely by material things at their best and their highest? Oh, that's
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:54.320]   the tragedy, you see, of men in sin. Having left God and having believed the lie, he's
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:42:00.880]   got his whole view of life all wrong, it's all askew, and therefore his diagnosis is
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:10.760]   wrong. He thinks he knows his need and that's it, materialistic, if only flesh.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:20.600]   And thereby I say he betrays his ignorance of the running sore of his soul, the disease
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:26.400]   of his spirit. He doesn't know that if you made him a multimillionaire he'd still be
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:31.480]   miserable, there'd still be something he hasn't got, something he still wants. If he has everything,
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:36.720]   all the flesh of the universe, there would still be a lack and a need. Why? Well, because
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:48.920]   he's made for God and nothing less can satisfy him. But there he is, weeping and miserable
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:56.400]   and unhappy and sorry for himself and commiserating with himself for the hard time he's having
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:04.080]   and excusing himself and not realizing the truth about himself. What can be done with
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:14.280]   him? What does he deserve? What's your verdict on him as you look at him there in the children
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:26.640]   of Israel? Does he deserve anything but punishment and hell? I say he doesn't. And I say the
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:35.000]   same thing about myself and about the whole of mankind. We've all rebelled against God,
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.440]   we've spurned his vice, we've believed the lie and the insinuation of the devil against
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:45.840]   him, we've ridiculed his way of life, we've turned our backs upon it, we've brought our
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:53.680]   misery upon ourselves, and then we turn round and blame God. We are croods, we are useless,
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:44:03.720]   we are worthless, we deserve nothing but hell and perdition. What can be done for him, I
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:13.040]   ask? Is there any hope for him? Well, it's my privilege to tell you again that there's
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:22.000]   only one hope for such a cad, such a creature, and it isn't in him himself, it isn't in his
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:33.600]   world. There's only one hope for him, and that is the God whom he's offended. The great
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:41.880]   and glorious God with his eternal heart of love, who after men had believed the lie and
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:47.320]   had admitted this hatred of God into his heart and had begun to complain about the paradise
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:57.080]   in which he'd been placed, the God who after that even, after it all came down to them,
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:05.320]   had not only announced the punishment to them, he did announce it, don't forget it, but also
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:14.880]   announced and promised the way of deliverance and of salvation. There is only one hope for
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:26.840]   men in sin, and it's this. Christ died for the ungodly. While we were yet without strength,
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:35.280]   while we were enemies against God, in that wretched, foolish, mad position, God sent
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:50.760]   his Son to die even for us there. Christ died for the ungodly. His pure body was broken,
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:59.200]   his blood was shed. He suffered the agony of the garden of Gethsemane. He suffered the
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:08.800]   agony of the cross, all for you and for me, rebels as we are, fools as we are, cats as
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:21.280]   we are. He died for us, suffered all for us and for our sins. God sent him to do it in
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:29.360]   order that we might be pardoned and forgiven, in order that we might be given a new heart
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:37.440]   and a new nature and a new outlook, in order that with this new nature and this new outlook
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:45.280]   we might not only desire God and enjoy him, but enjoy his way of life and thank him and
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:51.640]   follow his Son and go after him, come what may, through the wilderness of life, through
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:47:07.040]   death itself. Our only desire now being to know him and to please him in all things.
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:17.960]   Oh, my dear friend, have you believed the lie? If you have, go and confess it to God
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:26.840]   immediately. Cast yourself at his feet, as it were. Acknowledge your sin, your stupidity,
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:36.760]   the enormity, the arrogance, the rebellion of it all. Go to him, repent, and believe
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:46.400]   him when he tells you that he sent his Son to die for you and that as the father of the
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:55.760]   prodigal received that foolish boy back again and ran to meet him and embraced him and put
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:48:05.160]   upon him this gorgeous robe. So, God will receive you and adopt you into his family
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:12.920]   and begin to shower his blessings upon you. Go to him. Amen.
