[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.240]   Hey Cal, my name is John. I am a pastor at a local church plant outside of Los
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.920]   Angeles. I'm also a graduate student in theology, getting a PhD. My question is
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:23.360]   this. My reading load on a weekly basis is enormous, to the point that scheduling
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.240]   two blocks of deep work a day just isn't enough to get all the reading done. That
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.680]   said, I was hoping you could give me some advice about how I might schedule more
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.000]   than two significant sessions of reading per day in order to get all the work
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.160]   done. Thanks for all the help. Well, I don't think you're gonna be able to get
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.640]   much more productive deep work done in a day. If you're already doing two long
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.400]   sessions of hard reading and you have another job, I think that's probably a
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.600]   realistic limit for your time available and a realistic limit for what your mind
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.320]   can actually do. As I've talked about before, when it comes to really cognitively
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.800]   demanding deep work, so the work that's really straining you, professionals who
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.760]   do this type of work really have two sessions they do a day and that's it. So
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.400]   this came out of the study of professional violin players that was
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.200]   cited in Anders Ericsson's work and picked up and popularized in Malcolm Gladwell's
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.600]   work where they were studying the best violin players at this particular
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.440]   Academy in Berlin, and among other things were trying to characterize their
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.720]   practice habits, and they would do one intense session, break, another intense
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.200]   session, and that's it. What they did not find, for example, in this study was that
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.000]   there was a dose effect where more and more and more practice led to
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.160]   more and more accomplishment with the violin, because there's only so much you
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.360]   could do at that level of intensity and you might be there. So what do we do
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.640]   about this? Well, you probably need to get more strategic about your reading. The
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.120]   very first book I wrote was called "How to Win at College" and the very first
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.640]   chapter in that book is called "Don't Do All of Your Reading." What this means is
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.760]   that at the college level, the grad school level, you have to learn how to be
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.760]   more strategic with your reading. You have to know when to go in and really go
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.480]   slow and understand the argument and where you need to skim, where you can
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.760]   skip an assignment, and where you need to dwell on an assignment. The amount of
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.680]   reading assigned in a typical program in the humanities tends to be more than
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.160]   can actually be done for most people, so you have to learn how to do some of the
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.280]   strategic slow down, speed up, go deep, go shallow. The other thing you probably
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.880]   have to do is, to the extent that's possible, be more strategic about your
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.240]   course selection. People don't think enough about this. There's a real
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.480]   masochism out there in higher education where people just put in place on paper
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.480]   the course load they want to do. "You know, I want to get this degree fast and
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.280]   these are all good courses. Let me challenge myself and yeah, this is five
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.840]   courses instead of four and these three are notoriously hard, but I want to be
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.480]   the type of person who just goes after it and gets really hard courses and
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.840]   gets things done early." And then you get to the reality of it, like, "I can't keep
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.160]   up with this amount of work." And I tend to push the other way. Keep your schedule
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.440]   as easy as possible that still keeps you on track for graduating on whatever
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.480]   schedule you want to. And if that is still too hard, then maybe you need to
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.160]   adjust that schedule and say, "I'm a full-time pastor. I'm gonna have to add
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.040]   another year to my studies here because I can't take a full course load and do
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.680]   my full-time job." That's fine too. This is not laziness. This is actually giving
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.000]   yourself the cognitive space required to actually do the work that you're doing
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.200]   well. So keep that in mind too. You may have given yourself a heroic schedule
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.400]   because you like on paper being the type of academic hero that has those hard
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.760]   schedules. But in the end, no one cares about how hard your schedule is. No one's
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.240]   going to give you a gold star for taking a fifth course instead of four. No one's
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.160]   going to pat you on the back because you took three really hard courses at the
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.320]   same time. No one is going to say, "This is why I'm going to hire you because you
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.520]   had such a hard demands on your time." People just care about what's the degree,
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.900]   what are your grades, how well did you do at the thing you did best. So keep your
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.800]   load reasonable. Be strategic about your reading. Combine those two strategies, and
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.920]   I think you'll find that you have a little bit more breathing room. Don't try
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.800]   to add a third session. Don't try to be doing seven hours of deep work a day.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.400]   It's just not going to work out.
