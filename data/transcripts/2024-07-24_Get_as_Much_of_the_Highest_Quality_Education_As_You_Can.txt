[00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.160]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.000]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.480]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.480]   My name is Josh Rasheeds.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.480]   I'm your host.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.520]   Today we continue our financial goals that everybody should set series with goal five,
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.920]   which is simply this, set a goal to get as much of the highest quality education that
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.360]   you possibly can as soon as you can.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.860]   Set a goal to get as much of the highest quality education that you possibly can as soon as
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.860]   you can.
[00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.160]   I'm going to expand this concept very carefully in today's podcast, explain to you why it
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.700]   is so foundational.
[00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.240]   But a quick review of this series so far, goal one, I encourage you to get a job because
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.120]   once you have a job, you have income.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.140]   And as soon as you have income, you start to be able to make important decisions.
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.960]   Number two, I encourage you to spend half your income and save half your income.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.520]   The goal being to accumulate investment capital, extra money that you can use for even things
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.400]   like we're going to talk about today.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.060]   Goal three, I encourage you to give away 10% of your income, to do it systematically in
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.560]   order to strengthen your giving muscles, to increase your own happiness and self-confidence
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.800]   in life by recognizing that indeed you are quite well off, and to prepare you to make
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.000]   a difference in the world by helping you to hone in on the things that are most important
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.960]   to you where you want to make the biggest difference.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.560]   Then goal four was I encourage you to begin a job or a career that has the long-term potential
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.280]   to get you to be a top 20% income earner.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.400]   Encourage you not just to take some random job, at the beginning, first one was, okay,
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.000]   take a random job, that's fine.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.800]   But then I want you to think about where your job might lead.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.960]   If you don't see the potential for your current job or your current career track to take you
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.940]   to be a top 20% income earner, then I want you to reconsider that career track and try
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.280]   to find a job or a career track where that is a reasonable possibility in the fullness
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.280]   of time.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.440]   Now today, goal five, get as much of the highest quality education that you possibly can as
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.780]   soon as you can is probably going to be your pathway to accomplishing goal four.
[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.720]   Even if it's not directly related, this goal still needs to stand strong.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.000]   There are a couple of reasons that education is the foundational thing that we look at
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.520]   in order to think about long-term financial impact.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.480]   The first reason is that education allows you to move into fields that have a much bigger
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.360]   long-term opportunity than those without.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.280]   Think back to earlier in the series where I talked about the basic value of human labor
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.000]   and I talked about how when you're beginning, if you're not highly educated, you don't have
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.840]   any particular skills, basically what you're selling is your physical ability.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.560]   I use the example of digging a ditch.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.960]   All around the world, we don't see this much in the United States anymore, but all around
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.080]   the world, I run into people who are quite literally just selling their physical daily
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.080]   labor.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.240]   You'll run across an old man or an old woman that's passing down the street with a broom
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.640]   in his hand, picking up garbage, sweeping the streets, things like that.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.240]   These are the most poorly paid jobs in the world and without education, there's not really
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.040]   much of an ability to advance from them.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.740]   These jobs are useful.
[00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.360]   They should be treated with honor.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.000]   We should honor those who do them because they're doing something that we need done
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.880]   and that may be the limit of this person's capability or the limit of this person's ambition.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.860]   We want to honor the work itself.
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.320]   There's nothing dishonorable about it because it's honest labor that contributes to the
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.000]   good of society, but it's very hard to build a long-term financial plan on that.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.300]   Again, there's no shame in these.
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.400]   Most of us start with this.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.480]   I remember one of the earliest jobs that I had that was similar to this was when I was
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.480]   in middle school.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.240]   I worked for a friend of mine who was a tile contractor and I worked as a helper on a tile
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.240]   job.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:44.440]   And this job is working as a helper laying tile is basically the same thing as is just
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.480]   simply selling your basic labor.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.900]   You don't start with anything skilled.
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.720]   You're not actually laying tile.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.780]   All you're doing is using your physical strength.
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.320]   And so I remember day one of that job, I was put to work with a chipping hammer, chipping
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.560]   up a floor, lobby of a big condo building that we were retiling.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.640]   And so basically all you need to do is hold the chipping hammer and use it to chip up
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.820]   the floor, swing the sledgehammer to chip up the floor and it's basic labor.
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.960]   Then from there, you move on to something where you get a little â€“ well, the next
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.100]   one is usually you do carrying jobs.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.440]   So I carried many boxes of tile from by the street where the truck dropped them off to
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.100]   the job site and positioned them in the bathroom.
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:28.280]   Carried many buckets of thinset and mud depending on whether we're laying tile or marble.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.720]   Carried many buckets of those kinds of things, just basic raw labor.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.800]   And it's again work, it's useful.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.800]   I'm glad I had the job.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.800]   I learned a lot from it.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.160]   But there's no opportunity for it until you start being educated.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.100]   So education begins with something like here's how you mix up a bucket of thinset.
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.440]   And if you're a helper, then somebody gives you a lesson.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.980]   Here's the basic dry ingredients.
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.520]   Here's how much water you have.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.520]   Here's the mixer.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.080]   Mix it up and carry buckets of thinset or buckets of mud to the tile setter who's actually
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.320]   laying the tile.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.440]   So now you start to have a little bit of skill.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.520]   And skill grows over time and by the end of the summer, I was grouting floors.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.000]   I was doing some polishing work and refinishing work, various things where you start to build
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.680]   a little bit of skill.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.760]   But in order to build skill, you have to get educated.
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.040]   You have to be taught how to do that.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.160]   Now my advancement over the course of that summer job was very slow and all of the education
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.160]   was informal.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:31.720]   It was all based upon the instructions, just the daily instructions from the tile mechanic
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.400]   whose helper I was.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.800]   And you could advance in that regularly little by little.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.480]   But now I want you to imagine that I actually engaged in some process of education.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.260]   I myself was not smart enough to do this at the time.
[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.200]   But imagine that I had gone to the library and checked out a couple of books on laying
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.280]   tile.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.960]   Imagine that in today's world, I had gone to YouTube and I had found some various tutorials
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:01.100]   on YouTube and I had started to take some lessons and some classes on different aspects
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.760]   of tile setting.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.080]   And then imagine at some point my boss gave me a chance to do something that was a little
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.200]   bit complicated and I did it well because of the education that I had taken, the knowledge
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.200]   that I had learned.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.140]   And as soon as I had an opportunity to practice those skills, I practiced those skills, then
[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:20.240]   now I could make much faster progress in my career.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.240]   So this is a very simple example of the importance of education.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.240]   If you will go and become educated in the thing that you're doing and you'll get as
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.640]   much of the highest quality education that you possibly can as soon as you can, you will
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.060]   get much faster financial results.
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:43.260]   Imagine if I weren't simply a middle schooler with a random summer job, but instead I were
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.320]   say a young guy who had just graduated from high school.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.760]   And I had actually gone and instead of just signing up as a helper, I had gone and taken
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.980]   some classes from some kind of tile setting institute or coursework.
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:08:00.540]   And I had practiced and I was trained in some way in order to be an effective tile setter.
[00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.280]   Well now I would have gone into the career world and I would have been able to be hired
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.660]   as some form of actual tile mechanic rather than just a random helper who had to work
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.260]   his way up slowly.
[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:15.960]   And that jump in pay from being educated as a craftsman would have made a big difference
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.820]   to my financial results as say a 20-year-old, assuming I started at 18, instead of just
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.220]   simply starting as a helper and working my way up.
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:28.940]   I would be years ahead of the 18-year-old who just started off as a basic helper if
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.940]   I had actually gone through some courses.
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.920]   Incidentally, I think in the United States, this is something that we don't generally
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:39.180]   do well in training people systematically with coursework for the skilled trades.
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:44.340]   I'm a great admirer of the European system in Switzerland and Germany and other nations
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:48.880]   where being a craftsman or a builder is actually a skilled trade.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:54.100]   And there are many high quality schools that go through and systematically teach the skills
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:09:00.620]   to young apprentices so that they can enter into their field at an earlier age with actual
[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.340]   skills that have been proven in a classroom environment.
[00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.780]   We'd like to see more of that happen in the United States because the informal method
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:11.140]   of instruction where you're just relying on your boss to teach you something and show
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:16.360]   you something suffers from a whole host of problems in terms of an actual method.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.360]   It can work.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.820]   It certainly has worked throughout history, but in order for it to work well, you need
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:27.540]   a very educationally focused master, meaning a leader, the mechanic, the person that you're
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:32.180]   working under, and that person needs to have the skills and the ability to actually train
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.180]   you.
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:37.100]   And there aren't many, I didn't ever experience that there were all that many people who are
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.840]   very good at training.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.900]   There were some and when you find those people as a young guy and somebody who's actually
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.940]   willing to take the time and explain to you what's happening, it's incredibly rewarding.
[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.880]   But having to pick everything up the hard way doesn't really, really work.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.460]   So I use this as a practical example just to say that if you get as much of the highest
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.840]   quality education that you possibly can as soon as you can, you will be able to make
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.920]   faster progress in a career.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.140]   You can get hired at a higher initial rate.
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:09.700]   Because of your higher levels of education, you'll probably make faster progress and be
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:15.340]   more productive than many other people, which allows your financial income to grow faster.
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:20.180]   And all of this, especially if you're saving half your income, all of this will compound
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:23.160]   more and more with the fullness of time.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:28.700]   Getting more education also puts you into a different direction in terms of potential
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:29.920]   careers.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:39.120]   The person who has the most education is usually going to be being steered relatively automatically
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:44.580]   towards the highest income careers because of the cost of getting that education.
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:49.860]   As we think about various professions and you go down just industry level professions
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:56.620]   and you rank them based upon their current earnings, the standard earnings for that profession,
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:04.340]   they rank pretty neatly in terms of the actual amount of education needed as compared to
[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:09.620]   the average income of the participants in that career field.
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:16.540]   The more education required or the more schooling required in order to function in this career,
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:20.500]   the higher the long-term earning potential.
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:26.260]   And if you look at the total lifetime earnings of various careers, you can see that the payoff
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:31.180]   of investing in education is extremely high.
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:35.260]   Education puts you on the fast track in everything.
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:43.900]   And the most highly educated person in a job or in a career or in a career area is going
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:50.360]   to have the basic tools and equipment to go the fastest towards the long-term goal, towards
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.980]   long-term success.
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.900]   Now you notice about 40 seconds ago I stuck in a word that I hadn't used until the about
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.020]   11 minute mark of this podcast.
[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:04.900]   I inserted the word schooling alongside the word education.
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:10.460]   I want you to note that the word education has a different connotation for you than the
[00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.540]   word schooling.
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:19.260]   You should not necessarily conflate education with schooling.
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:26.380]   School is normally an extremely valuable source of education, but it is certainly not the
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:32.220]   only source of education, and it is not the only source of education that matters.
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:35.300]   So these words are not synonymous.
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:41.940]   When I refer to education, I am referring to learning, to your gaining knowledge, to
[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:49.740]   your building skills, to your enhancing your abilities through active, focused learning.
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:55.940]   Generally speaking, I like the idea that education is something that you must get for yourself.
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:01.740]   It's something that you must do for yourself, that education basically should be thought
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.460]   of always as self-education.
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.860]   The only real education is self-education.
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.700]   That's not necessarily the same thing for school.
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:17.540]   You can go through school and you can be poorly educated because you chose not to learn anything.
[00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:22.940]   Alternatively, you can go through school and you can become highly educated because you
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:27.020]   were determined to educate yourself through school.
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:30.620]   Schooling can be forced, education can't be forced.
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:37.900]   So in the context of this podcast, I'm referring to education from any source, but that doesn't
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:42.140]   indicate that you should be opposed to schooling.
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:48.820]   On the contrary, the standard option that you should choose is as much schooling as
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.500]   quickly as you can of the highest qualities.
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:56.900]   Let me restate the basic thesis of this show and let's see if this holds true.
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:02.220]   Your goal should be to get as much of the highest quality schooling as you possibly
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:05.180]   can as soon as you can.
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.860]   Is that true?
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:11.900]   I don't think it's as true as it is when I stated it in the term of education, but I
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:20.620]   think it is generally true because schooling is mostly the most direct pathway to education.
[00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:30.820]   It allows you to learn very efficiently because for most fields, most jobs, the person who
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:38.500]   teaches you your school classes is a person who has been carefully focused on how to teach
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.500]   those the most effectively.
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:47.260]   The difficulty here comes from the fact that the one type of schooling that we all have
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:54.540]   some experience in to some degree or some knowledge of is usually government K-12 compulsory
[00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:55.900]   schooling.
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:01.340]   That statement that I said probably doesn't hold true for all of our schooling experiences.
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:06.500]   Most of us have had some really great teachers who put enormous amounts of thought into helping
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.020]   their students to learn as much as possible, inspired learning.
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.940]   Most of us have also had some pretty subpar teachers who really didn't accomplish those
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.500]   goals and that's probably inevitable in that kind of schooling.
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:22.660]   Once you get out of K-12 though, depending on the school that you go to, things can change
[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:23.660]   very differently.
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:29.700]   I remember one school experience that I had was when I went through my insurance school,
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:35.100]   when I first got a life health and annuity insurance license in the state of Florida.
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:41.980]   It's a 40-hour school requirement in order to get your basic license and the teacher
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:45.780]   who taught that class was a wizard at teaching.
[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.500]   He was so good.
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.980]   He had taught the class for years.
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.300]   He had had a long career as a life insurance agent.
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.700]   He'd retired from that and he'd taught this class for years.
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:16:02.260]   His entire 40-hour class was perfectly scripted to hit every time mark.
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:10.020]   He had carefully crafted his message to teach important lessons from the industry, to teach
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:15.260]   important tools and sets of knowledge as well as to pass the exam.
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:20.060]   And when I finished his school, his 40 hours worth of class, his 40-hour school, I felt
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:23.340]   like it was one of the most productive experiences of my life.
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:27.940]   I came away from that school basically saying, "Every adult should take a 40-hour life health
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:28.940]   and annuity class.
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.680]   This is amazing levels of education.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.180]   This is wonderful."
[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:36.860]   And it was vastly more efficient for me to go through his class than for me to go out
[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.340]   and try to put together a big stack of books.
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.820]   I've routinely found this to be a differentiator.
[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:47.220]   If you talk to just simply an average life insurance agent versus an average personal
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:53.220]   finance enthusiast, I think that the average life insurance agent, by virtue of having
[00:16:53.220 --> 00:17:01.620]   gone through the basics of an insurance school, has a better broad-based understanding of
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:07.020]   the world of financial products and rules and laws and things like that than does the
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.580]   average personal finance enthusiast.
[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:15.740]   That's not to say that the finance enthusiast may not also have areas of strong specialization.
[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:21.380]   But usually what happens when you're purely self-educated is that you tend to gravitate,
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:25.860]   you tend to orient your education towards the things that interest you the most, and
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:30.580]   you tend to neglect the things that don't interest you, which means that you often have
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:37.140]   holes in your knowledge base that you wouldn't have if you went through some form of mandatory
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.140]   course of instruction.
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:44.140]   And having exposure to that allows you to ask better questions.
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:52.700]   And so the ideal thing is to bring these two things together, is to have the exposure to
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:58.380]   what is taught in a school of some kind, where you're basically forced to learn everything,
[00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:02.700]   and then supplement that with your own real focus on the things that interest you the
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:03.700]   most.
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:07.860]   Similarly, and just you staying in the life insurance space, I went through various schools
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.980]   for preparing for a certified financial planner exam.
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:15.940]   I went through schools for preparing to take all the various securities exams for securities
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.140]   licenses.
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:22.420]   And time and again, I found those schools to be enormously productive experiences, to
[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:23.940]   be extremely valuable.
[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:28.900]   And every time I went through one, I came away really impressed with the experience.
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:33.140]   Every industry and every career has some version of these schools.
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:38.940]   And because when you sit down to teach a class, you generally automatically make a comprehensive
[00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:44.100]   â€“ the person who does it usually knows the field very well and sits down to try to say,
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:49.460]   "I need to make this class serve everybody with all of the mandatory minimum levels of
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:50.940]   knowledge that this person needs."
[00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:56.060]   And the experience you have going through schools is very productive.
[00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:00.220]   Even though in today's world, we love to dump on the value of a college education,
[00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:02.420]   I think this basic principle still holds.
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:06.100]   I think it still holds even for a standard high school model.
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:09.620]   As my children are headed towards high school, I've been spending a lot of time looking
[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:15.100]   at my state's various requirements of what they need to know, what they need to study.
[00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:19.820]   And at its core, when you look at it, you say, "This is a pretty good base level of
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:24.040]   knowledge that most people would be well-served if they knew this."
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.040]   Same thing with college.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:29.180]   If you have a college degree in a certain subject, the degree-granting institution is
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:34.060]   going to make sure that you have gone through and learned all the different fields that
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:35.420]   are necessary.
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:40.340]   And that is one of the reasons why this traditional school model that we all live in still has
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.060]   significant levels of value.
[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:47.500]   And so I think it is fair to say that you should get as much of the highest quality
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.900]   schooling as you possibly can as soon as you can.
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.820]   I don't bristle against that statement.
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:20:01.080]   Very specifically, let's note this back to the normal trend of decisions that especially
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.700]   young people make.
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.100]   Should you finish high school?
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.260]   My answer is yes.
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:10.700]   You need a credential of some kind to indicate finishing.
[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:15.060]   High school is one of those funny things where we know that it's significantly important,
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:20.940]   but it's hard to defend all of the applications of its importance.
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:26.160]   When you go on from high school, the high school credential basically becomes irrelevant.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.820]   I don't think I have ever shown anybody my high school diploma.
[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:36.400]   I obviously must have submitted it to the college that I attended initially, but since
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:42.460]   then I've never seen or gotten a high school transcript or showed my high school diploma
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:44.460]   to anybody.
[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:47.780]   And I think that there are many people who don't have any form of high school diploma
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.980]   that can generally go through life pretty well.
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:57.860]   But what happens is if you don't have some form of completion certificate for high school,
[00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:01.100]   you reach a certain point where you want to take a certain job and they say, "High school
[00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.980]   diploma required," and all of a sudden you can't do it.
[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:09.780]   And yet, if you just focus on it, it's not that hard to finish it when you are younger.
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:16.620]   You've always known just how smart she is, from her early aptitude for science to her
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.700]   first big discovery.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:23.220]   And now that graduation is right around the corner, she can continue to excel.
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.980]   America's Navy offers her the chance to get hands-on training and experience for the career
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.660]   she was born for.
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:32.740]   From chemistry to computer science, aviation mechanics, or ship propulsion, it's the smart
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.580]   way to get ahead.

[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.540]   America's Navy, forged by the sea.
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:45.060]   I can't think, other than significant disability of some kind, in which case you could still
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:51.020]   get a diploma of some kind, I can't think of a scenario in which I don't think a teenager
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:54.020]   should finish a course of study for high school.
[00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:58.460]   The course of study doesn't have to be huge and comprehensive, it doesn't have to be nothing
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:21:59.860]   but AP classes.
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:03.140]   It may be as simple as completing a GED.
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:07.660]   For the non-Americans, that's basically a, I think it's grade equivalent diploma, I don't
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:13.620]   remember what it stands for, but it's basically a quiz or a test for certifying that you have
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:18.460]   learned what is expected for an average high school student.
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.420]   So completing some kind of test can be fine.
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:25.120]   And so if I'm working with a student, and let's say that I'm coaching a 14-year-old
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.540]   who says, "I think high school is going to be an enormous waste of time," well, my answer
[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:32.720]   is, "Okay, let's do your GED, pass your GED, and be done with it."
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:37.020]   But you need to have something that indicates your academic ability, unless you have some
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:42.220]   significant level of disability that needs to be dealt with.
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:50.600]   So you should finish high school, and we know that, in general, the average person is going
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:55.560]   to earn significantly more with a high school degree than without a high school degree.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.660]   We're always tempted, and I especially have this temptation, we're always tempted to go
[00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:05.020]   to the extreme example, the brilliantly smart person who became a multi-gazillionaire without
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:08.320]   ever finishing high school, and say, "Well, this proves the rule."
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.320]   But in fact, it doesn't.
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:13.120]   I'm sorry, "This proves that the advice of finishing high school is not good."
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:16.280]   But in fact, it doesn't prove it in any way.
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.600]   It's the exact opposite.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.640]   In order to succeed without a high school degree, you've got to be super, super brilliant
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.540]   and super, super competitive and have all kinds of other benefits, whereas if you just
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:32.040]   finish high school, you can be perfectly normal and average and do well in life.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.200]   So you should finish a high school degree.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.520]   Should you go to college?
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.180]   My answer is, for most people, most probably.
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:41.200]   If you're asking the question, then you probably should go.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:47.440]   And I think that you're generally not going to regret having a college degree in the fullness
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.000]   of time.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.640]   Even though I have regrets about how I went about it, I do not regret notâ€”excuse me,
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:24:00.440]   I'm all twisted upâ€”I don't regret going to college.
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.260]   There are other pathways other than college.
[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:06.920]   But if you're the kind of person who's asking the question of, "Should I go to college?"
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:11.160]   the answer is probably yes, you should.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:15.560]   Now that we've arrived at basically undergraduate degree, let's talk for a minute about why
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:20.760]   I think this is pretty obviously sound advice.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:25.560]   There are options available that will fit almost any kind of person, with almost any
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:29.020]   kind of interest, of almost any kind of budget.
[00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:34.360]   If the only option was, "Should I go to college at this very difficult school to get into
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.880]   that's going to charge me $50,000 a year?"
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:42.280]   I couldn't be so casual in saying that everybody should go to college.
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:48.720]   But since there are many options, including very low-cost options, including much less
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:53.840]   difficult options, including degrees that emphasize all kinds of different skills, some
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:58.660]   of them emphasizing liberal arts skills, some of them emphasizing practical skills, with
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:04.160]   all kinds of degrees, there is something that you can find that will fit your basic skill
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.080]   and basic inclination.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:13.720]   And once again, if you have a college degree, you will find that life is a lot easier for
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:14.720]   you.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:18.640]   You'll find access to more jobs, more careers than you otherwise would find, and there are
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:23.360]   plenty of more options available to you, which in the fullness of time will lead to your
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:31.320]   earning more money and make it more straightforward for you to get that top 20% income, job or
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:34.720]   business or career that you want to look for.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:39.680]   If I'm coaching somebody who has a college degree, I can with confidence put them on
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:47.140]   track to that top 20% job, top 20% of income level job.
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:51.920]   If I'm coaching somebody who doesn't have a college degree, I don't have the same level
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:52.920]   of confidence.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:57.240]   I believe it's still possible, but I don't have the same level of confidence.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.280]   So this holds true.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:04.200]   You should get as much of the highest quality education that you possibly can.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:10.920]   Now let's take that apart here for a moment and talk about highest quality.
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:15.520]   Highest quality is a subjective term, but a meaningful one.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:23.160]   There are many careers that don't need any kind of four-year bachelor's degree.
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.480]   For example, let's say that you wanted to go and work as a paramedic.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:30.680]   Well, you don't necessarily need a four-year bachelor's degree to do that, but you do need
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.720]   EMT school and you do need paramedic school.
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:39.760]   And so you should go and get as much of the highest quality paramedic schooling and training
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.220]   as you possibly can.
[00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:45.840]   Highest quality matters in almost any field.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:52.160]   The highest quality education is usually going to be some of the more expensive options.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:27:00.580]   The free market tends to shake out demand based upon pricing.
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.640]   So if you go out and you're looking at different schools, let's say you want to become a
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:07.320]   pilot and you've never flown anything, if you go out and you're looking at the cost
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:13.000]   for different flight schools, the highest quality flight schools are probably going
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.920]   to be those that are in the top quartile of cost.
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:23.320]   Maybe not the most expensive, and maybe there's one out of let's say the top 10 best flight
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:29.220]   schools that really is not all that great and they're just trying to puff up their cost
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:30.400]   as compared to the value.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:35.680]   But in general, what things cost pretty much relates to the basic value of them.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:42.400]   Those of us who sell services or products, we try to make a reasonable and informed decision
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.500]   of the costs to charge for things based upon their value.
[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.080]   Not always, but most of the time.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:56.840]   And there are usually a whole host of benefits associated with the higher cost options that
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:00.180]   might not be visible to you till the backside.
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:07.680]   So for example, people who go to a prestigious school in a particular field probably have
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:11.100]   an easier time getting hired and getting a job afterwards.
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:15.400]   It's not that the other guy can't get hired, that he can't get a job, it's just that he
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:20.760]   probably has a harder time if he doesn't go to a prestigious school.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:25.520]   All of the other benefits, the kinds of people that you're involved with, these basically
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.880]   align with overall cost.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:33.080]   So in general, you should get the highest quality schooling and education that you can
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:36.160]   afford based upon the amount of money that you have saved.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:41.440]   And this is why I encourage you to restrict your spending to, say, 50% of your income,
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:45.160]   to free up money for yourself so that you can get onto the fast track.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:50.220]   You should focus on getting the schooling and it's better to go to a bad school that
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:54.480]   you can afford than an expensive school that you don't have the money for, sure.
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:58.800]   But by being conservative with your spending, that should free up the money for you to go
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.740]   to the highest quality institution that you can find that's going to serve the particular
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:07.560]   career that you are targeting or that you are interested in.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:13.520]   So the general default answer for questions like, "Should I go to college?" or "Should
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.800]   I go to the school or just start in the business?"
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:20.460]   Generally speaking, the answer from a financial perspective is, yes, you should go.
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:24.200]   If you're capable of going, if you're capable of getting in, and if you're capable of finishing,
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.280]   you probably should go.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.920]   I acknowledge that many people are not capable of going.
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.560]   They're not capable of getting in and not capable of finishing.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:35.760]   And so I'm intentionally trying to be very subjective here.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:41.680]   Notice I said you should get as much education, get as much of the highest quality education
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.460]   that you possibly can.
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:45.840]   The you is important.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:49.840]   Your skills and your abilities will be different than mine and different from every other person.
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:55.500]   But you should get as much of the highest quality education that you possibly can as
[00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:56.500]   soon as you can.
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:57.900]   So you should go to college.
[00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:02.160]   You should go to the best college that you have access to and that fits your overall
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.000]   ambitions and long-term plans.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.580]   You're not going to be a failure if you don't go to an Ivy League university.
[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:15.280]   But if you do go to an Ivy League university, you probably aren't going to regret the credentials
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:19.840]   that you are granted at the end of your time there.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:25.120]   And so if you want something other than what an Ivy League university can offer you, pursue
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.120]   that.
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:31.120]   But the Ivy League university pathway still offers enormous benefits.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:36.320]   So if you can work it out, you should go to the best quality school that you can.
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:41.120]   Now long-time listeners of Radical Personal Finance would probably be expecting me to
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:47.800]   start inserting more caveats and more disclaimers and more justification and things like that
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.720]   here because that's my general inclination.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:56.200]   My general inclination is to go into things like, well, you should calculate the value
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.800]   of the cost of the degree and how much money you have and all of that stuff.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:06.320]   But I've decided not to put that in here and it's for one basic reason.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:15.640]   I've realized that it's enormously valuable to simply set the goal and then let people
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.720]   figure out how to do it.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:24.200]   And I didn't say that everybody should go to an Ivy League university as my goal.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:28.920]   I did say get as much of the highest quality education that you possibly can as soon as
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.200]   you can.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:37.200]   And my reason for doing that is simply that you will establish the actual meaning of that
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.680]   based upon what is accessible to you.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:45.000]   And whatever you consider to be the highest level of education, I'm using Ivy League
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:52.040]   university as a kind of a stand-in for something that has a lot of cultural panache and cachet.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:32:00.240]   But if you set the goal of going to an Ivy League university, you're probably capable
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:05.520]   of going there and you're probably also perfectly capable of going there and paying for it,
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:09.040]   having it paid for without ever borrowing money, without ever doing anything.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:13.160]   And you're probably also perfectly capable of going there and choosing a degree that
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:18.760]   that Ivy League university is really valuable in rather than a degree that it's not valuable
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:19.760]   in.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:23.640]   And you're probably perfectly capable of going there and maintaining your soul in the process
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:28.480]   and really being a valuable part of your life.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:34.980]   So sometimes I've realized that I spend so much time caveating everything that it can
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:38.120]   discourage somebody who's capable of going there.
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:44.000]   This leads me conveniently enough to the next thing that I want to move to, which is partly
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.800]   by considering higher levels of degrees.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:51.480]   So I talked about should you finish high school, go to college, go to a fancy college.
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:55.800]   Question now is should you go to things like graduate school?
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.120]   My answer is yes.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:03.640]   You should get as much of the highest quality education that you possibly can as soon as
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:04.640]   you can.
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:10.240]   And that includes, if you're in the standard academic world, graduate school, master's
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.720]   degrees, PhDs, postdoctoral work.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:16.680]   If that includes some other field that you're in, it means advanced specialty schools, advanced
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:21.360]   training institutes, whatever is appropriate to your career and interest.
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:25.200]   You should go as far as you can as fast as you can.
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.280]   Why?
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.360]   Why do I say this with confidence now?
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:34.080]   The reason is you don't have to do one or the other.
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:38.520]   When I think back on all of the arguments that people made to me, I was discouraged
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.520]   by some people.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.960]   I can't remember who, but generally I was discouraged from going and getting a master's
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.720]   degree, from going and doing PhD work.
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:50.880]   I heard things from people who said things like, for example, that, "You know what?
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:56.640]   If you're going to go to get a master's degree, you should probably have a few years of work
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:57.640]   experience."
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.480]   Okay, that could be perfectly true.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:05.520]   I'm not denying that work experience can be useful, but the goal still should be get as
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:09.960]   much work experience as is useful and then go and get the graduate degree.
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:16.140]   Similarly, I am a proponent of things like gap years for graduating high school students.
[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:21.000]   All of the research that I have seen on the concept of a gap year indicates that a gap
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.480]   year is a really good and healthy thing for young people to have, that for the college-bound,
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:34.100]   for those who go to college after the gap year, they outperform the non-gap year students
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:37.240]   on basically every metric.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:43.320]   I don't know how many students go on gap year who choose not to go to college, nor do I
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:47.040]   particularly worry about it, because if that's what they learned by going to gap year, they
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.840]   probably found that that was a better choice for them.
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:53.380]   Inserting a little bit of time, a year or so, to think about something else, pursue
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:56.480]   something else, is probably a healthy thing.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:02.240]   What happens is that when you go as far as you can, as fast as you can, you are probably
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:06.120]   trading out consumption for achievement.
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:12.160]   What I've discovered whenever I have made my life easier is that usually I just started
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.000]   to consume rather than to produce more.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.680]   One of the biggest financial mistakes I made when I was younger, as an example, I was a
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:22.640]   young financial advisor and everyone says, "You need to hire staff.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:26.280]   You need to hire someone to work with you, work for you so that you do less administrative
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.680]   work so that you can earn a higher hourly rate."
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.200]   I think that is true.
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.200]   And so I did that.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.480]   I hired staff.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:37.280]   Problem is, I didn't go and do more of the high return work.
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:41.320]   On the contrary, I just went and spent more time hanging out and doing nothing.
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:46.280]   And so the staff didn't wind up increasing my productivity, it wound up decreasing it.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.720]   Did it have to be that way?
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.680]   No, it absolutely did not have to be that way.
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:52.040]   It was my mistake.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.560]   I paid for it dearly and I regret it to this day.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:59.160]   But I think it is that way for many people.
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:03.780]   So let's say that you're young and you're thinking about, "Should I go to graduate school
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:04.780]   or not?"
[00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:08.880]   Well, if you don't go to graduate school, there's a good chance that you're not going
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:15.620]   to fill in all of that extra time with this rigorous self-education program.
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.020]   Maybe you will, right?
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:19.560]   And if you will, then you're satisfying what I've done.
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:24.400]   Maybe you'll be the guy who does the DIY master's degree in computer science and takes all the
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:29.280]   MIT courses and publicly blogs your way through them and posts all your projects on the internet.
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:32.840]   That'd be amazing if you did it and I'd be a big supporter of you.
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.800]   But there's a good chance you're probably not going to do it.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:40.480]   So there's a good chance that going and signing up for the master's degree in computer science
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.880]   is probably the right move.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:46.080]   Because what will happen is, instead of you just sitting around and playing video games
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:50.320]   all day, "Well, now I've signed up and I've got to go ahead and finish this thing."
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:54.440]   And then you probably might as well go ahead and sign up for the PhD program or the advanced
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:58.360]   certification program or whatever it is for your industry because you're just going to
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:02.400]   be trading out consumption time for achievement time.
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:07.760]   And if you've maxed out all of those things, and let's say you're 30 years old and you've
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:13.640]   gotten all that done, I don't think you're ever going to regret that.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:18.080]   There are clearly some people, I guess, who do, but in general, going as far as you can,
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:24.800]   as fast as you can, as early as you can in the fullness of time makes a lot of sense.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:28.240]   Just from my own personal experience, I have something like, I don't know, seven or eight
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:33.760]   different financial certifications and designations, certified financial planner and charter life
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:36.060]   underwriter and a bunch of other stuff like that.
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:40.040]   At the time, I thought I was working really hard to do that stuff.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:44.280]   There would be times many mornings I would get up and I was newly married, I would get
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:48.960]   up and I'd go to leave my wife at home in bed and I'd get up and go to Denny's at four
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:52.240]   o'clock in the morning and study for a couple of hours in the morning.
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:55.480]   That was what I found out worked for me and then go home, have breakfast and then go to
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.480]   work.
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.160]   I thought, "Man, I'm working really hard.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.160]   Maybe I'm working too hard."
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.560]   Today, I look back on the stuff and I laugh.
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.640]   I laugh at how easy it was.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:08.840]   And all I did was just swap out some wasted time for doing more academics.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:09.840]   And I'm glad I did it.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:10.840]   I wish I'd done more.
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:13.400]   I wish I had pushed myself farther.
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:14.640]   I wish I had done more.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.440]   Today, I wish very much that I had a PhD.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:21.520]   And I could have done it, I just never set the goal, no one ever really encouraged me
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.520]   to do it.
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:26.120]   So don't worry, I'm not complaining or whining, I can still go and do it.
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:30.400]   But it is more difficult to do at certain points in time.
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:34.800]   And in hindsight, if I had gone ahead and just signed up for it, there would have been
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.200]   a modest cost.
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:39.920]   I would have had to work at it, but it would put me in a very different place today that
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:40.920]   I regret.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.120]   I was offered a fellowship program.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:47.520]   When I first started radical personal finance, actually, I had just finished my master's
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:51.640]   degree in financial planning at the American College.
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.680]   And one of the professors there, when I was there doing my capstone work, pulled me aside
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.640]   and said, "You should do our fellowship."
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:02.320]   And because I didn't have this automatic idea that I'm now trying to convey to you of get
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:06.200]   as much of the highest quality education as you possibly can as soon as you can, I just
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:09.280]   said, "No, no, I'm going to go work on my business.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.320]   After all, I'm starting this new business, I'm going to go work on my business."
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.080]   But this was a false choice.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:18.560]   I have the capacity where I could have done both and I don't think I would have been any
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:22.840]   less effective at either one of them by doing both.
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.040]   Maybe I would have, right?
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.040]   Who knows?
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:26.520]   We can't ever know what would have happened.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.720]   We're not God, we don't have middle knowledge.
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:32.440]   But I think I could have.
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:38.920]   And so for basically all people, you should get as much of the highest quality education
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:41.420]   as you possibly can as soon as you can.
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:43.640]   You should go as fast as you can.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.840]   And if at some point in time you realize, "You know what?
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:49.920]   I've gone farther than I should," you can stop.
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:54.640]   If you start a PhD program and you decide, "No, this is really hurting me," you can stop.
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:57.460]   You can stop for a year or two and then come back or you can just stop.
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:00.160]   And you'll know that that was where I should have stopped.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:04.800]   Let's say you are a pilot and you get your private pilot's license and you think, "Well,
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:08.280]   should I really get multi-engine?"
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.440]   The answer is yes, you should.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.840]   And if you get multi-engine and you get into it and you decide, "I don't want this," then
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:14.840]   stop.
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:15.840]   But in general, you should get multi-engine.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.240]   And then you say, "Should I go to commercial?"
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.240]   Yes, you should.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.760]   "Should I get my flight instructor?"
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.760]   Yes, you should.
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:21.840]   You should go.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:26.120]   Because what will happen is as you press down that path as quickly as possible, generally
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:31.080]   speaking the money that you're spending on the schooling is probably money that you would
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:33.360]   have just wasted otherwise.
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:36.800]   The time that you're spending on the schooling is probably time that you would have just
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.760]   wasted otherwise.
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:43.640]   And you're probably not going to regret getting as much of that as you can, as much as you
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.360]   have access to.
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:50.320]   And when you do all that stuff when you're really young and you really go, go, go, go,
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:54.120]   go, it hugely transforms the rest of your life.
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.960]   It hugely transforms it.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:03.640]   And education has a huge compounding effect over time.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.720]   It's enormously valuable.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:07.200]   Now I began with education.
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.640]   I kind of moved to schooling.
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:12.160]   Now let me move back from schooling.
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:15.240]   I repeat, I think these statements are true.
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:19.440]   Your goal should be to get as much of the highest quality education that you possibly
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.620]   can as soon as you can.
[00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:25.680]   Your goal should also be to get as much of the highest quality schooling as you possibly
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:29.060]   can as soon as you can.
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:33.380]   But you should also, even when finished with schooling, you should get as much of the highest
[00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:38.360]   quality education that you possibly can as soon as you can.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:42.820]   So you should always look for opportunities to become more well-educated.
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:48.700]   And this here is where we just simply apply all of the basic fundamentals of self-education,
[00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:54.920]   being widely read, being widely lectured to, whether that's through podcasts or videos
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:42:01.200]   or online classes that you take, being widely experienced by going to conferences, meeting
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.200]   people.
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.920]   All of those things pay off.
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:07.720]   And you should continually do as much of that as you can.
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.320]   And you won't regret it.
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:12.680]   Follow your interests and go down the pathways.
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.600]   And in time, it'll pay off.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:19.660]   I appreciate the many nice compliments that many people pay about the things that I know
[00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:20.920]   a little bit about.
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:25.400]   I know a little bit about a lot of different topics.
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:30.360]   And it allows me to do what I do for a living, which I find very gratifying and rewarding.
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.880]   I'm not some kind of genius.
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.040]   I'm not superhuman.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:42.160]   Basically all I have done is swapped out some time-wasting consumption activities that other
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.560]   people engage in that I don't engage in.
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:49.960]   And I've just substituted my enjoyment for different things.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:55.200]   The most mystifying question that anyone has ever, ever asks me is things like, "Joshua,
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:56.680]   what are your hobbies?"
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:02.160]   And this was mystifying to me for many years because I always felt like I should have some
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:07.000]   answer of what to say, like, "Well, I watch football" or something like that.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.840]   But later on, I just realized my hobby is learning.
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:11.840]   That's it.
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:12.840]   That's my hobby.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.960]   And I don't see why a hobby of learning is in any way inferior to any other hobby.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.880]   It's a hobby that has served me well.
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:21.120]   And I don't find it any less enjoyable than anything else.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:25.960]   I think I get just as much satisfaction out of learning as some other guy does from throwing
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:27.200]   darts.
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:28.200]   It's fine.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.200]   And I'm not good at darts.
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:32.560]   I can sort of kind of throw a football as long as you don't go too far away, just because
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.880]   I'm a standard American boy.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:40.920]   But in general, you can choose all of these things.
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:45.960]   And when you choose to have hobbies of things like education or schooling, they are just
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.960]   as enjoyable as anything else.
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.080]   I'm not going to go deep down this rabbit trail.
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:53.160]   I believe I've done other podcasts on it.
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:58.480]   But some guys make their hobby drinking beer and eating pizza.
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:01.660]   Other guys make their hobby climbing mountains.
[00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:05.880]   And both of them get together with their buddies and they do the thing that they like to do.
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:09.320]   They're both having a great time doing what they're doing.
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:14.280]   But the guy who chooses the hobby of drinking beer and eating pizza is headed for a lifetime
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:15.320]   of being fat.
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:18.880]   He's headed for early diabetes, early heart attack.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.960]   He's headed for slothfulness in his life.
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:28.040]   The guy who makes the habit of climbing mountains is headed for, in general, great health, great
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:31.600]   stamina, and a totally different perspective of the world.
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:36.360]   So we need to be really careful about the kinds of things that we generally engage in,
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:39.860]   that we try to focus on, the kinds of hobbies that we enjoy.
[00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:45.240]   And if you go back and think about the pathway of life of someone who pursues getting as
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:51.640]   much of the highest quality education as he possibly can, if he spends his 20s, his teens
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:57.060]   and his 20s, following that path as far as possible, and he wakes up at 30 years old
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:05.200]   and he finishes out his advanced specialty after medical residency, did he really lose
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:08.880]   something that was so valuable by doing that?
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:12.620]   People are prone to say things like, "Well, he didn't have any fun because he was working
[00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:14.520]   all the time or studying all the time."
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.480]   I think that's a false choice.
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:21.760]   I've known a lot of very high-achieving academics who have a perfectly satisfying social life,
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.180]   have a perfectly normal friend basis.
[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:28.560]   There's all kinds of ways to do it.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.080]   There's lots of ways to do it.
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:34.040]   You don't have to, it's not as, "Oh, well, you're either a medical student or you have
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:35.040]   a life."
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.360]   What does that even mean?
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:43.200]   But in general, the person who really dedicates himself to his craft and who works hard and
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:47.520]   who becomes very highly educated is going to be a more useful and productive member
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.160]   of society.
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:50.960]   And that's what we need more of.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:55.120]   And hard work is one of those things that when you do it, it's its own reward.
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:58.560]   It's satisfying in and of itself.
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:03.080]   When I reflect back to all the times that I didn't work hard and I thought, "Oh, I'm
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:09.800]   doing too much," I can't today identify any value or any benefit to my life of the times
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.760]   when I didn't work hard.
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:17.160]   But I can identify huge value from all the times that I did.
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:20.200]   Might it be true that overwork is a problem?
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:24.120]   Might it be true that some people are genuinely working too hard?
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:29.800]   Might it be true that some people's ambitions are so large that it's putting them into a
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:31.720]   bad place?
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:36.240]   Might it be true that in some cases it's important to lower ambitions?
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.540]   It's important to stretch out timelines?
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:41.200]   It's important to dial it back 20%?
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:42.720]   Of course.
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:50.740]   But that seems like a fairly obviously easily diagnosable problem as compared to the alternative.
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:53.120]   We can probably err in both directions.
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:58.760]   We can err on the side of being too hardworking and we can err on the side of being too lazy.
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:05.380]   However, one is much more easily diagnosable and recoverable than the other.
[00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:10.320]   If you, let's say that you're starting young and you find that you've worked far too hard
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:16.320]   through your 20s and in your 30s you have a top 20% career, you have a high income,
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:20.680]   you have a lot of money saved, you're very highly credentialed, you're very highly certified,
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:24.980]   but you're working too much and too hard, it's relatively easy to go ahead and pull
[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:27.600]   back by 20% or 50%.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:28.920]   Start coasting a little bit.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:33.120]   Start smelling the roses a little bit and enjoying life a little bit more and still
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:37.680]   get amazing results and you'll be happy with that move.
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.040]   It's not so easy to go the other direction.
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:44.520]   If you spend all your teens and your 20s and your 30s lazing about because you don't want
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:51.240]   to just do too much and you wind up at, say, 40 years old and you're poorly educated, you
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:57.780]   are relatively unqualified for almost anything, that's a pain that goes pretty deep and is
[00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:59.960]   pretty hard to recover from.
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:04.200]   So if we have to err, it's better to err on the side of doing a little bit too much and
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:10.340]   then pull back when the conditions warrant than the alternative, easier to make corrections
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:11.340]   in that direction.
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:18.120]   Now, as I start to wind down this episode, I want to re-emphasize that you should be
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:27.760]   careful, thoughtful, and strategic about the specific delivery mechanisms of the education
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.860]   that you choose.
[00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:38.300]   If you are working in an area in which self-education through books and seminars and courses is
[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:42.540]   the obviously best path, then focus on that.
[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:48.480]   If you are working in an area where formal education with some kind of accredited school
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:54.140]   or college is obviously the best path, then focus on that.
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:57.200]   Make smart strategic decisions.
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.520]   Every career is different.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:01.360]   Every person is at a different place in a career.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:08.000]   And throughout your life and lifetime and career, there will be different time periods
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:13.440]   in which certain choices are pretty obviously better choices than others.
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:18.120]   What I want you to take home from this episode is simply this.
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:25.440]   Your standard choice, your default option, your basic operating mindset should be, "I
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:30.080]   must get as much education as possible.
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:35.480]   I must get the highest quality education that is available to me.
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:39.200]   And I must get it as soon as possible."
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:46.460]   If you have that basic mindset and you repeatedly exercise the specific steps that will emerge
[00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:52.120]   from that mindset, then in the beginning, your career will seem like it's only going
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:54.680]   a little bit faster than others.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:50:01.200]   But when we zoom back and look at your life over the course of, say, a 40 or 50-year lifespan,
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:08.680]   working career, as you repeatedly dogmatically apply that throughout your life, you will
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:13.600]   be on a very different trajectory and you'll be very happy with your results.
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:19.280]   While you may strategically use periods of inactivity, such as a gap year or such as,
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:23.880]   "I'm going to go and work in this industry for two years and then go back and get a graduate
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:28.240]   degree," that can be a very valuable component of your strategy.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:34.160]   So while you may employ those strategies, you should not allow that to cause you to
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:42.200]   become complacent, nor should you defer educational and school opportunities to the future thinking,
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:43.520]   "Oh, I can always go back.
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:45.640]   I can always do this in the future."
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:51.520]   You can't always go back, and even if you can do it in the future, there are times in
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:54.280]   life in which it's more difficult.
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:51:00.360]   Now one final point as to why this is actually very helpful.
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:06.600]   Think back to goal number two, where I talked about spend half and save half.
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:12.280]   And think back to how I said that if you'll defer your high-consumption lifestyle by a
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:19.440]   few years, then you will find yourself to be decades ahead of your peers.
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:25.680]   The time in your life in which it will probably be the easiest for you to live very modestly
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:31.360]   will be during your young adult years, especially your college years.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:36.800]   Very rarely do we expect a young person who is in college to have a lot of money.
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:44.880]   And so everything about the college lifestyle is oriented towards high-return, high-fun
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:47.280]   activities that are cheap.
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:49.680]   You go to an event and you get fed.
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:53.880]   And if you're hanging out with college students, generally since most people are broke, it's
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:59.680]   pretty easy to have a lot of fun together, but to have a lot of fun together inexpensively.
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:05.800]   Where that starts to change is when people start to get out of college and get "real
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:08.240]   jobs" of adult wages.
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:15.200]   And now all of a sudden when they have adult wages and they have low expenses because they're
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:19.680]   still usually young and single, then they very quickly adapt to a higher consumption
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:20.680]   lifestyle.
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:26.040]   There's a really nice natural compliment here that if you stay in school for a little
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:32.880]   longer than most other people, you have kind of an easy excuse for your frugality.
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:35.840]   And remember that just because you're in school doesn't mean you necessarily have
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:37.880]   to defer earnings for many careers.
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:40.000]   For some it does.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.200]   So you can exercise this strategy.
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:45.240]   So this is something you can exercise at any point in your life.
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:50.680]   But I'm certainly acknowledging that a lot of this advice in this series is going to
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:56.640]   be most applicable to young people who are especially thinking about this college strategy.
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:53:02.320]   So if you're spending your 20s and you're finishing out various graduate degrees and
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:06.700]   terminal degrees in addition to your self-education, and especially if you're working concurrently
[00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:12.320]   with that, then from a lifestyle perspective, it's fairly low pressure for you just to acknowledge,
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:15.900]   "Hey, I don't have much money to spend so I don't spend much money."
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:21.060]   And in reality, you may be earning very well and you may be saving huge amounts of money.
[00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:26.580]   So this can be a very reasonable way for you to adapt to a low cost of living lifestyle
[00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:30.140]   at a time where that really doesn't hurt you very much because your friends are accustomed
[00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:35.100]   to it and it's very easy to live inexpensively at this period of life.
[00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:39.300]   We'll cover other savings and investments in future episodes.
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:45.220]   But your overall long-term rate of return on investments in education tends to be the
[00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:48.120]   highest of anything else.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:52.100]   If we wanted to put it even more simply than I did in the title of the show, you should
[00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:57.640]   spend as much money on your education as you possibly can until you just can't spend money
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:58.900]   on it anymore.
[00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:03.380]   And when you reach the point where it's just not possible for you to effectively spend
[00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:08.680]   money on education, then that's when you flip to other kinds of investments.
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:13.860]   Your most powerful wealth-building tool is going to be you and your income.
[00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:19.340]   And every dollar that you can spend on increasing your income is going to pay off over the long-term
[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:21.060]   course of your career.
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:23.700]   This is a really smart move.
[00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:29.580]   Goal number five, get as much of the highest quality education that you possibly can as
[00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:31.380]   soon as you can.
[00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:34.540]   That's a goal that every one of us should set.
[00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:36.980]   Be we young, be we old.
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:40.420]   Be we at the beginning of a career, be we in the middle of a career, even be we in the
[00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:42.580]   end of our career.
[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:47.260]   Every one of us should have a goal of getting as much of the highest quality education as
[00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:50.140]   we possibly can as soon as we can.
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:52.000]   Good results come from that.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.540]   Are you having problems with your 2018 to 2024 car?
