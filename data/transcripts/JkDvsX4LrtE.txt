[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.240]   - A new week begins, a very sweet week,
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.120]   and a very full one as well in Minneapolis
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.780]   as we welcome many friends in town
[00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.200]   for the annual Pastors Conference,
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.320]   the Bethlehem Conference for Pastors and Church Leaders
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.880]   in partnership with DesiringGod.org,
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.560]   once again, it's downtown
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.640]   at the Minneapolis Convention Center.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.960]   This year's theme is this, Joy Set Before Us,
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.320]   Perseverance and Hope in the Day of Opposition.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.240]   For these first three days of the week,
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.920]   we'll be talking at the conference
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.080]   about the reality of cultural opposition to the gospel
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.080]   and learning how to spiritually flourish
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.960]   and faithfully minister in the face of cultural persecution,
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.360]   however subtle or severe that persecution is.
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.440]   It is, of course, a leaders' conference,
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.600]   but this one, I think, of all years,
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.040]   will be especially relevant for any attentive Christian
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.160]   who wants to engage our culture with the gospel
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.320]   thoughtfully and humbly.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.240]   The speakers include you, Pastor John, of course,
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.240]   and I know you're prepared and ready to go.
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.160]   Also, Don Carson is in town,
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.040]   and of course, Jason Meyer and Leonce Crump,
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.280]   and missionary Tim Kazee from the Dispatches
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.520]   from the front DVDs you may have seen.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.800]   He's in town along with us,
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.760]   as is Oz Guinness and many other speakers.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.600]   You can follow the schedule and the livestream
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.360]   at DesiringGod.org/live for more.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.760]   Well, on to the inbox.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.360]   Many questions have come in this month, Pastor John,
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.680]   and they have had to do with the theme of discipleship.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.120]   So maybe I'll just ask this.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.560]   What is discipleship?
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.520]   What is the aim of discipleship?
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.560]   How is it done typically?
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.160]   Pastor John, what would you say in sort of the macro context
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.560]   to sort of orient us to this work,
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.640]   this discipline of discipleship?
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.920]   Couple of observations about the word.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.200]   The word discipleship never occurs in the Bible,
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.680]   the English word discipleship.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.800]   It's not in the Bible.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.000]   The term is ambiguous in English.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   It can mean my discipleship in the sense of
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.120]   my own pattern of following Jesus
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.360]   and trusting Him and learning from Him.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.160]   That's my discipleship, could mean that.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.160]   Or it can mean my activity of helping others be disciples
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:33.500]   in that sense of learning from Him, growing in Him.
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.640]   The second meaning, you know, there's helping others,
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.640]   does have a verb in New Testament Greek, mathe teuo,
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.480]   to make disciples.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.480]   It can mean preach the gospel
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.920]   so that people get converted to Christ
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.140]   and become Christians and thus disciples.
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.840]   For example, Acts 14.21,
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.360]   when they had preached the gospel to that city
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.100]   and made many disciples,
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.440]   they returned to Lystra and to Iconium.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.560]   So make disciples is one Greek word there,
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.880]   and it means get them converted to Jesus.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.040]   That's what it means.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.000]   Or it can mean the whole process of conversion,
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.640]   baptism, and teaching the ways of Jesus
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.440]   as it's used in Matthew 28.19.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.920]   Go therefore and make disciples.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.240]   And here's what he means,
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.120]   baptizing them in the name of the Father,
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.360]   the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.400]   and teaching them to observe everything I commanded you.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.760]   That's a very long process.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.020]   That's like a lifetime of process.
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.820]   So get them converted, baptize them,
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.560]   and then spend a lifetime teaching them
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.640]   to obey all that Jesus said.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.680]   That is what the verb disciple
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.400]   in the New Testament would include.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.400]   The word disciple in the New Testament
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.880]   does not mean a second-stage Christian.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.400]   - Yes.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.900]   - There's some ministries that are built
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.360]   around this distinction that's just so unbiblical.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.560]   As if there were converts,
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.560]   then there are disciples who are a little stage two
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.320]   Christians who've learned more,
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.560]   and then there are disciple makers.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.200]   Now all those groupings are linguistically foreign
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.880]   to the New Testament.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.600]   A disciple in the New Testament is simply a Christian,
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.440]   Acts 11.26.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.960]   And in Antioch, the disciples were first called Christians.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.520]   Everybody that was converted to Jesus was a disciple.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.920]   Everybody that was converted to Jesus was a Christian.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.920]   Disciple was, in fact, not a favorite term for Christian.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:57.880]   As time went by, it seems, Paul never uses the noun
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.040]   or the verb disciple.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.880]   In fact, neither the noun disciple
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.400]   or the verb make disciples occurs anywhere
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.840]   in the New Testament outside the Gospels and Acts.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.840]   So I think what is important is not the terminology,
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.880]   but the reality.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.200]   People need to become Christians,
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.200]   and people need to be taught how to think and feel
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.440]   and act as a Christian, that is, a disciple,
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.440]   a follower of Jesus, one who embraces him as Lord
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.600]   and Savior and treasure.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.400]   Now, where and how should that happen?
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.560]   I mean, that's what I think all the talk
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.560]   about discipleship is.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.260]   It's just a fresh concern about how to bring people
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.800]   to Christ and grow them up into being what they ought to be
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.520]   as Christians or as followers of Jesus or as disciples.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.360]   There's a lot of different words that people are using
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.280]   these days to describe Christian.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.600]   So how does that happen?
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.040]   Well, the conversion of people from unbelievers to believers,
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.940]   Christians, disciples, should be happening
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.120]   in any and every situation, okay?
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.040]   So no single strategy.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.000]   There is no limit to the ways a person can be told
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.680]   the good news of Jesus.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.120]   And so, quote, "Discipling," unquote, in that sense,
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.280]   is as varied as there are ways of saying the gospel
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.160]   or living the gospel in front of people to draw them in.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:45.200]   As far as training Christians how to think and feel
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.420]   and act as a Christian, that is, discipling in the sense
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.800]   of growing them into more and more maturity
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.000]   that happens in so many ways in the New Testament.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.240]   Here's just a grocery list of possibilities.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.560]   Titus 2.4, "Older women are to train younger women."
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.920]   2 Timothy 2.2, "Paul trained Timothy to train others
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.400]   "to train others."
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.680]   Ephesians 6.4, "Fathers are to train their children."
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.860]   Matthew 28.20, "Missionaries are to teach the nations
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.240]   "everything Jesus commanded."
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.880]   Hebrews 3.13, "All Christians are to exhort each other
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.840]   "every day to avoid sin and to stir each other up
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.720]   "to love and good works."
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.160]   Chapter 10, 1 Peter 4.10, "All Christians are to use
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.920]   "their gifts to serve others."
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.640]   Acts 18.24, "Priscilla and Aquila, on the spur of the moment
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.480]   "it seems, explained the way of God more accurately
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.760]   "to Apollos."
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.680]   And we could go on and on.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.720]   Every Christian should be helping unbelievers become
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.720]   believers by showing them Christ, that is, making a disciple,
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.360]   and every Christian should be helping other believers
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.120]   grow to more and more maturity, that's making a disciple.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.840]   And every Christian should be seeking to get help
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.520]   for themselves from others to keep on growing,
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:13.520]   and that is also His, their, our discipleship.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:19.000]   And every church should think through how all of these kinds
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.080]   of biblical disciple-making find expression
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.000]   in their corporate life.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.040]   - Huge entailments, thank you, Pastor John,
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.320]   and thank you for this survey of disciple-making,
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.000]   and thank you for listening to this podcast.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.800]   I hope to see a number of you today at the conference.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.040]   If you're there, come over and say hi.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.280]   And tomorrow we're actually gonna talk about conferences
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.800]   on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.160]   We're gonna hear from a listener who wants to know
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.120]   how you, Pastor John, square your wartime lifestyle
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.640]   of simplicity with the expensive conference venues
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.240]   that you often speak at.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.800]   That should be interesting.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.080]   Until then, for more information about the podcast
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.800]   or to find our most recent or our most popular episodes,

[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.360]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke,
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.240]   and I need to get off to the conference.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.400]   Thank you for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.640]   with John Piper.
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.760]   We'll see you tomorrow.

[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.920]   (upbeat music)
