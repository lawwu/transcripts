[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620]   Can I give you a hack that I think is probably my number one thing that I've picked up in the last
[00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.520]   three months that I absolutely recommend to everyone? We all know that ChatGPT has a voice
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.340]   interface, right? Like you can talk to it now and you can interrupt it now, which is quite nice,
[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.900]   right? So you don't have to wait for it to finish this whole long sentence because like, well,
[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.260]   wait a second, like tell me a little bit more about this. So you can tie that to your iPhone
[00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.460]   on that extra button that they have. And we ask it questions throughout the day, like tell me about
[00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.440]   this, tell me about that, right? But one thing I realized that is really fun is if you just go
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.820]   outside, sit on your patio one day and think about a topic that you know very little about,
[00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.780]   but are curious about. So for me, that was quantum computing. And I was like, tell me about this,
[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.820]   tell me about this. And she, I have a voice trained, it's a female voice. This is what I tell her,
[00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.460]   but you're explaining this at a college level. Give it to me at a ninth grader level. She's like,
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.120]   okay, cool. At a ninth grader level, I'd explain it like this, right? And I got it. After 45 minutes,
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.580]   I now have a really solid foundational understanding of quantum computing. And I didn't know any of that
