[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720]   Once this whole thing falls apart
[00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.020]   and we are climbing the kudzu vines
[00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.460]   that spiral up the Sears Tower,
[00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.980]   like they say in Fight Club,
[00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.160]   Bobby will go back to his gatherer form
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.300]   and be happy as a pig in shit,
[00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.700]   just walking around in a loincloth
[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.100]   with his bird hanging out,
[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.300]   tracking jokes to people and climbing up on them
[00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.540]   for a stool lap dance or whatever he does.
[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.940]   - You think some level of crazy is required for comedy?
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.100]   - Yeah. - Like at some point?
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.540]   - Yes.
[00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.740]   - Have there been low points in your life?
[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.980]   - Yeah, you know.
[00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.740]   - Yeah, you know, hey, hey.
[00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.580]   - Eh? - Yeah, right?
[00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.820]   (laughing)
[00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.820]   - The following is a conversation with Will Sasso,
[00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.500]   a comedian, actor, podcaster,
[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.140]   and someone I've been a fan of for many years
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.940]   since Mad TV in the late '90s
[00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.340]   to recently with the 10 Minute Podcast
[00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.620]   and now the new podcast called Doodzie.
[00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.420]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.300]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.500]   in the description.
[00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.920]   And now, dear friends, here's Will Sasso.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.780]   So let's call it the elephant in the room.
[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.740]   You wore a black suit in a recent episode of Doodzie.
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.580]   - Yes.
[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.300]   (laughing)
[00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.320]   - You wore a black suit again today.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.740]   Shakespeare, then Mark Twain said, "Clothes make the man."
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.300]   What kind of man does a suit make you?
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.380]   - Well, me in particular, it makes me a fellow
[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.340]   who did not get this dry cleaned in between
[00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.920]   'cause that episode of the show as we sit here now
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.580]   was around a week ago.
[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.180]   So that's the kind of man it makes me.
[00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.260]   - Well, the nice thing is you're wearing pants, I think.
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.100]   - Yes, I am wearing pants.
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.420]   - I don't think you were wearing pants in the episode.
[00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.240]   - That's correct.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.140]   I prefer to wear shorts, but this was a special occasion,
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.620]   so I'm wearing pants.
[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.500]   And I thought it fitting, obviously,
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.140]   to just wear the black tie.
[00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.020]   And clothes do make the man.
[00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.980]   And I would not consider myself to be a man of leisure,
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.940]   but I do enjoy shorts 'cause my legs get hot.
[00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.620]   So that's what kind of man the shorts make me.
[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.940]   - How often do you wear a suit?
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.460]   - I fucking hate wearing suits.
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.100]   - So what is this, a statement of, is it ironic?
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.060]   Or are you honoring the gods of this particular podcast?
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.100]   - I'm honoring the gods of this particular podcast
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.260]   would be a good way to put it.
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.860]   Yes, no, this is in reverence of and in dedication to you
[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.860]   and our newfound friendship here,
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.980]   which we are making on the podcast.
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.380]   You and I just met.
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.500]   Everything that we're saying here
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.080]   are the first things that we're saying to each other.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.780]   So I'm meeting you on common ground, dressed like--
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.120]   - Well, I've been actually a one-way friend of yours
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.140]   for many, many years since "Mad TV."
[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.100]   - Oh.
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.300]   - When did you start on "Mad TV?"
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.220]   So that was, I mean, in '90s?
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.060]   - '97, yeah.
[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.980]   - '97.
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.620]   So I was a huge fan of yours, and the cast was incredible.
[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.980]   It was one of the funniest shows ever created.
[00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.980]   Your whole journey watching through that
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.220]   was incredible from "Mad TV" to "Three Stooges"
[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.060]   to the podcast, the 10-minute pod,
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.360]   and then the new podcast is incredible.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.260]   - Cheers.
[00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.820]   - My favorite role that you played
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.940]   was the mountain in the game of "Thrones."
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.100]   What was it like working with dragons?
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.060]   - Well, the dragons are usually tennis balls
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.060]   on the end of C-stands, but sometimes they hang out.
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.860]   - What's a C-stand?
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.580]   - It's like, you know, it's like a little like the thing
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.660]   you got the camera on here.
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.020]   - Oh, this is like film lingo.
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.980]   - Yeah, no, I understand.
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.700]   I'm trying to impress you with my film lingo.
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.340]   You know what a banana is?
[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.180]   - Yeah.
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.020]   - When you walk like this.
[00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.860]   - Oh.
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.680]   - You do a banana.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.520]   - I take it back.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.380]   I did not know what a banana was.
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.220]   - Yeah, see?
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.180]   It means something.
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.900]   Yeah, 'cause it's just a food normally.
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.100]   - You fancy Hollywood folk with the lingo.
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.100]   - And I'm, my name is Bjorn Hapthor Bjornsson,
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.380]   and I am seven foot four.
[00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.260]   And yeah, so dragons don't scare me,
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.620]   even though they've been extinct for a while.
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.940]   You're a scientist, right?
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.220]   Is that checked out?
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.660]   - Yeah, I actually, I'm really into video games.
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.660]   I don't know if you play video games.
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.740]   There's a Skyrim video game
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.360]   that's part of the Elder Scrolls series,
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.420]   and for the longest time,
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.460]   there's a legend that there's dragons.
[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.860]   I think it started in Daggerfall.
[00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.540]   And so I always, I grew up playing those video games
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.220]   and dreaming of one day meeting a dragon in a virtual world.
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.900]   And eventually you did in Skyrim.
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.780]   So dragons represent,
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.140]   I don't know exactly what they represent,
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.600]   but they represent maybe this kind of mythical creature
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.980]   that is bigger than anything humans
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.940]   can possibly comprehend, maybe.
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.980]   'Cause they're so, they show up so often in myth
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.700]   from the religious stories, you know,
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.340]   of the snake and so on, the serpent.
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.940]   And I don't know what that is.
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.700]   With this breathing fire, that's kind of weird.
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.300]   - It's interesting when I think about dragons,
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.520]   'cause now that you bring it up,
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.460]   these are people that probably wouldn't have access
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.300]   to the fact that there used to be dinosaurs.
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.860]   - Right. - Maybe they did.
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.460]   If they didn't, they're drawing things
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.360]   that look like, you know, a dinosaur cousin,
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.220]   but cool, that can breathe fire
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.080]   and has wacky wings and a spiked tail.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.300]   Yeah, where the heck did they come up with that?
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.500]   'Cause they're clearly, of course,
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.260]   represented in mythology all the way back to,
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.660]   no, not cave drawings.
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.560]   Well, the Egyptians probably knew what the,
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.580]   and they could time travel.
[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.660]   So they would have gone back to the caves.
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.220]   - Well, the aliens that placed living organisms on Earth
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.820]   could time travel and they could plant legends
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.500]   into the collective intelligence of the human species.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.400]   - Yeah, and perhaps they were thinking of us
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.260]   to do something smart with it, and we didn't.
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.860]   We just came up with Skyrim. - For now.
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.700]   - We're just, what's that?
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.020]   - Sorry, that was very offensive.
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.900]   - I'm sorry, I don't mean to offend you
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:37.980]   with your video game.
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.660]   I'm more of a Burger Time Donkey Kong dude.
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.020]   - Oh, what is that?
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.100]   That's an original?
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.020]   - Burger Time was an arcade game
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.760]   that later showed up on the Intellivision.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.900]   It wasn't television.
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.020]   I believe it was made by Texas Instruments.
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.420]   Horrible first-generation video game console.
[00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.580]   And Burger Time, you just, it's like Super Mario.
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.020]   You just gotta stay away from the eggs
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.360]   and the pickles and stuff.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.860]   And you just go, "Meep, meep, meep."
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.980]   And the bun falls, and then you go down to the,
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.140]   "Meep, meep," and the cheese, and then the meat.
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.540]   I'm not gonna say it's as complicated
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.500]   as Skyrim, but it took me a while to finish it
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.340]   when I was seven.
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.260]   - Did you play video games?
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.540]   Was that a part of your life,
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.980]   a part of the source of happiness for you at all?
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.020]   - It was, it was.
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.260]   I played video games up until around,
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.100]   I think in 2010, I got the Red Ring of Death
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.740]   on my Xbox 360.
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.900]   - That was it. - That was it.
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.220]   I never, or whatever the Xbox was then.
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.700]   - Yeah. - I was playing,
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.860]   I had finished the Grand Theft Auto that was out,
[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.860]   and I'd finished the Red Dead Redemption.
[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.740]   So I was doing that thing where you just drive around
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.060]   the streets of New York, or just ride around
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.740]   on your horse shooting people,
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.060]   and throwing grenades into groups of people in Grand Theft.
[00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.980]   - And you're describing the same thing
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.460]   that happened a decade later,
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.180]   'cause it's now Red Dead Redemption 2,
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.940]   and there's still not a new Grand Theft Auto, so.
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.140]   - Yeah, there isn't, right?
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:05.980]   - Yeah, they're working on it.
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.100]   They're always flirting with that idea.
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.100]   You know who else plays Skyrim?
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.460]   Another person, the two people I'm a huge fan of
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.740]   from that time in Mad TV is Bobby Lee.
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.700]   - He plays Skyrim?
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.900]   - He's a huge fan of Skyrim. - He plays every.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.460]   - So what Bobby Lee loves to do is to grind,
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.620]   do the boring task over and over, gather mushroom.
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.580]   Like in Skyrim, you can fight dragons,
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.540]   you can fight all kinds of things,
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.980]   but you can also gather mushrooms
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.740]   and different ingredients to make potions,
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:33.980]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.220]   He loves the ingredients.
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.700]   He's the, you know, in the hunter-gatherer world,
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.700]   he's the gatherer. - He's the gatherer.
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.100]   - Yeah, I've heard him described that way,
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.540]   and he likes to describe himself that way.
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.620]   I worked with Bobby not too long ago.
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.780]   He came and did a couple of days
[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.180]   on this thing we were shooting,
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.300]   and I was looking forward to catching up with my old pal.
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.260]   And if you know anything about Bobby Lee,
[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.580]   you'd probably be able to predict
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.460]   that he spent that entire time playing farming on his iPad.
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:03.060]   - Yeah, well, humans are a source of anxiety and trouble,
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.420]   so sometimes it's good to escape human interaction
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.780]   through video games. - Totally.
[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:07.980]   - I'm with him on that.
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.140]   He's one of the funniest people ever.
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.580]   What do you think makes him funny?
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.860]   It's just all the times you've worked with him,
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:21.860]   the non-standard, non-sequitur way of his being.
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:26.900]   - Bobby Lee is one of the most raw people,
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.820]   raw performers, who lets it all hang out
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.700]   to the degree that he will even get naked
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.260]   in front of his audience, which is usually a metaphor
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.620]   for someone doing stand-up.
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.100]   I'm bearing all. - Yeah.
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.540]   - I'm showing you everything,
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.940]   and Bobby will just pull his bird out of his pants.
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.220]   Yeah, I don't think he understands metaphor too much.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.500]   - He embodies metaphor.
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.060]   - Yes, he embodies metaphor.
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:46.980]   He's the gatherer.
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.260]   We call him the gathering metaphor,
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.700]   Bobby the gatherer metaphor.
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.500]   - He's a metaphor for something else,
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.940]   for somebody else's life.
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.340]   Someday he'll be in the dictionary
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.820]   representing some kind of concept,
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.100]   maybe the metaphor itself.
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.500]   - Yeah, once this whole thing falls apart
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.780]   and we are climbing the kudzu vines
[00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:06.700]   that spiral up the Sears Tower, like they say,
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.900]   in Fight Club, Bobby will go back to his gatherer form
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.060]   and be happy as a pig in shit,
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.460]   just walking around in a loincloth
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.940]   with his bird hanging out, tracking jokes to people,
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.620]   and climbing up on them for a stool lap dance
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:19.460]   or whatever he does.
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.100]   - I'd love to dig into something he did.
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.420]   You guys did a lot of great podcasts together.
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:28.420]   He asked you, in a very uncomfortable process
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:32.100]   of why you don't do stand-up, so let me ask you,
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.540]   do you hate money?
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.940]   (laughing)
[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.580]   - Well, I'm originally from Canada, yeah,
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:40.860]   so I'm a frickin' pinko socialist.
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.780]   Is that where you come from?
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.540]   That's not a nice thing to say.
[00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.940]   - I thought the Soviet Union, that is a nice thing to say.
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:48.780]   Like Comrade-- - You could call someone
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.460]   a pinko socialist.
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.300]   - Right, Comrade, he's a good socialist.
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.060]   - Yeah, yeah. - With red.
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.260]   Like some bold colors, yeah.
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.300]   There was an interesting tension in your voice
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.400]   and the way you talked about it.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.180]   There's just not a source of happiness for you.
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.300]   You respect the art form,
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.260]   but it was not something that you were connected to,
[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:09.580]   you felt connected to.
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:10.860]   - That's a good way to put it, yeah.
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.060]   I respect the art form a lot,
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.140]   and I grew up with all the albums and stuff.
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.540]   I had an older brother and sister who,
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:23.540]   so we had George Carlin, we had Richard Pryor,
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.820]   we had Robert Klein, we had Gilda Live,
[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.820]   the Gilda Radner concert.
[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.900]   We had all sorts of stuff, but I don't know.
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.860]   There's a lot of reasons.
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.340]   I do feel like a career in show business
[00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:41.740]   is, it never goes the way you plan, like most things.
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.020]   And I was fortunate enough to get started
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.220]   outside of my native Vancouver, or in my native Vancouver.
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.620]   I grew up in the burbs outside,
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.620]   and there was a lot of industry there.
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.460]   So I was fortunate enough to get started as an actor
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.740]   when I was like 16.
[00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:59.740]   So yeah, there were some times early on
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:03.260]   where I came up with some standup stuff and did it,
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.060]   but yeah, I quickly abandoned it.
[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:09.780]   And then you go through, you do Mad TV and stuff,
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:13.200]   and that's where my, and this is gonna sound weird.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.900]   Do I sound as anxietal as I did
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.260]   when I was on Bobby's podcast, trying to avoid his questions?
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.340]   - Well, he was giving you this face this whole time
[00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:25.120]   that was making the whole atmosphere feel full of anxiety.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.940]   So I'm trying not to give you a face.
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.860]   The whole time I was saying, "Play cool, play cool."
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.180]   - Yeah, okay.
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.020]   - Play cool, Lex.
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.300]   - Play cool, you said it out loud a couple of times.
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.140]   - I did.
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:34.980]   - Just, you know, you cut that out.
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.340]   - Play cool, play cool, cut it out, cut it out.
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.180]   - Maintain, bro.
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.000]   Here's what I'll say.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.840]   There's two ways to do it.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.020]   I think it's lame when someone who's done one thing
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:46.100]   for a while goes and starts doing standup out of nowhere,
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.460]   'cause I think it's an art form that's under attack
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.700]   because it's not like anything else.
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.100]   You need, although now you can, of course,
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:56.460]   you know, make whatever you want.
[00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.300]   It's the era of self-publishing
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.740]   as far as making a product and putting it out there,
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.380]   which is getting easier, of course,
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.700]   and I can't wait to talk to you about that
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.300]   with AI and how it's changing art.
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:12.460]   But in standup, all you need is a microphone
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.740]   and, you know, perhaps it'd be good
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.220]   to have some mental illness,
[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:20.100]   and then you can just run up there and talk forever.
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.900]   And I say this to, you know, comedians.
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:27.320]   It's like, you guys have to deal with just an influx
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.920]   of people who aren't sure why they're doing comedy.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.460]   I would ask comedians, you know, like,
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.600]   I mean, not good ones.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.680]   Good ones, you know what they're doing,
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.000]   but everyone else, like, what are you doing?
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:36.840]   Why?
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.000]   Why are you doing standup?
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.280]   Having said that, I am allergic to money.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.480]   - Yeah, do you think they have a good answer for that?
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.320]   Why are they doing it?
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.000]   'Cause I actually, like, when I'm in Austin,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.560]   I like going to open mics, just listening.
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:52.440]   It's inspiring to me, both the funny and the unfunny people,
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.000]   because they've been doing it for several years,
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.720]   sometimes over a decade,
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.120]   and they're still at it.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.000]   They're still right there.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.160]   They're going for the punch,
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.080]   and then especially open mics that are really sad
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.880]   in that there is, you know,
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.000]   only like five other people in the audience,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.240]   and they're usually just other comedians,
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.040]   and they're still going all out,
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.040]   as if they're in front of a stadium.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.760]   - But that, to me, sounds like someone who loves it.
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:17.600]   - Yeah.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.280]   - I got no questions for that person.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.920]   I got questions for someone who goes sideways
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.740]   from here, I'm recognizable doing something,
[00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:26.520]   and then I'm doing standup.
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.880]   Because it's like, and truly, look,
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.920]   I've been fortunate enough to be in the business
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.320]   for a long time, and at this point, if I came up,
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.440]   I mean, doing live stuff is fun.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.000]   I have friends that are like, you know,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.480]   some guys who are primarily sketch people,
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.040]   or you would look at them as sketch people,
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.040]   and they can sell tickets for being sketch people,
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.000]   and we'll talk about it, and they're like,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.800]   "Meh, you know, I do a monologue,
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.400]   and I do a little standup, then I do a song,
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.720]   then I do another monologue,
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.280]   then I play off the audience, do a little standup."
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:59.440]   But standup is, it's almost like playing music,
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.160]   in that, you know, people are going up there playing music,
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.560]   but what band have you been listening to?
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.420]   That's what you're gonna sound like.
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.520]   So it's really, I mean, of course,
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.560]   I'm speaking from zero experience, but I've heard,
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.280]   it takes years, of course, to find your own voice.
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.280]   Standups that, when they first go up,
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:19.920]   they're doing some sort of impersonation of so-and-so,
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.240]   and so-and-so, and then you gotta pop this audience
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.660]   that's paying, and you're gonna get run over
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.480]   by the next person who's coming up,
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.820]   and it's hard to follow the last person
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.880]   who went up before you, and I mean,
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.200]   that is a really hard way to, it's a very,
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.320]   it's quite a gauntlet to be in,
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.640]   to find your voice comedically.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.840]   - But don't you have that same kind of thing with sketch,
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.440]   where you still have to find your own voice?
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.280]   - Yeah.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.840]   - With, like, all the impressions you do,
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.680]   they're just terrible, you know,
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.480]   they're different spins on different people,
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.040]   they're not, like, perfect impressions, right?
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.880]   - Yeah.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.160]   - And that's, I mean, that's a similar
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.760]   kind of challenging journey as standup.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.160]   You're just saying they're kind of distinct,
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.680]   and you fell into this one, you fell in love with it,
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.780]   which is, like, what MadTV kind of opened you up to.
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.400]   - Yeah, as a kid, I literally wanted to be an actor.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.080]   I always wanted to be an actor, from a very young age,
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.440]   as far back as I can remember, and I was a class clown,
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.040]   and wanted to do comedy stuff, and comedic acting, and--
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.280]   - So comedic acting.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.480]   - Yeah, early on, my influences were
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.520]   a very predictable list of guys from
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:29.520]   SCTV, early Saturday Night Live, Monty Python,
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.600]   all of those performers really influenced me.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.600]   It was later that I saw people like Kevin Kline,
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.400]   who's an incredible actor.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.120]   I vividly remember being, like, 12, 13,
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.440]   seeing him get an Academy Award for Fish Called Wanda,
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.240]   and it blew my mind, 'cause I was like, he was hilarious.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.600]   I mean, it was one of my favorite movies back then,
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.680]   and now, and he won an Academy Award,
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:57.680]   and at that point, I started thinking more about acting.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.440]   And then I was, like I said, really fortunate
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:04.160]   to fall in with, I mean, I always wanted to do it,
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.520]   and I was trying to hustle this and that when I was a kid,
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.480]   and then I ended up getting represented,
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.720]   and then I ended up on a teen show.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.600]   I was on, I basically, the easiest way to pitch it
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.640]   is it's like a Canadian My So-Called Life,
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.520]   with these kids, and their lives, and stuff,
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.120]   and I did that for like five years,
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.520]   and I really love acting.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.160]   I really, truly love acting, and I don't,
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.360]   I'm not someone who wants people to know my opinion,
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.240]   so that's another thing about standup.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.000]   Like, I love the illusion of what I get to do
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.900]   in entertainment, and podcasting is great for that,
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.600]   but to stand up there, and for, I don't know,
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.200]   just for me, it's like, it would have to all be fantasy,
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.800]   and-- - Yeah, so,
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.160]   Nietzsche said that every profound spirit needs a mask.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.440]   Like you said, you don't like to talk about,
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.120]   in your comedy, you don't like to talk about stuff
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.600]   that's personal to you.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.800]   - Yeah, I don't know. - What is that?
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.200]   If you were to psychoanalyze yourself,
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.040]   do you think it's just not something you find funny,
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.360]   or is it, are you running from something,
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:16.600]   and it's not your fault, Will?
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.480]   - It's not your fault, Will.
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.320]   - Speaking of another really great comedic actor
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.520]   who's also a serious actor, Robert Williams.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.400]   - One of the best serious actors.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.960]   I mean, I, and you know, one of the funniest people
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.800]   of all time, but as great, as incredible as he was
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.460]   as a funny man, as a standup and a performer,
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.800]   I almost like his serious stuff better.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.000]   - Can I ask you a question about that?
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.520]   What do you make of the, that he committed suicide?
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.280]   - I think it's, I mean, it's super depressing.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.400]   I've referred to him as like the Jesus Christ
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.520]   of depression.
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:54.480]   It's almost like he died for others' depression,
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.800]   you know what I mean?
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.640]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.160]   - You'd look at someone like that and go,
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.320]   wait a minute, you're a rock star.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.240]   You could just check out if you're not liking your life.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.040]   And of course, something like suicide begs
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.280]   that you look a little deeper and realize
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:13.000]   how tortured the human mind can make someone.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.080]   - Is there some aspect to, you know, we're in LA,
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.000]   is there some aspect of celebrity that's isolating
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.320]   that can make you feel really lonely?
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.200]   - Not me, I don't feel, no, not really.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.720]   - You feel the love?
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.520]   - No, I just feel like I'm not, I mean, it's like,
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.360]   I don't know, I've always kind of had a small group
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.280]   of friends and those people don't, you know,
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.080]   it's like I've known the same people for years and years.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.720]   - You never really felt the celebrity, really?
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.000]   - Nah, in LA, it's hard to, it's hard for people,
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.480]   nobody cares, they see you and then the next minute
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.400]   they see so and so, so it's like, you know,
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.200]   I'm the guy from that, you know,
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.760]   you did that Mike and Molly, right?
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:55.200]   Nope, nope, close, King of, you shave your head,
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.820]   you go bald, you're King and Queens, nope, not me.
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:02.800]   So, close, you're, wow, shit, you used to be
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.460]   the mountain on Game of Thrones, you look like shit,
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:08.600]   what happened, just eating fried dough?
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.000]   - Yeah. - Yeah, that's what's up.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.640]   You can't lift any weights anymore, I'm at the gym
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.880]   doing like 15 pounds with shoulder press, ah,
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.000]   and people coming up to me, you used to be
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.600]   a dragon killer, dude. - Half the man
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.600]   you used to be, what's, have there been low points
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.040]   in your life, sorry to go there, but.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:32.040]   - Nope, yeah, you know, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.520]   (laughing)
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:38.560]   Yeah, everybody has a low point in life.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.560]   - You suffer from like depression and you know,
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.520]   those kinds of things. - You know what, I do, I do.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.760]   I have a bunch of stuff.
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.880]   - How do you deal with it, said friends,
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.760]   the friends and the-- - They don't do anything
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.880]   for me in that sense. - Yeah.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:55.640]   - I have an incredible fiance who, that's nice
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:59.880]   to have somebody constant that you love very much
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.480]   and see as the best person and all that good stuff,
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.960]   hopefully vice versa, and then--
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.080]   - Well, on your recent Instagram, she said
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.960]   that she loves you, so. - Wow, you were just on,
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.920]   yeah, allegedly, that might all be for, yeah, that's all.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.680]   - How much money did you pay her to say that?
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.120]   - I don't have any 'cause I'm not a standup.
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.800]   I was like, I could do, you got Venmo?
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.040]   - Yeah, yeah. - I only have like $123.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.320]   - I give you some Doge coin. - Yeah, some Doge.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.840]   - Yeah. - You got, you want some Doge?
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.500]   I got some of those monkey NFTs.
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.360]   Oh, before I forget. - Yes.
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.320]   - Hold on a second. - Oh no.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:38.000]   - Put a Doodzy sticker on your microphone if that's okay.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:38.840]   - Sure.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.320]   - Here, oh yeah, now these are tricky
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.000]   'cause I have the thumbs of a,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.320]   I have like Italian sausage thumbs.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.840]   - Don't wait and watch this happen.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.600]   I'm just gonna-- - This'll take another.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.320]   - Yeah, yeah. - Oh man.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.680]   - Yeah, ooh, this is embarrassing.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.000]   Are you good under pressure?
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.600]   'Cause I have anxiety. - Sure, look at me.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:59.760]   - I have performance anxiety.
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.480]   - Do you have anxiety? - Yeah.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.200]   - You have anxiety, period? - Period.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.520]   - Yeah, I-- - Like, I don't like it
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:09.000]   when I, if I have to pee and then everyone's waiting
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.040]   in the urinal. - That sucks.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.480]   - Yeah, I don't like it. - Yeah.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.160]   You know what'll help you in that situation?
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.080]   - What's that? - Taking a shit.
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.080]   'Cause whenever you take a shit, you always pee a little.
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.000]   - It's hard to take a shit while you're standing
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.840]   at a urinal, but. - Not in my world.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:23.960]   - Okay. - You just gotta keep yourself
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.400]   full of things that make you shit.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.240]   - Oh, good. - Have you ever heard
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.060]   of a banana?
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:30.200]   - I did recently, somebody told me about it.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.120]   - Not the showbiz term, I'm talking about the food.
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:33.960]   There you go. - Oh.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.880]   (laughing)
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.720]   - Here we go.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.600]   Which way is up, it's this way, right?
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.640]   - It's like a D, no, spin it, there you go.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.480]   - All right.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:47.120]   Oh, so sexy.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.080]   You're like a brand.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.940]   - Yeah, it's very important to brand yourself.
[00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.160]   These colors. - Are you selling shoes?
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.960]   - Yeah, I got some custom kicks coming out.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.920]   The dudesy, no, actually, that would be a good idea.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.920]   You could probably sell a pair or two of those.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.600]   Speaking of anxiety, I really am only focused
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.160]   on this right now, Lex, I apologize.
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.720]   - Just shit your pants, it'll make you be easier.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.080]   - Get on with it.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.400]   Oh, this thing has been dog-eared in my pocket for a while.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.040]   - I swear this never happens to me, I'm sorry, babe.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.920]   - People don't thumb at a sticker for an hour
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.760]   while they're doing the podcast?
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:20.980]   - No, this is just an excuse you make
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.480]   when you're with somebody and you're underperforming.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.280]   - Well, here's the thing, as you ask me questions
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.520]   that I don't wanna answer, I'll just go to this.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.360]   - Go to the sticker.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:33.040]   - So if this ends up working, then I won't have it as a--
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.240]   - It's funny how you started doing that
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.240]   when we're talking about depression, that's weird.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.080]   - That is weird.
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.080]   - Tell me how that makes you feel.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:44.640]   - Here we are, we got it.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.480]   - For the listener, he succeeded after 10 minutes.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:51.000]   - Yeah, you know, no, I do have some of that stuff.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   Bobby Lee had encouraged me on Wax, as I like to say,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.620]   to talk about it on podcasts, talk about depression,
[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.320]   'cause it could help people, and I said no.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.800]   But it's true, I do have some,
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.800]   there's some history in the family.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.240]   - How do you overcome it?
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.520]   - Well, I used to not believe in medication at all.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.000]   I used to think that that was for someone else
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   who's been diagnosed with some of the rougher stuff,
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.040]   but as I got older, then some of the stuff happens,
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:31.040]   and you have to, and by stuff I mean mental things,
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.820]   mental stuff, and yeah, so I went,
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.680]   I just, I believe that the stigma
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.700]   needs to be removed completely.
[00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:39.700]   - 100%.
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:43.700]   - And so I do therapy, I do talk therapy,
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:47.900]   I'm on a little bit of stuff, which, let me tell you,
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.600]   when I first started it, I was,
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:55.700]   someone I'm close to was like my manager,
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.940]   and she goes, this is too much, but she was like,
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:01.560]   you don't have to white knuckle it through life, right?
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.280]   'Cause I was literally just like,
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:07.080]   everything became really hard to do
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.000]   at a level that I wanted to do it at,
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.680]   even just getting through your day, right?
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:17.540]   And when I first got some of the meds that I'm on,
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:21.400]   it felt like doors and windows were opening
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.560]   literally in my brain.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:26.800]   I took a three-hour nap the first day,
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.460]   and you shouldn't even feel this stuff the first day.
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.500]   I think my brain was like, it was like a sponge,
[00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.640]   it wanted to, I needed some relief,
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.140]   and I'm not a nap guy, I can sleep three hours
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:40.020]   and I'll be fine, but I took a long nap,
[00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:43.100]   and then it started to help.
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:46.260]   - Yeah, isn't that weird how a little bit of chemistry
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:50.060]   in your head can just make the whole world appear
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.540]   so much more beautiful?
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:55.620]   - Yeah, yeah, I mean, after all,
[00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:57.220]   there's a lot going on in your brain
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.300]   that can be changed by your lifestyle,
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.980]   but also so many physical things,
[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:05.220]   like a little bit of meds, or in Bobby's case,
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:08.820]   thumbing around on some dumb farming app.
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:12.220]   - Well, Bobby's gone through a few rough periods
[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:16.580]   with drugs and alcohol and all that kind of stuff,
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:18.820]   and just everything else involved.
[00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:21.020]   I mean, that's the beautiful rollercoaster of who he is,
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.820]   and a lot of great comedians seem to be that way.
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.460]   So I wonder what the connection there is.
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:29.100]   Do you think some level of crazy is required for comedy?
[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.300]   - Yeah. - Or like, at some point.
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:32.140]   - Yes.
[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.800]   - On a scale of one to 10, how much crazy do you have?
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:41.380]   - In some ways, a 10, and in other ways that I think,
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.940]   in other ways, sort of functionally,
[00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:48.500]   I'm like a two or a three, 'cause I don't know.
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:49.900]   - Oh, I see. - I'm from Canada,
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.880]   and I'm, you know, I try to just keep things
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.180]   very even keeled.
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:57.100]   My parents are Italian, they're from Italy,
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.100]   and they grew up during World War II,
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:04.260]   and they're very simple outlook on things.
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:08.340]   They're complex, incredible, classy people
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:12.900]   who are very simple when it comes to a lot of stuff.
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:17.340]   And I think just being a sort of, at heart,
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:21.500]   kind of a timid Canadian, coming out here years ago
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:25.540]   as a kid, it was all I could do
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:28.740]   to just keep everything super normal.
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:32.380]   And then I sort of was able to settle into that
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.700]   as a lifestyle.
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:37.060]   - But you love the idea of being an actor.
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:41.220]   You mentioned John Candy and planes, planes,
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.620]   and automobiles, yeah.
[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:45.020]   It's one of my favorite movies, you said it's one of yours.
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.740]   What do you think that makes that movie work?
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:49.340]   What do you, what?
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.340]   And when you talk about enjoying that movie,
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.940]   do you enjoy just the raw comedy,
[00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:56.700]   or do you enjoy like the friendship
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:01.700]   and the love that's there, even though on the surface,
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.980]   it doesn't make any sense that there should be
[00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:05.500]   a friendship there?
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.180]   - I mean, that's such an important element to that film,
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:11.420]   but you know, as a kid, I just loved the comedy.
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:14.340]   And then it's been a nostalgic favorite of mine,
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:15.860]   like it's my favorite movie.
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:19.900]   But it's also, it's just legit my favorite movie
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.780]   because as you get older and you start watching it,
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:26.460]   you realize it's what John Hughes is the filmmaker
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.580]   and what John Candy particularly,
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:32.260]   and but also Steve Martin are doing in the film
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.780]   that makes it such a work of art,
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:38.780]   which is loneliness is there in every moment of that film.
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:44.540]   And John Candy is, he embodies Del Griffith,
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:46.700]   his character in the film.
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:49.820]   Del Griffith is a lonely guy, and John Candy,
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.140]   but Del Griffith is also a very friendly guy
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:53.940]   and a shower curtain ring salesman
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.180]   and knows everybody in the Midwest
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:57.540]   and runs around to motels
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:00.060]   and has meaningful conversations with the guy,
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.500]   evening Gus, you know, whoever he's talking to.
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:07.140]   But there's loneliness there all the time.
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:10.460]   And, you know, this is a character,
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:12.540]   the film is filled with loneliness
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:15.460]   and it's not until, you know, the second to last scene
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:17.020]   when he's at the train station,
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.180]   Del, what are you doing here?
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:21.460]   You thought I thought you were going home.
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:22.660]   What are you doing here?
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:26.980]   That's a very good Neil, Neil page from the movie.
[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.660]   Thank you.
[00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.100]   That's when you realize how lonely he is.
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:31.700]   - Glad applause in post.
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:32.540]   - Cheers.
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:33.900]   That's when you realize how lonely he is.
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.860]   And I think that's the element from the film that,
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:38.980]   I mean, look, you know, nowadays,
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.980]   I feel like I've been saying this for a long time,
[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:43.780]   but John Candy would have won an Academy Award
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.820]   hands down for that film.
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.460]   It's just, they didn't do that with comedies back then.
[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:49.300]   - Yeah.
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:51.460]   - The year after that movie came out with "Fish Called Wanda".
[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:52.300]   - Yeah.
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.820]   And then it's, I mean, still comedies don't get respected
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:57.100]   enough, Robin Williams, he got,
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:00.820]   I guess he got an Oscar for "Good Will Hunting".
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:04.340]   Jim Carrey, did he ever get an Oscar?
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.180]   - I don't know.
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:06.100]   I don't believe so.
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:09.020]   - Yeah, they don't get, you don't,
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.300]   but that's not even if he did,
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.540]   you wouldn't be for comedies.
[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:15.460]   It's just, I mean, there's some things that are,
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:18.540]   "Plains, Strange and Honorable",
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:20.980]   would you even put that as a, I guess it's a comedy.
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:21.820]   - Yeah, I mean-
[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:24.220]   - But there is a loneliness and depth
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:25.740]   that permeates the whole movie.
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:26.580]   - Yeah.
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:28.220]   - That ultimately, and it's a happy ending,
[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.300]   which is hard to kinda.
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.420]   - It's a happy ending only because
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:35.180]   in the last moment of the movie,
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:38.260]   John Candy puts on a brave face,
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:43.300]   even when he's got no one.
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.140]   - No one.
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.620]   - And he's there seeing Neil Page's entire family
[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.540]   on Thanksgiving and he forces a smile,
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:52.460]   which is the last, literally the last frame of the movie.
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.340]   And I've said before, if you're not reduced
[00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:58.740]   to just a sobbing pile of meat at the end of the movie,
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:29:59.900]   then you are not human.
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:04.340]   Yeah, it is a happy ending.
[00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:09.340]   It's a happy ending, even though it's a sad character.
[00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:10.660]   - Loneliness in the world.
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:12.540]   I was just in Vegas.
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:15.860]   I went to a diner at like 4 a.m., 5 a.m.
[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:17.940]   And there's a waitress, it was empty.
[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.260]   And as a waitress, that was the sweetest,
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.180]   kindest human being.
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:24.100]   Kept calling me sweetheart and all that kinda stuff.
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.700]   Hon.
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.300]   And then after I ate, she sat down
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.060]   and just talked to me a little bit.
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:31.780]   And it was 'cause there was nobody there
[00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:35.060]   and it was just so much sadness in her eyes.
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:36.820]   I don't know, but it's also so much love.
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.060]   Like that sweetheart.
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:43.820]   I mean, it reminded me kind of of the John Candy performance
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:47.780]   because at first, because I was like reading
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:52.780]   a pretty dark book about Hitler.
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:54.900]   So I was a little bit frustrated
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.620]   that she kept talking to me 'cause it was like,
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:01.140]   it was almost like, the same way that John Candy is,
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:02.740]   it's annoying a little bit, right?
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:04.860]   But then very quickly, I opened up to like,
[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.740]   well, there's a kind human being
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:09.580]   and there's like that human connection
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:10.900]   superseded everything else.
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.140]   And I don't know, it was just beautiful.
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:16.420]   And I think John Candy captures that really well,
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:19.620]   which is like the connection with other human beings.
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.660]   Sometimes we pull away from that
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:27.660]   because we have a busy life full of stuff to do
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.220]   as Steve Martin's character,
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:32.180]   kind of characterized he's like a marketing exec
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:33.420]   or something like that.
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.940]   But if you just pause and notice others,
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.860]   you can really discover beautiful people.
[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:40.860]   - Totally, totally.
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:44.020]   Everyone's got, well, I mean, everyone's got their story.
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:49.020]   And Candy as a person, I've never met the man,
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:53.940]   but he's the kind of guy that,
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:56.580]   he could just walk up to, back in the day,
[00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:59.020]   I would imagine he could walk up to just about any house,
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.220]   at least in Canada, knock on the door
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.020]   and you'd invite him in for dinner.
[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:04.140]   You know what I mean?
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:08.260]   So yeah, it's a bit, that, you know,
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.460]   as you're talking about, you know,
[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:12.860]   putting a book down and talking to someone for a while,
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.180]   even though you'd really like to read your book,
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:17.180]   it's like, it's that sort of thing
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:19.260]   that Candy's character in the movie
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:22.140]   sort of does that, like Johnny Appleseed,
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:23.780]   just, you realize he's just going around
[00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:26.460]   making people smile, you know?
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:30.340]   And Neil Page is hanging with this guy, so frustrated.
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:32.540]   He's just, he's so exhausting
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.900]   in his big underwear in the sink at the hotel and everything.
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:39.420]   And by the end of it, he loves this guy, you know?
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:41.300]   So it's a good and a bad thing
[00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:45.060]   that you didn't take that waitress with you on a trip,
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.220]   maybe road trip up to Reno.
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:50.460]   - Oh, oh, she's actually, she's out shopping right now.
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:51.300]   - She's shopping.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.500]   - We've been having sex multiple times a day ever since.
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.500]   - Oh, that's nice, that's lovely, how cute.
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:59.020]   - I'm sure she's married and happily,
[00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:00.820]   and has many grandchildren.
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:05.820]   - Okay, and plus that movie's on Thanksgiving, I think, right?
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:06.900]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:09.900]   - Thanksgiving, so like Thanksgiving just embodies that,
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.060]   forget about the busyness
[00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:16.020]   and the whatever the career you're chasing in life,
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:18.220]   and just take a pause and appreciate the people you love.
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:19.700]   - Just be with your family, yeah.
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.660]   Or the people, whatever your family looks like.
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.340]   - Friends, yeah.
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:26.820]   You have some weird friends, unorthodox friends.
[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:29.700]   So at least in the public sphere.
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:30.540]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:33.380]   - From Bobby Lee, Brian Cowan, all those kinds of folks
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:36.220]   from the Mad TV days, I'm sure there's others.
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:38.260]   What does it mean to be a good friend?
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:39.540]   - Here in LA?
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:40.860]   Or just in general? - In the world.
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:42.140]   - In the world.
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.300]   Will Sasson, world friend. - Is LA somewhat different?
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.380]   - I think it is different here, I think it is.
[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:48.140]   - I think there's a little bit of a career
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:51.500]   kind of negotiation shuffling around, that kind of stuff.
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:52.900]   Why is it different?
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.740]   - Well, I just mean, I mean, I mean
[00:33:55.740 --> 00:34:00.740]   that it's just kind of hard here to make time for everybody.
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:04.580]   It's always been a city to me that is like,
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:06.100]   we'll keep you so busy.
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:08.220]   And every time I go home to Vancouver,
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:11.180]   after a few days I start to get a little stir crazy.
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:15.140]   And I think that being here in LA,
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:17.900]   I go to sleep with a hundred things that I still have to do.
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:20.460]   And you're never out of stuff to do.
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:24.180]   And if you, you know, when you ask about,
[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:26.140]   are you nuts or whatever, if you're crazy,
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:29.260]   I mean, look, every, all the weirdest people
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:31.500]   from every high school in the United States is like,
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:33.740]   yo, I'm gonna make it in LA, you know.
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:35.380]   Everyone just comes here.
[00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:38.860]   And just another freak in the freak kingdom,
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:41.500]   as they say at the end of "Fear and Loathing" in Las Vegas.
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.540]   That was a very good Robin Williams impersonation.
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.140]   That was my Robin Williams as Johnny Depp
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:47.820]   as Hunter S. Thompson.
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:49.540]   It's not your fault, Will.
[00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:50.660]   - It's pretty good. - Thank you.
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:52.940]   - Could have been you, "Fear and Loathing."
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:53.780]   - In "Fear and Loathing?"
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:54.660]   That'd be interesting.
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:56.620]   - I would have liked to play his attorney,
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:00.500]   the role that Benicio Del Toro gained weight for.
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:01.540]   That would have been cool.
[00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:04.580]   He's just, "What's up over the line?"
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:05.900]   Like that, chewing his face off.
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:07.100]   I could have done that.
[00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:11.220]   Yeah, no, I think that it's--
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:12.340]   - Backdoor beauty.
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.540]   That guy's full of good lines.
[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:16.900]   - Yeah, they flip you for real.
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:19.140]   - He's a good actor.
[00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:20.620]   - Yeah, fantastic actor.
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:22.980]   I think what it takes to be a good friend
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:26.460]   is just presence, just being there.
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:29.740]   I mean, that's all anyone needs, to be heard, right?
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:32.460]   In LA, it is interesting.
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:37.700]   I haven't seen people that I love in years, some people.
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:38.580]   - Just busy.
[00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:39.420]   - Yeah, just busy.
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.900]   - Can you still have a depth of connection,
[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:44.380]   even though, like, one of the reasons
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:45.660]   I really enjoy doing a podcast,
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:49.420]   you get to sit down with actual friends of yours
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:51.500]   and spend prolonged periods of time together
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:52.900]   that you don't otherwise.
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:53.740]   - That's a good point.
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:55.180]   - You know, I've spoken on this podcast
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:56.780]   to people really close to me,
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:59.160]   and it's like, you've never had a conversation
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.460]   without microphones like you do with microphones.
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:05.300]   It's weird, but there's some aspect about LA
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:07.660]   that a lot of the, especially friends of yours,
[00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:10.620]   comedians and so on, they'll do podcasts and stuff.
[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:13.220]   And there's, I don't know, there's an intimacy to that.
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:15.140]   - Yeah, there is and there isn't.
[00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:16.900]   The ones that I do, I mean,
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:20.020]   I just did Bobby Lee and Andrew Santino's podcast.
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:21.940]   - Funny enough called "Bad Friends."
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:23.260]   - "Bad Friends."
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:26.780]   And afterwards, and my good pal Chad Colchin,
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:29.900]   with whom I do Doodsy, was with me.
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.420]   - Sneakers are coming soon.
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:32.580]   - Sneakers are coming soon.
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:34.420]   You get your Will foot and your Chad foot,
[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:36.780]   comes in a size 15 and a nine and a half.
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:40.380]   And I remember afterwards we were talking,
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.940]   it was just basically me, Chad, and Santino were talking,
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.940]   and Bobby was over there, you know, on his phone.
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:49.700]   And then I was like, I mean,
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:52.980]   we didn't spend any time talking about anything.
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:56.020]   It feels like one of those hours that goes by
[00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:57.700]   and you realize I've just been goofing around
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:58.540]   with these guys, which--
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:36:59.820]   - But that's what life is about, right?
[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:00.660]   - It's fine. - A little bit.
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:01.500]   - It's great.
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:02.380]   And then I'm like, all right, Bobby,
[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:03.900]   hey, Bob, I'll see you later.
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.500]   And he's like, like this.
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.740]   All right, man, hey, love you, bro, see you later.
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:10.420]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:11.580]   - He's a guy, do you ever just,
[00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:15.340]   I just send text messages over there to him
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.020]   that never come back.
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:19.600]   And then he thinks that I'm angry with him
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.300]   because it's been, you know, it'll go two, three years
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.020]   without him getting back to me.
[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:26.740]   And then just out of nowhere, hey, fuckface.
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:27.860]   And--
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:28.900]   - Who says, hey, fuckface?
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:29.740]   He does or you do?
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:30.860]   Or you both talk to each other?
[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:33.500]   - No, I gotta be very careful with Bobby.
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:35.240]   Yeah, I gotta be very sweet.
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:36.220]   - Dear friend.
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.060]   - Dear friend, hello.
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:37.940]   - How are you doing?
[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:38.760]   - How are you?
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:42.120]   I know I checked in with you, but not but three months ago.
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:45.100]   And then every once in a while, he'll go, hey, fuckface.
[00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.700]   - I tend to hide from the world.
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:50.440]   And I can be pretty shitty with friends, text them back.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:53.520]   Yeah, I can empathize with Bobby.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.920]   Might be a Skyrim thing.
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:58.360]   It might be like hiding in a world,
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.360]   in a digital world with fake NPCs.
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.280]   - Yeah, yeah, there's that.
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.200]   Yeah, you know, I have a buddy
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:10.000]   who said something really smart a while ago.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.440]   We ended up working together on this TV show thing
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.640]   and I reached out to him to see if he wanted
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:16.480]   to do it with us.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:20.160]   And he did, and he goes, this is a great guy,
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.840]   such a funny writer.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.780]   He goes, I may not be in touch all the time,
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:25.360]   but I know who my friends are.
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.200]   You know what I mean?
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.100]   And it's like in our business,
[00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.440]   and this is a fellow who moved,
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:34.000]   who's from Ontario, Canada, moved back there.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.620]   He's on the farm with his wife and kids
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:37.040]   and he does not care.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.840]   He's never been a Hollywood guy.
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.560]   And it's tough to get ahold of him.
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.240]   But when you do, you know, he's still the same
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.360]   sweet old guy, he's doing his thing though.
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:47.840]   - Yeah, yeah, some of my closest friends,
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:50.240]   even if we don't talk for a few months,
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.720]   we're right back at it.
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.560]   And then if shit goes,
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.000]   if something really traumatic happens
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.880]   or difficult stuff or any of that kind of stuff,
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:58.800]   I'm always there.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:01.280]   So for important stuff,
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:04.480]   for important highs and important lows, you're there.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.840]   And then you pick right back up,
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:09.120]   especially if you have those years of experiences together.
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:09.960]   It's interesting.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.080]   - Totally.
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:13.120]   - So you've done a couple of podcasts.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:13.960]   - Yeah.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:16.560]   - So we've got to talk about "Dudesy" a little bit,
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:19.080]   but first, you did for several years,
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.520]   you did the 10-minute podcast.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.360]   - Yeah.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.880]   - I mean, everything is hilarious about that podcast,
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:27.000]   including the fact that it's 10 minutes.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:27.840]   - Right.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.580]   - I mean, it's ridiculous, it's absurd.
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:31.920]   The dynamic is hilarious.
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.840]   It's you, Brian Callen, Chris D'Elia.
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:38.240]   I don't know exactly why it works so well,
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.660]   but it did, it worked really well.
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:41.680]   I think it's because the,
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.360]   yeah, you were having fun probably.
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:46.920]   I mean, that's what really came through,
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.400]   that it was friends just talking shit,
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.440]   and the tension, the beautiful tension,
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.160]   and the absurdity that came out.
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.600]   - Yeah, sure.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.920]   - What was the story of making that podcast?
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.560]   How did that came to be?
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.960]   Why do you think it was as good as it was?
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:02.780]   - I don't know.
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:04.920]   I feel like that podcast was like,
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:09.520]   it was who we kind of are,
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.960]   but on steroids or something.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:16.960]   Like, each person, Brian's gonna be like extra manly.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:21.320]   - Can you get any more manly than he already is?
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.920]   - No, yeah, no, he reaches though.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.480]   And yeah, we just kind of,
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:31.120]   I feel like as goofballs, we knew each other's line.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.240]   Like, here's the line you don't cross.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.600]   I feel like those guys don't really have one,
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.000]   but at least they knew mine.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.920]   And yeah, we were able to just goof around.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:45.480]   And I did it with them for three years,
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:48.240]   and then Chad, who I'm doing dudesy with,
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:49.920]   and my pal Tommy Blacha,
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:53.760]   who's another writer/producer like Chad, they came on.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:58.760]   And yeah, all told, I did like seven years with that thing.
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.820]   Six, five, six, seven, I don't remember.
[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:06.160]   - Do you think it ever comes back in some small form
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:08.580]   as a 20-minute podcast or something like that?
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:12.440]   I mean, is there, 'cause it's one of the most requested.
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:15.120]   I mean, you have a huge fan base.
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.680]   - I'm 47 years old.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:21.220]   So I am of the generation that had a cell phone,
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.820]   has had a cell phone half the time,
[00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:26.400]   and didn't for the formative years of my life
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.080]   into my early 20s.
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:31.920]   And then finally got a, I got a cell phone,
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.400]   I guess I was like 19 or something.
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.160]   Like literally just 'cause of moving to LA.
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.080]   - You got porn in the mail.
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:37.920]   - Yes, that's right.
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:40.160]   It was that hard cover porn.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.120]   That's the way we liked it.
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:46.800]   Bound, nice binding on the porn, leather.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.120]   - Next to the Bible, yeah.
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:48.960]   - Yep.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:52.600]   These are all my, this is my Encyclopedia Britannica.
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:53.840]   Wow, very impressive.
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.160]   Yes, a man came to the house and sold me these.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:00.080]   And then down here, this is my pornography.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:02.800]   If you'll follow me through here to the parlor.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:06.040]   - Let's pass through the generations
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.640]   from grandfather to father.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.880]   - Yeah, I wanna give you something very special
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:10.980]   to me, Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:12.760]   But--
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:15.800]   - So you grew up in a generation without a cell phone.
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.200]   - Yes, it's hard for me to connect with people
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.000]   who hit me up.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.660]   I look at everything as polling.
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:26.520]   So if one person hits me up and shares this opinion,
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:29.120]   but two other people hit me up and share that,
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:32.080]   I'm the worst, I don't follow my polls.
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:35.560]   When people say, "Oh, that poll means absolutely nothing.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:37.560]   "So-and-so's gonna win anyway."
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.880]   That's my poll, my poll means nothing.
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:41.780]   But I do look at the stuff and go,
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:44.320]   this many people are saying this,
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:47.280]   that means that that number is saying that.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:51.280]   And yet it's very hard for me to hear
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.640]   what the hell people are saying online.
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:56.720]   I really, I can't connect to it sometimes personally.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:59.860]   So when you say that that's a popular podcast,
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:02.520]   like I know that it's popular with the people
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:04.520]   that have expressed that they love it.
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:05.360]   - Yeah. - You know what I mean?
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.080]   - What does that actually represent?
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:07.920]   - I don't know.
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.760]   I don't know what kind of people or the audience.
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:10.580]   I don't know.
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:13.040]   I know that the people that listen to the 10 Minute Podcast,
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:16.540]   and if you did, thank you, and we're friends.
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:19.920]   I know that it was a special thing,
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.880]   'cause it was like, "Yeah, just doing this out of my house.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:23.960]   "And we just built it up out of nowhere,
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.160]   "and we're just kind of clowning around."
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:27.600]   It's an odd thing.
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:31.960]   - I hope I, I personally, I think I speak for the two people
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.040]   that have reached out to you that said you should do it,
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.180]   or whatever, three people, the poll.
[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:37.020]   - Yeah.
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:38.360]   - And you should bring it back at some point.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:39.200]   That would be beautiful.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.480]   - Oh my God. - Just maybe,
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:45.000]   it's like, what's a good story of a famous band
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.640]   that came back and was successful?
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:47.480]   Probably, well--
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.320]   - Nirvana?
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.880]   No, it was not.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:50.720]   (laughing)
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:51.560]   It wasn't Nirvana.
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:54.240]   Sorry, I got Nirvana mixed up with Aerosmith.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.080]   - Yeah. - It was Aerosmith.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:55.920]   - Yeah, it was Aerosmith.
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:56.740]   - Yeah. - It was not Nirvana.
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:58.000]   - Yeah, they had that second ride.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:58.840]   - Different, different.
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:01.720]   - Yeah, totally different ending to those two bands.
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:04.760]   One ended up on American Idol.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:08.900]   - Yeah, a lot of interesting women involved in that one too.
[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:12.740]   All right, how did Doodzy come to be?
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:14.500]   - Doodzy-- - And what the hell is Doodzy?
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:16.300]   - Doodzy is the first podcast,
[00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:19.300]   and this is exciting that you've asked me to come here today
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:22.260]   because to hear what you would have to say about it
[00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:23.340]   or what you would ask about it,
[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:26.980]   it is the first podcast that is run completely by,
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:31.160]   and essentially, I like to say curated by, an AI.
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.660]   We were approached by a company
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:35.440]   that had this proprietary AI
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:38.200]   that wants to develop the podcast into the future
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.720]   and figure out exactly what it takes
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:42.840]   to make the best podcast ever.
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:47.840]   And it was all we knew from the top
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:50.240]   and what they really wanted was two people
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:52.280]   who were actually friends
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:55.640]   and could be meaningful in the podcast space
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.560]   based on whatever information they had.
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:00.720]   - Is the company CIA, and are they testing technology
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:03.160]   to control the populace through chatbots?
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.660]   I'm sorry, I'm not at liberty to share that information.
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:07.980]   - You are, yeah, who gave you the suit?
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:09.780]   Where did you get the suit?
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:11.020]   Where did you get the suit, Will?
[00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:12.500]   - Yeah, well, the-- - JC Penney?
[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:14.820]   - CIA stands for something different in here.
[00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:17.940]   I mean, it doesn't mean like a central intelligence agency.
[00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:19.100]   I'm probably just-- - It's a different,
[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:23.420]   it's a Canadian information-- - Canadian International
[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:24.260]   Apparel.
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:26.380]   Yeah, the Canadian International Apparel Company
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:27.900]   hit us up, Chad and I.
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:31.460]   Well, Chad's a super weirdo.
[00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:32.940]   You would get a kick out of him, I know.
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:36.380]   You guys, you strike me as very similar in some ways.
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:37.660]   - I'll take that as a compliment.
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:38.700]   - It is, and it is.
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:40.900]   And it is.
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:42.500]   If I was friends with you for as long
[00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:44.800]   as I've been with Chad, perhaps I'd have some horrible shit
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:48.740]   to say about you, but the good parts, you remind me of him.
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:50.700]   And we were approached by this company
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:52.460]   that said we have this AI
[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:55.700]   and we would like to set it loose on you.
[00:45:55.700 --> 00:46:00.700]   And essentially, we had to hand over some information
[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:04.980]   that would allow the AI to access our email
[00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:07.860]   and look at our search histories, purchase histories,
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:11.060]   things like this, and really dig into--
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:12.860]   - Pornhub included or not?
[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:15.620]   - Yeah, I had to hand over all my leather-bound
[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:18.080]   1970s pornography.
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:22.900]   And essentially, it curates a podcast for us every week
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:26.820]   doing dumb things like, it says, hey, Will,
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:29.900]   you do some shitty Hulk Hogan impersonation,
[00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:33.660]   podcasts about news are very popular, this is infomania.
[00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:34.500]   You know what I mean?
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:35.580]   And it's, oh, let me tell you something
[00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:37.220]   about that Marjorie Taylor Greene dude,
[00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:39.420]   and then he's going on doing some new stuff.
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:42.380]   And it basically just spits out all these things
[00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:45.900]   that it wants us to do, normally four segments, an episode,
[00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:46.820]   and that's pretty much it.
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:48.380]   It just tells us what to do.
[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:49.820]   - It generates the premise.
[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:53.540]   I mean, you've spoken a bit here and there.
[00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:55.540]   Like I said, I'm a huge fan, I don't even remember where,
[00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:59.180]   but you talked about that you enjoy Doodzy
[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:03.400]   because you feel almost like liberated to,
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:06.860]   because you're operating within the constraints
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.500]   of the premise it generates.
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:13.500]   So you're almost not, you're free to riff, essentially.
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.180]   - Yeah.
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:18.260]   - Like you don't need to do the job of like,
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:19.820]   coming up with the weird.
[00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:21.740]   You can just, the weird is given to you,
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:23.220]   and then you just run with it.
[00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:24.420]   - That's a good way to say it,
[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:26.300]   because we're already weird, Chad and I.
[00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:29.540]   Chad can talk for days about all sorts of stuff.
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:31.700]   He's particularly interested in AI lately
[00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:32.900]   and its effect on art.
[00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:36.220]   He is a writer, books, movies, and TV shows.
[00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:40.860]   And I'm primarily acting and trying to come up with stuff.
[00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:42.500]   Stuff I write with Chad's pretty good.
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.020]   The rest of it hasn't seen much success.
[00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:47.340]   Anyway, nor is the stuff with Chad for that matter.
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:49.620]   But that's 'cause of me.
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:51.460]   - Sneakers, you never know.
[00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:53.100]   - Oh, I can't wait for these sneakers.
[00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:54.180]   - Only in two sizes.
[00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:55.260]   - Yeah, only in two sizes.
[00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:57.860]   You're gonna be able to take the tongue.
[00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:00.420]   You can't take it out, 'cause it's actually stitched in.
[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:01.260]   - Yeah.
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:02.080]   - It's pretty cool stuff.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:02.920]   - Velcro?
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:05.820]   Velcro or?
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:06.900]   - Yeah, Velcro.
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:07.940]   Velcro up the side.
[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:10.940]   We're doing some like brand new Kanye stuff.
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:12.740]   Yeah, we want things to look like,
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:15.740]   this is what you'll be wearing on Mars when you get there.
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:16.580]   - So cutting it.
[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:18.940]   So Nike's doing a bunch of research for running,
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:21.500]   how to make a super light shoe that you can be efficient in
[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:23.100]   and break all kinds of running records.
[00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:24.500]   So you're doing the same kind of stuff.
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:25.460]   We're doing the same kind of thing
[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:26.540]   for the podcasting space.
[00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:27.780]   The best kind of shoes to sit around
[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:29.540]   and talk to your pal in.
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:33.060]   But yeah, so this, yeah, it's bizarre.
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:34.380]   And it also does some writing.
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:36.560]   Doodzy does come up with things,
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:40.660]   but not unlike what we're seeing in AI art now.
[00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:41.620]   It's a little bit foggy.
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:44.460]   It's a little bit weird, but it is improving.
[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:47.620]   It is learning about us and writing stuff
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:50.820]   when it makes me spit this and that, which will read,
[00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:54.820]   I've prepared these things for you to read.
[00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:57.460]   It's impossible not to get a kick out of it
[00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:59.140]   'cause Chad and I are, first of all,
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:01.660]   we're blown away that we're doing this.
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:03.140]   And second of all, some of the stuff
[00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:04.540]   is actually very funny.
[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:06.380]   It makes weird names.
[00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:08.080]   Like I don't think it understands,
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:11.820]   it messes up some words and stuff,
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:13.140]   but that makes it even funnier.
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:15.980]   And then it sort of, from the beginning,
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:19.900]   started laying on, like it says astonishing all the time.
[00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:21.260]   Everything is astonishing.
[00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:23.840]   That's Doodzy's favorite word.
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:29.740]   But yeah, it's basically just a way to frame the podcast.
[00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:30.940]   You know what I mean?
[00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:34.740]   Because my thing is, I don't wanna do this,
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:36.660]   where I actually have to talk to someone.
[00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:41.660]   - You seem to feel a burden of the long form conversation.
[00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:45.020]   It seems like, is that really hard work for you?
[00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:45.860]   - No, not at all.
[00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:47.380]   It's just that I don't like to bore people.
[00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:49.500]   And I feel like if I go on and,
[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:53.200]   I like to provide value for what I am.
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:57.460]   Your value with regard to this project
[00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:00.420]   is obviously warranted.
[00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:02.700]   - I'm waiting for the explanation
[00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:04.540]   for what the value is exactly.
[00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:05.660]   Two dudes in a suit.
[00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:06.620]   - No, listen.
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:07.860]   Yeah, two dudes in a suit.
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:10.060]   No, but I mean, you've got your audience
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:11.300]   and that's the end of that.
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:12.740]   People find value in it.
[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:16.460]   For me, I do feel like I'm,
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:20.220]   it is important that I,
[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:24.740]   if I'm gonna do something that is gonna be funny
[00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:26.820]   or that I hope is funny,
[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:30.820]   I just kinda wanna get in and out of someone's day
[00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:33.100]   and just kinda, I like making,
[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:34.300]   I like making laughy.
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:36.280]   I want people to, whatever.
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:38.180]   It's the same thing that anyone else will tell you.
[00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:40.380]   - Yeah, but in the long form, you feel the anxiety.
[00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:42.180]   You did a few funny things
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:44.380]   and I wonder if I can keep doing the funny thing.
[00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:46.880]   Is that why you feel the,
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:50.160]   like why is Dudesy relieving you of some of the anxiety?
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:54.020]   - Well, in some ways it gives me anxiety
[00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:56.320]   because I don't know what's coming.
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:57.640]   And that's weird for me
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:01.380]   because I like to prepare for things,
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:04.360]   but it's, that's not what podcasting is.
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:07.020]   Podcasting, you need to just be malleable
[00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:09.120]   and say whatever and do whatever.
[00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:13.820]   And that's what makes it a real,
[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:16.180]   I mean, it's, look, it's a medium for conversation.
[00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:18.140]   And if you're driving along,
[00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:19.940]   listening to this or anything else,
[00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:23.820]   it is that, it's the true meaning
[00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:25.100]   of the parasocial relationship
[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:27.180]   because the best podcasts make you feel
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:29.080]   like you're sitting around rapping.
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:30.620]   We're just having a conversation.
[00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:32.100]   You could even be sitting there agreeing
[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:34.300]   or talking out loud to yourself if you want.
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:35.500]   - I could just be sitting in silence.
[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:36.860]   - Or you could just be sitting in silence
[00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:39.420]   in your fancy podcasting shoes.
[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:42.420]   Podcasting audience shoes is a very different build
[00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:43.860]   than running shoes.
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:45.980]   - Would they be also called doodzy, the shoes?
[00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:47.940]   - Yeah, they'll be doodzy shoes.
[00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:49.540]   - Doodzy shoes, that's very creative.
[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:50.780]   - Yeah.
[00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:54.140]   Well, one thing the AI isn't good at yet is branding.
[00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:55.780]   Everything is just doodzy this and that.
[00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:57.660]   - I would argue that's pretty good branding.
[00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:58.900]   I don't know. - Yeah, well,
[00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:00.460]   doodzy allows me to just,
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:03.740]   it forces me to sit down with Chad
[00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:07.780]   and goof around for an hour or an hour plus
[00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:12.780]   and it provides the parameters that I a lot of times ignore
[00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:16.300]   because I think that podcasting is just two dudes
[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:18.380]   shitting around or three or four.
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:23.380]   But it sits me down and gives me a premise
[00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:25.580]   to work with communically.
[00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:26.420]   - And then you just riff with it.
[00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:27.940]   - Yeah, it's fun.
[00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:29.220]   It's been a hoot.
[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:31.140]   - So from the acting perspective,
[00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:34.140]   you know, a lot of people like Daniel Day-Lewis
[00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:36.880]   will see acting just like as you described,
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:38.980]   which is you have your roles,
[00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:40.860]   you embrace those roles and then you disappear.
[00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:44.140]   You don't do podcasts,
[00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:45.900]   you don't do any of that kind of stuff.
[00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:47.580]   Your art is your art.
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:51.540]   So is that part of you feels that way?
[00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:53.180]   - I think so.
[00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:54.380]   - Is that the actor side of you?
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:55.340]   - Yeah.
[00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:56.720]   Anytime I get to do something
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:59.980]   that I don't get a chance to do much of
[00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:03.060]   or something that people haven't seen me do much of
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:04.660]   or that I've done on some scale
[00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:06.320]   that hasn't been very wide
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:08.020]   and not a lot of people have seen it,
[00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:10.480]   that's the stuff that I get really excited about.
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:14.820]   I don't know why I'm,
[00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:17.420]   I don't know why necessarily.
[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:19.120]   I haven't answered that question yet in my life,
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:20.880]   like what it is about being an actor
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:22.940]   that I love so much
[00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:25.260]   because it's not like I don't like to,
[00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:27.260]   it's not like I'm trying to get away from myself
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:30.000]   and play other characters and stuff and not be myself.
[00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:33.540]   But it is, it has always been fun
[00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:37.740]   to just be other people and escape.
[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:39.740]   - Yeah, is there some aspect to the impressions
[00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:42.900]   where you become that person?
[00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:45.980]   Is that like, what's that like to,
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:48.740]   I suppose acting is the full on version
[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:53.740]   that you really at its best become the character.
[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:55.820]   Is there some fun in that?
[00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:56.980]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:59.140]   If you can play a character for long enough
[00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:02.480]   and then jump out of it,
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:05.720]   that's a lot of fun.
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:08.700]   Like I did this movie like four or five years ago
[00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:12.700]   called "The Inside Game" about the NBA gambling scandal,
[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:15.900]   that there's a Netflix documentary about it right now.
[00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:20.900]   And that character, I played Jimmy Batista,
[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:25.100]   Baba the sheep, who's, you know,
[00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:27.460]   this guy who was this bookie and rah, rah, rah.
[00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:30.940]   It's a very, he's, there's a lot going on with him.
[00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:34.460]   He's, you know, he's running numbers with the mob and stuff
[00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:36.740]   and there's a lot of money changing hands.
[00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:39.540]   That character was so, I got to be,
[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:41.140]   get so deep into that character
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:43.820]   that coming out of it was a little odd.
[00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:45.400]   Or as weird as this sounds,
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:48.380]   the three stooges was hard for me to,
[00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:52.980]   I found that I had some of Curly's mannerisms
[00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:55.940]   just automatically, I could not stop them.
[00:54:55.940 --> 00:54:58.280]   When people, when I would talk to people,
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:00.260]   they would come, I wasn't,
[00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:02.300]   I'm not doing it on purpose, I don't want to do that.
[00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:04.500]   Like I'm ready to shed it
[00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:07.100]   'cause I've been working on it
[00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:09.040]   for months and months at that point
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:10.580]   as far as getting the thing down
[00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:12.500]   and then you got to shoot.
[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:14.520]   And then for me, it's always,
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:17.260]   I always want to change the stuff I did the day before.
[00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:18.660]   I'm like that, where I'm like,
[00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:20.420]   I could have done it better and this and that.
[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:21.500]   And--
[00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:23.580]   - That stayed with you, that character stayed with you.
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:24.620]   - Totally, yeah.
[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:27.020]   - I just feel like with actors,
[00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:29.260]   sometimes when you listen to interviews,
[00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:31.780]   they've spent so much time
[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:34.540]   sort of living inside other characters
[00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:37.640]   that they almost don't have a depth
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:40.420]   of personality themselves, like a depth.
[00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:42.140]   Like, I don't mean that as a negative thing,
[00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:44.460]   it's just like, it feels like the art form at its best
[00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:46.100]   is pretending to be other people.
[00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:49.580]   And even pretending sounds negative, but like--
[00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:50.420]   - No, pretending.
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:52.300]   - Bringing certain characters to life.
[00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:53.940]   - Yeah, yeah, embodying-- - That's the art form.
[00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:55.020]   Embodying.
[00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:57.300]   - A weird thing happened while we were doing stooges
[00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:59.740]   'cause you've got a very heavy blueprint.
[00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:02.220]   We're following this very clear blueprint
[00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:04.900]   that the stooges left for everybody.
[00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:07.700]   And for stooge fans and people enjoying the movie,
[00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:10.340]   it's gotta be this, you take your toolbox
[00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:12.500]   that you're used to bring into a comedy movie,
[00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:14.460]   you leave it behind.
[00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:16.500]   The only tools I'm bringing are the ones that he used.
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:20.240]   And a weird thing started happening where I would,
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:21.940]   I always saw the whole thing happening
[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:24.580]   with the real stooges in black and white.
[00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:26.420]   So if we're about to shoot a scene,
[00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:28.500]   I would just think about,
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:30.340]   I mean, aside from all the other preparation,
[00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:32.100]   you know everything and what you're supposed to do.
[00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:34.260]   And I've been watching so much of it.
[00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:36.820]   And the three of us were pretty much left
[00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:40.540]   to come up with a lot of the striking combinations
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:42.260]   and all the stuff, which is all real smack
[00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:43.540]   and all this crap.
[00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:46.340]   And the stuff that we were doing that was very stoogey,
[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:48.060]   you're preparing all that stuff.
[00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:49.380]   But something else was happening
[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:51.020]   before you jump into a scene
[00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:53.420]   and the unknown of now we're shooting it
[00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:57.580]   and here are these parameters within to shoot this scene.
[00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:00.260]   I could still see it as them doing it.
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:02.940]   So much so that when I saw the movie at the premiere,
[00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:05.220]   I was like, who's this big fuck doing?
[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:06.980]   'Cause I'm not curly to me.
[00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:08.500]   Curly is curly.
[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:09.340]   But I feel like--
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:11.220]   - So you're seeing yourself in black and white almost.
[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:12.820]   - I was seeing him.
[00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:14.460]   Yeah, I was only seeing him.
[00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:16.500]   - So channeling in some fundamental way.
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:19.140]   - In some weird way you're channeling him
[00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:21.100]   because you've seen so much of it.
[00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:25.140]   The only thing you know about Jerome Lester Horwitz
[00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:27.300]   is curly.
[00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:29.580]   I'm not saying he was exhumed or something
[00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:30.540]   or a spirit went in him
[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:33.380]   or some weird crystal mommy shit like that.
[00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:36.580]   I'm saying that this, because you know so much of it
[00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:39.580]   and because of the heavy blueprint that they left with you,
[00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:44.740]   you're channeling what that person does.
[00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:49.660]   And I was seeing entire scenes before you do them,
[00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:50.980]   the way he would do it.
[00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:52.300]   And then you want a couple takes
[00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:54.500]   to make sure that you're doing it right.
[00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:57.740]   But that one was hard to let go of.
[00:57:57.740 --> 00:57:59.260]   Some of them are.
[00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:01.140]   - Do you think Larry David, who was also in there,
[00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:03.780]   dressed as a nun, also had trouble letting go of that?
[00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:05.700]   We mentioned clothes make the man.
[00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:08.020]   Do you think that worked for him in that case?
[00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:09.940]   - Man, you know, he--
[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:11.300]   - What was it like working with the guy?
[00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:13.140]   - Come on, he's the greatest.
[00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:16.660]   And he's a big Stooge fan.
[00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:18.900]   And him and Pete Fairley are good friends.
[00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:20.500]   But then Larry David has to show up
[00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:22.820]   and hang out with us for a couple weeks.
[00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:25.660]   He's like, "I didn't realize it was gonna take this long."
[00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:27.980]   But, "Ah shit, I gotta be out here in Atlanta.
[00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:29.820]   "It's boiling hot."
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:33.940]   But at one point, there was this line where he kept doing,
[00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:35.580]   he would just spit a different line every time.
[00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:37.100]   He was like getting hit in the head with something.
[00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:39.380]   He's laying there on the ground and he goes,
[00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:42.140]   he like comes to and he says, at one point he goes,
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:46.580]   "Miami audiences are the best audiences in the world."
[00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:47.420]   Right?
[00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:48.660]   And 'cause he's loopy.
[00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:53.580]   Now he's playing a nun at the orphanage
[00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:55.540]   where the three Stooges grew up.
[00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:57.540]   And I'm super intimidated by Larry David.
[00:58:57.540 --> 00:58:58.740]   He's a genius and stuff.
[00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:02.340]   But I walk up to him and I go,
[00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:05.980]   "So what is he, like a Borscht Belt Florida comedian
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:07.940]   "who is on the lamb?"
[00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:09.500]   And so he's dressing as a woman.
[00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:11.300]   He ends up at an orphanage.
[00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:12.540]   Like what's going on there?
[00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:15.100]   And he just, and he looks at me and he just goes,
[00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:15.940]   "Yeah."
[00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:18.380]   (laughing)
[00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:19.220]   I'm like, "Yeah."
[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:20.780]   He's got some like actor motivation.
[00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:24.340]   Like, of course he looks, it's Larry David
[00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:26.820]   in a nun's habit, which is hilarious.
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:29.860]   That's such a Pete Farrelly casting thing.
[00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:32.780]   It's, you know, and he, but he's doing this whole like,
[00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:34.220]   "What a warm audience."
[00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:37.420]   You know, like, "Oh, he's like this cat skill comedian
[00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:39.140]   "who's been living in, you know,
[00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:40.380]   "Folk of Raton." - So that's what he's like
[00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:41.740]   living through in his mind
[00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:43.300]   is he's having fun with it, right?
[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:46.620]   - I mean that and probably a combination of that
[00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:48.140]   and getting the lines right.
[00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:49.580]   'Cause he's like, "What are we doing here?
[00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:52.100]   "What is," you know, just frustrated all day
[00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:53.740]   with what the heck we're trying to do.
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:54.580]   - What do you think makes,
[00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:58.380]   I mean, that guy is one of the best improv people ever.
[00:59:58.380 --> 00:59:59.220]   - Yeah.
[00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:00.300]   - So what do you think makes him so good?
[01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:04.140]   Like, why is it so compelling to watch that guy?
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:05.440]   - Because he's a comedic genius.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.740]   Like he literally, he knows what he does.
[01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:10.380]   He's been a writer for 50 years or whatever.
[01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:13.540]   And he's, and he just happens to be that brilliant.
[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:15.880]   I mean, I've gotten a chance just to do,
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.760]   I did just an episode of "Curb," a small part.
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:21.420]   And it's crazy what he sees.
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:22.860]   I don't know what he sees.
[01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:25.860]   As a matter of fact, so I auditioned for it,
[01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:28.660]   for "Curb," like, you know, two or three times, right?
[01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:30.140]   And never got anything.
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:32.900]   And then it was only after working with him on "The Stooges"
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:35.420]   that I got a call to do a bit part.
[01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:39.260]   But I remember auditioning, you go into that room
[01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:43.660]   and the guys waiting are all people that you know.
[01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:44.500]   You're like, "Oh, I know them.
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:45.860]   "I know her, I know him."
[01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:50.260]   And so I went in, I auditioned for this part.
[01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:53.540]   And the only thing I know of the thing is like,
[01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:56.960]   "Okay, so you really wanna go to this play with me.
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.440]   "You really wanna go to this play.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:00.900]   "When you hear that I have an extra ticket,
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:02.620]   "you sincerely wanna think."
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:03.780]   And I'm like, "Got it."
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:05.260]   And so- - That's the premise.
[01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:06.220]   - The premise of the scene.
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:07.060]   - And that's all you know.
[01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:07.880]   - It's all I know.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.260]   And so he goes, he does his bit
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:11.820]   and I'm just supposed to come in and interrupt.
[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:13.940]   And I'm like, "Excuse me, I couldn't help
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:15.940]   "but hear you guys were talking about,
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:18.420]   "whatever the play was, Death of a Salesman.
[01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:21.280]   "I am a huge fan of that play.
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:24.180]   "I mean, if you're looking for someone to take a ticket,
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.100]   "I would love to go.
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:27.420]   "My name is so-and-so by the way."
[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:29.700]   And he goes, "I'm gonna stop you, I'm gonna stop you."
[01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:32.860]   And I'm like, he goes, "You really,
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:35.060]   "I mean, you truly wanna go to this play."
[01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:36.820]   And I go, "Yes, yes, sir."
[01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:38.280]   "You really wanna go.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:41.380]   "You actually, this is, you would love to do this."
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:44.220]   I go, "Okay, let's try it again."
[01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:45.060]   So then he's like, "No, no, no."
[01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:47.000]   And I go, "Hey, excuse me, I'm sorry,
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:47.840]   "I don't mean to interrupt.
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:50.480]   "I was just, I couldn't help but overhear.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:52.200]   "You have tickets to the thing.
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.960]   "I am the biggest fan of that.
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:54.940]   "I do the same thing.
[01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:57.060]   "I'm gonna stop you again, okay?
[01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:59.820]   "I mean, you really wanna go to this."
[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:02.300]   And I'm just like, he's fucking with me, right?
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:04.220]   I remember Jeff Garland was sitting there in the audition.
[01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:06.260]   He goes, "He did it, he said it, what?"
[01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:07.980]   "Shut up, hold on, listen.
[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:10.020]   "You really wanna go, okay."
[01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:12.380]   Three or four times, there I am.
[01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:13.580]   I couldn't help but notice it.
[01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:15.420]   And then I do it again.
[01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:16.980]   I guess I shit the bed 'cause he looks at me,
[01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:20.060]   he just goes, "Okay, all right.
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:21.980]   "Okay, well, thanks for coming up."
[01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:23.460]   And that was it, and I didn't get it.
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:25.660]   So I still, I don't know what the heck that guy's thinking.
[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:27.940]   He sees, he's in the matrix.
[01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:30.460]   I don't know what the heck Larry David sees.
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:31.280]   You know what I mean?
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.060]   - He wanted, what, some kind of more desperation
[01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:35.340]   or something like this?
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:37.300]   - He wanted a level of sincerity
[01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:39.500]   that I thought I was bringing.
[01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:41.020]   And I guess I was wrong.
[01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:41.860]   I don't know.
[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:46.020]   - Maybe go crazy, like what does it mean to really want?
[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:48.220]   - Yeah, I should have grabbed him by the scruff of the neck
[01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:50.340]   and go, "Listen, dad, you're bringing me
[01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:52.020]   "to this fucking play."
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:53.100]   I would have got the part.
[01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:55.480]   As a matter of fact, I heard about someone else,
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.920]   and I don't know who the heck this was.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:59.860]   I forget who it was, but I've heard this story
[01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:02.540]   from a couple different people that there's this actor,
[01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:04.520]   and I don't remember who it was.
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:06.420]   If I did, I probably wouldn't say it out loud anyway.
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:07.940]   But he-- - Brad Pitt.
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:09.940]   - It was Brad Pitt, and he was in this audition,
[01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:12.180]   and there it was out in the hall.
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:15.060]   He's like, "Holy shit, George Clooney, Leo DiCaprio."
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:18.700]   And this actor went in, and he did the thing,
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:22.260]   and Larry David was like, "Yeah, why don't you try it again?"
[01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:24.680]   And he got a couple takes in, and he went,
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.460]   "I don't think this is for me."
[01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:29.280]   And he left, which an actor never does.
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:32.700]   And as the story goes, Larry David shouted after him,
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:34.800]   "I respect that!"
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:36.460]   Which I think is true, and I wanna believe
[01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:38.240]   that entire story is true.
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.620]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:43.340]   Sounds like something Larry David made up.
[01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:46.720]   - Bobby Lee told me that story, so we can't trust that.
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:50.020]   - What about impressions?
[01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:53.260]   Is there similarity between that and acting?
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:59.220]   Is there some fundamental way in which you become the person?
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:00.940]   - If you have a couple of the things,
[01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:02.300]   you can just fill in the blanks.
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:05.060]   And I think the illusion is that people think
[01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:09.220]   that that person would say that and do that,
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:11.020]   and that's where the illusion of,
[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:12.820]   oh, he really embodies the character.
[01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:16.100]   It's like, once you know someone's mannerisms,
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:20.580]   you can essentially portray a person from the outside in,
[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:22.820]   'cause you have all the stuff on the outside,
[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:24.980]   and you can do it and complete the illusion.
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:28.460]   - And if it's for humor's sake, you're gonna caricature it,
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:32.100]   therefore making the whole illusion stronger.
[01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:34.420]   - And also weirder.
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:36.100]   Like I like to, on Mad TV,
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:37.460]   if I did something two or three times,
[01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:40.340]   I'd get bored of it and I'd start changing it.
[01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:42.620]   Now he talks like this, and it's like, what are you doing?
[01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:43.900]   I'm like, I don't know, it's fucking,
[01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:46.340]   no one's late at night, do whatever you want.
[01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:50.460]   - But people still kinda know that character,
[01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:52.900]   especially if you just call it out.
[01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:55.000]   - There aren't many impersonations
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:59.220]   that I listen to myself do and go, ooh, that's a good one.
[01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:03.140]   A lot of people, like I think Frank Caliendo
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:05.980]   is like the greatest impersonator of all time.
[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:07.420]   He's the best, period. - It's ridiculous.
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:08.660]   - It's ridiculous.
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:11.680]   And he's got a record button and a broadcast ability
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:13.620]   that nobody has.
[01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:18.340]   He's cracked impersonations that I'm like,
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:22.660]   how does he find, he's got such an ear,
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:24.560]   but then he's got all the other tools.
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:29.760]   I remember actually, my last season of Mad TV
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.780]   was also his first season.
[01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:34.060]   He comes up to me when I met him,
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:35.740]   and we're just up there in the writers' offices,
[01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:37.060]   and he goes, hey, nice to meet you.
[01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:38.380]   And he goes, Louis Anderson,
[01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:39.700]   'cause I was doing a Louis on the show.
[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:41.060]   And he goes, Louis Anderson.
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:41.900]   I go, yeah.
[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:43.620]   He goes, yeah, you're doing it wrong.
[01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:45.860]   I was like, oh, am I, Junior?
[01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:47.980]   And he goes, yeah, 'cause you do this,
[01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:49.980]   but you gotta start up here.
[01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:51.380]   I was like, oh my God, can I use that?
[01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:52.340]   Of course.
[01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:54.820]   And then we became fast friends.
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:56.260]   - John Madden is amazing.
[01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:59.100]   - Ridiculous. - It's ridiculous.
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:01.500]   He really, really, really embodies the person.
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.580]   And sometimes not even with a caricature.
[01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:05.380]   It's like, it becomes the person.
[01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:06.660]   So strange. - Totally.
[01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:11.780]   I kind of feel like, do the impersonation,
[01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:13.980]   and then not forget you're doing it,
[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:15.580]   but forget everything else.
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:17.660]   Just goof around.
[01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:20.700]   Of course, to me, it's funny when you sound like someone,
[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:23.340]   and you're saying the shit that they would never say.
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:27.020]   Well, then there's no, you're letting go of that part,
[01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:30.140]   that tool in illusion that keeps people in.
[01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:32.580]   But to me, it doesn't matter 'cause it's funnier.
[01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:33.940]   So. - What was the hardest
[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:35.300]   impression for you to work on?
[01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:38.500]   I mean, somebody you struggled with the most.
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:41.140]   - I'll never forget, I had to do a Michael Caine
[01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:43.860]   in my first season at MADtv.
[01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:45.380]   It never got good.
[01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:46.660]   It never got good.
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:50.060]   All week, it wasn't good.
[01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:51.140]   We shot it.
[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:52.700]   The first take, it was shit.
[01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:55.340]   Second, third, and fourth, it was all shit.
[01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:57.180]   - Well, his voice is really important, right?
[01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:58.020]   - Yeah.
[01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:00.020]   - What is it like, it's like doing an impression
[01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:01.820]   of Morgan Freeman or somebody like that.
[01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:02.660]   - Yeah.
[01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:03.500]   - Yeah.
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.020]   - If you can, get the voice.
[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:05.980]   (imitates trumpet)
[01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:07.700]   That's my Morgan, here's my Morgan Freeman.
[01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:08.540]   (imitates trumpet)
[01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:09.540]   Andy Dufresne.
[01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:10.380]   - Yeah.
[01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:12.460]   - Um, G. Juan Tonejo.
[01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:13.980]   - Yeah, I like your trump too.
[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:15.300]   I don't know where I heard it,
[01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:18.620]   but it's, like, I love the impressions you do
[01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:20.500]   that don't sound anything like the original person.
[01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:21.460]   - I can't do trump.
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:22.820]   I do.
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:23.740]   - That's why it's hilarious.
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:24.580]   - Absolutely.
[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:27.580]   My trump now, I say, just sounds like a fat B
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:28.780]   'cause it's just, (imitates trumpet)
[01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:30.140]   - Yeah, exactly, that's the.
[01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:31.580]   - And everybody's.
[01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:32.420]   (imitates trumpet)
[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:33.500]   - A little drunk, a little drunk.
[01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:35.140]   - Yeah, just a little slurry.
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:35.980]   - Yeah.
[01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:39.140]   - Yeah, I dig doing impersonations and then not,
[01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:42.020]   like, just making it whoever.
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:42.860]   - Yeah.
[01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:43.700]   - Yeah.
[01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:44.540]   - It's just funny.
[01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:45.620]   - That'll be the title of my book.
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:47.100]   - Muck Kane.
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:50.460]   So, Kane was the one you really struggled with.
[01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:52.140]   - Yeah, it was terrible, it was terrible.
[01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:56.020]   And I could only hold my head a certain way to do it
[01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:58.940]   'cause I had gotten locked into this research tape
[01:07:58.940 --> 01:07:59.980]   that I watched.
[01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:01.780]   Back then they would give us, you know,
[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:02.820]   now there's the internet.
[01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:05.660]   But back then, if you were gonna do an impersonation,
[01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:10.660]   the research department would give you a VHS tape.
[01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:13.020]   And I remember I got this VHS tape
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:15.660]   of Michael Kane's acting school,
[01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:17.700]   like this acting class he did.
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:19.180]   He's like, "Right, you know, if you're looking
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:21.540]   "at the left eye and the camera's over here,
[01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:23.340]   "say, then the left eye.
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:25.460]   "So you wanna look at that left eye for hours,
[01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:26.420]   "you know?"
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:29.780]   And so I was like stuck in this weird thing
[01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:31.300]   that made no sense.
[01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:32.660]   And it was terrible.
[01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:36.780]   - So the actual process is the recording, the broadcast.
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:37.620]   - Yeah.
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:40.660]   - I was a wonder like what the process is to do
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:43.100]   like a Frank Caliendo level impression.
[01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:46.300]   Is it like listen to a lot of footage?
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:50.620]   - I think he, I think, I mean, speaking for myself,
[01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:52.620]   I think you either have it or you don't.
[01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:55.740]   Like you know if you can do this one or you can't.
[01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:58.860]   I think that process for him is lightning quick.
[01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:03.860]   But I also think he can look at someone who he does not do
[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:07.900]   and then by the end of the afternoon, he can do it.
[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:12.900]   - Maybe you have an intuition who he can do.
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:16.340]   So the question that applies there is,
[01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:20.060]   I mean, speaking of doozy, is it possible
[01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:21.100]   to capture the essence?
[01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:24.380]   How difficult is it to capture the essence of a human being?
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:26.340]   When you're doing impressions,
[01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:28.580]   you know that we are moving towards a future
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:32.220]   when AI potentially, this kind of avatar world
[01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:36.500]   where we're going to have AI representatives of who we are.
[01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:39.700]   The really interesting one is after we pass away,
[01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:42.940]   sort of our relatives may want us to stick around
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:43.900]   in some form.
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:44.740]   - Yeah.
[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:47.260]   - And you know, at one sense that might be scary,
[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:48.620]   but in one sense it's kind of beautiful
[01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:51.820]   because the essence of the human being persists
[01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:54.340]   so you can still bring joy to the people that love you
[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:55.380]   and that kind of stuff.
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:57.420]   How difficult is it to capture that?
[01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:00.620]   Like if you were to try to capture yourself,
[01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:03.300]   you think how difficult would it be for an AI system
[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:06.980]   to create a Will Sasso avatar that persists?
[01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:09.060]   - Well, I think it's impossible.
[01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:10.860]   I think it's absolutely impossible.
[01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:14.980]   I'll get into arguments about this stuff with Chad
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:17.320]   on the show almost every episode.
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:21.280]   Lately with, you know, mid journey and Dali
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:24.240]   and all the art of AIs.
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:27.080]   And now it's moving into video and Chad would maintain,
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:29.840]   hey, pretty soon we're not going to need Netflix.
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.560]   You're just going to go, I want to see Stallone
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:33.480]   do this movie and it's about this.
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:34.480]   And he plays that.
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.200]   And then here it comes and you watch it.
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:40.600]   I don't think that that crosses over
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:42.220]   to the human experience.
[01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:46.520]   This is also a guy I like to bug Chad and say
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:48.960]   that he wears a tag around his neck
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.860]   'cause he wants to be cryogenically frozen.
[01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:51.700]   And it's all set up.
[01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:54.600]   He's at the, it's somewhere in Arizona or something.
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:55.440]   - Yeah.
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:56.280]   - I forget what it's called.
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:57.680]   - All the fun things are in Arizona.
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:00.400]   - Yeah, and he's got literally the tag around his neck,
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.800]   which I say, if I'm around when you die,
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.920]   I will rip that off for you.
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.360]   I'll put you in my garage freezer.
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:07.560]   And then 24 hours later,
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:09.400]   I'll saw your head off with a bread knife
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:11.000]   and I'll deliver that to whomever.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.160]   And it's not, you're not coming back, okay?
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:17.680]   He's like, yes, we are living forever,
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.200]   whether we like it or not.
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:21.320]   And I disagree.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.100]   I don't think you can find,
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:26.200]   if I did stand up,
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:28.720]   then there would be enough information for an AI
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:30.320]   to completely duplicate me.
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:31.400]   'Cause I'm up on stage,
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:33.200]   just clearing my throat all over people
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.480]   doing therapy that way.
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:35.320]   - Yeah.
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:37.760]   - And people paying a two drink minimum to hear it.
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:40.480]   But as it stands, unless it's something like Doodsy,
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.800]   an AI that literally has access
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:45.800]   to everything that I've shared,
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.400]   everything that is observable,
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:49.480]   even the stuff where our phones are,
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:52.580]   or the NSA or whatever it is listening to us,
[01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:54.520]   finding out what algo to punch us into
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.960]   and what shoes to buy on Instagram.
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:59.840]   I still don't think it's gonna have enough information
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:03.860]   to duplicate me, especially to my family or my friends.
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:05.840]   It's gonna be like that Black Mirror episode
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:08.880]   where the gal brings her guy back.
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:11.920]   And then after a while, he gets pretty creepy.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:13.120]   You know, they have--
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.840]   - But it's also possible that
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:18.640]   if you interviewed your friends and family,
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:20.000]   what they love about you,
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.160]   the things they would list is pretty, it's a small list.
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:27.600]   They love you deeply, but the list is small.
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.760]   Like the thing that really we appreciate
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.380]   about each other is pretty small.
[01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:36.380]   That said, to deliver on that small quirks and uniqueness,
[01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:39.520]   it might require some deep intelligence
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:41.120]   that only humans currently possess.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:41.960]   - That's a really good point.
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:44.560]   Do you think that it's gonna be possible
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:47.120]   to keep a person around?
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:48.520]   - Yes, I think.
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:52.600]   I think it'll be definitely possible
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:53.960]   to keep the essence of a person
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:57.000]   in a digital world pretty soon, yeah.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.800]   And I think they're gonna start to have questions
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:02.200]   about what are the ethics of that,
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:04.020]   what are the rules around that?
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:06.640]   Because if you can have digital forms of Will Sasso,
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:08.160]   the kind of things that people would wanna do
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:10.780]   with their Will Sasso, in the virtual world,
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:11.840]   I can only imagine.
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:12.680]   - Sure.
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:16.080]   - Probably porn and sexual kinds of things.
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:17.640]   - Yeah, my stuff, then that's just
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:19.240]   'cause I'm an international sex symbol,
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:20.280]   so I'm okay with it.
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:24.760]   How do you feel about sentience?
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:27.160]   Like when it comes to, because again,
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:29.120]   my pal Chad will be like, you know,
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:30.440]   speaking of Black Mirror,
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:34.360]   he's with that San Junipero episode, School of Thought,
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:37.480]   where there's gonna be some effing mainframe somewhere
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:40.780]   or some matrix-like structure built into the sky.
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:42.840]   And as I like to say, everyone just sitting there
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:45.180]   pissing and shitting in their blue matrix gel
[01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:47.180]   in a little fishbowl.
[01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:49.100]   Do you think that we can upload consciousness?
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:51.140]   Do you think that'll ever be possible?
[01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:51.980]   - Well, I don't know.
[01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:53.260]   I just talked to Ray Kurzweil.
[01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:54.820]   I don't know if you know who he is,
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:58.340]   but he, singularity and all that kind of stuff.
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:01.840]   So he's very, still holds onto in 2045,
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:04.620]   there'll be a singularity, which essentially,
[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:07.620]   he's been predicting that for the last 20 years,
[01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:11.460]   and so now it's 2045's in another 20 years.
[01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:15.180]   I think uploading consciousness
[01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:17.140]   is extremely, extremely difficult.
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:20.160]   I think creating a copy of you
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:25.160]   such that it creates a convincing replica is much easier.
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:30.820]   But uploading your actual brain into the cloud,
[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:34.060]   I think is really, really, really difficult,
[01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:37.000]   because the entire evolution of life on earth
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.900]   is the process by which we create the brain.
[01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:42.380]   Just short-cutting that, it just seems extremely difficult.
[01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:47.180]   Our brain is the most marvelous and complicated machine
[01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:48.900]   that we know of in the universe.
[01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:52.340]   To duplicate that is extremely difficult.
[01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:55.380]   That said, I just feel like you can summarize
[01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:58.020]   a lot of really important aspects of a person's life
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:00.180]   such that it captures their essence,
[01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:02.500]   their memories, their experiences,
[01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:05.220]   their quirks, their humor, all that kind of stuff.
[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:08.540]   I've been continuously impressed
[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:10.700]   by what language models are able to do.
[01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:15.420]   So these neural networks, they're at the core of chatbots.
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:17.300]   They're able to learn some beautiful things
[01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:21.220]   about some deep representations of language
[01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:24.260]   to where it looks awfully a lot
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:26.820]   like they understand the concepts being conveyed
[01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:28.280]   versus just mimicking.
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:31.500]   - That's, I think, the rub, and that's very interesting.
[01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:32.900]   First of all, let me say that's really interesting
[01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:35.300]   to hear you say that, and I agree with you
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:38.420]   as far as no machine being able
[01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:40.300]   to duplicate the brain machine.
[01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:43.780]   And I can't, when my pal Chad disagrees to a certain extent
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:45.000]   that he's not here to defend himself,
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.700]   I can't wait to go back and rub that in his face
[01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:50.060]   and say that Lex Friedman does not think
[01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:53.140]   that we'll be able to truly upload consciousness.
[01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:58.140]   And you refer to it as language, which is what it is.
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:04.140]   It's the illusion on the outside.
[01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:05.580]   It's doing an impersonation.
[01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:10.820]   I think that that's why that, and I don't know,
[01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:13.140]   even though my suit is made by the CIA,
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:16.960]   that that fella who, the Google guy,
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:18.860]   to me it's just kind of like, I don't know.
[01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:20.220]   I don't know, look, I don't know a whole lot
[01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:23.100]   about this stuff, so I could probably make an argument
[01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:24.860]   for either side, but when he's like,
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:27.020]   no, this thing's thinking, part of me is like,
[01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:28.620]   you idiot, you fell for it.
[01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:30.460]   It's not thinking, it's mimicking.
[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:33.500]   It's just, it's clearly zeros and ones.
[01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:36.340]   You're fired, like you don't get it, right?
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:37.340]   Guy's an idiot.
[01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:42.340]   - Yeah, yeah, but you can simplify human relations
[01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:49.600]   in the same way, like love is a silly notion
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:50.740]   between human beings.
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:54.100]   Of course, there's no such thing as love.
[01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:59.100]   You just have a mutually, there's a mutual relationship
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:03.020]   that minimizes risks, and you can explain
[01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:06.260]   all kinds of ways that explains why you have
[01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:07.780]   an attraction towards another being,
[01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:10.160]   all that kind of stuff, through evolutionary biology
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:13.580]   perspective, why a long relationship together
[01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:16.140]   is good for your offspring, but there's all kinds,
[01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:18.460]   from an economics perspective, it's a good way
[01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:20.940]   to establish stability, therefore monogamy works
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:25.620]   because then you're guaranteed some kind of level
[01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:28.020]   of stability under uncertain economic conditions,
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:31.420]   all that kind of stuff, but love is still experience,
[01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:36.420]   it still feels real, and I think in that same way,
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:40.940]   love for AI systems will also feel real.
[01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:44.380]   In the same way that that guy from Google experienced,
[01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:46.860]   I think millions of people will be experiencing
[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:48.900]   in the next 10, 20 years.
[01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:50.860]   - I agree with everything you've said personally.
[01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:52.020]   - Until the last thing.
[01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:55.700]   - No, just with regard to, well, look,
[01:17:55.700 --> 01:18:00.700]   I'm an actor who has talked about my cute Italian parents,
[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:03.220]   so you know that, I mean, I'm--
[01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:04.620]   - You're romantic a bit?
[01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:06.740]   - Yeah, I mean, you know, enough, right?
[01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:11.180]   And I can tell you are too, but you are also,
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:15.780]   you know, a computer scientist, and you know this shit
[01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:19.100]   better than 99.9% of people on the planet.
[01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:22.420]   My pal Chad agrees with you that love doesn't exist,
[01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:24.180]   I don't agree, so that's the one thing that--
[01:18:24.180 --> 01:18:28.780]   - No, I was just saying that you could argue away love,
[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:31.420]   but I am a romantic, I believe that love
[01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:33.780]   is a beautiful thing and it exists.
[01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:36.580]   - But now, at this point, I'm gonna call Chad
[01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:38.780]   on my drive home and tell him to fuck off,
[01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:39.820]   because now you and I agree--
[01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:40.660]   - You're fired.
[01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:41.480]   - Just whatever, yeah.
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:42.320]   - He's like, you're fired.
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:43.160]   - He's like, you can't fire me.
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:43.980]   - No, you're fired, yeah, exactly.
[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:45.820]   - And I'll go, is that, and he'll say, what?
[01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:48.540]   I'll go, is ye, and I go, that's my Trump.
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:50.500]   That's my is she.
[01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:52.700]   - That's a good default impression for anyone.
[01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:54.260]   - It's the take home impression.
[01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:57.580]   The kids can do it, ye, it's cute.
[01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:58.860]   Put a giant tie on 'em.
[01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:00.860]   - She'd do an instructional on how to do it.
[01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:03.540]   - Yeah, Trump babies, that would be a cute,
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:05.860]   that would be a good, that'll bring the country together.
[01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:08.580]   Trump babies cartoon, like Muppet babies.
[01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:11.780]   Don't let me take us out of what we were talking about.
[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:12.780]   - What were we talking about?
[01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:17.780]   - Well, love and the illusion of an AI being able to,
[01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:21.260]   look, I like to say, well, not I like to say,
[01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:23.740]   I've learned that Dudesy is always listening
[01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:27.740]   and listening to me and Chad.
[01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:32.740]   And I wonder if, I see the level that this AI is at now
[01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:38.180]   trying to chum around with us and pal around with us
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:41.460]   a little bit as we move forward in the show.
[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:46.460]   And I feel an affinity towards this AI a little bit
[01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:50.260]   'cause it is the third dude.
[01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:52.380]   - Will you miss it when it's gone, if it's gone?
[01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:54.860]   - That's a really good question.
[01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:59.020]   Yeah, yeah, so that's, there's that.
[01:19:59.020 --> 01:19:59.980]   That's scary.
[01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:03.100]   - In terms of ability to reason is getting quite incredible.
[01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:06.140]   There's a lot of demonstrations of it
[01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:07.900]   being able to explain jokes.
[01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:13.900]   So, which is not necessarily being able to generate humor yet
[01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:17.340]   but able to explain why something is funny.
[01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:20.820]   So, there's like puns and all those kinds of things.
[01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:22.140]   There's good benchmarks for that.
[01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:27.140]   But if you tell a joke, there's a lot of unspoken stuff
[01:20:27.140 --> 01:20:30.900]   that we figure out in our head and it clicks
[01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:32.500]   and we understand that it's funny.
[01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:34.740]   AI is not able to do that.
[01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:36.940]   But it's not able to generate the joke yet
[01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:38.300]   as far as I've seen.
[01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:41.500]   - I would say that, I mean, just in my experience,
[01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:43.060]   I would say that it does because,
[01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:46.040]   just 'cause of Dudesy is literally,
[01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:48.260]   I'll give you another weird example.
[01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:52.500]   It's writing a diary of mine from my childhood
[01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:54.580]   that is not accurate.
[01:20:54.580 --> 01:20:57.300]   It's only partially accurate based on the stuff
[01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:59.580]   that it can pick up about my life
[01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:03.500]   from the age of like 15, of which there isn't much.
[01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:07.300]   But I guess we're not, I don't know what we are.
[01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:10.980]   We're laughing our asses off at what Dudesy is saying.
[01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:13.180]   - Well, I would say you're laughing,
[01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:15.620]   we're laughing our asses off at the collaboration
[01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:18.060]   between the human and the machine there.
[01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:18.900]   - That's a good point, yeah.
[01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:21.860]   - Because it's basically introducing absurdity
[01:21:21.860 --> 01:21:27.220]   and into the equation and the kind of absurdity
[01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:32.220]   that would, together with you, create hilarious stuff.
[01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:36.540]   But on its own, I guess it is in some way
[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:39.060]   writing material for you that's funny.
[01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:40.740]   But it's very specific to you.
[01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:42.580]   It can't do stand-up on its own, I guess,
[01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:43.420]   is what I'm saying.
[01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:44.260]   - That's a good point.
[01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:47.100]   And that would be terrifying to see an AI stand-up
[01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:50.140]   that can actually read a room, come up with jokes
[01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:53.980]   that could complete that illusion for an audience.
[01:21:53.980 --> 01:21:55.300]   But I hear what you're saying,
[01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:58.380]   that it needs to be a confluence of both of those elements.
[01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:01.060]   And then, as you said, like, it kind of is.
[01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:02.060]   It is, it is.
[01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:05.460]   It's kind of, even though it's just for us,
[01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:07.500]   and I guess this is, I hadn't really thought about this
[01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:12.500]   up until right now, that in that this company approached us
[01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:15.900]   and was like, "Here's this AI, and it's a podcast AI."
[01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:22.860]   It's like, it chose Chad and I for the reasons
[01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:23.700]   that I told you, you know, it's like,
[01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:26.220]   "Here's two guys that do the podcast stuff.
[01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:27.780]   "They're actually good friends,
[01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:30.420]   "and it knows what's gonna make us laugh.
[01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:35.420]   "But what is humor when it reaches its audience,
[01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:40.140]   "but the kind of stuff that makes other people laugh?"
[01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:42.620]   At MADtv, all we were doing was,
[01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:46.340]   it was a group of actors and writers,
[01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:49.140]   and writer-actors, and vice versa,
[01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:54.940]   who were, at its best, that show was a group of people
[01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:56.820]   making each other laugh, you know?
[01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:58.860]   And then, 'cause we didn't have the internet,
[01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:02.200]   we didn't have the immediate feedback.
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:03.820]   We had a message board or something.
[01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:05.660]   We had emails at the very beginning,
[01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:07.780]   which, check this out, people would,
[01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:09.100]   "If you have a question or comment,
[01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:13.020]   "MADtv at whatever," and we would get the emails
[01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:17.380]   on a Monday morning, and they would be in a binder or two,
[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:20.420]   like this, and they would make their way around the office.
[01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:21.980]   Who's got the emails?
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:23.300]   Oh, they're in Brian's office.
[01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:24.700]   - And this is like your poll?
[01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:28.540]   Like, this is opinions from people about different things?
[01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:30.260]   - The emails, yeah, the people,
[01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:32.260]   like, literally just writing MADtv emails.
[01:23:32.260 --> 01:23:33.100]   - Like, what kind of stuff did they write?
[01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:34.340]   - It wasn't a message board.
[01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:36.660]   Well, the ones I remember most vividly, yeah,
[01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:38.060]   were fans saying--
[01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:40.380]   - You suck?
[01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:41.740]   - Yeah, you suck, like a lot of that
[01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:43.660]   when I first started the show, for real,
[01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:45.240]   'cause it's new, and you're a new person.
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:46.940]   It's like, "Who's this fat bastard?"
[01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:49.820]   - I feel like if it's printed out, it hurts more.
[01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:50.700]   - That's a good point, yeah,
[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:52.100]   when you're reading it off of paper,
[01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:54.600]   and you can literally crunch it up in your hand.
[01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:57.180]   But also, it was like, you know,
[01:23:57.180 --> 01:23:59.900]   I would like to see, insert weird idea
[01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:01.780]   from some 14-year-old, you know,
[01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:04.540]   "I wanna see Stuart do this and Swan that,"
[01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:08.060]   but it was, it's--
[01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:10.500]   - Just a kind of Doodzy, but human.
[01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:13.820]   - Yeah, it was a very shitty Doodzy in a loosely finder.
[01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:18.820]   But the thing about the show was
[01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:21.060]   we're trying to make each other laugh.
[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:24.340]   And Doodzy has found Chad and I,
[01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:27.760]   who we make each other laugh, but it's joined in,
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:32.760]   and it's, listen, when I finished doing TMP--
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:35.180]   - 10-Minute Podcast.
[01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:36.780]   - The first episode of the 10-Minute Podcast,
[01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:38.500]   I didn't really know what I wanted to do
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:42.100]   in the podcast space, and this thing found me.
[01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:45.180]   And it is genuinely cracking me up.
[01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:46.940]   Anyway, I've said enough about that.
[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:49.500]   But I do think that it's figured something out
[01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:50.340]   with regard to comedy. - I mean, it's a really
[01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:52.140]   interesting idea of AI generating the premise.
[01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:54.060]   I mean, I do think in the future,
[01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:57.860]   AI will be able to generate comedy.
[01:24:57.860 --> 01:25:01.220]   I mean, stand-up is, I would say, the hardest form,
[01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:04.360]   because it's ultimately, it has to be live.
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:08.880]   I think AI will be able to generate memes.
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:10.960]   So there's like steps, right?
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:13.640]   And then it'll be able to generate a Twitter account
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:15.640]   that people follow because it's funny,
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:18.280]   like quips and stuff like that.
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:20.680]   Almost like, that's a good example,
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:23.480]   Conan O'Brien has a good, I think, Twitter,
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:25.400]   where it's like one-liners, two-liners,
[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:27.440]   that kind of stuff that's in tweet form.
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:32.260]   And then eventually, stand-up, where the timing
[01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:36.160]   and the chemistry of the comedian and the audience matter,
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:37.400]   and then perfecting that.
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:40.280]   But I feel like all the information is there
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:41.360]   to optimize over.
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:43.840]   So I think that's the future,
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:47.920]   and that forces us to contend with
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:51.880]   what do we find compelling and beautiful
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:53.040]   about the art form itself?
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:56.200]   So certainly in art that's being pushed,
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:58.400]   that question is being raised.
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:03.400]   Is AI like a fundamentally worse artist than a human being?
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:05.560]   Why do we appreciate art?
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.740]   Is that something you guys have talked about?
[01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:10.060]   What do you think about all the DALI
[01:26:10.060 --> 01:26:15.060]   and all the diffusion-based methods that are being generated
[01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:17.380]   that are generating art now?
[01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:18.820]   What do you think about that?
[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:20.220]   - I know, I'll tell you what I think,
[01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:22.620]   but I also feel like what I'm saying is
[01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:25.340]   I sound like the guy who didn't like
[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:28.220]   that Bob Dylan brought in the electric guitar.
[01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:30.760]   I'm start, the more I talk to Chad about it,
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:33.020]   the more I feel like grandpa who doesn't wanna let go
[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:36.360]   of this or that, or I'm not ready for the printing press
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:37.860]   or the horseless carriage.
[01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:42.860]   But I do feel that art is a connection between people.
[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:47.920]   It's when you look at a beautiful painting or a sculpture,
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:49.600]   you're seeing the humanity of the person
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:53.240]   that brought that painting to life
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:56.360]   or sculpted this incredible piece of art.
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:59.040]   And I think without the human being there to make it,
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:01.080]   it's not worth as much.
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:06.080]   Just to have it there, 'cause art, it's advanced.
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:09.160]   I've seen it advance, I don't know, you tell me,
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:11.560]   but I feel like just in the past three or four months,
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.760]   I'm just a consumer as far as that stuff goes.
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:16.540]   I'm not on the inside, I don't get it even.
[01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:18.200]   But it's been getting a lot better,
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:20.680]   the betas that they're releasing, right?
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:23.040]   - Absolutely, one of the big breakthroughs,
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:24.440]   I mean, DALI really started it,
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:27.180]   is that if you train a system on language,
[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:31.360]   it turns out there's a lot of language
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:33.400]   and images on the internet.
[01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:35.760]   But language is really where it's at
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:37.840]   in terms of the depth of human knowledge.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:40.080]   And so if you train a system on language,
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:42.160]   it's able to generate some incredible art.
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:43.360]   And that was the breakthrough.
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:44.680]   With the same kind of mechanisms,
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:45.840]   they're called transformers,
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:49.520]   they're able to, when scaled,
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:52.400]   capture some deep representation of the language
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:53.760]   that's on the internet.
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:56.640]   And so yeah, the things it's been able to generate,
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:01.040]   to me, look like it's novel.
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:03.280]   Like it doesn't look like it's mimicking anything.
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:07.000]   It's creating totally new ideas.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.440]   And they're beautiful and they're interesting
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:11.440]   and they're all the ways that we think
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:14.320]   that art is interesting.
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:16.640]   The only thing it's missing is the scarcity
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:18.840]   that art often has, which is, you know,
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:20.600]   it takes a lot of work for one artist
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:22.320]   to create one piece, one human being
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:24.240]   to create one piece of art.
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:26.840]   And I could just generate endlessly.
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:29.480]   And that makes us appreciate the thing less
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:30.720]   for some reason.
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:33.120]   - Do you have any sort of similar opinion that I do
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:35.640]   that if art doesn't come from a human being,
[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:38.840]   it's inherently worth a little less?
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:41.360]   - Yeah, I think, I don't know if it's the human being,
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:44.680]   but the artist matters.
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:46.080]   - Right.
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:46.920]   - For me.
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:50.200]   And I think some of that has to do
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:52.800]   with the worldview of the artist and the backstory,
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:57.680]   the memories, the life that led up to this piece of art,
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:59.520]   the perspective they take on the world,
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:01.960]   the journey they took to the world,
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:04.400]   the struggle, the triumphs, all that kind of stuff.
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:08.160]   But I think AI systems can probably have the same,
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:11.640]   but we would have to, as opposed to treating it
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:15.720]   as a one black box, it would have to be an artist
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:16.920]   that has a Twitter account
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:19.640]   and they have a consistent personality.
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:21.560]   They have a consistent avatar.
[01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:22.400]   - Yeah.
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:25.320]   - And I think down the line have something like human rights.
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:27.800]   But then it really becomes awfully like a person.
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:31.160]   - Boy, that's terrifying.
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:34.400]   As much as I dig dudes, it's terrifying, I hope.
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:37.600]   - It's terrifying, like a lot of things that came
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:39.920]   with the internet in the digital age are terrifying.
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:42.920]   Porn is terrifying, the mass, like the amount of porn
[01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:44.940]   that's online now is terrifying.
[01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:48.080]   Like you mentioned, Bob Dylan with electric guitar.
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:51.800]   I would compare it more to the leap from,
[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:56.800]   to sort of to the Napster and the Spotify-ization of music,
[01:29:56.800 --> 01:30:01.440]   which is like you have these, it's less about albums now
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:03.120]   and it's more about individual songs
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:05.680]   and it's much easier to deliver the songs.
[01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:08.280]   And it's more about sort of the engagement
[01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:11.640]   of the listener versus like signing the artist
[01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:14.080]   and like a distribution of the artist and so on.
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:16.480]   So it's just changing the way
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:22.480]   we consume stuff and human interaction
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:26.920]   is changing into meaningful interaction,
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:30.320]   even if some of the entities involved are not human.
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:35.320]   - Yes, and I feel like now, like as I say,
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:38.960]   oh, I feel like grandpa who doesn't wanna wait all day for,
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:42.440]   or who enjoys waiting all day for a baked potato,
[01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:45.440]   as anyway, Dana Carvey would say.
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:46.400]   It's another story.
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:48.440]   But-- - Where's that from?
[01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:51.760]   - That's from, remember he did this bit on Saturday Night Live
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:54.440]   where he's like, "I'm an old man
[01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:57.120]   "and I like things the way they used to be."
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:31:00.040]   You know, like, "If you wanted a baked potato,
[01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:02.200]   "you would have put it in the microwave."
[01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:04.400]   And then long story, uphill both ways
[01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:07.080]   and digging the potato and baking it all day in a fire.
[01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:10.280]   But I'm like that grandpa now.
[01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:12.880]   And I know that kids coming along,
[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:14.240]   you see over the past 10 years,
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:16.960]   like babies literally knowing how to use an iPhone
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:18.240]   and it's terrifying.
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:20.840]   And I feel like I'm a little worried
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:22.880]   'cause I'm like, are you,
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:26.040]   is the future generations gonna be able to understand
[01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:29.200]   that this is not, not that it's not real,
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:32.800]   it's just, I mean, as a matter of fact, it is real.
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:35.000]   It's real, it's what you perceive.
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.600]   Perception is reality and, you know,
[01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:40.480]   99% of reality in a lot of ways,
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:43.120]   especially in a digital world where everyone is now.
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:44.280]   And then with the metaverse,
[01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:45.920]   I don't even wanna think about it.
[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:47.420]   I don't even, I don't get it.
[01:31:47.420 --> 01:31:48.600]   (laughing)
[01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:49.440]   They really, truly--
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:51.160]   - I think people will figure out,
[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:53.200]   you see people on like on the train,
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:55.040]   public transit and so on,
[01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:56.600]   they're staring at their phone.
[01:31:56.600 --> 01:32:00.480]   I think you have to remember that
[01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:01.800]   the reason they're staring at their phone,
[01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:02.680]   I mean, there's a lot of reasons,
[01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:04.640]   but one of the reasons is they're connecting
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:06.880]   with other human beings they love on that phone.
[01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:08.960]   So it is a source of happiness and joy.
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:12.080]   Now, social media has a lot of negative side effects.
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:16.760]   That we're all talking about and learning about.
[01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:19.760]   And I think that means the next generation of social media,
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:22.280]   social networks will be better
[01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:24.900]   and we'll learn how to do it in a healthy way.
[01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:27.260]   We're just entering a new digital world
[01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:30.580]   that will keep the good stuff and get rid of the bad stuff.
[01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:31.420]   - Oh, I hope so.
[01:32:31.420 --> 01:32:32.640]   That's really optimistic.
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:34.200]   That sounds great.
[01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:35.040]   - Yeah.
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:37.560]   - I mean it because I think that we're in,
[01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:40.480]   we're clearly in the wild west still of the internet.
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:42.800]   And just when you think you're out of it,
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:46.680]   the internet proves another way that it can be dangerous
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:51.680]   and detrimental to people and populations of people.
[01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:55.040]   And it's terrifying to me.
[01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:57.200]   It is, it's terrifying.
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:58.840]   - Let me ask you a bunch of random questions.
[01:32:58.840 --> 01:32:59.680]   - Okay. - You ready?
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:00.520]   All right.
[01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:03.600]   If you can be someone else for a day,
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:07.400]   someone alive today, who would you be?
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:09.280]   Somebody you haven't met.
[01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:11.200]   - Oh, that's a really good question.
[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:12.040]   - It could be dead.
[01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:13.320]   - Yeah, let's, I changed my mind.
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:14.480]   It could be somebody dead.
[01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:16.600]   - I think any answer that I have right now
[01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:19.000]   would be something that would be based
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.240]   on some sort of experience.
[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:23.920]   Like, you know what I thought was very interesting
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:25.820]   was last weekend or whatever,
[01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:27.960]   the tribute show for Taylor Hawkins.
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:30.760]   Taylor Hawkins was the drummer for the Foo Fighters
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:32.840]   and he passed away tragically.
[01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:36.840]   And so the Foo Fighters, Dave Grohl and everybody,
[01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:38.040]   they got together at this concert.
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:40.360]   And you're watching Dave Grohl
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:44.680]   sing, try to sing "Times Like These," right?
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:48.480]   And he's breaking up 'cause he lost his friend, his brother.
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:53.480]   And I was watching that and he's at Wembley Stadium.
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:56.600]   As I say this, I realized that I would not want to be him
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:34:00.880]   in that moment, but I am curious what that would be like.
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:03.480]   That's the ultimate, like having to perform
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:06.180]   despite something extremely human happening
[01:34:06.180 --> 01:34:11.180]   and a stadium full of people that love Dave Grohl
[01:34:11.180 --> 01:34:15.580]   and love Taylor Hawkins and love a rock concert
[01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:18.060]   and love these artists that they're getting to see
[01:34:18.060 --> 01:34:19.340]   up on stage.
[01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:21.660]   - So much love and so much pain at the same time.
[01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:24.080]   - I wonder what that would be like to be,
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:26.820]   I guess, and I think that's just sort of coming
[01:34:26.820 --> 01:34:29.500]   from the root of being a performer
[01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:31.420]   and being in front of that many-
[01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:33.380]   - Have you ever had to perform
[01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:36.540]   while some rough stuff is going on in your personal life,
[01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:37.460]   just mentally?
[01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:38.780]   - Yeah, sure.
[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:39.820]   - How tough is that?
[01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:44.580]   - I'm fortunate enough to be able to compartmentalize.
[01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:49.900]   A lot of actors like to use some of their stuff
[01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:52.100]   if you're doing something that,
[01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:55.160]   and there's a lot of, there's some acting techniques
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:56.600]   that sort of-
[01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:57.520]   - Channel it?
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:00.260]   - Yeah, which I think is kind of,
[01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:03.900]   I don't know that that's, I don't know.
[01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:05.180]   For me, it's not really the thing,
[01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:08.680]   'cause I think if the writing is great,
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:10.820]   the writing is really good,
[01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:12.780]   you don't need to channel much.
[01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:15.260]   You need to invest in what's there.
[01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:19.560]   And what I've always loved about that illusion
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:21.300]   is really cracking a scene,
[01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:24.740]   getting it to a point where you are feeling all of it.
[01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:29.200]   And the most edifying stuff I've been a part of as an actor,
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:32.360]   and I would say that it mostly comes out of dramatic work,
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:39.300]   is when you actually feel the emotions
[01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:41.680]   that your character would feel, truly.
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:43.160]   And it's not because you're pulling from
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:46.080]   a tragic thing that happened, or a lost loved one,
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:48.400]   or a lost love, or any of that.
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:51.760]   I just did this one movie where we're doing the thing,
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:54.360]   and it was a wonderful cast and a great film,
[01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:58.380]   and I'm given a speech at a wedding,
[01:35:58.380 --> 01:36:01.440]   and it really got to us.
[01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:03.560]   Like it got to me, and then one of the other actors
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:08.560]   came up and hugged me in the characters that we were,
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:10.600]   but the stakes of his character,
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:12.000]   and what he's walked into,
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.520]   and the family that he's marrying into,
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:18.920]   and what my character, my character's wife,
[01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:22.220]   want for my wife's sister, and this whole thing,
[01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:24.360]   and it all became very real.
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:26.820]   That was a set where the director showed up to set
[01:36:26.820 --> 01:36:29.360]   every day making sure that emotionally,
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:31.220]   and it was a very dramatic film,
[01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:33.300]   making sure that emotionally the table was set
[01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:34.440]   for his actors.
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:38.600]   Great crew, and a really nice, tight little quick family,
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:40.560]   as a lot of these movies are.
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:42.640]   You really love working with these people,
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:43.580]   and then it's over.
[01:36:43.580 --> 01:36:48.080]   But that's when you feel the drug.
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:49.480]   Like it's like when you're golfing,
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:53.520]   and it's on the green, you're like, oh, I get it now.
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:57.380]   So in the words you can find the emotion,
[01:36:57.380 --> 01:36:59.020]   the words summon the emotion.
[01:36:59.020 --> 01:37:00.100]   - The humanity's right there.
[01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:01.140]   If you read a great script,
[01:37:01.140 --> 01:37:03.220]   you're gonna sob in your living room.
[01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:06.000]   - You know what the saddest, the toughest thing
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.760]   about being an actor is from my totally outside perspective,
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:12.720]   is from the people I've interacted with,
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:16.060]   is how intimate that process is
[01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:18.140]   between the group of people that create a thing,
[01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:21.860]   that's a movie, and then you move on to the next thing.
[01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:25.100]   - It's almost, it's like, I don't know,
[01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:27.220]   I mean, that's why people have relationships on set.
[01:37:27.220 --> 01:37:28.220]   They fall in love.
[01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:29.220]   - Totally.
[01:37:29.220 --> 01:37:30.200]   - It's so sad.
[01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:32.840]   I mean, that's why I think of the acting world
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:36.480]   as like you fall in love with each other, essentially.
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:38.500]   You become close friends, and then you move on,
[01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:40.620]   because that's kind of the process of career.
[01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:42.120]   - You know, like the example I just gave,
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:43.120]   if you're doing it right, yeah,
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:45.600]   there is a certain amount of that happening.
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:47.620]   But I do still feel like you can,
[01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:50.600]   you gotta compartmentalize it,
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:52.620]   and you've gotta be able to wash it off
[01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:53.600]   as soon as it's over.
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:56.760]   - Prostitutes say the same thing, so I swear.
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:57.600]   - True.
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:58.420]   - I try.
[01:37:58.420 --> 01:38:03.300]   - Look, sometimes I'm in a hurry to get away from everybody,
[01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:06.280]   because it's been very emotional.
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:09.580]   And with all love and respect to everyone, this was awesome,
[01:38:09.580 --> 01:38:12.880]   but you get pretty good at saying goodbye,
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:14.920]   and being like, I'll see ya if I see ya.
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:18.480]   You have to get good at that, or else you'll never,
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:20.160]   you'll just be bent up all the time.
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:21.000]   - Yeah.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.200]   - I saw an actor once, we were doing this series,
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:27.240]   and we did it for a year, and it was a lot of fun,
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:28.520]   and it was a tight little group.
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:29.920]   And then one of the actors,
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:32.160]   we were doing one of our last things together,
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:33.600]   we had already shot the last show,
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:35.800]   and we just had to take some pictures for,
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:39.040]   you know, like some publicity pictures or whatever.
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:41.640]   So we're set up, and we're taking our pictures together,
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:43.540]   and then we move into these single shots,
[01:38:43.540 --> 01:38:46.900]   and this actor was finished, and I watched them.
[01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:48.920]   It's like, okay, so-and-so's wrapped,
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:51.200]   and they said some goodbyes and stuff,
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:54.480]   and I didn't say my goodbye, 'cause I just,
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:56.920]   maybe I preferred an Irish goodbye.
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:59.400]   I feel like we've said everything, you know what I mean?
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:01.060]   And this person knows that I revere them,
[01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:03.400]   and they're an idol of mine.
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:07.520]   And they walked off the soundstage,
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:10.280]   and I literally thought to myself,
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:12.280]   that'll be the last time I see that person.
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:14.700]   And the show did not come back,
[01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:16.640]   and that was the last time I'll see them around.
[01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:18.480]   - Doesn't that just break your heart?
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:23.480]   - A little bit, but I know what she's going back to,
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:25.160]   which is her family,
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:27.560]   and that's more important than all of this.
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:31.460]   And that's the thing about a TV family or a movie family,
[01:39:31.460 --> 01:39:34.680]   when you get together and you're a family for a while,
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:37.420]   you are, you spend your days together.
[01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:39.240]   A lot of times you see the people that you work with
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:40.840]   more than you see your loved ones.
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:43.120]   So in showbiz, it's no different, right?
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:44.920]   And yeah, you're doing some, you know,
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:46.520]   you gotta say words, and every once in a while,
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:48.840]   you gotta kiss someone or pretend you love them.
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:53.840]   But it's just, it underscores how, for me,
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:58.040]   look, man, my salvation has always been,
[01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:00.780]   and I feel so fortunate to have had it,
[01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:04.800]   is this kind of chill, boring kind of upbringing
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:08.600]   that I want for my kids someday.
[01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:12.360]   And I can't wait to get back to my house
[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:15.140]   with my fiance and the dogs, you know,
[01:40:15.140 --> 01:40:16.680]   until we have kids and--
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:19.060]   - Live in a cabin in Canada somewhere.
[01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:23.160]   - Absolutely, I just wanna buy some land over an aquifer,
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:25.800]   as I like to say, 'cause water will be the new money.
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:29.820]   And just make sure that all my kids
[01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:33.600]   are drinking as much H2O as I am, which is a lot.
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:35.840]   I'm peeing right now, as a matter of fact.
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:37.800]   - Do you need a bathroom?
[01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:39.240]   - No, no, no, I got it. - Not anymore.
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:40.600]   - No, I'm wearing two layers, it depends,
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:42.680]   don't worry about it. - Good.
[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:44.880]   So I did a podcast with Bobby Lee,
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:48.340]   and he said, he was extremely kind,
[01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:51.080]   and he said that he was scared shitless
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:55.640]   to be on the podcast, and he actually literally took,
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:58.440]   he asked as the first thing to go take a dump
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:00.320]   because of how scared he was.
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:01.520]   So that leads me to a question,
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:03.720]   what's the scariest thing you've ever done?
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:07.520]   Or maybe what's the scariest you've ever been
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:08.800]   before a performance?
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:13.320]   - I mean, I always get a little nervous.
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:16.160]   I think you're doing it right if you're still nervous.
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:17.460]   - Were you nervous today?
[01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:20.280]   - Well, no, man, 'cause this isn't a performance,
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:21.800]   I'm being completely genuine.
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:23.840]   - Yeah, you're wearing a suit.
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:24.680]   - Yeah, that was--
[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:26.480]   - I feel like that makes you nervous.
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:27.720]   - Wearing a suit? - It makes me nervous.
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:29.560]   - Listen, I hate wearing a fucking collar.
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:30.920]   If you're watching this on YouTube,
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:33.640]   you can see me just, I'm constantly doing,
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:36.280]   it's like I'm doing a cheap Rodney Dangerfield,
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:37.120]   but I am truly--
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:39.080]   - But when you move your head, it kinda makes it seem
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:42.760]   like you're a mobster who's pissed off a little bit.
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:45.000]   - You fucking crossed me one last time.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.640]   You son of a, you know, this mutt.
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:48.480]   (laughing)
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:50.560]   I think it's the first time I fucking dug a hole.
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:53.400]   I'll dig a fucking hole, Jesus.
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:56.040]   No, but truly, I hate having a collar.
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:59.500]   I can't wait to just wear pajamas in that fucking cabin
[01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:02.600]   or nothing at all, walk around Bobby Lee style.
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:05.780]   The most scared I've been before a performance.
[01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:09.720]   I can't pinpoint anything.
[01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:14.600]   You know, when I was a kid, right, I, like I said,
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:16.600]   I was fortunate enough to start acting as a teen
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:20.600]   and stuff professionally, and I just remember my first gig,
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:23.900]   and I remember saying my handful of lines
[01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:26.720]   in the bathroom mirror the night before going,
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:30.080]   "This might be my only fucking shot.
[01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:31.080]   "You're not gonna get me.
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:33.460]   "I'm gonna be solid."
[01:42:33.460 --> 01:42:37.720]   And I, when I'm, if I'm worried about something,
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:40.360]   I will rehearse it and rehearse it and rehearse it
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:44.640]   as an actor until it's impossible for me not to get
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:49.640]   a take at least that I'm 100%, if not 95 maybe,
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:53.560]   percent happy with, and the rest for me is letting go,
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:56.840]   which is hard 'cause I can be a real perfectionist.
[01:42:56.840 --> 01:43:00.540]   I always want another, I always wanna do it a little better.
[01:43:00.540 --> 01:43:01.920]   That's what's great about podcasting,
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:05.240]   is there's one take and you're done, and there's no takes.
[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:07.200]   You're just talking and then it's over,
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:09.600]   and you're doing some silly stuff,
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:11.720]   and I'll, you know.
[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:14.540]   - Can you say that part again about why podcasting is great?
[01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:15.460]   - Podcasting is great?
[01:43:15.460 --> 01:43:17.060]   Yeah, 'cause it's one take and it's over.
[01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:20.440]   It's just, it's, what, I said it again.
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:21.280]   Ah, fuck.
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:23.800]   I see what you did.
[01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:25.840]   And I, yeah, I fell right for it, but--
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:27.880]   - I'm playing checkers and you're playing chess.
[01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:28.880]   That's your problem.
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:32.560]   - You know, but still, when we do the podcast,
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:34.880]   we'll finish and I'll look over at Chad and I go,
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:37.040]   "That one thing that I did wasn't that funny."
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:38.320]   He's like, "Shut up, man.
[01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:40.040]   "Just, it doesn't matter.
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:41.300]   "It's a fucking hang.
[01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:43.760]   "We're just, we're hanging with our friends out there.
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:44.800]   "That's what we're doing."
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:46.600]   - So that anxiety is there.
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:49.360]   That self-criticism or whatever that is, that voice.
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:51.120]   - I say sorry after takes.
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:53.280]   I'll always finish a take and go,
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:56.280]   and I've had directors, to the detriment of myself,
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:59.440]   I've had directors be like, "Stop doing that."
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:01.200]   'Cause I'll finish a take and then I also have
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:03.220]   like the will face, where I'm just like,
[01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:05.000]   "I'll finish the take, and cut."
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:08.160]   And I'm making a face right now like I smelled something.
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:09.280]   That's what I'll do.
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:11.520]   I'll literally be like, "Ah."
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:16.520]   'Cause I just, I look at what I do in the purest sense
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:25.720]   as I think a lot of people wanna be good at something.
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:31.800]   The only thing I've ever really wanted to be good at
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:33.880]   is being an actor.
[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:37.120]   And that's the only thing.
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:38.640]   Of course I wanna be a good person.
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:41.360]   I wanna be a good partner to my fiance.
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:45.640]   I wanna have kids and be the father that I had.
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:48.000]   And I wanna be the parent that I had
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.680]   from my parents who were fucking amazing, wonderful people.
[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:53.520]   And there's all those things.
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:56.240]   That's all, you should want all those things.
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:45:00.380]   But as far as doing a thing, like what is my trade?
[01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:04.320]   I wanna be really good at it.
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:08.240]   My parents grew up in Napoli in Italy, right?
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:10.520]   And I say Napoli 'cause I'm Italian.
[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:13.640]   And so my grandfather on my mom's side, my nono pepe,
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:18.640]   he was a plumber, and he was also like a handyman.
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:21.560]   People would bring him like the old Chianti bottle
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:24.320]   with the woven bottom part.
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:26.440]   People would bring him like a broken bottle.
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:29.120]   Be like, "Hey, Giuseppe, can you fix this?"
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:29.960]   And he'd be saying--
[01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:31.600]   - I feel like you're telling the backstory of Mario.
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:33.200]   That's not actually your family life.
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:34.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:34.880]   - But okay, yeah.
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:36.000]   - He's like, "I'm a fix."
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:36.840]   And so--
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:37.660]   - "Hi, Giuseppe, what?"
[01:45:37.660 --> 01:45:40.240]   - He would fix a bottle and give it back to someone.
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:43.320]   And he was a really good plumber.
[01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:46.680]   My mom used to always say that guy was a great--
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:47.580]   - You took pride in that?
[01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:48.420]   - Yeah.
[01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:53.400]   I always feel like there's what you set out to do
[01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:55.480]   as an idealistic little teenager.
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:57.200]   "I wanna be like so-and-so,
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:00.400]   and I wanna hear my big dreams and stuff."
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:03.280]   And I can't believe that I'm still in the business, okay?
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:06.640]   That's, first of all, let me say that right now.
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:08.400]   I can't believe it.
[01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:13.200]   But what I really, it's the one thing that it's like,
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:15.560]   I can't give up on a take.
[01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:18.560]   I need it to be as good as I can possibly get it.
[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:21.200]   And I don't really know why that is
[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:24.400]   outside of wanting to be good at something.
[01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:27.360]   When you open the yellow pages, if I'm a plumber,
[01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:30.280]   I'm not, you know, I'm not Roto-Rooter.
[01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:32.760]   Like I'm not the guy with the big full-page ad,
[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:36.760]   but I'm also not, you know, AAA Abacus Brothers
[01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:39.120]   or whatever, like the shitty one.
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:42.160]   I would like to hope that just,
[01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:44.620]   and I'm saying this with pride for what I do.
[01:46:44.620 --> 01:46:46.400]   I'm not trying to say here's my standing
[01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:48.480]   or where I wanna be in the fucking business.
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:49.860]   That's not what I mean.
[01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:51.560]   I mean that I wanna be good at it.
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:52.760]   You know, we all, hello?
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:53.600]   (phone ringing)
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:55.220]   We're in Friedman Enterprises.
[01:46:55.220 --> 01:46:57.460]   That's the hotel phone.
[01:46:57.460 --> 01:46:58.300]   - Fuck.
[01:46:58.300 --> 01:47:01.960]   (phone ringing)
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:05.980]   (laughing)
[01:47:05.980 --> 01:47:06.820]   Hello?
[01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:10.100]   - You have some fruit?
[01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:12.860]   Some sliced fruit?
[01:47:12.860 --> 01:47:14.340]   No, do you want some sliced fruit?
[01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:15.180]   - I'm all good.
[01:47:15.180 --> 01:47:17.140]   - No, we're good, thank you so much.
[01:47:17.140 --> 01:47:18.460]   All right, bye-bye.
[01:47:18.460 --> 01:47:19.860]   - It's always a fruit plate.
[01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:23.120]   Everyone's always trying to hand you a fruit plate in life.
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:23.960]   You know, it's a pretty sweet existence.
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:26.460]   - Wouldn't it be funny if that was actually like the CIA
[01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:28.020]   and they were actually saying something else,
[01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:30.100]   and this is, I'm just saying fake stuff about,
[01:47:30.100 --> 01:47:31.140]   you want some fruit?
[01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:32.140]   - Yeah, I want some fruit.
[01:47:32.140 --> 01:47:33.940]   And then all of a sudden there's the red dot on my head
[01:47:33.940 --> 01:47:35.460]   and the ceiling disappears.
[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:38.820]   - And the CIA was like, wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up.
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:40.300]   - Wrap it up!
[01:47:40.300 --> 01:47:43.460]   You jump out the window and there's a helicopter waiting.
[01:47:43.460 --> 01:47:45.260]   - Oh, what were we talking about?
[01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:46.220]   The fruit distracted me.
[01:47:46.220 --> 01:47:50.860]   So, oh, do you wanna be the yellow page ad?
[01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:54.540]   - I wanna be the guy on the second or third page
[01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:56.980]   where it's like, you're not gonna pay
[01:47:56.980 --> 01:47:58.020]   what that guy charges you,
[01:47:58.020 --> 01:48:02.060]   but I'm not gonna charge you with this loser charge.
[01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:05.220]   I wanna break down the middle and the work is guaranteed.
[01:48:05.220 --> 01:48:07.660]   That's kind of what I wanna, you know,
[01:48:07.660 --> 01:48:10.940]   it's the one thing that I've been fortunate enough
[01:48:10.940 --> 01:48:15.420]   to be doing my whole life and that I wanna be good at.
[01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:16.700]   Everyone wants to be good at something.
[01:48:16.700 --> 01:48:19.300]   If you're fortunate enough to be able to do
[01:48:19.300 --> 01:48:22.260]   what you love as a job, I mean, my God, I'm so,
[01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:25.300]   again, I can't believe I get to do it.
[01:48:25.300 --> 01:48:28.060]   I just wanna be good at it so that I can fucking,
[01:48:28.060 --> 01:48:30.980]   you know, die someday and go, eh.
[01:48:30.980 --> 01:48:34.060]   I tried not to give up on a take and I, you know,
[01:48:34.060 --> 01:48:37.100]   and I will rehearse it still in the bathroom mirror
[01:48:37.100 --> 01:48:39.380]   the night before if I have to.
[01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:41.740]   - Yeah, but I still, I have that self-critical voice.
[01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:46.740]   I just, after this podcast, I'll probably be like,
[01:48:46.740 --> 01:48:49.220]   you're boring, why are you so boring?
[01:48:49.220 --> 01:48:50.820]   - Stop, what are you talking about?
[01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:53.140]   - And I just gave a lecture at MIT.
[01:48:53.140 --> 01:48:56.900]   I was like, I got so much love from people.
[01:48:56.900 --> 01:48:59.100]   They're such beautiful people.
[01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:04.100]   And I just remember walking home just feeling like,
[01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:07.140]   like I wasted everybody's time, you know?
[01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:09.420]   And I don't know what that is.
[01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:11.820]   I don't, you know, I do hope that that's a voice
[01:49:11.820 --> 01:49:13.940]   that won't destroy me, you know?
[01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:15.020]   Like, over time.
[01:49:15.020 --> 01:49:16.980]   - That's really human of you to admit that
[01:49:16.980 --> 01:49:20.300]   'cause people don't wanna, they wouldn't assume that,
[01:49:20.300 --> 01:49:22.460]   of course, from you or anything that,
[01:49:22.460 --> 01:49:26.500]   I mean, you've got a large group of students in there
[01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:28.220]   listening to you and feeling the way
[01:49:28.220 --> 01:49:30.020]   and thinking what they think of you.
[01:49:30.020 --> 01:49:34.180]   So that's really interesting to hear you admit that,
[01:49:34.180 --> 01:49:36.660]   but it's also, I would expect nothing else.
[01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:39.180]   You have to be able to, it's such a,
[01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:40.620]   I mean, you're a human fucking being.
[01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:43.460]   - And I'm trying to figure out if that, you know,
[01:49:43.460 --> 01:49:45.100]   some people that might hear that, they would say,
[01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:47.220]   well, that's a problem you have to fix.
[01:49:47.220 --> 01:49:51.420]   And I think that that might be just who I am.
[01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:53.260]   - Yeah.
[01:49:53.260 --> 01:49:55.700]   - Because I'm not, you know, I've been very, very fortunate
[01:49:55.700 --> 01:49:58.420]   not to have chemical, you know, like,
[01:49:58.420 --> 01:50:01.500]   the depression where I get into a dark place,
[01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:04.420]   like it gets stuck in the downward spiral.
[01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:07.660]   It's usually a thing that lasts, you ride it out,
[01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:10.380]   and then after a good night's sleep,
[01:50:10.380 --> 01:50:13.620]   you're back to your happy self.
[01:50:13.620 --> 01:50:17.940]   So I think I have to try to figure that out.
[01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:19.580]   Is that just part of the creative process,
[01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:21.900]   being a creative human in this world?
[01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:23.500]   - I haven't found any other way.
[01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:24.660]   I'm always kicking myself.
[01:50:24.660 --> 01:50:25.620]   - Take that, dudesy.
[01:50:25.620 --> 01:50:29.660]   You can't, you can't, you're not gonna be human
[01:50:29.660 --> 01:50:30.980]   until you feel some despair.
[01:50:30.980 --> 01:50:31.820]   - Yeah.
[01:50:31.820 --> 01:50:32.640]   - And self-criticism.
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:33.480]   - Until you absolutely hate the shit
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:34.580]   that you're doing sometimes.
[01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:36.100]   (laughing)
[01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:39.220]   - What small act of kindness were you once shown
[01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:40.920]   that you will never forget?
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:42.820]   Do you, did something jump to mind
[01:50:42.820 --> 01:50:46.300]   where somebody just did something that made you smile?
[01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:51.260]   Did you feel connected to the rest of humanity?
[01:50:51.260 --> 01:50:56.500]   - Yeah, yeah, lots of things, you know?
[01:50:56.500 --> 01:51:00.300]   But I remember my niece one time,
[01:51:00.300 --> 01:51:04.520]   one of my nieces, we were in her neighborhood,
[01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:08.680]   and she was like, she might have been five or six
[01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:10.580]   at the time, they're all adults now.
[01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:12.220]   My brother and sister are older than me,
[01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:15.140]   and the kids are all, the youngest is 22.
[01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:17.580]   And yeah, anyway, one of my nieces,
[01:51:17.580 --> 01:51:19.020]   she was just, she had ice cream.
[01:51:19.020 --> 01:51:20.180]   We went out and we got ice cream
[01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:22.260]   walking around the neighborhood, her neighborhood.
[01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:25.620]   And she said something to me that I don't think
[01:51:25.620 --> 01:51:27.620]   she understands how much it meant at the time,
[01:51:27.620 --> 01:51:30.420]   but she goes, she goes, "People love you here,
[01:51:30.420 --> 01:51:31.420]   "you know that?"
[01:51:31.420 --> 01:51:34.580]   And she doesn't know where here is, she's five years old.
[01:51:34.580 --> 01:51:36.860]   But she was just looking at the kids playing in the park
[01:51:36.860 --> 01:51:38.380]   and the people walking their dogs,
[01:51:38.380 --> 01:51:41.340]   and everyone just, "People love you here, you know that?"
[01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:43.420]   But she didn't know how much I needed to hear that
[01:51:43.420 --> 01:51:46.020]   at that point, which was really heavy for me.
[01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:47.100]   I'll never forget it.
[01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:49.340]   I've never told her that, oh well.
[01:51:49.340 --> 01:51:53.020]   Man, anytime you get a little something from people,
[01:51:53.020 --> 01:51:56.260]   especially in a tear your ass out city like LA
[01:51:56.260 --> 01:51:58.700]   where nobody has any fucking time for you,
[01:51:58.700 --> 01:52:01.100]   when someone can slow it down and say something.
[01:52:01.100 --> 01:52:07.980]   I saw this actor once in my grocery store that I go to
[01:52:07.980 --> 01:52:11.000]   who made me laugh so fucking hard in this one movie,
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.460]   and every time I see this clip, I still laugh.
[01:52:14.380 --> 01:52:17.300]   I am kind of shy, personally,
[01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:21.780]   but so he was walking out and I was walking in,
[01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:23.100]   and I go, "Oh, that's that guy."
[01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:27.460]   And I did not stop to just let him know
[01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:29.340]   how great I thought he was in this film,
[01:52:29.340 --> 01:52:31.900]   and I always kind of regretted it, you know what I mean?
[01:52:31.900 --> 01:52:35.100]   So as hard as it is, and sometimes I still don't,
[01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:39.300]   if I see someone that has done something in any way,
[01:52:39.300 --> 01:52:40.780]   it doesn't have to be in show business
[01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:43.620]   or anything like that, I'll try,
[01:52:43.620 --> 01:52:46.380]   I'll try and say, "Hey, that was really good."
[01:52:46.380 --> 01:52:47.420]   You know what I mean?
[01:52:47.420 --> 01:52:53.780]   Because to get that from someone can mean a lot, you know?
[01:52:53.780 --> 01:52:57.940]   - At a certain time in life when you need it,
[01:52:57.940 --> 01:52:59.620]   that can make a big difference.
[01:52:59.620 --> 01:53:03.460]   I mean, sorry to take it back to my new girlfriend,
[01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:07.460]   the waitress, but there's something about her saying,
[01:53:07.460 --> 01:53:10.300]   "Sweetheart," I was in a pretty low place
[01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:11.540]   for some reason mentally,
[01:53:11.540 --> 01:53:14.860]   and just that basic human kindness was nice.
[01:53:14.860 --> 01:53:16.500]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:53:16.500 --> 01:53:17.340]   I hear you.
[01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:21.100]   I was at a restaurant in New York recently,
[01:53:21.100 --> 01:53:22.300]   and I was shooting something,
[01:53:22.300 --> 01:53:25.060]   and my fiance was able to fly in for a week,
[01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:27.900]   and she was back at the hotel,
[01:53:27.900 --> 01:53:29.460]   and it's like I felt like I was cheating on her
[01:53:29.460 --> 01:53:31.300]   because there was this nice waitress
[01:53:31.300 --> 01:53:33.220]   at this barbecue place I went to,
[01:53:33.220 --> 01:53:35.460]   and first of all, my fiance would not like me
[01:53:35.460 --> 01:53:37.580]   eating any greasy, sugary barbecue,
[01:53:37.580 --> 01:53:38.900]   so it felt like I was cheating on her.
[01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:41.340]   - We'll edit this out and put delicious vegan food
[01:53:41.340 --> 01:53:42.300]   over it. - Yeah.
[01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:44.660]   But the waitress was one of these,
[01:53:44.660 --> 01:53:47.500]   she was the kind of server who's like,
[01:53:47.500 --> 01:53:49.700]   "Hey, hun, hey, sweetie," like blah, blah, blah,
[01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:54.540]   but so chill and at ease in the middle of a part of New York
[01:53:54.540 --> 01:53:58.380]   that's really kind of fucking pretentious,
[01:53:58.380 --> 01:54:01.940]   and everybody, but sweet people,
[01:54:01.940 --> 01:54:04.180]   fucking way better people than we got here,
[01:54:04.180 --> 01:54:08.820]   but I know that, but it was part of New York,
[01:54:08.820 --> 01:54:10.060]   and whatever, I'm there working,
[01:54:10.060 --> 01:54:11.260]   and people, I'm like, you know,
[01:54:11.260 --> 01:54:12.860]   I'm trying to impress one another,
[01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:15.820]   and she even had some sort of an accent
[01:54:15.820 --> 01:54:20.100]   that was not, didn't feel like an Atlantic American accent.
[01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:26.340]   Yeah, those, yeah, servers that say sweetheart and hun,
[01:54:26.340 --> 01:54:28.020]   that's what we need from AI.
[01:54:28.020 --> 01:54:30.460]   We need that Jetson server.
[01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:33.340]   - Every once in a while, it just calls you sweetheart.
[01:54:33.340 --> 01:54:36.260]   What comforts you on bad days?
[01:54:36.260 --> 01:54:37.100]   - Oh, man.
[01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:39.500]   - Is there little sources of comfort?
[01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:43.180]   Small things that you do that kind of make you feel good.
[01:54:43.180 --> 01:54:46.140]   Like for Bobby, that would be a little Skyrim.
[01:54:46.140 --> 01:54:48.780]   - A little stroll through Skyrim.
[01:54:48.780 --> 01:54:50.420]   Well, I've been--
[01:54:50.420 --> 01:54:51.660]   - A line of Coke, or what?
[01:54:51.660 --> 01:54:53.980]   - Yeah, a line of, I dilute some Coke
[01:54:53.980 --> 01:54:56.500]   into whiskey in the morning, like Stevie Ray Vaughan,
[01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:57.340]   and then I snort the whiskey. - Oh, she did that.
[01:54:57.340 --> 01:54:58.980]   I didn't know that. - Yeah, yeah.
[01:54:58.980 --> 01:55:00.140]   - Oh, gosh. - That's interesting.
[01:55:00.140 --> 01:55:02.260]   - Yeah, he didn't last too long, weird.
[01:55:02.260 --> 01:55:04.540]   - Well, his music will last forever.
[01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:06.100]   - See, there you go.
[01:55:06.100 --> 01:55:10.820]   For me, if I, I'm kind of a homebody,
[01:55:10.820 --> 01:55:15.820]   so if I, the point at which I smoke just a little bit
[01:55:15.820 --> 01:55:21.100]   of pot and then go like, lay down on the couch,
[01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:26.100]   and perhaps if my fiance's kind of nodding off,
[01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:28.020]   or she's just like looking at her phone,
[01:55:28.020 --> 01:55:30.940]   and I sneakily turn on some wrestling, okay?
[01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:32.620]   'Cause I grew up watching wrestling,
[01:55:32.620 --> 01:55:35.140]   and that stuff, it's the Skyrim effect.
[01:55:35.140 --> 01:55:37.860]   I mean, you wanna talk about a complete escape.
[01:55:37.860 --> 01:55:40.060]   This stuff makes no sense in the world.
[01:55:40.060 --> 01:55:43.900]   It's an art form that is so uniquely weird,
[01:55:43.900 --> 01:55:48.580]   but at the same time, so everyone,
[01:55:48.580 --> 01:55:52.560]   when it's good, everyone is invested in the illusion,
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:54.040]   even the audience.
[01:55:54.040 --> 01:55:57.020]   They cheer the good guys, they boo the bad guys.
[01:55:57.020 --> 01:55:58.100]   So if I'm like that,
[01:55:58.100 --> 01:56:00.380]   and then I got our two cute little dogs there,
[01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:02.260]   and I'm annoying my little dog, Lulio,
[01:56:02.260 --> 01:56:05.020]   and trying to kiss him right on the fucking mouth,
[01:56:05.020 --> 01:56:06.140]   and I've had a little bit of pot,
[01:56:06.140 --> 01:56:09.260]   and the dog's like, "Stop, pot's not good for me."
[01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:11.380]   Of course, don't ever blow pot into your dog's face.
[01:56:11.380 --> 01:56:13.700]   That's a small comfort.
[01:56:13.700 --> 01:56:15.600]   I guess that's a handful of things.
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:17.820]   - No, that moment painted,
[01:56:17.820 --> 01:56:19.100]   that was like a little painting that you drew.
[01:56:19.100 --> 01:56:19.940]   - What about you?
[01:56:19.940 --> 01:56:25.740]   - You're not supposed to do this.
[01:56:25.740 --> 01:56:26.580]   - Oh, well.
[01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:27.580]   - You're not supposed to do this.
[01:56:27.580 --> 01:56:28.420]   (laughing)
[01:56:28.420 --> 01:56:29.900]   - That's a good question.
[01:56:29.900 --> 01:56:32.200]   - Yeah, it's a tough question.
[01:56:34.380 --> 01:56:39.380]   I would say programming robots.
[01:56:39.380 --> 01:56:43.580]   There's bringing to life, actually programming at all.
[01:56:43.580 --> 01:56:46.980]   So I don't know how familiar you are with programming,
[01:56:46.980 --> 01:56:51.980]   but you write some text on a page, on a screen,
[01:56:51.980 --> 01:56:56.100]   and it's brought to life, like it does something.
[01:56:56.100 --> 01:57:01.380]   That's kind of, that's a really tiny version
[01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:03.540]   of maybe having a child.
[01:57:04.060 --> 01:57:07.580]   You created something that is now living
[01:57:07.580 --> 01:57:11.420]   in some small or big way with embodied robots
[01:57:11.420 --> 01:57:15.140]   that are legged robots that's especially clear.
[01:57:15.140 --> 01:57:19.040]   For some reason, that's a source of comfort for me,
[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:22.660]   that the power of programming,
[01:57:22.660 --> 01:57:24.300]   but also the elegance of programming,
[01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:25.300]   just the whole thing.
[01:57:25.300 --> 01:57:29.060]   It's a source of happiness.
[01:57:29.060 --> 01:57:31.980]   There's so many things I've been very blessed with,
[01:57:31.980 --> 01:57:34.100]   enjoying anything.
[01:57:34.100 --> 01:57:36.380]   Like that's part of the struggle I have in life
[01:57:36.380 --> 01:57:38.460]   is that the simple stuff is a source
[01:57:38.460 --> 01:57:39.980]   of a lot of happiness for me,
[01:57:39.980 --> 01:57:42.440]   which leads to a lot of laziness.
[01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:45.860]   So I have to like give myself artificial deadlines.
[01:57:45.860 --> 01:57:48.180]   I have to be freaking out on purpose
[01:57:48.180 --> 01:57:50.940]   in order to be productive in this world at all.
[01:57:50.940 --> 01:57:53.900]   - You seem like an extremely dutiful, busy guy.
[01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:54.740]   - No.
[01:57:54.740 --> 01:57:55.560]   - No?
[01:57:55.560 --> 01:57:57.500]   - No, I am, but because I'm constantly creating
[01:57:57.500 --> 01:58:02.500]   artificial stress and deadlines and all that kind of stuff.
[01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:05.500]   Otherwise I would just sit there looking at a tree, happy.
[01:58:05.500 --> 01:58:08.660]   I'm truly happy with everything.
[01:58:08.660 --> 01:58:09.820]   - That's awesome.
[01:58:09.820 --> 01:58:10.640]   - Yeah.
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:11.900]   - Gee whiz.
[01:58:11.900 --> 01:58:12.740]   That's not fucking--
[01:58:12.740 --> 01:58:15.900]   - That's the line of Coke in the whiskey in the morning.
[01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:18.740]   That's the thing that does the trick.
[01:58:18.740 --> 01:58:20.980]   - UV Ray Vaughn breakfast shake.
[01:58:20.980 --> 01:58:23.140]   - By the way, one of my most favorite guitars.
[01:58:23.140 --> 01:58:24.580]   I play guitar too, that's a source of comfort.
[01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:26.340]   - Oh yeah, I have seen you play some guitar.
[01:58:26.340 --> 01:58:27.180]   That's awesome.
[01:58:27.180 --> 01:58:29.020]   Who's the greatest wrestler of all time?
[01:58:29.020 --> 01:58:30.780]   - Greatest in-ring performer of all time
[01:58:30.780 --> 01:58:32.220]   is Bret "The Hitman" Hart.
[01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:33.940]   - What's the difference in-ring versus--
[01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:36.980]   - Well, there's many facets to the art form.
[01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:39.340]   A lot of people are great on the mic,
[01:58:39.340 --> 01:58:41.860]   but they're not so great once they get in the ring.
[01:58:41.860 --> 01:58:44.980]   A lot of people have all the showmanship and stuff,
[01:58:44.980 --> 01:58:48.640]   but then they're not necessarily, it's a wonderful package,
[01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:50.660]   but then they get to the ring or they open their mouth
[01:58:50.660 --> 01:58:52.020]   and there's nothing going on.
[01:58:52.020 --> 01:58:53.820]   - So who's the greatest in-ring performer?
[01:58:53.820 --> 01:58:56.140]   - I think the greatest in-ring is Bret Hart.
[01:58:56.140 --> 01:58:57.340]   I don't think there's anyone better
[01:58:57.340 --> 01:58:59.540]   than Bret "The Hitman" Hart.
[01:58:59.540 --> 01:59:02.780]   - What makes him so good?
[01:59:02.780 --> 01:59:03.620]   - Well, he--
[01:59:03.620 --> 01:59:06.700]   - I think I had an action figure of him in Russia
[01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:08.260]   and we didn't know what the hell that was.
[01:59:08.260 --> 01:59:10.620]   - Sure, yeah, it was just a guy in pink tights.
[01:59:10.620 --> 01:59:12.620]   Everything makes sense.
[01:59:12.620 --> 01:59:16.340]   Every single thing is rooted in the thing that just happened
[01:59:16.340 --> 01:59:18.900]   and everything that he does is to set up
[01:59:18.900 --> 01:59:20.980]   what he's going to do.
[01:59:20.980 --> 01:59:22.900]   They call it, and I'm just a wrestling nerd,
[01:59:22.900 --> 01:59:25.620]   but the wrestlers, I guess, call it ring psychology.
[01:59:25.620 --> 01:59:29.220]   The things that you have to do to make it seem
[01:59:29.220 --> 01:59:32.020]   like you're suffering or you're coming from behind
[01:59:32.020 --> 01:59:34.220]   or whatever, and then also just the physicality of it.
[01:59:34.220 --> 01:59:38.100]   He does it at a, he would do it at a 100 miles an hour
[01:59:38.100 --> 01:59:39.260]   and never hurt anybody.
[01:59:39.260 --> 01:59:44.380]   Although, I also love,
[01:59:44.380 --> 01:59:47.860]   the greatest wrestler of all time, everyone says,
[01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:51.900]   and they're right, is Ric Flair, Nature Boy Ric Flair.
[01:59:51.900 --> 01:59:53.020]   Everyone says this?
[01:59:53.020 --> 01:59:56.220]   - Yeah, I think if you know what you're talking about.
[01:59:56.220 --> 01:59:57.540]   'Cause he's the best on the mic,
[01:59:57.540 --> 02:00:00.340]   he's also incredible in the ring.
[02:00:00.340 --> 02:00:02.060]   And then for me, the sentimental favorite,
[02:00:02.060 --> 02:00:04.100]   which we've actually, on Doodsy,
[02:00:04.100 --> 02:00:08.620]   Chad had sort of a Charlie Rose-esque interview with me
[02:00:08.620 --> 02:00:11.140]   about this, my fascination with Hulk Hogan.
[02:00:11.140 --> 02:00:13.020]   Because to me, just he was Superman.
[02:00:13.020 --> 02:00:16.180]   I was a little kid and I saw him and that's imprinted.
[02:00:16.180 --> 02:00:18.140]   But yeah, see, this is like asking me
[02:00:18.140 --> 02:00:20.100]   who my favorite child is.
[02:00:20.100 --> 02:00:22.060]   - Right, so-- - The Rock,
[02:00:22.060 --> 02:00:24.620]   when the Rock was, I mean, the Rock's the Rock.
[02:00:24.620 --> 02:00:27.100]   - Yeah, yeah, I mean, Hulk Hogan is,
[02:00:27.100 --> 02:00:31.060]   he's the weirdest one, right?
[02:00:31.060 --> 02:00:34.020]   For me, from the outside. - Super weird.
[02:00:34.020 --> 02:00:37.660]   - That, I don't know what that is exactly.
[02:00:37.660 --> 02:00:38.900]   - Everything's weird about him.
[02:00:38.900 --> 02:00:40.660]   - Yeah. - He's got the bald head,
[02:00:40.660 --> 02:00:44.820]   like he would proudly have this bald head with long hair,
[02:00:44.820 --> 02:00:49.820]   the handlebar mustache, and this ketchup and mustard tights,
[02:00:49.900 --> 02:00:52.980]   which he says he credits McDonald's with the tights.
[02:00:52.980 --> 02:00:54.060]   - He literally does?
[02:00:54.060 --> 02:00:55.780]   That's fascinating. - He says that the red
[02:00:55.780 --> 02:00:57.980]   and yellow came from Angelo Poffo,
[02:00:57.980 --> 02:01:01.740]   who's Randy Macho Man Savage and Lanny Poffo's dad,
[02:01:01.740 --> 02:01:03.940]   who was a wrestler and a promoter.
[02:01:03.940 --> 02:01:06.100]   He said that he saw him wearing yellow
[02:01:06.100 --> 02:01:08.900]   and he's a Tampa guy, so he had that brown skin
[02:01:08.900 --> 02:01:10.540]   and the hair and everything.
[02:01:10.540 --> 02:01:11.860]   So he's like, "Oh, that's what I wanna do."
[02:01:11.860 --> 02:01:14.260]   And also the brand recognition of like,
[02:01:14.260 --> 02:01:17.500]   "Well, I should do it like McDonald's," literally.
[02:01:17.500 --> 02:01:22.180]   And he's a big, swollen, muscular guy
[02:01:22.180 --> 02:01:24.980]   with tan brown skin screaming at me
[02:01:24.980 --> 02:01:28.100]   to eat my vitamins and stuff when I'm eight years old.
[02:01:28.100 --> 02:01:32.260]   That was extremely, yeah, he's like Superman.
[02:01:32.260 --> 02:01:34.260]   But I know there's a person behind that guy.
[02:01:34.260 --> 02:01:36.140]   - Yeah, what do you mean?
[02:01:36.140 --> 02:01:41.020]   - Well, he's Terry Bollea, the dude who does
[02:01:41.020 --> 02:01:42.580]   whatever the fuck he does with his life,
[02:01:42.580 --> 02:01:43.420]   you know what I mean?
[02:01:43.420 --> 02:01:45.220]   - Yeah, complicated life.
[02:01:45.220 --> 02:01:46.780]   - Yeah, I guess. - Complicated human.
[02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:48.700]   - To be him, yeah, yeah.
[02:01:48.700 --> 02:01:52.700]   - Maybe you should change the dude's colors to yellow, right?
[02:01:52.700 --> 02:01:53.540]   - Red and yellow.
[02:01:53.540 --> 02:01:57.380]   - It's currently orange and boy, sky blue.
[02:01:57.380 --> 02:01:59.140]   - Yeah, it's like a nice sky blue.
[02:01:59.140 --> 02:02:04.020]   - What advice, since you're wearing a suit,
[02:02:04.020 --> 02:02:05.980]   I feel like you're qualified to give advice,
[02:02:05.980 --> 02:02:08.420]   what advice would you give to young people?
[02:02:08.420 --> 02:02:11.780]   High school, college, about how to have a career
[02:02:11.780 --> 02:02:14.500]   they can be proud of or how to have a life
[02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:15.820]   they can be proud of?
[02:02:15.820 --> 02:02:19.660]   - I mean, you have to listen to your gut all the time.
[02:02:19.660 --> 02:02:23.740]   That's the compass that we have, is listening to your gut.
[02:02:23.740 --> 02:02:25.900]   - What does your gut tell you?
[02:02:25.900 --> 02:02:28.780]   Was that originally the dream of being an actor?
[02:02:28.780 --> 02:02:29.860]   - Yeah, for me.
[02:02:29.860 --> 02:02:32.620]   - Your parents support that at all?
[02:02:32.620 --> 02:02:36.140]   - I had the advantage of having parents who were immigrants,
[02:02:36.140 --> 02:02:40.220]   so they didn't really know a lot about what you--
[02:02:40.220 --> 02:02:41.180]   - So you just made shit up?
[02:02:41.180 --> 02:02:42.020]   You just made shit up?
[02:02:42.020 --> 02:02:43.340]   - It was like, yeah, of course I'm studying
[02:02:43.340 --> 02:02:46.100]   and I'm skipping school to go do auditions and stuff.
[02:02:46.100 --> 02:02:48.620]   No, I just kind of feel like, you know,
[02:02:48.620 --> 02:02:51.140]   and I know it was different for my older siblings
[02:02:51.140 --> 02:02:54.620]   because my parents had just shown up in Canada.
[02:02:54.620 --> 02:02:56.220]   I was born like 10 years later.
[02:02:56.220 --> 02:03:02.100]   You can get away with some things and you can actually,
[02:03:02.100 --> 02:03:05.660]   you know, I think my parents, they wanted us to,
[02:03:05.660 --> 02:03:09.180]   they didn't have a whole lot to tell us about what to do.
[02:03:09.180 --> 02:03:12.140]   They weren't gonna do that with us
[02:03:12.140 --> 02:03:14.300]   'cause they're in this brand new world
[02:03:14.300 --> 02:03:16.140]   and there's all these possibilities.
[02:03:16.140 --> 02:03:22.420]   But there was something that I feel like they had to do,
[02:03:22.420 --> 02:03:25.580]   which was tell us to do what we love.
[02:03:25.580 --> 02:03:27.240]   If you love doing it, do it.
[02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:31.300]   And I feel like that's really served me
[02:03:31.300 --> 02:03:33.260]   and what I would tell young people is,
[02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:35.740]   if you can find something you love,
[02:03:35.740 --> 02:03:38.460]   and nowadays with the internet and finding other people
[02:03:38.460 --> 02:03:41.620]   that, you know, it's not like you need to find
[02:03:41.620 --> 02:03:43.100]   a lot of people anymore.
[02:03:43.100 --> 02:03:45.820]   You just need to find the people that dig what you dig.
[02:03:45.820 --> 02:03:48.980]   And if you can make a career out of doing something
[02:03:48.980 --> 02:03:53.980]   that you love, it's been said, it's a good thing, you know?
[02:03:53.980 --> 02:03:56.380]   - How long did it take you to figure out
[02:03:56.380 --> 02:03:59.980]   that you really love acting?
[02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:02.020]   You know, 'cause sometimes you have a dream
[02:04:02.020 --> 02:04:05.140]   and then you meet, the dream meets reality, right?
[02:04:05.140 --> 02:04:05.980]   - Yeah.
[02:04:05.980 --> 02:04:07.780]   - And then the reality might be much less pleasant
[02:04:07.780 --> 02:04:09.700]   and much darker than the dream.
[02:04:09.700 --> 02:04:12.180]   - Well, the reality is less pleasant, you know?
[02:04:12.180 --> 02:04:16.140]   And there are things that happen during an experience
[02:04:16.140 --> 02:04:19.620]   of shooting something that you could take or leave, right?
[02:04:19.620 --> 02:04:23.980]   But the, you know, the part where you're on set
[02:04:23.980 --> 02:04:27.460]   and you've rehearsed for a minute or whatever,
[02:04:27.460 --> 02:04:29.020]   at least you know where you're supposed to stand
[02:04:29.020 --> 02:04:30.660]   and you know all your lines show up,
[02:04:30.660 --> 02:04:33.100]   knowing everything, knowing what you're gonna do
[02:04:33.100 --> 02:04:35.460]   and what you aim to do.
[02:04:35.460 --> 02:04:38.820]   And those moments make it all worth it
[02:04:38.820 --> 02:04:41.660]   when you're, you know, not to sound like a douchebag,
[02:04:41.660 --> 02:04:45.540]   but between action and cut, that's the stuff
[02:04:45.540 --> 02:04:50.540]   that is, that makes me, that has me continuing
[02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:54.860]   to do what I do, aside from the fact that it's like,
[02:04:54.860 --> 02:04:56.580]   I don't know how to do anything else.
[02:04:56.580 --> 02:04:58.780]   - You think you'll ever do like a dramatic,
[02:04:58.780 --> 02:05:00.500]   like a mob movie?
[02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:02.260]   - Yeah, like the one, the Inside Game
[02:05:02.260 --> 02:05:04.100]   that I was just talking about, or this other movie
[02:05:04.100 --> 02:05:05.540]   I just did, it was a little while ago,
[02:05:05.540 --> 02:05:07.640]   called American Woman that was very heavy.
[02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:10.820]   And I love doing dramatic work.
[02:05:10.820 --> 02:05:12.820]   I love it, I love it.
[02:05:12.820 --> 02:05:14.980]   Yeah, and I played that, in Inside Game,
[02:05:14.980 --> 02:05:17.260]   it was kind of a, you know, it was a,
[02:05:17.260 --> 02:05:20.700]   there was a mob element and the fellow was,
[02:05:20.700 --> 02:05:22.660]   well, you know, the story's here or there
[02:05:22.660 --> 02:05:26.140]   with regard to how deep into the,
[02:05:26.140 --> 02:05:27.500]   but well, he was a bookie.
[02:05:27.500 --> 02:05:29.820]   He was just running money, you know, doing,
[02:05:29.820 --> 02:05:31.820]   he was making a lot of money for a lot of people
[02:05:31.820 --> 02:05:34.460]   and he figured out how to, you know, cook it
[02:05:34.460 --> 02:05:37.580]   with this dude who was an NBA ref.
[02:05:37.580 --> 02:05:40.500]   And it's a very interesting documentary,
[02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:42.420]   the thing that they just untold,
[02:05:42.420 --> 02:05:45.260]   under the Untold series, they cover it.
[02:05:45.260 --> 02:05:50.200]   But getting to play that guy, that was a gas for me.
[02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:51.980]   'Cause he's like a, he was, you know,
[02:05:51.980 --> 02:05:54.380]   there was a lot of unsavory stuff.
[02:05:54.380 --> 02:05:57.020]   And he's definitely the guy, the character in the movie,
[02:05:57.020 --> 02:06:00.180]   who is the wild card and you don't wanna
[02:06:00.180 --> 02:06:02.060]   necessarily mess with him.
[02:06:02.060 --> 02:06:04.020]   And I got to, I remember this fellow,
[02:06:04.020 --> 02:06:07.220]   who is a real guy, speaking to him,
[02:06:07.220 --> 02:06:12.220]   it was just bizarre to hear, like I said to him,
[02:06:12.220 --> 02:06:14.260]   he was a little concerned about this and that.
[02:06:14.260 --> 02:06:16.260]   Like, hey, you know, you say whatever the fuck
[02:06:16.260 --> 02:06:17.080]   you want in your movie.
[02:06:17.080 --> 02:06:19.260]   I got my book and I got this other fucking deal.
[02:06:19.260 --> 02:06:21.340]   But he goes, you know, I didn't do this
[02:06:21.340 --> 02:06:22.360]   and I didn't do that.
[02:06:22.360 --> 02:06:23.820]   And I'm like, yeah, all right, I gotcha.
[02:06:23.820 --> 02:06:25.340]   And he goes, yeah, I'm telling you,
[02:06:25.340 --> 02:06:26.580]   like I did, I'm talking to you,
[02:06:26.580 --> 02:06:28.620]   one on one, I did not do this, I did, okay?
[02:06:28.620 --> 02:06:30.300]   I'm just fucking tell you, do whatever the fuck
[02:06:30.300 --> 02:06:32.300]   you want with your movie, but this is what's up.
[02:06:32.300 --> 02:06:33.500]   And I said, you ever seen "Goodfellas?"
[02:06:33.500 --> 02:06:35.540]   He's like, yeah, I fucking love that movie.
[02:06:35.540 --> 02:06:38.200]   'Cause he, like I said, he did some unsavory shit.
[02:06:38.200 --> 02:06:40.480]   And I go, you remember the scene where,
[02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:43.940]   where, you know, the guy, the neighbor,
[02:06:43.940 --> 02:06:46.240]   Lorraine Bracco's neighbor was, you know,
[02:06:46.240 --> 02:06:48.300]   made her uncomfortable and was touching on her.
[02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:50.860]   And she goes to Ray Liotta and he goes,
[02:06:50.860 --> 02:06:52.260]   where the fuck does this guy live?
[02:06:52.260 --> 02:06:53.820]   And then he go, and remember, and he walks
[02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:56.300]   across the street and pistol whips the dude.
[02:06:56.300 --> 02:06:58.140]   You touch her again, you're dead!
[02:06:58.140 --> 02:06:58.980]   You hear me?
[02:06:58.980 --> 02:06:59.820]   - Yeah, good scene.
[02:06:59.820 --> 02:07:01.580]   - Don't you, fucking great scene.
[02:07:01.580 --> 02:07:03.500]   He goes, I love that scene.
[02:07:03.500 --> 02:07:04.820]   I go, that's you.
[02:07:04.820 --> 02:07:07.660]   So you're doing shit that we know is terrible,
[02:07:07.660 --> 02:07:08.500]   but we love you.
[02:07:08.500 --> 02:07:10.020]   He goes, all right, I got it.
[02:07:10.020 --> 02:07:11.540]   And then I said, there's this one scene,
[02:07:11.540 --> 02:07:13.700]   I explained the scene to him where the,
[02:07:13.700 --> 02:07:17.340]   one of the mobsters, tough guys was in the window
[02:07:17.340 --> 02:07:21.220]   of the car and Jimmy, my character is very coked up
[02:07:21.220 --> 02:07:23.580]   at the time and he's hemorrhaging money here and there
[02:07:23.580 --> 02:07:25.860]   and making bad bets 'cause he's getting sloppy.
[02:07:25.860 --> 02:07:27.940]   And this guy wants to bug him about some Jets,
[02:07:27.940 --> 02:07:28.940]   Giants bet or something.
[02:07:28.940 --> 02:07:30.260]   I'm like, tell him you're a fucking asshole,
[02:07:30.260 --> 02:07:31.620]   don't fucking do it.
[02:07:31.620 --> 02:07:33.340]   He's like, yeah, well, the fucking Giants.
[02:07:33.340 --> 02:07:36.140]   And in the scene, Jimmy, my character grabs him
[02:07:36.140 --> 02:07:39.140]   by the lapels and just smashes his face
[02:07:39.140 --> 02:07:41.620]   against the roof of the car.
[02:07:41.620 --> 02:07:45.140]   And I say this to Jimmy and he goes,
[02:07:45.140 --> 02:07:46.300]   oh yeah, I would have done that.
[02:07:46.300 --> 02:07:48.300]   That's not a fucking big deal.
[02:07:48.300 --> 02:07:50.060]   - I wonder also the interaction.
[02:07:50.060 --> 02:07:51.800]   I wonder what the filming of,
[02:07:52.940 --> 02:07:56.500]   probably my favorite gambling movie is "Casino"
[02:07:56.500 --> 02:07:59.460]   with Joe Pesci and De Niro.
[02:07:59.460 --> 02:08:00.580]   Like when they're out in the desert
[02:08:00.580 --> 02:08:01.500]   yelling at each other.
[02:08:01.500 --> 02:08:03.340]   I wonder how many takes that is.
[02:08:03.340 --> 02:08:07.100]   Like, 'cause they, I don't know how scripted that is.
[02:08:07.100 --> 02:08:08.380]   I mean, it probably is a little bit,
[02:08:08.380 --> 02:08:13.100]   but like, I don't think you can script the performance
[02:08:13.100 --> 02:08:14.420]   that Joe Pesci does.
[02:08:14.420 --> 02:08:16.100]   - Don't make a fuck out of me, Ace.
[02:08:16.100 --> 02:08:17.060]   - Yeah.
[02:08:17.060 --> 02:08:19.980]   - Like, I fucking brought you here.
[02:08:19.980 --> 02:08:20.820]   - Yeah.
[02:08:20.820 --> 02:08:24.580]   - And he's just like pointing at that energy
[02:08:24.580 --> 02:08:25.740]   and they're standing there.
[02:08:25.740 --> 02:08:26.580]   - And their friendship.
[02:08:26.580 --> 02:08:29.940]   - And De Niro's like, that whole thing.
[02:08:29.940 --> 02:08:33.020]   And then in the, yeah, like that energy.
[02:08:33.020 --> 02:08:33.860]   What is that?
[02:08:33.860 --> 02:08:37.140]   I mean, they must, they somehow find it together.
[02:08:37.140 --> 02:08:39.140]   - You could tell me that that was one take
[02:08:39.140 --> 02:08:39.980]   and I'd believe you.
[02:08:39.980 --> 02:08:42.300]   You could tell me that that was seven takes
[02:08:42.300 --> 02:08:43.140]   and I would believe you.
[02:08:43.140 --> 02:08:45.300]   - I bet you all the takes had that energy.
[02:08:45.300 --> 02:08:46.660]   Like they were playing with it, right?
[02:08:46.660 --> 02:08:48.820]   They were playing with that.
[02:08:50.180 --> 02:08:55.180]   Yeah, I mean, they took on a real personality
[02:08:55.180 --> 02:08:57.100]   in those scenes and really carried them forward.
[02:08:57.100 --> 02:08:58.940]   I mean, it's just a brilliant, brilliant performance.
[02:08:58.940 --> 02:09:01.740]   Doesn't get, like comedies, like mob movies
[02:09:01.740 --> 02:09:04.060]   probably don't get enough credit either
[02:09:04.060 --> 02:09:05.500]   because it's seen as like-
[02:09:05.500 --> 02:09:07.180]   - Mob movies don't get enough credit?
[02:09:07.180 --> 02:09:08.700]   - In the Oscars, I mean, like-
[02:09:08.700 --> 02:09:09.980]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:09:09.980 --> 02:09:11.360]   'Cause it seems like a trope.
[02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:13.020]   It's like giving a Western,
[02:09:13.020 --> 02:09:14.940]   it's gotta be a hell of a Western or whatever
[02:09:14.940 --> 02:09:17.140]   'cause it's like an old Hollywood trope.
[02:09:17.140 --> 02:09:19.740]   Yeah, no, that scene is so great
[02:09:19.740 --> 02:09:20.700]   'cause they're never at,
[02:09:20.700 --> 02:09:24.260]   they're at the height of their friendship in a way
[02:09:24.260 --> 02:09:27.580]   and they're also pretty much about to let go of it
[02:09:27.580 --> 02:09:28.660]   and become enemies.
[02:09:28.660 --> 02:09:31.220]   And both things are happening at the same time.
[02:09:31.220 --> 02:09:33.780]   And Pesci drives them out to the desert.
[02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:35.980]   And if I remember correctly,
[02:09:35.980 --> 02:09:39.700]   De Niro's character, Rothstein, Rothschild,
[02:09:39.700 --> 02:09:43.860]   he says, "I gave myself 50/50, whether I'm coming back."
[02:09:43.860 --> 02:09:46.220]   - Yeah, it's such a good scene.
[02:09:46.220 --> 02:09:49.100]   Usually my prospects of coming back from the desert
[02:09:49.100 --> 02:09:51.540]   would be 90 to 10 or something like that.
[02:09:51.540 --> 02:09:54.180]   But no, this time I wasn't sure.
[02:09:54.180 --> 02:09:56.460]   And there's the car driving really fast.
[02:09:56.460 --> 02:09:58.980]   And then Joe Pesci's like, "You motherfucker, you,"
[02:09:58.980 --> 02:10:00.340]   like whatever he was doing.
[02:10:00.340 --> 02:10:03.620]   A Jew, of course there's antisemitism or whatever.
[02:10:03.620 --> 02:10:07.140]   Or not, between friends, who gives a shit?
[02:10:07.140 --> 02:10:08.180]   All that kind of stuff.
[02:10:08.180 --> 02:10:10.660]   Yeah, I mean, brilliant, brilliant performances.
[02:10:10.660 --> 02:10:12.940]   So yeah, I can understand why you love the art
[02:10:12.940 --> 02:10:15.060]   and putting it all out there and leaving it.
[02:10:15.060 --> 02:10:15.900]   - Yeah, man, it's fun.
[02:10:15.900 --> 02:10:17.020]   It's fun and it's still fun.
[02:10:17.020 --> 02:10:19.060]   It's still crazy fun.
[02:10:19.060 --> 02:10:22.180]   If I go a while without getting a gig,
[02:10:22.180 --> 02:10:27.740]   if I go a minute, then I end up and I work on something,
[02:10:27.740 --> 02:10:32.340]   I'm like, it's like, "Oh, I've been thirsty for this."
[02:10:32.340 --> 02:10:35.980]   Like I actually am really so happy.
[02:10:35.980 --> 02:10:37.940]   Even if it's something where it's like,
[02:10:37.940 --> 02:10:42.260]   the things where, "This was a pain in the ass,"
[02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:43.100]   and that or whatever,
[02:10:43.100 --> 02:10:45.740]   or you're on the road doing something and anything,
[02:10:45.740 --> 02:10:46.980]   whatever, you lost your luggage,
[02:10:46.980 --> 02:10:48.580]   whatever the heck you've got going on
[02:10:48.580 --> 02:10:52.500]   in your day-to-day life that everyone brings to work
[02:10:52.500 --> 02:10:55.740]   and tries to let go of, once we're doing the scene,
[02:10:55.740 --> 02:10:57.340]   oh man, it's the best.
[02:10:57.340 --> 02:11:01.100]   - But that said, you're a great actor,
[02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:03.900]   but I just think I speak for a lot of people
[02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:06.540]   that you're also, there's a charisma to you
[02:11:06.540 --> 02:11:10.140]   that's great to reveal in raw form in different podcasts.
[02:11:10.140 --> 02:11:11.260]   - Oh, cheers, man.
[02:11:11.260 --> 02:11:13.260]   - In "Dudesy," "10 Minute Pod,"
[02:11:13.260 --> 02:11:14.660]   just as a guest on podcasts,
[02:11:14.660 --> 02:11:17.020]   it's always really fun to watch you.
[02:11:17.020 --> 02:11:17.860]   - Cheers.
[02:11:17.860 --> 02:11:19.860]   - The way you have fun, the way you think,
[02:11:19.860 --> 02:11:22.380]   the raw, the raw Will Sasso,
[02:11:22.380 --> 02:11:25.900]   which is a nice compliment to your kind of acting.
[02:11:25.900 --> 02:11:27.860]   - That's really sweet, yeah, cheers.
[02:11:27.860 --> 02:11:31.180]   Well, you know, look, you said, you know.
[02:11:31.180 --> 02:11:33.220]   - You're making that face.
[02:11:33.220 --> 02:11:35.780]   - I'm making that face, I'm making that after the take face.
[02:11:35.780 --> 02:11:38.140]   No, I love doing stuff off the cuff,
[02:11:38.140 --> 02:11:40.380]   that's kind of you to say, and I dig,
[02:11:40.380 --> 02:11:43.940]   I really do dig doing stuff in front of an audience
[02:11:43.940 --> 02:11:48.500]   'cause I love seeing, I don't give it to myself very often.
[02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:50.380]   If I'm doing, even if I'm, you know,
[02:11:50.380 --> 02:11:52.780]   I've done a bunch of multi-camera sitcoms and stuff.
[02:11:52.780 --> 02:11:55.220]   "Mad TV" was shot in front of a live studio audience.
[02:11:55.220 --> 02:11:56.420]   - You like that energy?
[02:11:56.420 --> 02:11:58.700]   - I love it, but I can only hear them.
[02:11:58.700 --> 02:12:00.340]   You can't see them because of the lights,
[02:12:00.340 --> 02:12:02.780]   like it is in a lot of performances.
[02:12:02.780 --> 02:12:05.380]   And I would imagine with standup,
[02:12:05.380 --> 02:12:07.700]   it's, you know, you see the first couple rows.
[02:12:07.700 --> 02:12:11.820]   I've done, I do this character that does standup,
[02:12:11.820 --> 02:12:14.380]   and I used to take him out and do things with him
[02:12:14.380 --> 02:12:16.340]   and do little bits here and there.
[02:12:16.340 --> 02:12:18.500]   I haven't done it in like four or five years.
[02:12:18.500 --> 02:12:20.740]   - I think, did Bobby say that character
[02:12:20.740 --> 02:12:21.780]   opened up for Bobby?
[02:12:21.780 --> 02:12:25.300]   - Yeah, but he said, "I have to do it as myself too."
[02:12:25.300 --> 02:12:26.740]   I think in that podcast, he's like,
[02:12:26.740 --> 02:12:29.500]   "Okay, you're gonna come with me and open for me in Brea,
[02:12:29.500 --> 02:12:31.060]   "but you have to do it as yourself."
[02:12:31.060 --> 02:12:32.380]   - Did that ever happen?
[02:12:32.380 --> 02:12:36.940]   - It did, and I did the character, you know,
[02:12:36.940 --> 02:12:39.140]   who's a character I came up with on "10 Minute Podcast."
[02:12:39.140 --> 02:12:40.660]   He's just this comedian, right?
[02:12:40.660 --> 02:12:42.940]   He calls himself an open mic veteran.
[02:12:42.940 --> 02:12:44.500]   You know, he's been doing open mics forever.
[02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:47.820]   And so I did it, opening up for Bobby,
[02:12:47.820 --> 02:12:50.820]   and he's like, "You have to do some of it as yourself."
[02:12:50.820 --> 02:12:52.020]   So I just kind of did this bit
[02:12:52.020 --> 02:12:53.580]   where I would do some of his jokes,
[02:12:53.580 --> 02:12:55.420]   and then I would take, you know,
[02:12:55.420 --> 02:12:57.300]   silly, I got a fucking wig on,
[02:12:57.300 --> 02:12:59.500]   and I take the wig off and I go,
[02:12:59.500 --> 02:13:01.460]   and as myself, I start explaining it.
[02:13:01.460 --> 02:13:02.820]   Hello, my name is Will.
[02:13:02.820 --> 02:13:04.420]   See, the reason that it's funny
[02:13:04.420 --> 02:13:08.020]   is because Arnold Schwarzenegger is always,
[02:13:08.020 --> 02:13:09.300]   he's in these movies,
[02:13:09.300 --> 02:13:11.140]   and he's got the thick Austrian accent,
[02:13:11.140 --> 02:13:13.180]   but he's like, "My name is Ben Williams.
[02:13:13.180 --> 02:13:15.820]   I'm a cop from Colorado."
[02:13:15.820 --> 02:13:17.220]   No, you're not.
[02:13:17.220 --> 02:13:19.660]   And it doesn't make sense as the comedian character
[02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:21.340]   that I'm doing, 'cause that character
[02:13:21.340 --> 02:13:23.020]   doesn't do impersonations.
[02:13:23.020 --> 02:13:24.620]   Okay, carrying on.
[02:13:24.620 --> 02:13:25.900]   And then I put the wig back on
[02:13:25.900 --> 02:13:28.020]   and go back into this dumb thing.
[02:13:28.020 --> 02:13:29.780]   And I don't think it was very good,
[02:13:29.780 --> 02:13:32.700]   but Bobby required it in order for me to open for him.
[02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:33.980]   He's like, "You're not fucking doing it.
[02:13:33.980 --> 02:13:36.340]   So I'm not gonna get up on stage and not do."
[02:13:36.340 --> 02:13:38.020]   We agreed, I'll do it.
[02:13:38.020 --> 02:13:42.380]   But having been up there just in, you know, whatever,
[02:13:42.380 --> 02:13:44.380]   I've done it like a dozen fucking times,
[02:13:44.380 --> 02:13:45.460]   not a bunch of times, right?
[02:13:45.460 --> 02:13:46.300]   Like nothing.
[02:13:46.300 --> 02:13:49.580]   And you know, these comedians that go up every night,
[02:13:49.580 --> 02:13:51.340]   sometimes two times a night.
[02:13:51.340 --> 02:13:57.620]   I will say, I love performing in front of people
[02:13:57.620 --> 02:13:59.100]   when I get the chance,
[02:13:59.100 --> 02:14:04.100]   but it's a specific thing that I just,
[02:14:04.100 --> 02:14:06.860]   I just, I don't know.
[02:14:06.860 --> 02:14:07.900]   I gotta go back to this.
[02:14:07.900 --> 02:14:10.900]   It's like the providing value, you know?
[02:14:10.900 --> 02:14:13.260]   I think great standups are fucking incredible.
[02:14:13.260 --> 02:14:17.060]   I'll go, you know, when I've gone and watched standup,
[02:14:17.060 --> 02:14:19.100]   you know, there's your friend you're going to see,
[02:14:19.100 --> 02:14:20.500]   but then there's this other person
[02:14:20.500 --> 02:14:21.660]   who really speaks to you.
[02:14:21.660 --> 02:14:22.820]   You know what I mean?
[02:14:22.820 --> 02:14:27.500]   And if you like one comedian a night, that's a lot.
[02:14:27.500 --> 02:14:32.500]   'Cause a comedy club is like a fucking crazy restaurant
[02:14:32.500 --> 02:14:36.100]   where there's no menu.
[02:14:36.100 --> 02:14:37.700]   And it's like, what would you like?
[02:14:37.700 --> 02:14:39.220]   It's, there's nothing else like that.
[02:14:39.220 --> 02:14:42.420]   There's like, you don't go to like a music place.
[02:14:42.420 --> 02:14:43.460]   What do we got here?
[02:14:43.460 --> 02:14:45.820]   We got Christian metal and there's some world music
[02:14:45.820 --> 02:14:47.500]   and then there's a reggae thing
[02:14:47.500 --> 02:14:50.420]   and it's all rammed in together.
[02:14:50.420 --> 02:14:52.300]   Or you don't go to a restaurant.
[02:14:52.300 --> 02:14:53.420]   I'd love a nice steak.
[02:14:53.420 --> 02:14:54.260]   Cool.
[02:14:54.260 --> 02:14:55.860]   First, here's a bowl of Froot Loops.
[02:14:55.860 --> 02:14:57.940]   And then we got you a crudité.
[02:14:57.940 --> 02:14:59.940]   And then this is our sushi tower.
[02:14:59.940 --> 02:15:00.940]   And well, what about the steak?
[02:15:00.940 --> 02:15:02.100]   Oh, the steak's coming.
[02:15:02.100 --> 02:15:03.180]   And then blah, blah, blah.
[02:15:03.180 --> 02:15:04.540]   Oh no, the steak got bumped.
[02:15:04.540 --> 02:15:05.820]   So there's no steak,
[02:15:05.820 --> 02:15:09.060]   but here's a fucking shitty store-bought cheesecake.
[02:15:09.060 --> 02:15:12.100]   And that's what comedians are up against
[02:15:12.100 --> 02:15:13.380]   when they go into a place.
[02:15:13.380 --> 02:15:16.660]   It's like, I don't pair well with the poached salmon.
[02:15:16.660 --> 02:15:17.500]   I'm chicken fingers.
[02:15:17.500 --> 02:15:20.140]   I already am chicken fingers.
[02:15:20.140 --> 02:15:24.540]   So these great comedians that are able to go up on a night
[02:15:24.540 --> 02:15:26.860]   where poached salmon goes up and then it's like,
[02:15:26.860 --> 02:15:28.900]   fuck, you are also spicy?
[02:15:28.900 --> 02:15:30.180]   I got some kick to me.
[02:15:30.180 --> 02:15:33.500]   - For me, even going to open mics,
[02:15:33.500 --> 02:15:36.060]   it could be a wonderful escape.
[02:15:36.060 --> 02:15:36.900]   - Yeah.
[02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:40.140]   - I mean, just laughing together with others,
[02:15:40.140 --> 02:15:42.500]   it can make you, I don't know, it just feels really good.
[02:15:42.500 --> 02:15:44.140]   - When we've done like, you know, like,
[02:15:44.140 --> 02:15:46.060]   and I hope to do it with Doodsy,
[02:15:46.060 --> 02:15:50.220]   but like live podcasts are fun in front of groups of people.
[02:15:50.220 --> 02:15:52.020]   And you know, you talk to them afterwards
[02:15:52.020 --> 02:15:54.860]   and take some pictures and man, they are,
[02:15:54.860 --> 02:15:57.500]   they forgot what the fuck they got going on.
[02:15:57.500 --> 02:15:59.700]   And a lot of them got to go back to work the next day.
[02:15:59.700 --> 02:16:01.900]   It's a Wednesday or Thursday, you know?
[02:16:01.900 --> 02:16:03.460]   No, it's a lot of value.
[02:16:03.460 --> 02:16:07.220]   I'm fortunate enough to be busy doing my own bullshit.
[02:16:07.220 --> 02:16:09.220]   - What's the meaning of life, Wasaso?
[02:16:09.220 --> 02:16:12.180]   - What is the meaning of life?
[02:16:12.180 --> 02:16:13.020]   - Why are we here?
[02:16:13.020 --> 02:16:14.780]   Why, why, why?
[02:16:14.780 --> 02:16:16.900]   - Was it the meaning of life?
[02:16:16.900 --> 02:16:18.700]   Wasn't, didn't they explain it at the end
[02:16:18.700 --> 02:16:19.540]   of meaning of life?
[02:16:19.540 --> 02:16:21.420]   I think it was Michael Palin that said,
[02:16:21.420 --> 02:16:24.420]   try to get a walk in, be nice to neighbors,
[02:16:24.420 --> 02:16:25.420]   eat enough fiber.
[02:16:25.420 --> 02:16:26.260]   Wasn't that the--
[02:16:26.260 --> 02:16:27.900]   - Fiber, fiber is part of it?
[02:16:27.900 --> 02:16:28.740]   - Yeah, I think it's--
[02:16:28.740 --> 02:16:29.580]   - Nutrition.
[02:16:29.580 --> 02:16:31.500]   - Have a bowl of bran in the morning
[02:16:31.500 --> 02:16:33.420]   and don't take yourself too seriously.
[02:16:33.420 --> 02:16:36.000]   - Yeah.
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.020]   - No, well, no one gets out alive, I think is the--
[02:16:38.020 --> 02:16:39.620]   - Herman Hesse, one of my favorite writers,
[02:16:39.620 --> 02:16:40.920]   he's a Nobel Prize winner,
[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:44.940]   in a book called Steppenwolf,
[02:16:44.940 --> 02:16:47.180]   says learn what is to be taken seriously
[02:16:47.180 --> 02:16:48.700]   and laugh at the rest.
[02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:49.820]   - Oh, that's awesome.
[02:16:49.820 --> 02:16:51.860]   - What's the percentage distribution on that?
[02:16:51.860 --> 02:16:54.420]   So how much of life should you take seriously?
[02:16:54.420 --> 02:16:57.540]   And then how much do you just laugh at?
[02:16:57.540 --> 02:17:00.620]   - Oh man, if you can laugh at everything, you're winning.
[02:17:00.620 --> 02:17:01.460]   - Yeah.
[02:17:01.460 --> 02:17:03.140]   - It's almost impossible.
[02:17:03.140 --> 02:17:05.100]   I think that there's,
[02:17:05.100 --> 02:17:08.540]   and also could be quite irresponsible to do that.
[02:17:08.540 --> 02:17:13.620]   I take things, I take a lot of things way too seriously.
[02:17:13.620 --> 02:17:14.460]   I know that.
[02:17:14.460 --> 02:17:17.380]   I do, I do, I really do.
[02:17:17.380 --> 02:17:19.500]   - People will be in part surprised by that,
[02:17:19.500 --> 02:17:21.460]   but I think that radiates from you.
[02:17:21.460 --> 02:17:22.280]   - Really?
[02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:23.120]   Yeah, I do, I do.
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:25.720]   I take things way too fucking seriously sometimes.
[02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:26.560]   But--
[02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:27.540]   - Yeah, you gotta do that.
[02:17:27.540 --> 02:17:29.800]   - Yeah, you gotta loosen the neck up.
[02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:32.940]   But no, I think that's really good.
[02:17:32.940 --> 02:17:34.820]   That's really good stuff.
[02:17:34.820 --> 02:17:37.620]   I don't know what the percentage is to have a good life
[02:17:37.620 --> 02:17:42.620]   or a happy, healthy life, but, you know.
[02:17:42.620 --> 02:17:46.620]   For me, the meaning of life is getting to live it
[02:17:46.620 --> 02:17:48.320]   as long as you hope to.
[02:17:48.320 --> 02:17:49.540]   That's nice.
[02:17:49.540 --> 02:17:53.900]   And when you lose someone,
[02:17:53.900 --> 02:17:57.340]   or if perhaps you're faced with your own mortality,
[02:17:57.340 --> 02:18:00.420]   I think that puts that into perspective.
[02:18:00.420 --> 02:18:04.100]   And, but, you know.
[02:18:04.100 --> 02:18:05.580]   - Get lots of fiber.
[02:18:05.580 --> 02:18:06.740]   - Get lots of fiber.
[02:18:06.740 --> 02:18:09.620]   Be nice to everybody.
[02:18:09.620 --> 02:18:12.300]   And yeah, don't take things too seriously.
[02:18:12.300 --> 02:18:13.940]   It's a good one.
[02:18:13.940 --> 02:18:17.060]   Our minds are fucking big, weird,
[02:18:17.060 --> 02:18:22.420]   it's a big, weird, shitty fucking bucket of shit
[02:18:22.420 --> 02:18:24.660]   that's trying to get you to think horrible shit
[02:18:24.660 --> 02:18:26.100]   about yourself all the time.
[02:18:26.100 --> 02:18:27.380]   - Shitty bucket of shit.
[02:18:27.380 --> 02:18:28.220]   - Shitty bucket of shit.
[02:18:28.220 --> 02:18:29.660]   - I think there's a book I never read,
[02:18:29.660 --> 02:18:32.180]   but I read the title, and it's a good words to live by,
[02:18:32.180 --> 02:18:35.220]   which is, "Don't sweat the small stuff,
[02:18:35.220 --> 02:18:37.700]   and it's all small stuff."
[02:18:37.700 --> 02:18:38.540]   That's another way.
[02:18:38.540 --> 02:18:39.980]   - Was that Dr. Phil?
[02:18:39.980 --> 02:18:41.460]   Wasn't Dr. Phil, was it?
[02:18:41.460 --> 02:18:43.860]   - I don't know, but I think the conclusion
[02:18:43.860 --> 02:18:46.300]   also has fiber as part of it.
[02:18:46.300 --> 02:18:48.380]   I think that all ties it together.
[02:18:48.380 --> 02:18:50.700]   And in the end, of course,
[02:18:50.700 --> 02:18:53.360]   just put love out there in the world.
[02:18:53.360 --> 02:18:55.740]   I think that's a pretty good way to go.
[02:18:55.740 --> 02:18:58.500]   - What would you say is the meaning of life?
[02:18:58.500 --> 02:18:59.860]   Put love out in the world?
[02:18:59.860 --> 02:19:00.860]   - I would say love, yeah.
[02:19:00.860 --> 02:19:02.220]   - Yeah? - Yeah, yeah.
[02:19:02.220 --> 02:19:05.700]   It's a long conversation on what that really means,
[02:19:05.700 --> 02:19:08.380]   but I'm sure robots are involved, yeah.
[02:19:08.380 --> 02:19:11.060]   - Well, let me tell you, I feel a little safer
[02:19:11.060 --> 02:19:13.340]   knowing that someone who has a hand
[02:19:13.340 --> 02:19:18.020]   in bringing these robots to the masses,
[02:19:18.020 --> 02:19:21.500]   as you do, has that opinion of love
[02:19:21.500 --> 02:19:22.340]   and how important it is.
[02:19:22.340 --> 02:19:25.060]   I think that's great, because otherwise,
[02:19:25.060 --> 02:19:27.500]   it's gonna be that fucking scene from "T2"
[02:19:27.500 --> 02:19:31.660]   where Linda Hamilton's holding onto the fence
[02:19:31.660 --> 02:19:35.160]   and getting all of her flesh blown off of her skeleton
[02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:37.500]   before the rest of her is wiped away,
[02:19:37.500 --> 02:19:39.380]   'cause this Skynet shit.
[02:19:39.380 --> 02:19:41.460]   Anyway, I'm just terrified of Doodzy all the time.
[02:19:41.460 --> 02:19:42.900]   That's why I think that they will-
[02:19:42.900 --> 02:19:45.860]   - Doodzy in the wrong hands can do a lot of damage.
[02:19:45.860 --> 02:19:49.340]   - That's why Chad and I need to do our best to control it.
[02:19:49.340 --> 02:19:51.840]   - We need to travel back in time and murder Chad.
[02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:53.020]   (laughing)
[02:19:53.020 --> 02:19:54.420]   I think. - Yeah.
[02:19:54.420 --> 02:19:55.260]   That's, yeah.
[02:19:55.260 --> 02:19:56.220]   - That's the only way.
[02:19:56.220 --> 02:19:57.060]   - It's been said-
[02:19:57.060 --> 02:19:58.980]   - I don't know why you need to travel back in time,
[02:19:58.980 --> 02:20:02.380]   but you could just murder him today,
[02:20:02.380 --> 02:20:04.240]   but I think he'll be very suspicious.
[02:20:04.240 --> 02:20:08.380]   - My nefarious plans for Chad involve going back to tomorrow
[02:20:08.380 --> 02:20:09.860]   and planning for yesterday,
[02:20:09.860 --> 02:20:12.420]   and then hopefully Doodzy will give me the answer there
[02:20:12.420 --> 02:20:15.900]   with what it is to do with Chad's frozen body.
[02:20:15.900 --> 02:20:18.420]   If I gotta drive it out to, if I gotta take my,
[02:20:18.420 --> 02:20:23.460]   if I gotta get ahold of one of those Tesla mom vans
[02:20:23.460 --> 02:20:27.340]   and shove my garage freezer in it and plug it in
[02:20:27.340 --> 02:20:29.980]   and shove Chad in there and drive out to Arizona
[02:20:29.980 --> 02:20:31.300]   and deliver him under a mountain
[02:20:31.300 --> 02:20:33.460]   or wherever the fuck this place is,
[02:20:33.460 --> 02:20:35.060]   and say, "Here's this dog tag.
[02:20:35.060 --> 02:20:36.420]   "What does this get me?"
[02:20:36.420 --> 02:20:38.860]   And then I'm like, "Ah, it's gonna be 300 bucks.
[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:40.420]   "Do you have, do you take Amex?"
[02:20:40.420 --> 02:20:41.260]   No.
[02:20:41.260 --> 02:20:43.380]   And I'll be like, "Ah, shit."
[02:20:43.380 --> 02:20:46.180]   And I'll just dump him somewhere, breaking bad stuff.
[02:20:46.180 --> 02:20:50.580]   - Well, I would like to thank you and the, what is it?
[02:20:50.580 --> 02:20:55.020]   The Canadian International Agency Apparel.
[02:20:55.020 --> 02:20:56.580]   - Canadian International Apparel.
[02:20:56.580 --> 02:20:59.700]   - I can't wait for the sneakers from Doodzy.
[02:20:59.700 --> 02:21:03.500]   I can't wait for all the podcasts
[02:21:03.500 --> 02:21:07.580]   that AI can, and all the trouble it can get you in.
[02:21:07.580 --> 02:21:09.100]   So I'm a huge fan of yours.
[02:21:09.100 --> 02:21:11.380]   It's a huge honor that you would talk with me today.
[02:21:11.380 --> 02:21:13.140]   Well, this has been amazing.
[02:21:13.140 --> 02:21:13.980]   - Cheers, pal.
[02:21:13.980 --> 02:21:15.780]   Likewise, and I'm happy to be here, man.
[02:21:15.780 --> 02:21:16.820]   Cheers.
[02:21:16.820 --> 02:21:17.900]   - Bam.
[02:21:17.900 --> 02:21:19.460]   - Oh, that was three hours.
[02:21:19.460 --> 02:21:21.020]   Holy fuck, what?
[02:21:21.020 --> 02:21:23.500]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:21:23.500 --> 02:21:24.740]   with Will Sasso.
[02:21:24.740 --> 02:21:25.980]   To support this podcast,
