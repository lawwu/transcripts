[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.920]   a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.840]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.960]   to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.520]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.320]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.480]   On today's podcast, I would like to further that mission
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.360]   of Radical Personal Finance
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.400]   in a physical flesh and blood format
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.360]   by inviting you to join me
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.360]   for the inaugural Radical Personal Finance Family Camp,
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.840]   which I will be hosting in the great state of Indiana
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.200]   in about a month and a half.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.760]   I wanna give you a few minutes of details here
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.480]   on just some basic logistics of the event
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.880]   so that those of you who know, hey, I'm all in,
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.720]   you immediately know what you need to know
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.960]   and you can go and buy your tickets today.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.680]   And then I'll give you a more detailed backstory
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.680]   of my experience with events,
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.520]   a little bit more about how I'm designing the event, et cetera
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.400]   for those of you who are looking for more information.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.200]   In short, I am hosting
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.000]   the inaugural Radical Personal Finance Family Camp
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.280]   in Seymour, Indiana
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.560]   during the weekend of April 11 to April 14.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.320]   So to help you place the date into your mind,
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.000]   you can remember this as the weekend before tax day,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.240]   the weekend before tax day.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.960]   It's also going to be the weekend after
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.320]   the big solar eclipse, which will be on Monday.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.840]   And the family camp is going to be
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.160]   right inside of the totality.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.280]   We weren't able to line up the dates exactly,
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.040]   but we were able to line up the location.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.960]   So if you're traveling to see the solar eclipse, et cetera,
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.080]   this may work out really beautifully for you
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.200]   to join us the weekend after the solar eclipse.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.800]   The location of the event is in Seymour, Indiana,
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.120]   which is right smack dab in the middle between
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.520]   Indianapolis, Cincinnati, and Louisville, Kentucky.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.080]   So it's just South of Indianapolis, Indiana,
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.640]   just West of Cincinnati, Ohio,
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.000]   and just North of Louisville, Kentucky.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Very well connected.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.440]   There's tons of great inexpensive flights
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.120]   in and out of those three airports.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.080]   And then within driving distance,
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.960]   it's less than four hours driving distance
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.880]   from Chicago, St. Louis, even less from Nashville, et cetera.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.200]   And so I hope that it's a really great location
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.640]   for many of you and a workable date for many of you.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.400]   And in essence, what I am planning
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.320]   is what I'm calling a family camp weekend.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.640]   What I have built is a, it'll be a three-day event.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.040]   So you will arrive on Thursday, if you're able to,
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.400]   Thursday afternoon, Thursday evening, et cetera.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.560]   Then we'll be together all day, Friday, all day, Saturday,
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.600]   half a day, Sunday, and then you will be on your way.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.840]   And my idea is to provide a mixture
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.400]   of great education, personal finance talks,
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.200]   great lifestyle education on various topics
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.160]   related to things that I'm into and that you're into,
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.920]   as well as just a phenomenal time of socializing,
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.720]   getting to know one another, meaning you and me,
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.160]   also many of our friends
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.920]   in the Radical Personal Finance community,
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.280]   and then abundant camp activities.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.800]   I've rented all the facilities of a local church camp.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.120]   So we have all of the various camp facilities
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.280]   available to us.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.320]   And I'll go over more details of that in a moment.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.000]   If you know, that's it, Joshua, I'm in, I'm sold,
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.120]   go immediately to radicalfamilycamp.com,
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.880]   radicalfamilycamp.com, link in the show notes, of course,
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.600]   radicalfamilycamp.com, sign up now.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.760]   There is a first come, first save sale on,
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.560]   a significant sale for the first 20 adult tickets
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.520]   and the first 20 child tickets.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.840]   And that sale is valid for one week.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.120]   So if you know I'm in, go now,
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.880]   buy those tickets before they're all gone
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.960]   at radicalfamilycamp.com.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.560]   If you aren't sure,
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.760]   or you arrive at this more than a week from now,
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.040]   no problem, the tickets are still a great price
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.400]   and you'll see on the website there if they are available.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.760]   I hope to sell out the event
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.080]   and I have kind of a limited number of rooms,
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.560]   details on that in a little bit,
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.560]   but I, hey, go and check it out, radicalfamilycamp.com.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.360]   Now, four minutes and four seconds, that was pretty good.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.680]   I'm pretty proud of myself.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.080]   I think I get you all the information
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.720]   that the quick movers need.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.760]   I wanna share with you now a little bit of the backstory
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.760]   and describe in more detail of what I'm seeking to do
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.000]   and why I'm seeking to do it.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.880]   First of all, it has been my unrequited ambition
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.240]   to host events for the radical personal finance community
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.360]   for many years now.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.820]   And it has been very frustrating to me
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.200]   that I have not been able to do it yet, or at least well.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.720]   And I think we're finally, hopefully with this event,
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.840]   we're breaking the seal
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.320]   and we're gonna be able to do this really well.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.320]   But since starting Radical Personal Finance in 2013, 2014,
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.200]   I have been amazed at the community
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.760]   that has developed out of this podcast.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.080]   The number of emails that I get,
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.840]   the number of wonderful comments that I get
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.120]   is truly astounding.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.000]   And I'm grateful for each and every one of them.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.480]   And soon after I launched the podcast,
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.120]   I at that time attended frequently podcasting events
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.360]   and personal finance events, et cetera.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.360]   And I was always just entirely thrilled
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.340]   to meet up with listeners in various formats,
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.480]   had lots of breakfasts and lunches and dinners
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.420]   with so many of you.
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.820]   And it's just been an amazing,
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.320]   it's a great experience for me
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.600]   that I have always really enjoyed.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.720]   And then my wife and I started to have a bazillion babies
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.160]   and I basically swore off traveling for,
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.440]   traveling myself for a significant amount of time
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.240]   because it was a lot of work on her
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.040]   if I was not there for a significant period of time.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.500]   And obviously I could have forced her,
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.760]   she never complained about it.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.240]   And obviously I could have done that,
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.100]   but I figured what's the point of running your own life
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.060]   the way you wanna run it?
[00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.400]   Why should I go be a road warrior if I don't have to?
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.400]   And so I basically stopped going to a lot of events
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.360]   and conferences and things like that.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.680]   Haven't been to many of those things for over five years
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.920]   'cause we had all these young children
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.900]   and it just didn't seem appropriate to go.
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.000]   But I had a brilliant idea.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.840]   I had a brilliant idea that,
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.840]   hey, well, it's no problem, I'll just travel with my family.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.280]   And so starting back in 2018,
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.720]   my wife and I started traveling the United States in our RV.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.980]   And when I set off on that trip,
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.880]   one of the ambitions that I had
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.760]   was not just to travel with her,
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.120]   but to meet up with listeners all across the country.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.760]   I pictured myself having a different meetup
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.360]   in a different town every week, every two weeks,
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.760]   and announcing on the podcast,
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.800]   "Hey, we're in Nashville," or, "Hey, we're in Atlanta,"
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.680]   or, "Hey, we're in Denver," or whatever,
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.940]   and just hosting a new meetup across the country.
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.040]   That was my initial inclination.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.960]   That was what I wanted to do.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.340]   And I thought this is gonna be easy.
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.080]   After all, we got an RV, everything is great.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.940]   Well, it turns out that it wasn't easy.
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:04.640]   And basically it was largely a matter of handling logistics
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.360]   of event locations, dates, et cetera.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.160]   What we discovered at that time,
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.200]   RVing across the country with the five-year-old,
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.720]   a three-year-old, and one-year-old, et cetera,
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.200]   was that we were able to have a great time with our travels
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.480]   as long as we were not particularly committed
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.040]   to any certain schedule or to any certain dates.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.120]   So there were a few dates we hit,
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.200]   specific dates we needed to have,
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.740]   but beyond that, it was fairly stressful
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.320]   to have to be somewhere at a certain time.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.920]   And it was much easier if we traveled
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:41.920]   on a more carefree basis without firm commitment to dates.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.200]   And also our route at that point in time
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.360]   was fairly undetermined.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.560]   And we were trying to hit some hard dates
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.120]   that we wanted to visit with some people
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.320]   that we had planned out.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.860]   And then it just seemed like we needed to press on.
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:56.840]   We needed to press on.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.600]   And I think most people, when they start going traveling,
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.340]   certainly most RVers in the beginning,
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.940]   they have a tendency to move very quickly,
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.180]   to travel too much.
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.540]   And it was no different for us
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.820]   is that we traveled far too quickly
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.900]   and far too fast for ourselves, but we had good reasons.
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.520]   We didn't know how long we were gonna be on the road
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.100]   and we needed to keep making forward progress.
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.340]   I mean, it all seemed like good reasons.
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.500]   So we were traveling very, very quickly.
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.420]   And in order to host an event,
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.300]   I needed to be at least a week in advance.
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.580]   That would be kind of the minimum.
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.820]   And it would be ideal if it were a couple weeks in advance
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.740]   because many people listen to podcasts on a delayed schedule.
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.060]   They check in every now and then, every week or two.
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.820]   They don't listen right when a show is published,
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.460]   which is perfectly understandable.
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.180]   Just means that I needed to plan ahead more.
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:47.460]   And then I needed to plan ahead with certain logistics.
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.940]   So who should I host and where should we be
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.060]   and how many people will come, et cetera.
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.060]   And so the plan was to do meetups all across the country.
[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.260]   As it turns out, we only did a handful.
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.020]   We met up with some listeners privately
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.020]   who had invited us to see them.
[00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.800]   We hosted a handful of events,
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.380]   which were beautifully attended, the ones that we did do.
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.700]   Thank you very much.
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.740]   But those events worked when we knew we were going to be
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.260]   in a specific place for a specific period of time.
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.740]   And then we cut our trip short.
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.420]   I had planned to be on the road for a year.
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.740]   Turns out that we were on the road for six months.
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.940]   And so I cut the trip short
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.300]   and kind of abandoned the idea of doing it.
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.740]   And then once again, with small children,
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:26.620]   it was just challenging.
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.140]   We would go to an event and my wife and children could come.
[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.500]   They could be there for an hour, hour and a half,
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.140]   but usually the event would be late, bedtime, et cetera.
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.460]   It's not super great.
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.300]   And so then they would have to go back and go to bed
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.280]   and I would stay and visit for longer.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.700]   So once again, small children,
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.860]   while wonderful accessories to life,
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.980]   certainly do change your lifestyle
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.660]   and change your options in various ways.
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.220]   Then we, over the years,
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.740]   we started traveling internationally.
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.380]   And I remember two years ago,
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.700]   my plan was, you know, let's go to Europe.
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:56.860]   This is going to be fantastic.
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.660]   I got lots of European listeners.
[00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.220]   Let's, in addition to,
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.420]   let's have meetups all across Europe.
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.140]   And so I had a car,
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.340]   we're traveling across the continent,
[00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:07.980]   going here, going there.
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.460]   And once again, though,
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:13.220]   my ambitions were foolishly optimistic
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.580]   for all the reasons that I just said.
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.660]   And as it turns out,
[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.460]   we did no public meetups in Europe
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.620]   the entire time that we were there.
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.940]   And that trend has basically continued over the years,
[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.460]   is that I've wanted to do meetups.
[00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.140]   And I have, when I've gone on trips by myself
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.900]   to various places, I've done meetups,
[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.940]   various places in the United States, Canada, et cetera.
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.020]   And it's just been difficult
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.380]   to figure out how to do them in advance.
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.580]   It's challenging.
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.460]   Even the logistics of a simple meetup
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:41.780]   requires a little bit of planning,
[00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:42.940]   a little bit of commitment, et cetera.
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.660]   And it can be challenging to know how to do it.
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:49.340]   Why do I care about this?
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:50.900]   Like, why is this important?
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.860]   Well, it's my observation
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.180]   that we are living in a world
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.660]   in which the way that we interact with one another
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.700]   is changing dramatically.
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.660]   And it's not all good and it's not all bad.
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.020]   It's a mixture.
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:07.020]   First, with our digital communication revolution,
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:12.780]   a lot of our real and true interaction
[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.740]   could now happen in a disembodied way.
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.540]   I don't think that internet friendships
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:19.780]   are fake friendships.
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.020]   I think they are real.
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.020]   The way that we communicate with one another,
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.820]   using all the various forms of digital connection
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.900]   that we have, these ways are real ways
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.580]   to build and maintain relationships.
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.060]   Many jobs now, we can do them remotely.
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.580]   But what I see happening is
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.780]   that these ways of communicating
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:47.780]   do not replace the value of face-to-face relationships.
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.020]   But indeed, they make the value
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:53.940]   of the face-to-face relationships much more important.
[00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.740]   And as a remote worker myself,
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.780]   I'm very conscious of this,
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.940]   that I don't mind working remotely most of the time.
[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.420]   In fact, I think it's a great advantage
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.460]   for most workers who do digital work
[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.780]   to be able, or work that can be transmitted digitally,
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.060]   to work from home, work from wherever,
[00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:17.540]   and do most of your work that way is really ideal,
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.580]   but it shouldn't be all the time.
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.540]   And so companies that have a dispersed workforce,
[00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.900]   I believe that it's far more important for them
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.540]   that they're super intentional
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:32.020]   about scheduling significant opportunities
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.100]   for face-to-face contact,
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.860]   significant weekend events, or three-day events,
[00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.460]   and it's more than just quote-unquote team-building events.
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.860]   These events are necessary for human relationships.
[00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.540]   Some of the strongest
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.380]   and most productive relationships that I have
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:52.140]   are relationships where most of our communications happen
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.700]   in a dispersed manner, where I live here,
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.220]   you live on the other side of the country,
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.460]   that's no problem,
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.500]   but there needs to be a face-to-face connection
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.940]   at some point in order for us
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.580]   to be able to communicate on a deeper level
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:10.580]   with our actual face-to-face,
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.460]   where we have a chance to know each other,
[00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.620]   to take the measure of a man face-to-face, et cetera.
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:16.980]   It makes all the difference in the world.
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.980]   And so it's really important.
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:24.620]   And I observe that when those two things go together,
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.820]   meaning digital connection and face-to-face connection,
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.580]   the relationships can be stronger
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.700]   than they otherwise would be.
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.700]   For example, I think about various groups and whatnot
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.020]   that I have set up with my family and friends
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:38.980]   and things like that,
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.420]   just the ability to chat with one another
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.580]   on an ad hoc basis in a private WhatsApp group
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.100]   or Facebook group or messaging group, whatever you use,
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.780]   that can strengthen relationships
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.860]   in a way that wasn't possible
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:55.660]   when we were only having face-to-face relationships.
[00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.020]   And so this makes you feel closer to people
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.140]   because you're able to share more of the moments
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.980]   of your lives with your small groups.
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:07.580]   However, if those relationships are only digital
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.620]   and they're not buttressed and reinforced
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.540]   by that face-to-face contact,
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.580]   then they leave us feeling extremely lonely.
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.020]   But when they go together, they're the strongest.
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.660]   That's my point, is that we want them to be together.
[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.460]   And so here at Radical Personal Finance,
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:29.620]   I'm thrilled to have a great connection with you,
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.140]   my listener, in a digital format.
[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.780]   Even when it's only one way, it's a great connection.
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:39.060]   But I also need that face-to-face format
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.780]   and you need that face-to-face format
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.660]   with like-minded people.
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.900]   Because at the end of the day,
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.460]   while we can appreciate these digital forms
[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.020]   of connectedness that we enjoy,
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:55.420]   the truth remains that you and I are physical creatures
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.420]   with a physical experience.
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:01.140]   And that physicality should be part of our life.
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.180]   So that has been my desire, is to bring people together.
[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.260]   One of the great things that concerns me enormously
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:10.220]   about our society is that I see with my own eyes
[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.620]   and I read the data from the psychological surveys
[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.700]   that indicate that in many ways,
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.700]   it's not unfair to characterize us
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.940]   as a society of people who are dying of loneliness.
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:24.140]   And I think this is particularly pronounced
[00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:28.060]   for those of us even who are in child-raising years,
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.580]   that while there can be variations of this,
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.380]   meaning that there are times in life
[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:38.380]   where our children wind up being
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.540]   an expression of socialization.
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.020]   You make your friends through your child's school
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.940]   and go to sporting events and music events, et cetera.
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.780]   So it's not always lonely, but in general,
[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.700]   it can be a fairly lonely experience that you have.
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.220]   Because when you're a parent,
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.500]   it's hard to schedule time to go and socialize
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.060]   with other people without having some activities
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.860]   and things planned, et cetera.
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.900]   So as a way to try to improve this,
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.980]   I've wanted to have events
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:08.020]   and I've wanted to have some kind of camp,
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:11.420]   some kind of event where people can be together.
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.260]   One more comment on the camp and I'll get into more details.
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.020]   But when my wife and I RVed across the country,
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:20.460]   we loved it, we loved that experience.
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.980]   And the reason we loved that experience
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:27.460]   was because we were able to have more intimate communication
[00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.420]   with our friends and loved ones
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.940]   that we had been missing for years being parents.
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.260]   So when you are a parent,
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.140]   for those of you who are aspiring parents
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.740]   or just are unaware,
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.660]   your schedule naturally changes a little bit.
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.340]   And while you can push your children and be out late
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:46.180]   and things like that,
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.540]   and often it's excessively difficult and not worth it,
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.180]   especially when you have young children.
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.220]   And so when you start to have young children,
[00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.820]   you start to experience a lot of social isolation.
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:02.620]   You start to experience a lot of social isolation
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.460]   and no one intends it, it's nobody's fault,
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.620]   it just is what it is, it just happens.
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:09.820]   Because number one,
[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.340]   your children are demanding on your time,
[00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:14.260]   your attention, et cetera.
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.060]   When you are with other people,
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.580]   you have an enormous duty of caring for your children.
[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.260]   So you always have to be watching,
[00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.220]   you always have to be making sure
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.340]   there's not fights happening,
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:26.540]   that children aren't in danger, physical danger, et cetera.
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:31.820]   The presence of children and their noisy boisterous play
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.820]   is often disruptive to adult conversations.
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.100]   And it's just not super enjoyable.
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.580]   It's hard to have a long, drawn out adult conversation
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.180]   when you're watching a three-year-old run around
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.300]   and play with his friends.
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.580]   And so you wind up going into this period
[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.340]   where you often don't have many conversations
[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.780]   because even when you do go to social events,
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:55.860]   either, I mean, you're watching your children.
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.460]   And if you don't watch your children,
[00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.500]   then of course you're not a great parent
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.860]   and everybody would judge you as not a great parent.
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:02.860]   And it's just not an option.
[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:04.940]   You want your kids to survive and to live,
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:05.860]   to see another day.
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:07.700]   And so you've got your job to do.
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.740]   So you wind up losing a lot of this social connection
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:13.500]   that you formerly had.
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.860]   And then to, well, what about,
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.940]   and then you wind up taking your children home early,
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.940]   et cetera, so you get on a different schedule
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.900]   than your friends that don't have children.
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.900]   And then the relationships start to grow a little bit weak
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.540]   and people just drift away.
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.620]   'Cause we generally socialize with people
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.540]   who have a similar lifestyle
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.820]   to the kind of thing that we have.
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:36.860]   And then if you don't, if you continue it,
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.340]   then you often wind up, what I mean is that,
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.060]   so you say, okay, well, I'm gonna send my wife home
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.140]   with the children and I'm gonna go
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:43.300]   and hang out with my buddies.
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.980]   All right, well, that's fine every now and then,
[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:49.980]   but most good husbands and wives don't like to do that.
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:54.300]   And there's a balance in which going to a third place
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.900]   and having your own adult relationships is valuable,
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.620]   but there's a real balance there where you can go too far
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:03.900]   and then cause issues and challenges,
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.060]   and you don't wanna do that.
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.260]   And so you wind up being isolated is the point.
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.940]   And it comes on you gradually,
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:09.980]   and all of a sudden you wake up
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.220]   and you're three or four or five years in,
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:14.220]   you realize like, where are our friends?
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.420]   And you're friends with other parents,
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.420]   but you never have long time to talk to them
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.960]   'cause you're always together when you're with children.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.020]   So when we started traveling across the country in an RV,
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.100]   we found the sweet spot.
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.300]   And the sweet spot is we put the children to sleep
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.500]   in the RV, then we go in
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.140]   and hang out with our friends for three hours.
[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:31.500]   And it takes you back to those heady days of college
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.500]   and young adult living where you can stay up all night
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.380]   and visit with your friends.
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:36.540]   It's really wonderful.
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.120]   And so we always look for opportunities
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.240]   to do a similar thing.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.080]   But in order to do it,
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.820]   you gotta have some kind of facility is the point.
[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.100]   So if I'm getting together with my family
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:47.780]   or family reunions,
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.680]   then ideally you wanna have some kind of facility
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.620]   where you can be together in a physical way,
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.380]   if at all possible, where you can put children to bed
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.100]   and then enjoy adult relationships.
[00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.180]   So back to events, it's hard to do that with events,
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:05.580]   but it's doable if you find an appropriate facility.
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.340]   And so one of the goals I've had
[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.760]   is to host some variation of a family camp
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.500]   because there are solutions for these problems.
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:16.420]   And the solutions are usually camps or church camps,
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.800]   family camps, various expressions of them.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.980]   And these are really fun.
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.860]   There are lots of professional organizations
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:23.900]   that offer these kinds of family camps.
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.460]   Families go there, you pay a fee.
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:27.960]   There's tons of activities for the children.
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.540]   There's tons of activities for the adults.
[00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.340]   And those are super fun to go to with your friends.
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:33.700]   You get a couple of families together
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.260]   and everyone's got something to do.
[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.820]   You're together in the evenings and at night,
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.900]   but you have things to do in the daytime.
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.900]   And I think this is a really ideal way
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:44.020]   to structure a chance for people
[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.300]   to spend a couple of days together.
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.780]   And so that's what I'm doing.
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:52.780]   So I've rented a whole church camp facility in Indiana.
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:56.820]   And I have a friend of mine who's helping me organize it.
[00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:58.700]   And so he's the one who found the facility.
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.500]   He's the one who negotiated everything,
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.380]   made it really simple for me to just say yes.
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.140]   And we just picked a date and let's do it
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.420]   and see what happens.
[00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.460]   And now the goal is, well, what can I put together
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:12.100]   that will be helpful and appealing to you
[00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:13.860]   that'll make you guys want to come?
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:14.980]   I want everyone to come.
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:19.140]   And so let me describe what I'm trying to do
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.980]   so you can see if it might be a good fit for you.
[00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:24.380]   Number one, I'm trying to create an event
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:26.860]   that will have something for everyone
[00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.100]   so that you'll be motivated to come.
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.580]   And so what I thought is,
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.620]   and this is kind of a classic thing also
[00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:35.580]   that kept me wondering for a long time
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.500]   is what kind of thing do people want?
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.580]   I can talk to you here on a microphone.
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:42.620]   So I can lecture to you with no problem here.
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.340]   If I'm gonna create something physical,
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.560]   what's the additional benefit of a physical event
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.460]   versus a digital thing?
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:52.060]   A digital course is often a more effective means of teaching
[00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:53.700]   than is something in person.
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:55.400]   So what needs to be the benefit of it?
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.820]   Well, it should be socialization.
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.620]   But then the question is, if we're just gonna socialize,
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.140]   shouldn't there be, is that gonna be easy
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.260]   to justify the money to go to a camp?
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.140]   Shouldn't I offer something more?
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.260]   And so for this inaugural event,
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:14.260]   what I have built is basically a three-track event.
[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:18.300]   And it's gonna be up to you what track you come to.
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.340]   But, and how you wish to participate.
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.140]   But I'm trying to create an event
[00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:25.580]   that has something that will appeal to you,
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:29.720]   to everyone in your family and be a good fit for everyone.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.140]   So first of all, I'm going to present
[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.700]   a series of talks on finance.
[00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.780]   I'm gonna use the Radical Personal Finance Framework
[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.460]   for Wealth as my outline of those talks
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:43.820]   because I can collapse that into two minutes
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.700]   and I can collapse and I can expand it
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.620]   into two years of university courses.
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:51.380]   So it gives me a good level of appropriateness.
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:56.260]   And I can use content and material that is appropriate
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:23:00.100]   for folks who are extremely advanced with their money,
[00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.860]   very wealthy, earn a high income.
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.560]   And I can use levels that are appropriate
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.940]   for your teenage son who's just getting started,
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.580]   doesn't have anything, has never even had his first job.
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:12.600]   And so that's my basic outline.
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.460]   Number two, though, I think a huge benefit of an event
[00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:18.740]   is to have something hands-on, have an actual workshop
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.460]   where you implement something.
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.000]   The great danger of any form of content,
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.780]   such as a podcast or a course, et cetera,
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:29.260]   is that you absorb an idea and it tickles your brain.
[00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.260]   You say, "Oh, that's a good idea.
[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.220]   "I should do that someday."
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:32.600]   And you go on to the next thing.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:33.520]   That's what we all do.
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.460]   And we just swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe,
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.900]   listen, listen, listen, more books, more information,
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.740]   more podcasts, more information, and we don't do anything.
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.140]   And in reality, we would, most of us, be better off
[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.580]   if we just chucked 90% of what we listened to
[00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:47.020]   and we spent all that time,
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.260]   instead of listening to new things,
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.120]   we spent all that time implementing the few good ideas
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.500]   that we heard in the 10%.
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:56.200]   And so I have arranged a series of practical workshops
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:01.020]   to implement kind of the finance track of content.
[00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:02.540]   And so there's gonna be a complete,
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:03.560]   with this three-day event,
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:07.900]   there's gonna be a complete collection of financial talks,
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:13.420]   tightly concise talks with practical workshop application,
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.540]   where I'm gonna work with you to implement the ideas
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:19.360]   of each of the talks in a specific way.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.500]   So my goal is that you come to the camp
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:25.540]   and you leave with a clear plan to make more money,
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.740]   lower your expenses, invest more effectively,
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:30.740]   avoid catastrophe, optimize lifestyle
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:34.500]   with clear specific ideas and actual actions taken
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:35.740]   to implement those ideas.
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.220]   I want you to make money on the event
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:38.660]   in the fullness of time.
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.940]   Number two is I'm bringing in what,
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:44.060]   calling a lifestyle track right now.
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.900]   And the idea is there's a lot of things associated
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.420]   with radical personal finance that don't fit perfectly
[00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.820]   into the personal finance framework.
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:55.420]   And so I've built out a series of sessions.
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.340]   The sessions are not yet set in stone,
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.140]   but for example, some of it may be a discussion
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.580]   on home education, some of it discussion
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.860]   on language learning, some of it discussion
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:09.980]   on things like that, the kinds of things that I talk about.
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:13.660]   But we've also got a series of presentations,
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:16.380]   of hands-on presentations planned that will be of interest
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:17.900]   to various members of the family
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.340]   and whoever is appropriate for.
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:23.220]   So an example would be one of the great business
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:27.540]   opportunities that I believe is available to anybody,
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.900]   literally anybody, although ordinarily these kinds
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.900]   of businesses, we would target towards a young man
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:36.460]   or a woman, adolescent or child,
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.980]   is quite simply just making money doing things
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:42.540]   like baking bread and selling bread to your neighbors
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.620]   or baking cookies and selling cookies,
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.340]   nicely decorated cookies.
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:48.700]   And so we're planning a workshop.
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.100]   I found this great entrepreneur that,
[00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:54.860]   a young teen entrepreneur who has a great business,
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:58.060]   great cookie business, does tons of business,
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.980]   making and selling cookies into her local event,
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:02.580]   corporate events, et cetera.
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:05.500]   And then so probably she'll be presenting,
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.500]   maybe we might do it with bread, not sure,
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.220]   but we're gonna have a hands-on workshop.
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.020]   And we're gonna present the business fundamentals
[00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.460]   that'll be appropriate to anybody who's looking
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:15.220]   for a sideline income, and then also go
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:17.100]   through the actual process of applying it
[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:20.500]   and bake some bread, make some cookies, things like that.
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:21.340]   There are other things.
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:25.820]   So another example is balloon twisting and balloon tying,
[00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.580]   excuse me, balloon twisting, not tying,
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:31.180]   is an example of what I think of an ideal skill
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:35.860]   that some motivated teens and young people could use
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.540]   to make extra money on the side.
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.540]   And their per hour rate can be enormously higher
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.060]   than working at a local retail job,
[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.860]   but it's limited in numbers of hours.
[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:48.980]   And so we're planning a workshop on that, for example,
[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:51.140]   to come in and say, here, you can learn a skill.
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:52.900]   You can learn the skill physically.
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.180]   Well, we have a presenter to come in
[00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.140]   and present on the skill itself.
[00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.820]   But then let's talk about the business application of this.
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.740]   And if there's two or three or four fairs
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:06.180]   that you can go to and events in your area per year,
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.460]   and you can go and you can make a couple hundred dollars
[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.860]   at an event twisting balloons,
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.780]   that's a pretty good way for a young person especially
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:14.620]   to make money.
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.580]   So we've developed a series of lifestyle,
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.460]   we're calling just kind of a lifestyle track
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:19.940]   of some talks on different things
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:22.460]   that hopefully will be broadly appealing
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.260]   to those who may not be interested in personal finance,
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.380]   but they're interested in ideas.
[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:27.620]   And some of these might be helpful
[00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:29.060]   and appealing to your teens.
[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:30.620]   And then the third thing is that we've just,
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.140]   we've got an entire camp,
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:34.900]   and the camp is really beautiful, really well-equipped.
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.580]   It's got all the camp activities.
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.580]   So we've got all the ball games and gaga ball
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:44.460]   and volleyball and basketball, et cetera, ultimate Frisbee.
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.060]   We've got a bouldering wall.
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:51.460]   We've got hiking trails and creek stomps and horseshoes
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:52.900]   and kayaking and canoeing,
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.460]   although it's probably gonna be too cold
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:56.980]   to use all the lake stuff,
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.180]   and mountain bikes and playgrounds
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.740]   and all of the outdoor stuff.
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:05.740]   Plus we've got a complete kind of staff-led stuff.
[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:10.740]   So we've got a high ropes course and a low ropes course,
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.540]   and we're gonna play archery tag,
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:14.940]   and we've got a BB gun range and hatchet throwing
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.540]   and all the camp stuff as well.
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.340]   So there's gonna be a complete and total,
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.900]   plus all the indoor games as well,
[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:22.380]   foosball and ping pong and board games
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.860]   and pool and all that stuff.
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:28.020]   So it's a complete and very beautifully equipped camp.
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.780]   So if you've got people in your family
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.620]   that just aren't interested in classes
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:33.660]   and wanna just hang out,
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:36.020]   then this is a great opportunity to do that as well.
[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.500]   And I'm sure there'll be lots of people
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.500]   who just wanna come and hang out.
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:43.140]   So I think that'll be the appropriate way.
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.900]   I hope that'll be attractive to you.
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.300]   I hope that you will find that and say,
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.300]   "Hey, there's gonna be something
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.380]   "for everyone in my family to do."
[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:51.860]   Among those various options,
[00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:53.660]   if people are really into personal finance
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:55.580]   and they wanna attend lectures on personal finance
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.900]   with practical workshops, great.
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.300]   I'll be teaching those,
[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.380]   and I will make this stuff make sense to you
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:03.900]   no matter what level it is,
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:06.460]   and you'll go away with a clear action plan
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:07.780]   of things that you can do
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:08.940]   that over the next year or two
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:12.060]   are gonna dramatically improve your financial condition.
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:14.060]   If it's more of the lifestyle track,
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.500]   there's gonna be plenty of information on that.
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.060]   And then if you just wanna hang out and go to camp,
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.460]   then that's gonna, with friends and people
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.460]   of similar persuasion as you,
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:25.940]   then that's gonna be available to you as well.
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.300]   I hope that the agenda that I've designed
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:31.260]   is an appropriate balance among these things,
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.100]   recognizing again that socialization
[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:34.300]   is usually a primary thing,
[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:35.500]   but then we also wanna,
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:39.300]   just socialization alone makes it hard to justify,
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.260]   at least for me, I like to learn things.
[00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.860]   So hopefully we've got a good balance
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:45.020]   and we'll look forward to your ideas.
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:47.340]   By the way, I have the agenda designed,
[00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:48.860]   but it's not set in stone yet.
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:52.180]   And so if you say, Joshua, I'm absolutely coming
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.700]   and here's what I would really love
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.020]   for you to prepare for me,
[00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:56.700]   there's still time and there's still opportunity
[00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:58.300]   for me to interact with you.
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.540]   And if you're thinking that,
[00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:04.060]   there's probably other people.
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:05.740]   Or if you're thinking, Joshua,
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:08.060]   I really would love to come to an event that you would host,
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:11.540]   but what you've described is not for me.
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:14.460]   But if you did this, I would really come,
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.500]   then great, let me know.
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:17.340]   'Cause I wanna serve you.
[00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:18.700]   I wanna bring people together.
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.260]   I wanna bring people in my community together.
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.780]   I wanna hang out with you and enjoy interacting with you,
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:26.460]   but I also want you to build friends that are in your area
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:28.060]   and build relationships
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.780]   and have encouragement when you need it.
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:31.980]   Let's talk about the facilities.
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:35.460]   So this camp is going to be a all-inclusive.
[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.900]   And what I mean is that when you buy the ticket,
[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:42.620]   you have a bed to sleep in and a room to have and food.
[00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:43.620]   We're providing all the food
[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.220]   and all the sleeping accommodations.
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.060]   The camp is nice.
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:48.540]   It is clean.
[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:49.740]   It is well-kept.
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:52.300]   It is a bit rustic and industrial,
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:57.060]   as you would expect from a camp
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:01.260]   that's designed to be used by tons of kids and campers.
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.780]   So the facilities are very well done.
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.900]   It's a very nice camp, very well done.
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.460]   But the mattress, I would expect the mattress to be firm.
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:13.180]   And the shower curtain is a plastic shower curtain.
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:16.180]   So it's not gonna be the fanciest of things,
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.140]   but it's very nice, very clean,
[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:20.140]   perfectly adequate, comfortable.
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:21.460]   Everything is there.
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:22.980]   And everything is gonna be included.
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.660]   So again, we'll provide you with a bed
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:28.860]   and we'll provide you with all of your food.
[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.780]   Now, depending on the people that we have,
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:35.780]   we're gonna do our best to have the highest quality food
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:39.300]   and other things that we are capable of.
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.900]   And so I'm being careful not to make verbal commitments
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:46.460]   until I see kind of how things go.
[00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:48.460]   But our ambition is to provide you
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:50.340]   with a really fantastic event.
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.700]   That's my goal.
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:54.060]   And so in terms of rooms,
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:55.620]   it's a little bit complicated
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:57.620]   for me to arrange the logistics
[00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:59.460]   because I've rented the entire camp.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.060]   I've got lots of independent cabins.
[00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:03.580]   I've got room sizes from two-person rooms,
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.260]   four-person rooms, six-person rooms,
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:06.940]   eight-person rooms, et cetera.
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:09.300]   My plan is that all the families
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.620]   will have their own individual private room.
[00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:12.580]   That's my plan.
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:16.260]   And then depending on how many single people I have sign up,
[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:18.500]   then we'll try to either get you
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.180]   one of the small two-person rooms
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:25.180]   or I may allocate one of the rooms
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:29.020]   to bunk rooms for single individuals.
[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:32.980]   So I'm selling the tickets on a price per head basis,
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:37.140]   but I'm gonna use a lower capacity
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:40.220]   than the camp would be capable of
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.580]   if it were all price per head
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:45.020]   to manually allocate rooms to you and your family
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:46.100]   so that you have privacy.
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:46.940]   That's the plan.
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:50.580]   So we'll see who signs up and kind of how that works.
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:52.860]   I think it'll be good, but I've rented the whole camp,
[00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:53.780]   but we'll see.
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:54.620]   At the end of the day,
[00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.180]   you and I are gonna learn a lot together.
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:59.100]   I hope that you guys love the event.
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:00.460]   I hope that it sells out.
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:02.180]   I hope you come.
[00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:04.740]   And that's my plan.
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:07.140]   If only a few of you are interested in coming, great.
[00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:08.820]   Then we're gonna do it
[00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.020]   and we're gonna have a great time.
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.780]   So what I need from you is, I guess, your feedback.
[00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:14.740]   Like I said, this is the inaugural event,
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:17.100]   so I'm putting everything I've got into planning
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.020]   something that's gonna be really great and really fun.
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:21.900]   I was extremely encouraged by the recent event
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.580]   that I did in Panama.
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:26.700]   That event was clearly a much more of a niche appeal
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.380]   in terms of internationalization
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:31.020]   and Panamanian investment tour, things like that.
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.340]   But for me, the best part of it
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:34.460]   was just hanging out with my listeners,
[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:35.740]   some of the coolest listeners
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:39.460]   that I just enjoyed being with y'all for a week.
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:42.780]   Excuse me, those of you who were there, it was just amazing.
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:45.540]   I enjoyed that so much
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.020]   because it gave an opportunity for us
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:48.700]   to build real relationships
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:51.420]   that can continue in the years to come.
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.860]   And that's what I'm hoping comes out of this family camp.
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:55.100]   So I ask you to come.
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.460]   I really want you to come.
[00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.860]   I really want the event to be fantastic.
[00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:00.220]   I want it to be something that you really love.
[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:03.300]   If you have further questions, again,

[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:26.900]   you say, "Joshua, I wanna teach a session on this,"
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:30.060]   et cetera, I'm open to hearing that from you.
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:32.820]   I've got most of the things covered, et cetera.
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:35.140]   But if you would like to volunteer for something
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:38.940]   or you have ideas that you think would really add to it,
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:43.420]   please email those to me, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:45.620]   If you think, "You know what, Joshua, I'm on the fence.
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:48.220]   "I'd like to come, but here's what you could do
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:49.820]   "that would just push me over the edge,"
[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.660]   again, email me, and if I can do it, I will,
[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:53.820]   because I really wanna serve you.
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.540]   I wanna create an event that will serve you.
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:58.660]   I've done my best to think about that
[00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.980]   based upon my experience interacting with you,
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:04.220]   think about what I think would be helpful and fun,
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:06.580]   and all the events that I've been to.
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:09.820]   But if I'm off in some way, then just give that to me,
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:10.900]   and my goal is to serve you.
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:14.100]   So you can reach out at joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:16.380]   And that's it, go to radicalfamilycamp.com.
