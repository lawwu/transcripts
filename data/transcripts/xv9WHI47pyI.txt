[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   the words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.920]   found in the gospel according to st. John the first chapter verses 50 51 and
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.120]   51 verses 50 and 51 in the first chapter of the gospel according to st. John
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:25.800]   Jesus answered and said unto him because I said unto thee I saw thee under the
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:34.480]   fig tree believest thou thou shalt see greater things than these and he saith
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:43.560]   unto him verily verily I say unto you hereafter ye shall see heaven open and
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:51.760]   the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man. This is
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.440]   as you will realize the end of the account which is given here of how
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.880]   Nathanael became a follower and a disciple and a believer in our Lord and
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:11.720]   Savior Jesus Christ. We are looking at this incident for the third time it's a
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.320]   great and a very important incident. We have seen that it's important because it
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.680]   does give us in detail the account of how many a soul has come to Christ. We
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.880]   are given the details here we are shown something about the difficulties and how
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.800]   the difficulties can be overcome. Philip you remember having been to the Lord
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.520]   went back and invited Nathanael to come saying to him we have found him of whom
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.200]   Moses in the law and the prophets did write. Jesus of Nazareth the son of
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.380]   Joseph. Nathanael you remember said unto him can there any good thing come
[00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.320]   out of Nazareth? He had a legitimate a genuine difficulty there a difficulty
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.940]   that rarely arose from the fact because that he was such a good man and an
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.960]   Israelite and who knew his scriptures. But you remember Philip's method doesn't
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:21.560]   argue with him he says come and see come and see come to him. And Nathanael did so.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.800]   Nathanael was an Israelite indeed in whom there was no guile. He wasn't just
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.080]   out to be clever he wasn't just out to score debating points. Many a man has
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.100]   scored a debating point and lost his soul. This man was desperately serious
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.000]   and in earnest there was no guile about him. No pretense no make-belief. He didn't
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.640]   pretend to affect an interest in these things in order that he might show
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.360]   himself and his cleverness. No no our Lord says behold an Israelite indeed in
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:04.180]   whom is no guile. Well Nathanael I say in spite of his difficulty listened to what
[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.320]   his friend Philip said and went with him to the Lord Jesus Christ. And as they
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.360]   were approaching you remember we are told that our Lord made that statement
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.300]   about Nathanael and Nathanael was astonished and amazed. And he said unto
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:29.640]   him Rabbi now wait a minute whence knowest thou me? He couldn't understand
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.280]   this. How did this person know that he was an Israelite indeed in whom was no
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.520]   guile? How did he know his concern about the coming of the Messiah? How did he
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.480]   arrive at this knowledge? And our Lord said to him before that Philip called
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.320]   thee when thou wast under the fig tree I saw thee. And you remember that last
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.000]   Sunday evening we were looking at that and we realized that that tells us this
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.760]   that there our Lord is saying that he knows us one by one and he knows all
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.560]   about us. There probably under that fig tree hidden by the leaves from all
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.840]   people from all onlookers Nathanael was in communion with God and
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.520]   expressing his longing and his desire and God had met with him and had spoken
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.320]   to him this person knows that. So Nathanael says well there's only one
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:37.560]   thing to say at this point Rabbi thou art the Son of God thou art the King of
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:44.080]   Israel the Messiah that I've been longing for. Maybe that God had told him
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.360]   there under the fig tree that he hadn't much longer to wait that the Messiah had
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.900]   come and that he was soon to meet him we don't know it's more than likely it
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.280]   seems to me because when our Lord displays this knowledge Nathanael seems
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:07.680]   to say I see it I've got it thou art the Son of God thou art the King of Israel.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.800]   But you notice the story doesn't end there we might very well imagine that it
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.240]   did end there and indeed many people seem to mean their personal experiences
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:27.120]   to be content to stop there but the story goes on. Here you see Jesus answered
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:37.640]   and said unto him because I said unto thee I saw thee under the fig tree
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:47.940]   believest thou? Now that isn't a question that is a statement. Our Lord is
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:55.920]   here commending Nathanael it's put in this form of a question but it's a
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.380]   question that really answers itself he's saying Nathanael because I said to you
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.180]   that I saw you when you were under the fig tree you have believed on me
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:15.920]   excellent very good you are right in what you say but that isn't all you are
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:23.420]   confession that I am the Son of God that I am the King of Israel is wonderful it
[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:33.740]   is marvelous but Nathanael you haven't seen it all greater things than these
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:43.300]   are still to come thou shalt see greater things than these and then addressing
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:50.280]   not only Nathanael you notice but all the people those who are standing by ye
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:57.260]   the plural henceforth ye shall see heaven open and the angels of God
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:03.740]   ascending and descending upon the Son of Man that and this is a very important
[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:12.500]   and a very significant point our Lord introduced this statement by means of
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:23.580]   the words verily verily I say unto you now whenever he uses those words and you
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:30.460]   will find that he uses them very frequently it is always indicative of
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:36.420]   the fact that he is going to say something of unusual importance of
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:47.140]   exceptional importance you will find that this expression is is used in this
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:52.020]   gospel a large number of times I think altogether about 25 times and it's
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:57.140]   important that we should pay very careful and I say exceptional attention
[00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:04.260]   to every single instance of the use of the words it's our men our men it's a
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:10.100]   call to us to listen to pause to drop everything and pay attention or indeed
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:18.820]   it might be translated like this most solemnly I say unto you very well then
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:26.660]   here is one of those statements our Lord himself is calling attention to
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:32.580]   something which is of unusual importance and significance and let us remember
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:39.140]   that he says it to a man primarily who has already made the confession thou
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:48.980]   art the Son of God thou art the King of Israel very well what does he got to say
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:56.300]   they're going to see greater things what are these greater things what more is it
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.620]   that a man has got to see what more can a man believe than to come to Jesus
[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:05.780]   Christ and having seen certain things in him to say thou art the Son of God thou
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:11.660]   art the King of Israel is there anything beyond that yes as our Lord this is very
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:16.300]   good as far as you go but dear Nathaniel don't think that it's everything because
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:20.060]   I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree you believe that I am the Son
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:25.020]   of God thou shall see greater things than these greater well what can be
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:32.860]   greater well our Lord goes on to answer the question henceforth ye shall see
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:42.740]   heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:49.540]   men now then what does he mean by this well this as I say is one of those
[00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:54.420]   crucial statements I want to try to show you that here in this extraordinary
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:59.420]   statement our Lord himself is making one of the clearest and most important
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:04.220]   statements about himself and his purpose in coming into this world that even he
[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:10.260]   ever made there is a sense in which this statement is a kind of introduction to
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:15.260]   nearly all that we find about him in this gospel according to Saint John it's
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.900]   the theme if you like suddenly put before us it now beat will be taken up
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:24.380]   different aspects will be shown and displayed before us but here is the
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:35.100]   theme here is the essence of the message well what is it well it is obviously a
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:42.660]   picture you can read through your four Gospels and try to find instances where
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:48.700]   the disciples saw the heavens open and the angels of God ascending and
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:53.860]   descending upon the Son of Man and you won't find it there are some people who
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.820]   looking at these things very superficially and materialistically it
[00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:01.460]   seems to me and in a very bad the literalistic manner I've tried to say
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:08.300]   that this is just a reference to the angels coming to our Lord and to his
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:13.140]   service and to his aid in the garden of Gethsemane and so on but clearly it
[00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:17.820]   doesn't it doesn't fit the picture it isn't what we are told here he says you
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:23.220]   shall see heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:29.020]   Son of Man what is it well it's a great pictorial representation of the truth
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:34.620]   concerning himself you've seen he says in effect that I am the Son of God I am
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:39.100]   the King of Israel right beyond that you've got to go on to this I am more
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:45.660]   there is something further and this is the way in which he puts it now then
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:50.620]   what we have to do therefore is to examine the two main statements here
[00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:58.060]   henceforth hereafter he shall see heaven open and the angels of God ascending and
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:07.820]   descending upon the Son of Man now then what does he mean by this statement has
[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:12.500]   it ever struck you that this was a very strange occasion on which to use the
[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:17.980]   term just when Nathanael has said to him thou art the Son of God and he
[00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:23.460]   immediately says you're going to see something bigger than that Son of Man
[00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:29.460]   how can that be an advance on the previous ah well that is our business in
[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:37.380]   our exposition this term Son of Man is a term that is used some 83 to 84 times in
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:42.380]   the New Testament in this gospel according to St. John it's used for 13
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:50.460]   times in this gospel alone now then what is its connotation why does the Lord
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:57.100]   Jesus Christ so frequently refer to himself as the Son of Man and especially
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:02.820]   I say when he's just been addressed as the Son of God now it is generally
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:09.900]   agreed that this term Son of Man is a term that he borrowed and uses for his
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:17.340]   own purpose from the book of the Prophet Daniel in the seventh chapter where in
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:25.380]   verses 13 and 14 we read this I saw in the night visions and behold one like
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:31.860]   the Son of Man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the ancient of days
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:37.660]   and they brought him near before him and there was given unto him dominion and
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:42.620]   glory and the kingdom that all people nations and languages should serve him
[00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:48.340]   his dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:54.100]   kingdom that which shall not be destroyed now I say it's generally
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:59.540]   agreed and it's undoubtedly the case that our Lord takes up that term that
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:07.420]   remarkable prophecy there by Daniel and he uses it and applies it to himself so
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:12.140]   you see there is only one explanation of the meaning of the term and it is this
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:20.580]   he is saying in effect I am the Messiah the one pictured by Daniel coming in the
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:26.340]   clouds of heaven to whom this universal sway and dominion is to be given is the
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:31.580]   Messiah he is the deliverer of mankind he's the one who's going to reign over
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.260]   the whole earth and of his kingdom there shall never be an end the
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.840]   characteristic description of the Messiah and his kingdom which we have in
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:44.260]   the Old Testament prophecies now then here our Lord in speaking to Nathaniel
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:56.280]   says I am the Son of Man he applies this designation to himself very well what does
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:02.460]   he teaching thereby what is he saying to Nathaniel what's he saying to these
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:08.540]   disciples what is he saying to us well what he said to them was this isn't it
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:13.340]   he says you've just said that I am the Son of God you're right but I am also
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:22.060]   the Son of Man Nathaniel is perfectly right when he calls him the Son of God
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:28.180]   but Nathaniel and the others have not yet realized that he is also the Son of
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:35.860]   Man now then what does that mean well you notice that he doesn't say a Son of
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:42.900]   Man he says the Son of Man and that was his constant way of referring to
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:50.220]   himself he's not a Son of Man in other words he's not saying that he's just a
[00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:55.500]   man amongst other men as there were teeming masses of men in the world he's
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:00.540]   just a man like everybody else a man amongst men that isn't what he says the
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:13.420]   Son of Man he I say is not only not one amongst many he is not like the many he
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:20.220]   belongs to a category apart this thee stamps him out it is another way of
[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:29.020]   saying that he is not like other men in their birth for instance all men are
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:36.260]   born by natural procreation he wasn't he didn't begin when he was born in
[00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:44.340]   Bethlehem he came into the world he came out of eternity into time oh yes via the
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:48.260]   Virgin's womb but he didn't start there that isn't the beginning of his
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:53.060]   existence that's the beginning of every man every man starts as a cell he wasn't
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.780]   in existence until then that's the beginning that's the genesis of men
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:03.020]   there he is created as it were that's true of all men but he's not a man he is
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:10.540]   the Son of Man he stands in a category apart he is a visitor into this world he
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.620]   has come into time he's not an ordinary man there is a uniqueness there is
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:20.740]   something special about him he must be thought of entirely on his own the Son
[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:28.860]   of Man yes that's all right but even that doesn't exhaust the rich content of
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:35.940]   this term this is a term as we shall see which is absolutely vital to the
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:41.620]   Christian position and none of us really become Christians in a true sense until
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:47.660]   we see that in addition to being the Son of God he is also the Son of Man well
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:53.420]   then what is it well perhaps the simplest way in which I can put it is
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:18:03.980]   this you remember that when men fell in the Garden of Eden God went down and
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:10.780]   visited him in his disgrace and in his shame and he gave to him that marvelous
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:16.700]   promise he told him first of all that there would be perpetual enmity between
[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:23.940]   his seed and the seed of the serpent but then he gave that wonderful promise that
[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:28.380]   there was to be an end to the conflict that there was to be a victory because
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:37.420]   he said the seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head now what our
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:43.340]   Lord is really saying when he calls himself the Son of Man is this I am the
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:51.020]   seed of the woman I am the man the man that was promised in the Garden of Eden
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:56.140]   the man that has been expected throughout the running centuries the man
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:06.140]   the Son of Man yes but it isn't only that there is something else which for
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:12.900]   us is of vital importance and I cannot think of a better way of putting it to
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:24.340]   you than by putting it like this Adam at the beginning was the man there was
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:30.300]   nobody else he was the only man ah but you say scientists don't believe that
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:35.140]   now I can't help what scientists may believe or not believe I have no gospel
[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:43.060]   if that isn't true God made man in his own image and he made him perfect and
[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:50.500]   there was one Adam the man you read the early chapters of Genesis and you'll
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:55.300]   find that that is the way in which is described God saw that the man was
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:20:05.020]   lonely the man in what sense is he the man well in this sense he was the whole
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:16.220]   of humanity he is the first of a race he is the initiation of a humanity he's the
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:22.380]   first man and he has a progeny he has children he has descendants who come out
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:28.780]   of him and who derive their being from him Adam the first man the beginner of
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:39.140]   the human race the source of humanity and its life the Lord Jesus Christ here
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:47.900]   says that he is the Son of Man and what is he saying well what he's saying is
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:53.900]   this he is saying there is a sense in which as Adam was the man I am the man
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:21:02.740]   there is a parallelism between him and Adam that is something that cannot be
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:07.860]   said of anybody else all other men that have ever been in this world are just
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:15.100]   descendants of Adam they are children of Adam and they are not in the same
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:22.500]   position as Adam because they are descendants not progenitors but here he
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:32.180]   says I am the Son of Man I am man the man in a sense that Adam was the man in
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:38.740]   other words what he is telling Nathanael and his companions at this point is this
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:48.980]   that he is the head of a new humanity that he is if you like a second Adam
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:53.380]   indeed the Apostle Paul says that he is not only the second Adam but that he is
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:22:02.380]   also the last Adam but the point is this is that he is an Adam he is the founder
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:09.980]   of a new race he is the first in a great succession he is if I may use a term
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:17.060]   employed by the Apostle Paul he is the firstborn among many brethren now then
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:23.740]   you see the significance of the phrase and of his use of the phrase Nathanael
[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:31.380]   he says to him you're perfectly right in saying that I am the Son of God but you
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:37.340]   know if I were only the Son of God it wouldn't be of much help to you if I
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:41.820]   were only the Son of God well this would be a kind of theophany it would be a
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:47.100]   kind of appearance of the Son of God here in the world amongst men and you
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:51.940]   would be left exactly where you are I am the Son of God but I am also Son of Man
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:56.700]   you don't see it now you don't see it yet you're going to see it your eyes are
[00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:01.020]   going to be open and the eyes of these others you're going to see that I am the
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:05.660]   Son of Man and that I am standing here before you because I have come into this
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:12.180]   world to give a new start to the human race I am starting a new humanity I am
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:18.140]   starting a new progeny I am the firstborn amongst many brethren I am
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:23.220]   coming to initiate a new movement amongst mankind such as it has never
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:33.220]   known since Adam was created at the beginning I am the Son of Man now you
[00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:40.820]   see the significance and the importance of that you can't understand the New
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:48.740]   Testament gospel and its doctrine unless you lay a very firm hold and grip on
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:57.460]   this particular truth it is only as we are in Christ and belong to him and
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:03.460]   derive our being and our life from him that we are saved this is the business
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:08.500]   of Christianity Christ has come into the world into its teeming masses of men and
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:13.060]   women and what does he do well he takes us out of that compartment and he joins
[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:19.300]   us to himself we come out of him and we belong to his new race a new race of men
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:30.860]   and women a new humanity he does that as the Son of Man he is the man therefore
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:37.380]   he is the representative man Adam you see was a representative man wasn't he
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:43.140]   Adam was the only man and he was the representative of the whole of humanity
[00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:47.980]   which came out of him and God gave him a certain law and God said if you please
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:52.620]   me and if you keep my commandment I will bless you if you don't if you break my
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:56.900]   commandment you shall die and the curse will come upon you and you shall be
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:05.500]   driven out of the garden and Adam as our representative sinned against God
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:12.820]   rebelled against him and he fell into sin and thus the consequences of his act
[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:17.460]   came upon him yes but because he was our representative they've come upon us also
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:24.260]   and the whole of the world tonight is as it is because Adam sinned that's the
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:29.580]   teaching of the scripture that is the doctrine of original sin now you try to
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:35.220]   explain the world as it is this evening without that doctrine you try to
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:38.660]   explain it in terms that we are gradually rising and that we're
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:42.260]   improving from century to century and as the result of our knowledge we are
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:46.420]   getting better and better can you really say that as you look at life as it is
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:52.780]   tonight it's obviously not true it's simply not a fact at all no no the world
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:57.340]   is still in sin and shame in spite of all the efforts of men to improve it and
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:01.140]   to put it right why what's happened to the world what's gone wrong with men
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:06.820]   here's the answer Adam sinned sinned and fell and the whole of humanity has gone
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:11.820]   down with him we all come out of him and we inherit the consequences of his fall
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:17.980]   and of his sin we are born in sin we are shaken in iniquity every child wants to
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:22.060]   do what it's told not to do it seems to have a bias towards evil where'd you get
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:27.300]   it from it gets it in the nature that it's inherited from Adam we are all in
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:36.180]   Adam by nature the first men has led to this prodigy and what our Lord is here
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:42.260]   saying and it's one of the most glorious things he's ever said is this that though
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:50.660]   he is the eternal Son of God he has chosen and elected to become the Son of
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:57.580]   Man why well in order to open up the way of our deliverance and our redemption to
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:02.740]   give us a new life and a new start to give us a new birth to give us a new
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:09.620]   inheritance to give us a new pedigree he's come down and he's done this and
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:14.060]   if he hadn't become Son of Man though he's Son of God he couldn't have saved
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:22.180]   us so you see it's not surprising that he said to Nathanael and the company you
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:33.220]   shall see greater things than this you realize how much greater it is the Son
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:40.300]   of God I say it with reverence became greater when he stooped down and became
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:47.500]   the Son of Man he's Son of God and Son of Man very well but let me hurry on
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:52.140]   that's not the only thing that is implied there he also is saying this to
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:59.820]   Nathanael isn't he Nathanael he says in effect you are saying thou art the king
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:13.780]   of Israel and you're perfectly right Nathanael I am the king of Israel but I
[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:19.980]   am more than the king of Israel you're right when you say thou art the king of
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:30.180]   Israel I am the Messiah long expected but I am the Messiah long expected in
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:34.580]   the way that Daniel wrote in his book and didn't quite understand what he was
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:44.900]   saying when he called me also the Son of Man what does that mean well it means
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:51.500]   this the Jews you see held this view that the Messiah when he came would only
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:57.560]   deliver the Jews that's the great theme that you read of in these Gospels that's
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:02.340]   why they quarreled so much with our Lord because he went on saying as he said here
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:07.180]   at the very beginning that he is not only the king of Israel but the king of
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:12.300]   kings and Lord of Lords that he is not only the Messiah the deliverer of Israel
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:21.820]   but that he is to be the Savior of the whole world Son of Man not only you the
[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:31.100]   man covering all humanity as it were now this of course again is absolutely
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:42.100]   pivotal and vital Jesus of Nazareth was born amongst the Jews but he isn't only
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:47.940]   one who belongs to the Jews it is extraordinary to notice how John the
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:52.620]   Baptist had already seen it because you remember he stood there with his
[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:57.160]   disciples and he seeth Jesus coming unto him you read this in this same chapter
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:04.140]   earlier on and he says behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:09.900]   world not only the sin of the Jews not only king of Israel king of the whole
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:19.100]   world here is one who has come to span the human race and you remember how
[00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:26.060]   later on in his ministry our Lord himself made this abundantly plain and
[00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:31.980]   clear you remember the incident when two certain Greeks came and made their
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:38.820]   request and said sirs we would see Jesus and the disciples went to our Lord and
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:42.720]   asked if he'd receive them but he wouldn't receive them then but this is
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:50.700]   what he said you remember and I if I be lifted up from the earth shall draw all
[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:57.740]   men unto me what's it mean it means just this he says now while I'm still alive I
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:01.700]   don't see the Greeks at the moment while I'm still in the flesh I am dealing only
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:06.020]   with the last sheep of the house of Israel and he had told the disciples not
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:10.940]   to preach anywhere outside those confines but here he's saying if when I
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:16.340]   am lifted up when I'm crucified when I die it will be seen that I'm not merely
[00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:20.940]   the Savior the Messiah of Israel I will then draw all men men out of all
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:29.060]   nations Greeks then can come all can come Gentile and Jew Savior of all I will
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:37.540]   draw all men men out of all nations and kindreds and tribes unto me so here you
[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:47.220]   see is opening the eyes of the disciples to that that he is not merely a Savior or
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:53.220]   a teacher to a particular people he stands before them and says look at me
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:32:03.100]   again I am NOT merely king of Israel I am the Son of Man very well there is our
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:07.700]   first term let me hurry on to the second for what he says is this year after he
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:14.620]   shall see heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:19.200]   Son of Man now then what does he mean by this we've seen what the Son of Man is
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:24.140]   but what about this further picture well now this is undoubtedly a reference back
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:30.700]   to that great incident in the life of the Patriarch Jacob and that is why we
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:36.860]   are ready together in the 28th chapter of the book of Genesis in the reading at
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:42.020]   the beginning you remember it don't you there is Jacob reaching one of the great
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:47.400]   turning points of his life leaving his home leaving his mother in particular off
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:52.080]   he goes feeling lonely and desolate his brother may come after him at any moment
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:56.680]   because he'd been rather unfair and had acted the cad towards his brother there
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:02.580]   he is left alone puts his head down on a pillow of stone and falls asleep and
[00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:10.020]   then the dream what did he see well he saw the heavens open and he saw a ladder
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:14.900]   going from earth to heaven and the angels of God ascending and descending
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:19.380]   upon the ladder what's the meaning of the dream well God interpreted the dream
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:25.740]   to him as you remember God spoke to him and this is what he said Jacob the dream
[00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:32.660]   you've just had I have given you as a picture you see what it is a ladder from
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:38.980]   heaven to earth and you see the angels going up and down what's it mean well it
[00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:43.780]   means this I'm going to bless you Jacob I am opening the windows of heaven to
[00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:48.140]   shower a blessing upon you this is my way of doing it I'm going to send them
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:52.700]   down and you'll be able to speak to me it'll be this great exchange it was God's
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:58.180]   way of telling his servant Jacob that he was his men that out of his seed will
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:02.220]   all the nations of the earth be blessed and that he would follow him and lead
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:06.700]   him and guide him and bless him that he would be his God and there would be no
[00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:11.140]   end and no limit to the blessings that he was going to enjoy that's the meaning
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:21.100]   of the dream heaven opened the possibility of knowing God and being
[00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:27.340]   blessed by him very well our Lord now you see takes up that idea but I wonder
[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:30.340]   whether you noticed that there was a slight change in what we are told
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:38.980]   listen henceforth ye shall see heaven open and the angels of God ascending
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:43.380]   and descending upon the Son of Man what's the difference between the two
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:55.460]   pictures have you seen it there is no ladder mentioned here Jacob saw a ladder
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:35:01.780]   and the angels ascending and descending upon the ladder here Christ says you
[00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:06.940]   shall see the angels of God ascending and descending not upon a ladder upon
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:16.140]   what upon the Son of Man which being interpreted you see means this he
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:25.500]   himself is the ladder the Son of Man is the ladder what's it mean well obviously
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:29.740]   it means exactly what the letter meant in the case of Jacob in a still greater
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:39.460]   sense what he is saying here is this that he is the link between heaven and
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:48.460]   earth as that ladder was linking Jacob to heaven he himself links earth and
[00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:54.020]   heaven and heaven and earth the Son of Man it's on the Son of Man the angels
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:36:00.220]   will ascend and descend he is the ladder that God has sent down here is the link
[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:07.900]   then I say between earth and heaven and in the same way he is asserting and
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:20.940]   claiming that he is the bond of union between God and men man as I've been
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:29.580]   reminding you as the result of sin has become separated from God he is an alien
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:36.620]   from God there is a quarrel between God and men and men in sin are strangers to
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:40.740]   God and they don't know him they've often tried to find him but they cannot
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:47.100]   God and men are estranged as the result of the fall and as the result of sin and
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:54.940]   there is no way that men can ever think of a device of bringing about a union
[00:36:54.940 --> 00:37:04.780]   between himself and God and here the Lord Jesus Christ says I am the ladder I
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:11.480]   am the link I am the bond of union I am the one who has come you're quite right
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:17.620]   in saying that I am the Son of God I am the Son of God but I am also the Son of
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:23.820]   Men in order that I may link men to God that I may restore the broken communion
[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:30.140]   that I may make possible this communion and fellowship again the rising and the
[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:35.740]   falling the angels ascending and descending I bring man and God together
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:48.260]   I am the link between God and men and finally of course he is saying this that
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:58.180]   he is the way in which God's blessings come to men that was the meaning of the
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:06.340]   ladder as we have seen that Jacob saw in his dream at Peniel he felt alone he
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:13.780]   felt deserted he felt helpless never had he been so conscious of his weakness and
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:19.620]   of the great empty world in which he found himself no one near him absolute
[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:25.820]   loneliness and isolation that awful solitariness that we all come to feel or
[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:32.300]   soon or late left family behind future unknown there he is alone what can he do
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:43.740]   who's concerned about him suddenly the heavens open and the ladder appears and
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:52.180]   he knows that he is linked to heaven and God promises through the ladder to shower
[00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:59.580]   his blessings upon my friends this is just another way of saying what our Lord
[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:07.060]   claims in these extraordinary words that he used on this occasion he looked at
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:16.140]   these people and he said I am the Son of God I am the King of Israel but you will
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:24.900]   come to see something of infinitely more precious worth and value to you as the
[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:33.580]   Son of Man I am the means and the way whereby God's blessings are going to
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:45.020]   come to you now let me emphasize this as I close in putting it in that form our
[00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:54.580]   Lord is claiming and saying that he is the only way and that God's blessings to
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:40:04.220]   mankind come through him and through him alone he is the Son of Man he is the
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:08.660]   ladder between earth and heaven and heaven and earth and there is no other
[00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:14.380]   now in this gospel according to st. John he goes on saying that in different
[00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:18.780]   forms have you remembered them do you remember them listen to this he says I
[00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:28.260]   am the bread of life there is no life there is no sustenance apart from me he
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:35.680]   says I am the door there is no way of entering the kingdom of heaven but by me
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:51.540]   I am the door I am the light of the world there is no light apart from me
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:56.180]   there are great men there are philosophers there are theories but
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:41:02.660]   there's no light no light on God no light on yourself no light on salvation
[00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:09.140]   no light on death no light on eternity I am the light of the world there is no
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:14.500]   light apart from me that's what he's saying he is the ladder the only ladder
[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:39.140]   I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me oh
[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:44.100]   my dear friend you see the importance of all this do you see why I'm stressing it
[00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:48.860]   our Lord announces at the very beginning of his ministry for this all-sufficient
[00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:54.260]   reason until you and I come to see that we have shut up to Christ that there is
[00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:58.580]   no deliverer anywhere else no salvation anywhere else we don't know the
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:08.380]   salvation he is the only way of deliverance the only ladder but you
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:14.020]   remember that not only did he say this his followers kept on saying the same
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:23.020]   thing the Apostle Peter and his companions had been arrested because
[00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:27.780]   they had healed a man at the gate of the temple and had said that it was the name
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:32.380]   of Christ that had done it and then the authorities had arrested them and had
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:40.700]   said to them you mustn't speak in this name any longer we prohibit you to
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:47.900]   preach this Jesus of yours and this was the answer that Peter gave there is
[00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:53.540]   none other name under heaven given amongst men whereby we must be saved
[00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:58.820]   it's the only name I can't keep still says Peter I'll die rather than give in
[00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:06.220]   he's the only name there is none other all God's blessings come through him and
[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:11.260]   apart from him there is no blessing for men well then listen to Paul saying the
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:22.820]   same thing I determined he says to the Corinthians not to know anything among
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:32.140]   you save Jesus Christ and him crucified everything else is a waste of breath
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:37.940]   because it doesn't work I've kept myself to this I've been called a fool people
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:41.660]   say I don't know anything because I haven't talked about philosophy and have
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:45.780]   displayed my knowledge I've done it deliberately I determined not to know
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:50.700]   anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified why he's the only ladder
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:44:00.020]   between God and men between heaven and earth other foundation can no man lay
[00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:08.900]   than that which is laid which is Jesus Christ all the blessings that we enjoy
[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:15.300]   come to us through Jesus Christ blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:21.060]   Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:27.980]   in Christ Jesus we have been quickened with Christ we've been raised with
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:32.180]   Christ we are seated in the heavenly places in Christ we are saved by the
[00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:40.540]   blood of Christ it's all in Christ and there is nothing apart from him in whom
[00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:46.740]   are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge in whom dwelleth all the
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:59.340]   fullness of the Godhead bodily well there it is there I leave it for this
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:09.180]   evening we haven't exhausted it but this we have seen quite clearly haven't we
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:24.100]   he is the Son of God Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God but more he's the Son
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:31.460]   of Man he became the Son of Man why well in order to do this for us which none
[00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:40.180]   other could do a new man was needed a new man came a new link between a heaven
[00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:53.860]   and earth between God and men and he is but he is the only link no men cometh
[00:45:53.860 --> 00:46:03.940]   unto the Father but by me you'll never know God except through Jesus Christ
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:11.140]   you'll never be blessed by God unless it comes to you through Jesus Christ you'll
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:20.140]   never go to heaven except you go in Jesus Christ Son of God yes but blessed
[00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:33.380]   be his name son of man the ladder of God the way for men to rise to that sublime
[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:43.700]   abode an offering and a sacrifice the Holy Spirit's energies and advocate with
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:53.860]   God had you believed that Jesus of Nazareth was the Son of God had you
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:47:03.540]   liked his teaching that's all right he is the Son of God but the vital question
[00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:14.020]   for every one of us tonight is this had you seen also that he is the Son of Man
[00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:19.260]   had you seen that he came down from heaven to earth and died upon the cross
[00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:27.780]   as the men you are representative and mine as Adam was your representative but
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:36.580]   that this representative saves where that representative damn we are all lost
[00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:47.100]   by one man's sin and disobedience we can only be saved as we realize the merit
[00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:55.540]   and the value of this other man's obedience yeah his obedience even to the
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:48:03.100]   death of the cross do you seek God through Jesus Christ if you don't you'll
[00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:08.580]   never know him do you seek his blessings simply on your own without Christ you
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:13.180]   might as well stop there is only one way of entering to the presence of God it is
[00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:22.980]   by the blood of Jesus this is the ladder and on this blessed ladder the angels of
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:28.700]   God bringing and dispensing the blessings are ascending and descending
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:39.700]   he brings us to God and opens heaven that we may receive its glorious
[00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:49.620]   blessings Nathanael believe us now because I said unto thee I saw thee when
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:59.220]   thou wast under the fig tree thou shalt see greater things than these have you
[00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:11.820]   seen had you seen that Jesus Christ the Son of God is God's only way of blessing
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:18.580]   you well if you've seen it and seen it tonight for the first time I say to you
[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:24.140]   put your foot upon the first rung of the ladder hasten to him hold on to the
[00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:33.220]   sides flee to him once you're on that ladder you are linked to God and to him
[00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:46.060]   and you are open to all the glories and the blessings of the kingdom of him we
