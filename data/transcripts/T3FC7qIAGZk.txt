[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600]   Mossad will do anything.
[00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.440]   Mossad has no qualms doing what it takes
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.720]   to ensure the survival of every Israeli citizen
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.760]   around the world.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.920]   Most other countries will stop at some point,
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.280]   but Mossad doesn't do that.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.200]   - The following is a conversation
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.960]   with Andrew Bustamante,
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.520]   former CIA covert intelligence officer
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.760]   and US Air Force combat veteran,
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.740]   including the job of operational targeting,
[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.440]   encrypted communications,
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.140]   and launch operations for 200 nuclear
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.260]   intercontinental ballistic missiles.
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.900]   Andrew's over seven years as a CIA spy
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.740]   have given him a skillset and a perspective on the world
[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.640]   that is fascinating to explore.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.640]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.580]   To support it,
[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.100]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.740]   And now, dear friends, here's Andrew Bustamante.
[00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.700]   The Central Intelligence Agency
[00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.540]   was formed almost 75 years ago.
[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.980]   What is the mission of the CIA?
[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.100]   How does it work?
[00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.380]   - The mission of the CIA is to collect intelligence
[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.220]   from around the world
[00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.500]   that supports a national security mission
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.380]   and be the central repository
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.620]   for all other intelligence agencies
[00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.340]   so that it's one collective source
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.180]   where all intelligence can be synthesized
[00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.060]   and then passed forward to the decision makers.
[00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.100]   - That doesn't include domestic intelligence.
[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.420]   It's primarily looking outward outside the United States.
[00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.260]   - Correct.
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.340]   CIA is the foreign intelligence collection
[00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.380]   kingspoke, if you will.
[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.940]   FBI does domestic,
[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.620]   and then Department of Homeland Security does domestic.
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.300]   Law enforcement essentially handles all things domestic.
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.740]   Intelligence is not law enforcement,
[00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.000]   so we technically cannot work inside the United States.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.460]   - Is there clear lines to be drawn between,
[00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.980]   like you just said, the FBI, CIA, FBI,
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.260]   and the other US intelligence agencies
[00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.860]   like the DIA, Defense Intelligence Agency,
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.500]   Department of Homeland Security,
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.020]   NSA, National Security Agency,
[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.100]   and there's a list.
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.740]   - There's a list of about 33
[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.100]   different intelligence organizations.
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.020]   - So like the Army, the Navy has,
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.780]   all the different organizations
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.740]   have their own intelligence groups.
[00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.740]   So is there clear lines here to be drawn,
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.180]   or is the CIA the giant integrator of all of these?
[00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.520]   - It's a little bit of both, to be honest.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.300]   So yes, there are absolutely lines,
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.340]   and more so than the lines,
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.980]   there are lines that divide what our primary mission is.
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.740]   Everything's gotta be prioritized.
[00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.580]   That's one of the benefits
[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.120]   and the superpowers of the United States,
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.620]   is we prioritize everything.
[00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.100]   So different intelligence organizations are prioritized
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.540]   to collect certain types of intelligence.
[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.100]   And then within the confines of how they collect,
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.340]   they're also given unique authorities.
[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.520]   Authorities are a term that's directed
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.480]   by the executive branch.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.540]   Different agencies have different authorities
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.660]   to execute missions in different ways.
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.280]   FBI can't execute the same way CIA executes,
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.520]   and CIA can't execute the same way NGA executes.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.580]   But then at the end, excuse me,
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.940]   when it's all collected, then yes,
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.940]   CIA still acts as a final synthesizing repository
[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.740]   to create what's known as the President's Daily Brief,
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.580]   the PDB.
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.780]   The only way CIA can create the PDB
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.860]   is by being the single source of all source intelligence
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.380]   from around the IC, the Intelligence Community,
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.380]   which are those 30-some-odd and always changing organizations
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.980]   that are sponsored for intelligence operations.
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.420]   - What does the PDB, the President's Daily Brief,
[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.260]   look like?
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.080]   How long is it?
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.920]   What does it contain?
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.740]   (Lyle laughs)
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.940]   - So first of all, it looks like the most expensive
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.300]   book report you can ever imagine.
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.820]   It's got its own binder.
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.980]   It's all very high-end.
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.140]   It feels important. It looks important.
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.240]   It's not like a cheap Trapper Keeper.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.820]   It's somewhere between, I would give it probably
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.380]   between 50 and 125 pages a day.
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.540]   It's produced every day around two o'clock in the morning
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.540]   by a dedicated group of analysts.
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.540]   And each page is essentially a short paragraph
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.440]   to a few paragraphs about a priority happening
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.540]   that affects national security from around the world.
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.660]   The President rarely gets to the entire briefing in a day.
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.780]   He relies on a briefer instead to prioritize
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.060]   what inside the briefing needs to be shared
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.900]   with the President.
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.580]   'Cause some days the PDB will get briefed in 10 minutes,
[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.580]   and some days it'll be briefed over the course of two hours.
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.820]   It depends on the President's schedule.
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.220]   - How much competition is there for the first page?
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.680]   And so how much jockeying there is for attention?
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.500]   I imagine for all the different intelligence agencies
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.000]   and within the CIA, there's probably different groups
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.700]   that are modular and they all care about different nations
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.380]   or different cases.
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.380]   And do you understand how much competition there is
[00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.580]   for the attention, for the limited attention
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.500]   of the President?
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.300]   - You're 100% correct in how the agency
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.640]   and how officers and managers at the agency handle the PDB.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.940]   There's a ton of competition.
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.660]   Everybody wants to be the first on the radar.
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.380]   Everybody wants to be on the first page.
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.260]   The thing that we're not baking into the equation
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.140]   is the President's interests.
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.460]   The President dictates what's on the first page of his PDB,
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.700]   and he will tell them usually the day before,
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.380]   "I wanna see this on the first page tomorrow.
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.540]   "Bring this to me in the beginning.
[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.640]   "I don't wanna hear about what's happening in Mozambique.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.820]   "I don't really care about what's happening in Saudi Arabia.
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.860]   "I wanna see one, two, three."
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.240]   And regardless of whether or not
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.060]   those are the three biggest things in the world,
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.340]   the President's the executive, he's the one,
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.700]   he's the ultimate customer.
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.620]   So we do what the customer says.
[00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.660]   That has backfired in the past.
[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.540]   If you haven't already started seeing
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.280]   how that could go wrong, that has backfired in the past,
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.240]   but that is essentially what happens
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.380]   when you serve in the executive branch.
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.140]   You serve the executive.
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.100]   - So what's the role, the director of the CIA
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.840]   versus the President?
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.300]   What's that dance like?
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.100]   So the President really leads the focus of the CIA?
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.360]   - The President is the commander-in-chief for the military,
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.880]   but the Executive, the President is also
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.240]   the executive for the entirety of the intelligence community.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.580]   So he's the ultimate customer.
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.960]   If you look at it like a business,
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.340]   the customer, the person spending the money,
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.540]   is the President, and the director is the CEO.
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.640]   So if the director doesn't create what the President wants,
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.660]   there's gonna be a new director.
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:32.940]   That's why the director of CIA
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.600]   is a presidential appointed position.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.260]   Sometimes they're extremely qualified
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.640]   intelligence professionals.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.620]   Sometimes they're just professional politicians
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.540]   or soldiers that get put into that seat
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.820]   because the President trusts them
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.780]   to do what he wants them to do.
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.780]   Another gaping area that causes problems,
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.260]   but that's still the way it is.
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.300]   - So you think this is a problematic configuration
[00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.140]   of the whole system?
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.500]   - Massive flaw in the system.
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.900]   It is a massive flaw in the system
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.900]   because if you're essentially appointing a director
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.540]   to do what you want them to do,
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.620]   then you're assigning a crony,
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.860]   and that's what we define corruption as
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:11.700]   within the United States.
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.300]   And inside the United States, we say,
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.060]   if you pick somebody outside of merit
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.700]   for any other reason other than merit,
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.540]   then it's cronyism or it's nepotism.
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.740]   Here, that's exactly what our structure's built on.
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:22.940]   All presidential appointees
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.100]   are appointed on something other than merit.
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.500]   - So for an intelligence agency to be effective,
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.780]   it has to discover the truth and communicate that truth.
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.740]   And maybe if you're appointing the director of that agency,
[00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.700]   you're not, they're less likely
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.380]   to communicate the truth to you
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.020]   unless the truth aligns perfectly
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.740]   with your desired worldview.
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.100]   - Well, not necessarily perfectly
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.860]   because there are other steps, right?
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.900]   They have to go in front of Congress
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.460]   and they have to have the support
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.940]   of multiple legislatures or legislators.
[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.820]   But the challenge is that the shortlist of people
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.260]   who even get the opportunity aren't a meritorious list.
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.540]   It's a shortlist based off of who the president is picking
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.340]   or who the would-be president is picking.
[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.860]   Now, I think we've proven that an intelligence organization
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:11.860]   can be extremely effective even within the flawed system.
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:16.340]   The challenge is how much more effective could we be
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.780]   if we improved?
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.220]   And I think that's the challenge
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.980]   that faces a lot of the US government.
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.900]   I think that's a challenge that has resulted
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.580]   in what we see today when it comes to the decline
[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.180]   of American power and American influence,
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:35.460]   the rise of foreign influence, authoritarian powers,
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:39.500]   and a shrinking US economy, a growing Chinese economy.
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.460]   And it's just, we have questions, hard questions
[00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.380]   we need to ask ourselves
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.240]   about how we're gonna handle the future.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.020]   - What aspect of that communication
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.540]   between the president and the CIA could be fixed
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:54.540]   to help fix the problems that you're referring to
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.620]   in terms of the decline of American power?
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.260]   - So when you talk about the president wanting
[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.640]   to prioritize what the president cares about,
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.580]   that immediately shows a break
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.740]   between what actually matters
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.340]   to the long-term success of the United States
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.560]   versus what benefits the short-term success
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.540]   of the current president.
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:20.180]   - Because any president is just a human being
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.940]   and has a very narrow focus,
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.740]   and narrow focus is not a long-term calculation.
[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:26.700]   - Exactly, what's the maximum amount of years
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.280]   a president can be president?
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.260]   Eight.
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.660]   He has to be, he or she--
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.620]   - In the United States.
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:32.700]   - In the United States,
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.220]   according to our current constitution.
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.540]   (laughing)
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.460]   But they're very limited
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.580]   in terms of what they have to prioritize.
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.020]   And then if you look at a four-year cycle,
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.700]   two years of that is essentially preparing
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.100]   for the next election cycle.
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.140]   So that's only two years of really quality attention
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.020]   you get from the president,
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.460]   who is the chief executive
[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.060]   of all the intelligence community.
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.220]   So the most important thing to them
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.020]   is not always the most important thing
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.660]   to the long-term survival of the United States.
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.020]   - What do you make of the hostile relationship
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.660]   that, to me at least, stands out of the presidents
[00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.340]   between Donald Trump and the CIA?
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.460]   Was that a very kind of personal bickering?
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.260]   I mean, is there something interesting to you
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.300]   about the dynamics between that particular president
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.980]   and that particular instantiation
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.380]   of the intelligence agency?
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.720]   - Man, there were lots of things fascinating to me
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.700]   about that relationship.
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:24.540]   So first--
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.100]   - What's the good and the bad, sorry to interrupt.
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.960]   - So let me start with the good first,
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.800]   'cause there's a lot of people
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.900]   who don't think there was any good.
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.700]   So the good thing is we saw that the president,
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:40.340]   who's the chief customer, the executive to the CIA,
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.460]   when the president doesn't want to hear
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.460]   what CIA has to say, he's not gonna listen.
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.540]   I think that's an important lesson
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.100]   for everyone to take home.
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.580]   If the president doesn't care what you have to say,
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:52.780]   he's gonna take funding away,
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.620]   or she will take funding away.
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.220]   They're gonna take attention away.
[00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:01.820]   They're going to shut down your operations, your missions.
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.780]   They're gonna kill the careers of the people working there.
[00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:05.620]   Think about that.
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.500]   For the four years that President Trump was the president,
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.980]   basically everybody at CIA, their career was put on pause.
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.660]   Some people's careers were ended.
[00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:16.300]   Some people voluntarily left their career there
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:20.380]   because they found themselves working for a single customer
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.940]   that didn't want what they had to produce.
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.460]   - So for people who don't know,
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.940]   Donald Trump did not display significant,
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.820]   deep interest in the output.
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.620]   - He did not trust it, yeah.
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.420]   - He was a disinterested customer.
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.260]   - Exactly right.
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.380]   - Of the information.
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.980]   - And then what do disinterested customers do?
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.700]   They go find someone else to create their product,
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.100]   and that's exactly what Donald Trump did,
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.300]   and he did it through the private intelligence world,
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.500]   funding private intelligence companies
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.100]   to run their own operations that brought him
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.900]   the information he cared about when CIA wouldn't.
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.540]   It also didn't help that CIA stepped outside
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.540]   of their confines, right?
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.620]   CIA is supposed to collect foreign intelligence
[00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.700]   and not comment on domestic matters.
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.380]   They went way outside of that
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.340]   when they started challenging the president,
[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.140]   when they started questioning the results,
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:08.300]   when they started publicly claiming Russian influence.
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.760]   That's all something the FBI could have handled by itself.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.500]   The Justice Department could have handled by itself.
[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.300]   CIA had no place to contribute to that conversation,
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.760]   and when they did, all they did was undermine
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.700]   the relationship they had with their primary customer.
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:26.220]   - Let me sort of focus in on this relationship
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:29.140]   between the president or the leader
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.220]   and the intelligence agency,
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.120]   and look outside the United States.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.500]   It seems like authoritarian regimes,
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:37.860]   or regimes throughout history,
[00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.780]   if you look at Stalin and Hitler,
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.680]   if you look at today with Vladimir Putin,
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.540]   the negative effects of power corrupting the mind
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:50.340]   of a leader manifest itself is that they start
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:53.420]   to get bad information from the intelligence agencies.
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.660]   So this kind of thing that you're talking about,
[00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.660]   over time, they start hearing information
[00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.760]   they want to hear.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.780]   The agency starts producing only the kind of information
[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.860]   they want to hear, and the leader's worldview
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:12.560]   starts becoming distorted to where the propaganda
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.220]   they generate is also the thing
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.580]   that the intelligence agencies provide to them.
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:19.740]   And so they start getting this,
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.540]   they start believing they're on propaganda,
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.740]   and they start getting a distorted view of the world.
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:27.460]   Sorry for the sort of walking through in a weird way,
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.020]   but I guess I want to ask, do you think,
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.600]   let's look at Vladimir Putin specifically,
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:37.600]   do you think he's getting accurate information
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.620]   about the world?
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.820]   Do you think he knows the truth of the world,
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.620]   whether that's the war in Ukraine,
[00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.140]   whether that's the behavior of the other nations,
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.460]   in NATO, the United States in general?
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.060]   What do you think?
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.620]   - It's rare that I'll talk about just thinking.
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.500]   I prefer to share my assessment,
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.020]   why I assess things a certain way,
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.620]   rather than just what's my random opinion.
[00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.980]   In my assessment, Vladimir Putin is winning.
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.180]   Russia is winning.
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:07.020]   They're winning in Ukraine, but they're also winning
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.860]   the battle of influence against the West.
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.180]   They're winning in the face of economic sanctions.
[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.380]   They're winning.
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:15.500]   Empirically, when you look at the math, they're winning.
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.180]   So when you ask me whether or not Putin
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.580]   is getting good information from his intelligence services,
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.940]   when I look at my overall assessment
[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.500]   of multiple data points,
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.960]   he must be getting good information.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.580]   Do I know how or why?
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:29.740]   I do not.
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.260]   I don't know how or why it works there.
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.060]   I don't know how such deep cronyism,
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:40.060]   such deep corruption can possibly yield true real results,
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.740]   and yet somehow there are real results happening.
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.260]   So it's either excessive waste and an accidental win,
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.340]   or there really is a system and a process there
[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:50.420]   that's functioning.
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.860]   - So this winning idea is very interesting.
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.460]   In what way, short-term and long-term, is Russia winning?
[00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.260]   Some people say there was a miscalculation
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.920]   of the way the invasion happened.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.580]   There was an assumption that you would be able
[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.060]   to successfully take Kiev,
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:09.020]   you'd be able to successfully capture the east,
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.780]   the south, and the north of Ukraine,
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:15.140]   and with what now appears to be
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.380]   significantly insufficient troops
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.840]   spread way too thin across way too large of a front.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.740]   So that seems to be like an intelligence failure.
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:29.700]   And that doesn't seem to be like winning.
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.760]   In another way, it doesn't seem like winning
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.860]   if we put aside the human cost of war.
[00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.260]   It doesn't seem like winning
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.580]   because the hearts and minds of the West
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:43.220]   were completely on the side of Ukraine.
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.060]   This particular leader, Volodymyr Zelensky,
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.060]   captured the attention of the world
[00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:52.060]   and the hearts and minds of Europe, the West,
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:54.420]   and many other nations throughout the world,
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.340]   both financially, in terms of military equipment,
[00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:01.420]   and in terms of sort of social and cultural
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.180]   and emotional support
[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.860]   for the independence fight of this nation.
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.660]   That seems to be like a miscalculation.
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:12.100]   So against that pushback,
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.820]   why do you think there's still kernels
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:19.860]   of winning in this on the Russian side?
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.900]   - What you're laying out isn't incorrect.
[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:26.260]   And the miscalculations are not unexpected.
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.820]   Anybody who's been to a military college,
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.660]   including the Army War College in Pennsylvania,
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:34.860]   where so many of our military leaders are brought up,
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.900]   when you look at the conflict in Ukraine,
[00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:42.420]   it fits the exact mold of what an effective,
[00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:46.220]   long-term military conflict, protracted military conflict,
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:49.580]   would and should look like for military dominance.
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:52.420]   Now, did Zelensky and did the Ukrainians
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:53.260]   shock the world?
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.220]   Absolutely.
[00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.820]   But in that, they also shocked American intelligence,
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.180]   which, like you said, miscalculated.
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.540]   The whole world miscalculated
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.220]   how the Ukrainians would respond.
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.540]   Putin did not move in there accidentally.
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:06.820]   He had an assessment.
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:09.380]   He had high likelihood of a certain outcome,
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.420]   and that outcome did not happen.
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.060]   Why did he have that calculation?
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.940]   Because in 2014, it worked.
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:19.740]   He invaded, he took Crimea in 14 days.
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:24.740]   He basically created an infiltration campaign
[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:26.860]   that turned key leaders over
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:29.180]   in the first few days of the conflict.
[00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.700]   So essentially, there was no conflict.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.220]   It worked in 2008, when he took Georgia.
[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.980]   Nobody talks about that.
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.300]   He invaded Georgia the exact same way, and it worked.
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.380]   So in 2008, it worked.
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.340]   In 2014, it worked.
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.140]   There was no reason to believe it wasn't going to work again.
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.500]   So he just carried out the same campaign.
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.580]   But this time, something was different.
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:51.060]   That was a miscalculation, for sure, on the part of Putin.
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.940]   And the reason that there was no support from the West,
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:55.380]   'cause let's not forget, there is no support.
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.660]   There is nothing other than the Lend-Lease Act,
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.540]   which is putting Ukraine in massive debt
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.340]   right now to the West.
[00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:05.180]   That's the only form of support they're getting
[00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.060]   from NATO or the United States.
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.820]   So if somebody believed Ukraine would win,
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.260]   if somebody believed Ukraine had a chance,
[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:13.700]   they would have gotten more material support
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.540]   than just debt.
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.780]   And we can jump into that anytime you want to.
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.460]   But the whole world miscalculated.
[00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.420]   Everybody thought Russia was gonna win in 14 days.
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.540]   I said that they would win in 14 days,
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.340]   'cause that was the predominant calculation.
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.960]   Once the first invasion didn't work,
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.780]   then the military does what professional militaries do, man.
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:37.780]   They reevaluate, they reorganize leaders,
[00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.340]   and then they take a new approach.
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:41.740]   You saw three approaches.
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.740]   The first two did not work.
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:46.220]   The first two campaigns against Ukraine did not work
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.680]   the way they were supposed to work.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:51.260]   The third has worked exactly like it's supposed to work.
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.780]   You don't need Kiev to win Ukraine.
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:56.540]   You don't need hearts and minds to win Ukraine.
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.660]   What you need-- - What's the third?
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.780]   - Yeah, what you need is control of natural resources,
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.700]   which they're taking in the East,
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.900]   and you need access to the heartbeat,
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.140]   the blood flow of food and money into the country,
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.900]   which they're taking in the South.
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.740]   The fact that Ukraine had to go to the negotiation table
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:19.400]   with Russia and Turkey in order to get exports
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.760]   out of the Black Sea approved, again,
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.180]   demonstrates just how much Ukraine is losing.
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:29.500]   The aggressor had a seat at the negotiation table
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.400]   to allow Ukraine the ability to even export
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.860]   one of its top exports.
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.500]   If Russia would have said no,
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.100]   then they would not have had that.
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.620]   Russia has, that's like someone holding your throat.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:43.180]   It's like somebody holding your jugular vein and saying,
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:46.480]   if you don't do what I tell you to do,
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.340]   then I'm not gonna let you breathe.
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.080]   I'm not gonna let blood flow to your brain.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.180]   - So do you think it's possible
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:56.140]   that Russia takes the South of Ukraine?
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:01.140]   It takes, so starting from Mariupol,
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:03.640]   the Kherson region.
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.540]   - All the way to Odessa.
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:05.760]   - All the way to Odessa.
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.720]   - And into Moldova.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.880]   I believe all of that will happen before the fall.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.800]   - Fall of this year?
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.680]   - Fall of this year.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.600]   Before winter hits Europe,
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:21.480]   NATO wants, Germany needs to be able to have sanctions lifted
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.720]   so they can tap into Russian power.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.100]   There's no way they can have those sanctions lifted
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.240]   unless Russia wins.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.240]   And Russia also knows that all of Europe,
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:36.000]   all of NATO is the true people feeling the pain of the war
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.160]   outside of Ukraine are the NATO countries
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.680]   because they're so heavily reliant on Russia.
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.280]   And as they have supported American sanctions against Russia
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.880]   their people feel the pain.
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.520]   Economically, their people feel the pain.
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.940]   What are they gonna do in the winter?
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:54.720]   Because without Russian gas,
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.860]   their people are gonna freeze to death.
[00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.000]   - Ukrainian people.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.300]   - People all over NATO.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.040]   Ukraine, everybody knows Ukraine's at risk.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.200]   Everybody knows Ukrainians are dying.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.560]   The game of war isn't played just,
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.200]   it isn't even played majoritively
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.920]   by the people who are fighting.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.640]   The game of war is played by everyone else.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.000]   It's an economic game, it's not a military game.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.360]   - The flow of resources and energy.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.600]   - Attention. - And food.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.520]   - Exactly right.
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:24.640]   - I was on the front in the Kherson region,
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.880]   this very area that you're referring to
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.040]   and I spoke to a lot of people
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:33.240]   and the morale is incredibly high.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:37.680]   And I don't think the people in that region,
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:42.680]   soldiers, volunteer soldiers, civilians,
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:47.320]   are going to give up that land without dying.
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.660]   - I agree with you.
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.960]   - I mean, in order to take Odessa
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:56.960]   would require huge amount of artillery
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.360]   and slaughter of civilians essentially.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.840]   - They're not gonna use artillery in Odessa
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.360]   because Odessa is too important to Russian culture.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.840]   It's gonna be even uglier than that.
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.280]   It's going to be clearing of streets,
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:13.400]   clearing of buildings, person by person, troop by troop.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.080]   It'll be a lot like what it was in Margol.
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.120]   - Just shooting at civilians.
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.920]   - Because they can't afford to just do bombing raids
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.080]   because they're gonna destroy cultural
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.480]   significant architecture that's just too important
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.680]   to the Russian culture.
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.520]   And that's gonna demoralize their own Russian people.
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.520]   - I have to do a lot of thinking to try to understand
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.360]   what I even feel, I don't know.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.480]   But in terms of information,
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.400]   the thing that the soldiers are saying,
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.720]   the Russian soldiers are saying,
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.640]   the thing the Russian soldiers really believe
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.440]   is that they're freeing,
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:50.440]   they're liberating the Ukrainian people from Nazis.
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:55.420]   And they believe this.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:00.720]   Because I visited Ukraine, I spoke to over 100,
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.520]   probably a couple hundred Ukrainian people
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.440]   from different walks of life.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:08.600]   It feels like the Russian soldiers at least
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.240]   are under a cloud of propaganda.
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:15.520]   They're not operating on a clear view of the whole world.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:20.520]   And given all that,
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:25.520]   I just don't see Russia taking any more of the blame
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:31.160]   for Russia taking the South without committing war crimes.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:36.440]   And if Vladimir Putin is aware of what's happening
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.380]   in terms of the treatment of civilians,
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:43.120]   I don't see him pushing forward all the way
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.760]   to take the South.
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:49.760]   Because that's not going to be effective strategy
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:54.040]   for him to win the hearts and minds of his people.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.760]   - Autocracies don't need to win hearts and minds.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.160]   That's a staunchly democratic point of view.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.040]   Hearts and minds mean very little
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:07.040]   to people who understand core basic needs and true power.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:13.720]   You don't see Xi Jinping worrying
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.920]   about hearts and minds in China.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.600]   You don't see it in North Korea.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.080]   You don't see it in Congo.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.440]   You don't see it in most of the world.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.640]   Hearts and minds are a luxury.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.280]   In reality, what people need is food, water, power.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:31.000]   They need income to be able to secure a lifestyle.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.040]   It is absolutely sad.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.620]   I am not in any way, shape, or form saying
[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:42.440]   that my assessment on this is enriching
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:46.320]   or enlightening or hopeful.
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.680]   It's just fact.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:52.640]   It's just calculatable empirical evidence.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.320]   If Putin loses in Ukraine, the losses,
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:59.400]   the influential losses, the economic losses,
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:03.720]   the lives lost, the power lost is too great.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:07.560]   So it is better for him to push and push and push
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.400]   through war crimes, through everything else.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.600]   War crimes are something defined
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.400]   by the international court system.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.640]   The international court system has Russia
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.220]   as part of its board.
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:19.740]   And the international court system is largely powerless
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:23.180]   when it comes to enforcing its own outcomes.
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:27.520]   So the real risk gain scenario here for Russia
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:33.020]   is significantly in favor of gain over risk.
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.820]   The other thing that I think is important to talk about
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:40.320]   is we, everybody, is trapped in the middle
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.860]   of a gigantic information war.
[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:46.000]   Yes, there's battlefield bullets and cannons and tanks,
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.540]   but there's also a massive informational war.
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:53.540]   The same narrative that you see these ground troops
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.780]   in Ukraine, these Russian ground troops in Ukraine,
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.900]   believing they're clearing the land of Nazis,
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.540]   that information is being fed to them
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.120]   from their own home country.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.460]   I don't know why people seem to think
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.100]   that the information that they're reading in English
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.820]   is any more or less true.
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:13.020]   Every piece of news coming out of the West,
[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:14.840]   every piece of information coming out
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:18.420]   in the English language is also a giant narrative
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:23.420]   being shared intentionally to try to undermine the morale
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:26.060]   and the faithfulness of English speaking Russians,
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:27.900]   which somebody somewhere knows exactly
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.500]   how many of those there are.
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.000]   So we have to recognize that we're not getting
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.800]   true information from other side,
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.980]   because there is a strategic value in making sure
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:38.580]   that there is just the right amount of miss
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:40.300]   or disinformation out there.
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.540]   Not because someone's trying to lie to Americans,
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:44.440]   but because someone is trying to influence
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:47.080]   the way English speaking Russians think.
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.860]   And in that world, that's exactly why you see
[00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:54.380]   so many news articles cited to anonymous sources,
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.580]   government officials who do not wanna be named.
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.740]   There's nothing that links back responsibility there.
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:01.980]   There's nothing that can go to court there.
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:04.180]   But the information still gets released
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:08.220]   and that's enough to make Ukrainians believe
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.020]   that the United States is gonna help them
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.300]   or that the West is gonna help them.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.100]   It's enough to make Russians think
[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:17.020]   that they're going to lose and maybe they should just,
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.000]   they should just give up now
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.660]   and leave from the battlefield now.
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:20.880]   We have to understand,
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:24.020]   we are in the middle of a giant information war.
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.380]   - Maybe you can correct me,
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.320]   but it feels like in the English speaking world,
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.380]   it's harder to control.
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:32.260]   It's harder to fight the information war
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:35.200]   because of, you know, some people say
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.540]   there's not really a freedom of speech in this country,
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.140]   but I think if you compare,
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.740]   there's a lot more freedom of speech.
[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:44.260]   And it's just harder to control narratives
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:48.440]   when there's a bunch of guerrilla journalists
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.360]   that are able to just publish anything they want
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:51.980]   on Twitter or anything.
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:53.940]   It's just harder to control narratives.
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.100]   - So people don't understand where freedom of speech is.
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.580]   That's the first major problem.
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:00.340]   And it's shameful how many people in the United States
[00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:03.740]   do not understand what freedom of speech actually protects.
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:06.580]   So that aside, you're absolutely right.
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:09.140]   Fighting the information war in the West
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:10.380]   is extremely difficult
[00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:14.260]   because anyone with a blog,
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:16.140]   anyone with a Twitter account,
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:18.260]   anyone, I mean, anyone can call themselves
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:19.540]   a journalist essentially.
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:21.740]   We live in a world, we live in a country
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:23.280]   where people read the headline
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.620]   and they completely bypass the author line
[00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.220]   and they go straight into the content.
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.140]   And then they decide whether the content's real or not
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.420]   based on how they feel
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.980]   instead of based on empirical measurable evidence.
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:37.580]   - So you mentioned the Len Lease Act
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.740]   and the support of the United States,
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:42.340]   support of Ukraine by the United States.
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.700]   Are you skeptical to the level of support
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.800]   that the United States is providing
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.980]   and is going to provide over time?
[00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:51.620]   - The strategy that the United States has taken
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.900]   to support Ukraine is similar to the strategy
[00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:56.540]   we took to support Great Britain during World War II.
[00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:58.700]   The enactment of the Len Lease Act
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:28:59.980]   is a perfect example of that.
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.620]   The Len Lease Act means that we are lending
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:06.040]   or leasing equipment to the Ukrainian government
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.900]   in exchange for future payment.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.680]   So every time a rocket is launched,
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.000]   every time a drone crashes into a tank,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   that's a bill that Ukraine is just racking up.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.600]   It's like when you go to a restaurant
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.060]   and you start drinking shots.
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.460]   Sometime the bill will come due.
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:26.200]   This is exactly what we did when Europe
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:30.080]   and when Great Britain was in the face of Nazi invasion,
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.960]   we signed the same thing into motion.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.960]   Do you know that the UK did not pay off the debt
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.980]   from World War II until 2020?
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:41.880]   They've been paying that debt since the end of World War II.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:45.220]   So what we're doing is we're indebting Ukraine
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.340]   against the promise that perhaps
[00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:48.720]   they will secure their freedom,
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.280]   which nobody seems to want to talk about
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:52.880]   what freedom is actually gonna look like for Ukrainians.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.420]   What are the true handful of outcomes,
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.240]   the realistic outcomes that could come of this?
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:00.200]   And which of those outcomes really looks like freedom
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.600]   to them, especially in the face of the fact
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:05.400]   that they're going to be trillions of dollars in debt
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:09.480]   to the West for supplying them with the training
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.440]   and the weapons and the food and the med kits
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.800]   and everything else that we're giving them
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.480]   because none of it's free.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.120]   It's all coming due.
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.780]   It's all, we're a democracy,
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:20.400]   but we're also a capitalist country.
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.200]   We can't afford to just give things away for free,
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.840]   but we can give things away at a discount.
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.040]   We can give things away layaway,
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.880]   but the bill will come due.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.480]   And unfortunately, that is not part of the conversation
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.920]   that's being had with the American people.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:37.400]   - So debt is a way to establish some level of control.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.760]   Power is power.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:44.160]   That said, having a very close relationship
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.480]   between Ukraine and the United States
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:50.480]   does not seem to be a negative possibility
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.000]   when the Ukrainians think about their future
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.040]   in terms of freedom.
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:54.880]   That's one thing.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.840]   And the other, there's some aspect of this war
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:01.520]   that I've just noticed that one of the people I talked to
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:06.520]   said that all great nations have a independence war,
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:10.680]   have to have a war for their independence.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.760]   In order, there's something, it's dark,
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.760]   but there's something about war just being a catalyst
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.400]   for finding your own identity as a nation.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.360]   So you can have leaders,
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.120]   you can have sort of signed documents,
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.320]   you can have all this kind of stuff,
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:25.460]   but there's something about war
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.400]   that really brings the country together
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.400]   and actually try to figure out what is at the core
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.800]   of the spirit of the people that defines this country.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:36.540]   And they see this war as that,
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:38.520]   as the independence war to define the heart
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:39.360]   of what the country is.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.840]   So there's been before the war, before this invasion,
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:46.300]   there was a lot of factions in the country.
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:50.440]   There was a lot of influence from oligarchs
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.960]   and corruption and so on.
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:56.160]   A lot of that was the factions were brought together
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:00.000]   under one umbrella effectively to become one nation
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.440]   because of this invasion.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.720]   So they see that as a positive direction
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:09.720]   for the defining of what a free democratic country
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:12.040]   looks like after the war,
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.760]   in their perspective after the war is won.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.360]   - It's a difficult situation
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:19.780]   because I'm trying to make sure that you
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.160]   and all everybody listening understands
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.480]   that what's happening in Ukraine,
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:29.160]   among Ukrainians is noble and brave and courageous
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:33.240]   and beyond the expectations of anyone.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:38.880]   The fact is there is no material support
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.120]   coming from the outside.
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:43.040]   The American revolution was won
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:44.640]   because of French involvement,
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.920]   French ships, French troops, French generals,
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.720]   French military might.
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:54.720]   The independence of communist China was won
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:57.720]   through Russian support, Russian generals,
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:01.040]   Russian troops on the ground fighting with the communists.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.680]   That's how revolutions are won.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.320]   That's how independent countries are born.
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.320]   Ukraine doesn't get any of that.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.000]   No one is stepping into that
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   because we live in a world right now
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.760]   where there simply is no economic benefits
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:21.560]   to the parties in power to support Ukraine to that level.
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:24.500]   And war is a game of economics.
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:28.880]   The economic benefit of Ukraine is crystal clear
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.400]   in favor of Russia, which is why Putin cannot lose.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.520]   He will not let himself lose.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:36.560]   Short of something completely unexpected, right?
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:40.100]   I'm talking 60%, 70% probability, Ukraine loses.
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.560]   But there's still 20%, 30% probability
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.680]   of the unimaginable happening.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:45.860]   Who knows what that might be?
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.040]   An oligarch assassinates Putin
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.500]   or a nuclear bomb goes off somewhere
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.940]   or who knows what, right?
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:54.920]   There's still a chance that something unexpected
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.640]   will happen and change the tide of the war.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:01.640]   But when it comes down to the core calculus here,
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:06.320]   Ukraine is the agricultural bed to support a future Russia.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.600]   Russian knows, they know they have to have Ukraine.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.800]   They know that they have to have it to protect themselves
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.600]   against military pressure from the West.
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.680]   They have to have it for agricultural reasons.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:20.160]   They have major oil and natural gas pipelines
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.680]   that flow through Eastern Ukraine.
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:26.060]   They cannot let Ukraine fall outside
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.500]   of their sphere of influence, they cannot.
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.120]   The United States doesn't really have
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:33.580]   any economic vested interest in Ukraine.
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:37.800]   Ideological points of view and promises aside,
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.280]   there's no economic benefit.
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.320]   And the same thing goes for NATO.
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.480]   NATO has no economic investments in Ukraine.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:49.240]   Ukrainian output, Ukrainian food
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:51.080]   goes to the Middle East and Africa.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.840]   It doesn't go to Europe.
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:58.320]   So the whole, the West siding with Ukraine
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.940]   is exclusively ideological and it's putting them
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:04.120]   in a place where they fight a war with Russia
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.580]   so the whole world can see Russia's capabilities.
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:09.680]   Ukraine is a, as sad as it is to say, man,
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:14.680]   Ukraine is a pawn on a table for superpowers
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:17.440]   to calculate each other's capacities.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.920]   Right now, we've only talked about Russia
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:19.760]   and the United States.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.160]   We haven't even talked about Iran.
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.720]   We haven't even talked about China, right?
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.980]   It is a pawn on a table.
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.360]   This is a chicken fight so that people get to watch
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.640]   and see what the other trainers are doing.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.560]   - Well, a lot of people might have said the same thing
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:34.140]   about the United States back in the independence fight.
[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:38.440]   So there is possibilities, as you've said.
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.920]   We're not saying a 0% chance,
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:44.600]   and it could be a reasonably high percent chance
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:48.080]   that this becomes one of the great democratic nations
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.160]   that the 21st century is remembered by.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.000]   - Absolutely.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.120]   - And so you said American support.
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.600]   So ideologically, first of all,
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:02.600]   you don't assign much long-term power to that,
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:08.200]   that US could support Ukraine purely on ideological grounds.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:12.880]   - Just look in the last four years, the last three years.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.520]   Do you remember what happened in Hong Kong
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.520]   right before COVID?
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:20.520]   China swooped into Hong Kong violently,
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:23.840]   beating protesters, killing them in the street,
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:26.720]   imprisoning people without just cause.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.980]   And Hong Kong was a democracy.
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:32.640]   And the whole world stood by and let it happen.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.620]   And then what happened in Afghanistan just a year ago?
[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:37.800]   And the whole world stood by
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:41.760]   and let the Taliban take power again after 20 years of loss.
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:46.480]   This, we are showing a repeatable point of view.
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.600]   We will talk, American politicians,
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:52.960]   American administrations, we will say a lot of things.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.360]   We will promise a lot of ideological,
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.460]   pro-democracy, rah-rah statements.
[00:36:58.460 --> 00:36:59.840]   We will say it.
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:02.760]   But when it comes down to putting our own people,
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:07.260]   our own economy, our own GDP at risk,
[00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:09.280]   we step away from that fight.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.480]   - America is currently supplying
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.080]   military equipment to Ukraine.
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:13.900]   - Absolutely.
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:15.000]   - And a lot of that military equipment
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.840]   has actually been the thing that turned the tides of war
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.540]   a couple of times already.
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:22.620]   Currently, that's the HIMARS systems.
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:27.720]   So you mentioned sort of Putin can't afford to lose,
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.000]   but winning can look in different ways.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.320]   So you've kind of defined, so on, at this moment,
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.700]   the prediction is that winning looks like
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:41.240]   capturing not just the east, but the south of Ukraine.
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:44.560]   But you could have narratives of winning
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:48.080]   that return back to the, what was it,
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:49.840]   the beginning of this year before the invasion?
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:50.680]   - Correct.
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:53.840]   - That Crimea is still with Russia.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.680]   There's some kind of negotiated thing about Donbass
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.600]   where it still stays with Ukraine, but there's some--
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:00.440]   - Puppet government.
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:01.280]   - Yeah.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.760]   - Just like that's what they have in Georgia right now.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:07.320]   - And that could still be defined through mechanisms.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.360]   - As Russia winning.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.960]   - As Russia winning for Russia,
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.160]   and then for Ukraine as Ukraine winning.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.040]   And for the West as democracy winning,
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.120]   and you kind of negotiate.
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:22.640]   I mean, that seems to be how geopolitics works.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.920]   Everybody can walk away with a win-win story,
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:29.040]   and then the world progresses with the lessons learned.
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.600]   - That's the high likely, that's the most probable outcome.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:35.840]   The most probable outcome is that Ukraine remains,
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:38.840]   in air quotes, a sovereign nation.
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.400]   It's not going to be truly sovereign,
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.600]   because it will become,
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:47.520]   it will have to have new government put in place.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.720]   Zelensky, it's extremely unlikely he will be president,
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:54.040]   because he has gone too far to demonstrate
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.280]   his power over the people,
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:59.360]   and his ability to separate the Ukrainian people
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.440]   from the autocratic power of Russia.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.640]   So he would have to be unseated,
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.440]   whether he goes into exile,
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.400]   or whether he is peacefully left alone,
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.120]   is all gonna be part of the negotiations.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.040]   But the thing to keep in mind also,
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:15.840]   is that a negotiated peace,
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.760]   really just means a negotiated ceasefire.
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.080]   We've seen this happen all over the world.
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.800]   North Korea and South Korea are technically still
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.080]   just a negotiated cease power.
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.880]   What you end up having is,
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:28.560]   Russia will allow Ukraine to call itself Ukraine,
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:29.600]   to operate independently,
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:32.000]   to have their own debt to the United States.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.400]   Russia doesn't want to take on that debt.
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.680]   And then in exchange for that,
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.680]   they will have firmer guidelines
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:41.640]   as to how NATO can engage with Ukraine.
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:43.160]   And then that becomes an example
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.160]   for all the other former Soviet satellite states,
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:48.120]   which are all required economically by Russia,
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.640]   not required economically by the West.
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:53.800]   And then you end up seeing how it just,
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.440]   you can see how the whole thing plays out,
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:59.240]   once you realize that the keystone is Ukraine.
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:02.120]   - There is something about Ukraine,
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:05.520]   the deep support by the Ukrainian people of America,
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.800]   that is in contrast with, for example, Afghanistan,
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:14.080]   that it seems like ideologically,
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:17.160]   Ukraine could be a beacon of freedom
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:20.160]   used in narratives by the United States
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:24.160]   to fight geopolitical wars in that part of the world,
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.080]   that they would be a good partner
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.960]   for this idea of democracy, of freedom,
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.480]   of all the values that America stands for.
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.800]   They're a good partner.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.120]   And so it's valuable,
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:38.760]   if you sort of have a cynical, pragmatic view,
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:41.560]   sort of like Henry Kissinger type of view,
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.960]   it's valuable to have them as a partner,
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:47.440]   so valuable that it makes sense to support them
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.160]   in achieving a negotiated ceasefire
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:52.040]   that's on the side of Ukraine.
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.480]   But because of this particular leader,
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.280]   this particular culture,
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:00.600]   this particular dynamics of how the war unrolled,
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.640]   and things like Twitter,
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.120]   and the way digital communication currently works,
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:08.080]   it just seems like this is a powerful symbol of freedom
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.920]   that's useful for the United States,
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.680]   if we're sort of to take the pragmatic view.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:16.480]   Don't you think it's possible
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:20.520]   that United States supports Ukraine
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.720]   financially, militarily enough
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.280]   for it to get an advantage in this war?
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.360]   - I think they've already gotten advantage in the war.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.840]   The fact that the war is still going on
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.840]   demonstrates the asymmetrical advantage.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.460]   The fact that Russia has stepped up
[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:36.480]   to the negotiating table with them several times,
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:41.240]   without just turning to Chechen,
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:43.200]   I mean, you remember what happened in Chechnya,
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.120]   without turning to Chechnya level,
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:48.600]   just mass blind destruction,
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.040]   which was another Putin war.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:53.200]   To see that those things have happened
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.920]   demonstrates the asymmetric advantage
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.160]   that the West has given.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:01.160]   I think the true way to look at the benefit of Ukraine
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:06.720]   as a shining example of freedom in Europe for the West,
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:09.000]   isn't to understand whether or not they could,
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.640]   they absolutely could.
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:14.960]   It's the question of how valuable is that in Europe?
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.780]   How valuable is Ukraine?
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:19.800]   Which before January, before February,
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.400]   nobody even thought about Ukraine,
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.400]   and the people who did know about Ukraine
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:28.880]   knew that it was a extremely corrupt former Soviet state
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:30.980]   with 20% of its national population
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:32.500]   self-identifying as Russian.
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:35.460]   There's a reason Putin went into Ukraine.
[00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:37.000]   There's a reason he's been promising
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.520]   he would go into Ukraine for the better part of a decade,
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:43.680]   because the circumstances were aligned.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.600]   It was a corrupt country that self-identified
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.480]   as Russian in many ways.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:52.000]   It was supposed to be an easier of multiple marks
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   in terms of the former Soviet satellite states to go after.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.960]   That's all part of the miscalculation
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.920]   that the rest of the world saw too,
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.920]   when we thought it would fall quickly.
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:05.920]   So to think that it could be a shining example of freedom
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:10.320]   is accurate, but is it as shining a star as Germany?
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.960]   Is it as shining a star as the UK?
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.000]   Is it as shining a star as Romania?
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.920]   Is it as shining a star as France?
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:22.440]   It's got a lot of democratic freedom-based countries
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:23.720]   in Europe to compete against
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.840]   to be the shining stellar example.
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:29.960]   And in exchange, on counterpoint to that,
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:33.600]   it has an extreme amount of strategic value to Russia,
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:36.120]   which has no interest in making it a shining star
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.520]   of the example of democracy and freedom.
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:39.400]   - Outside of research,
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:43.120]   in terms of the shininess of the star, I would argue yes.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.200]   If you look at how much it captivated
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.520]   the attention of the world.
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.600]   The attention of the world has made no material difference,
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:50.320]   man, that's what I'm saying.
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:54.540]   - That's your estimation, but are you sure we can't,
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:59.120]   if you can convert that into political influence,
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:03.540]   into money, don't you think attention is money?
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:05.780]   - Attention is money in democracies
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:07.980]   and capitalist countries, yes.
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:09.480]   - Which serves as a counterweight
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.460]   to sort of authoritarian regimes.
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:14.520]   So for Putin, resources matter.
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.560]   For the United States, also resources matter,
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:21.280]   but the attention and the belief of the people also matter
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:24.720]   because that's how you attain and maintain political power.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:27.000]   - So going to that exact example,
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.380]   then I would highlight that our current administration
[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:30.880]   has the lowest approval ratings
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.680]   of any president in history.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:36.800]   So if people were very fond of the war going on in Ukraine,
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.280]   wouldn't that counterbalance some of our upset,
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:42.000]   some of the distent coming from the economy
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.800]   and some of the dissent coming from the great recession
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:48.660]   or the second great, or the great resignation
[00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:50.000]   and whatever's happening with the draw,
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.400]   with the down stock market.
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:52.600]   You would think that people would feel
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:54.640]   like they're sacrificing for something
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:57.960]   if they really believed that Ukraine mattered,
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:00.360]   that they would stand next to the president
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:05.080]   who is so staunchly driving and leading the West
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.840]   against this conflict.
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:09.840]   - Well, I think the opposition to this particular president,
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:12.720]   I personally believe has less to do with the policies
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:17.000]   and more to do with a lot of the other human factors.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.920]   - But again, empirically, this is,
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:23.040]   I look at things through a very empirical lens,
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:26.960]   a very cold fact-based lens.
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.560]   And there are multiple data points that suggest
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.480]   that the American people ideologically sympathize
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.480]   with Ukraine, but they really just want
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.080]   their gas prices to go down.
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:38.240]   They really just want to be able to pay less money
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.040]   at the grocery store for their food.
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:42.880]   And they most definitely don't want their sons and daughters
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.300]   to die in exchange for Ukrainian freedom.
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.960]   - It does hurt me to see the politicization
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:49.040]   of this war as well.
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:53.960]   I think that it has, that's maybe has to do
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:56.320]   with the kind of calculation you're referring to,
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.760]   but it seems like it doesn't.
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:00.720]   It seems like there's a cynical,
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:05.260]   whatever takes attention of the media for the moment,
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:07.160]   the red team chooses one side
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:09.000]   and the blue team chooses another.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.320]   And then I think, correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:17.320]   but I believe the Democrats went into full support
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:20.200]   of Ukraine on the ideological side.
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.200]   And then I guess Republicans are saying,
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.320]   "Why are we wasting money?
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:25.920]   The gas prices are going up."
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:27.720]   That's a very crude kind of analysis,
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:29.820]   but they basically picked whatever argument
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:30.880]   on whatever side.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:33.740]   And now more and more and more,
[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:38.740]   this particular war in Ukraine is becoming a kind of pawn
[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:40.100]   in the game of politics.
[00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:42.740]   That's first the midterm elections,
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:45.100]   then building up towards the presidential elections
[00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:49.980]   and stops being about the philosophical, the social,
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:53.820]   the geopolitical aspects, parameters of this war
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:57.380]   and more about just like whatever the heck captivates Twitter
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:58.940]   and we're gonna use that for politics.
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:02.380]   - You're right in the sense of the fact that it's,
[00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:04.020]   I wouldn't say that the red team and the blue team
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:05.360]   picked opposite sides on this.
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:08.900]   What I would say is that media discovered
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:12.340]   that talking about Ukraine wasn't as profitable
[00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:14.020]   as talking about something else.
[00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:17.620]   People simply, the American people who read media
[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:21.720]   or who watch media, they simply became bored reading
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:23.980]   about news that didn't seem to be changing much.
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:26.580]   And we turned back into wanting to read
[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:27.740]   about our own economy.
[00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:29.380]   And we wanted to hear more about cryptocurrency
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:31.020]   and we wanted to hear more about the Kardashians.
[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:32.460]   And that's what we care about.
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:33.900]   So that's what media writes about.
[00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:37.460]   That's how a capitalist market-driven world works.
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:38.460]   And that's how the United States works.
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:41.160]   That's why in both red papers and blue papers,
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:42.780]   red sources and blue sources,
[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:44.700]   you don't see Ukraine being mentioned very much.
[00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:47.260]   If anything, I would say that your Republicans
[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:49.420]   are probably more in support of what's happening
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:51.380]   in Ukraine right now because we're creating
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:53.740]   new weapons systems, our military is getting stronger,
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:55.000]   we're sending these military,
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   we get to test military systems in combat in Ukraine.
[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:02.980]   That's priceless in the world
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:05.420]   of the military industrial complex.
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:10.100]   Being able to field test, combat test a weapon
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:12.580]   without having to sacrifice your own people
[00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:13.740]   is incredibly valuable.
[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:15.820]   You get all the data, you get all the performance metrics,
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:17.620]   but you don't have to put yourself at risk.
[00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:21.200]   That is one of the major benefits of what we're seeing
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:23.780]   from supporting Ukraine with weapons and with troops.
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:26.640]   The long-term benefit to what will come of this
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:30.880]   for the United States, practically speaking,
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.820]   in the lens of national security,
[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:34.520]   through military readiness,
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:38.640]   through future economic benefits, those are super strong.
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:42.280]   The geopolitical fight is essentially moot
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:45.180]   because Ukraine is not a geopolitical player.
[00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:50.180]   It was not for 70 years, and after this conflict is over,
[00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:51.520]   it will not again.
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:53.320]   Just think about what you were just saying
[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:55.600]   with the American people's attention span
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.400]   to Twitter and whatever's currently going on.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:00.000]   If the Ukraine conflict resolved itself today,
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.520]   in any direction, how many weeks do you think
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:06.320]   before no one talked about Ukraine anymore?
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:07.880]   Do you think we would make it two weeks?
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:09.600]   Do you think we'd make it maybe seven days?
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:11.900]   It would be headline news for one or two days,
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:15.080]   and then we'd be onto something else.
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:17.760]   It's just an unfortunate reality
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:22.020]   of how the world works in a capitalist democracy.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.580]   - Yeah, it just breaks my heart how much,
[00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:30.840]   you know, I know that there's Yemen and Syria,
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:33.720]   - That nobody talks about anymore.
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:35.580]   Still raging conflicts going on.
[00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:38.720]   - It just, it breaks my heart
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:42.280]   how much generational hatred is born.
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:46.840]   I happen to be from, my family is from Ukraine
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:49.580]   and from Russia, and so for me, just personally,
[00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:51.880]   it's a part of the world I care about
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:54.360]   in terms of its history.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:56.960]   Because I speak the language,
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.920]   I can appreciate the beauty of the literature,
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:01.400]   the music, the art, the cultural history
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:04.560]   of the 20th century, through all the dark times,
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:09.000]   through all the hell of the dark sides
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.280]   of authoritarian regimes, the destruction of war,
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.440]   there's still just the beauty that I'm able to appreciate
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:17.680]   that I can't appreciate about China, Brazil,
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:19.680]   other countries because I don't speak their language.
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:20.880]   This one I can appreciate.
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:24.440]   And so in that way, this is personally really painful to me
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:26.880]   to see so much of that history,
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:30.320]   the beauty in that history suffocated by the hatred
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:34.960]   that is born through this kind of geopolitical game
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:39.960]   fought mostly by the politicians, the leaders.
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:41.520]   - People are beautiful,
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:42.800]   and that's what you're talking about.
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:47.180]   People are just, people are beautiful creatures.
[00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:52.180]   Culture and art and science,
[00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:53.700]   these are beautiful, beautiful things
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:55.920]   that come about because of human beings.
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:58.220]   And the thing that gives me hope
[00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:02.620]   is that no matter what conflict the world has seen,
[00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:04.540]   and we've seen some devastating,
[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:07.360]   horrible crimes against humanity already.
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:10.060]   We saw nuclear bombs go off in Japan.
[00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:13.780]   We saw genocide happen in Rwanda.
[00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:16.300]   We've seen horrible things happen.
[00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:18.260]   But people persevere.
[00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:21.420]   Language, culture, arts, science, they all persevere.
[00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:23.600]   They all shine through.
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:25.420]   Some of the most, people don't even realize
[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:27.780]   how gorgeous the architecture and the culture
[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:29.060]   is inside Iran.
[00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:30.160]   People have no idea.
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:35.820]   Chinese people in the rural parts of China
[00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:38.380]   are some of the kindest, most amazing people
[00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:39.580]   you'll ever meet.
[00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:44.580]   And Korean art and Korean dance, Korean drumming,
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:47.340]   I know nobody has ever even heard of Korean drumming.
[00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:50.380]   Korean drumming is this magical, beautiful thing.
[00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:52.220]   And the North, in North Korea,
[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:54.460]   does it better than anybody in the world.
[00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:57.780]   Taekwondo in North Korea is just exceptional to watch.
[00:51:57.780 --> 00:51:59.480]   - In North Korea? - In North Korea.
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:00.320]   Nobody knows these things.
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:02.380]   - How do you know about Taekwondo in North Korea?
[00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:03.380]   I have questions.
[00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:05.500]   That's fascinating.
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:08.180]   That's, people don't think about that,
[00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:09.820]   but the culture, the beauty of the people
[00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:11.740]   still flourishes even in the toughest of places.
[00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:13.700]   - Absolutely, and we always will.
[00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:16.340]   We always will because that is what people do.
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:18.500]   And that is just the truth of it.
[00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:21.140]   And it breaks my heart to see travesties
[00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:23.860]   that people commit against people.
[00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:26.460]   But whether you're looking at a micro level,
[00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:30.100]   like what happens with shootings here in the United States,
[00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:31.900]   or whether you look at a macro level,
[00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:35.020]   like geopolitical power exchanges
[00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:37.520]   and intra and interstate conflicts,
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:40.400]   like what you see in Syria and what you see in Ukraine,
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:42.180]   those are disgusting, terrible things.
[00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:43.860]   War is a terrible thing.
[00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:45.340]   That is a famous quote.
[00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:49.780]   But people will persevere.
[00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:52.040]   People will come through.
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:54.300]   - I hope so.
[00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:55.620]   I hope so.
[00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:58.100]   And I hope we don't do something
[00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:03.300]   that I'll probably also ask you about later on,
[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:08.180]   is things that destroy the possibility of perseverance,
[00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:09.860]   which is things like nuclear war,
[00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:14.300]   things that can do such tremendous damage
[00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:17.060]   that we will never recover.
[00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:21.060]   But yeah, amidst your pragmatic pessimism,
[00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:24.660]   I think both you and I have a kind of
[00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:27.020]   maybe small flame of optimism in there
[00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:30.540]   about the perseverance of the human species in general.
[00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:33.780]   Let me ask you about intelligence agencies
[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:35.240]   outside of the CIA.
[00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:38.500]   Can you illuminate
[00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:43.900]   what is the most powerful intelligence agency in the world?
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:48.720]   The CIA, the FSB, formerly the KGB, the MI6, Mossad.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:52.860]   I've gotten a chance to interact with a lot of Israelis
[00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:54.180]   while in Ukraine.
[00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:55.660]   Just incredible people.
[00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:58.140]   In terms of both training and skill,
[00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:00.100]   just all on every front.
[00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:03.980]   American soldiers too, just American military is incredible.
[00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:07.440]   The competence and skill of the military,
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:10.980]   the United States, Israeli I got to interact,
[00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:12.540]   and Ukrainian as well.
[00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:14.420]   - It's striking. - It's striking, it's beautiful.
[00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:16.860]   I just love people, I love carpenters,
[00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:19.300]   or people that are just extremely good at their job
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:21.400]   and then take pride in their craftsmanship.
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:22.780]   It's beautiful to see.
[00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:24.580]   And I imagine the same kind of thing happens
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:27.260]   inside of intelligence agencies as well
[00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:29.940]   that we don't get to appreciate because of the secrecy.
[00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:31.500]   Same thing with like Lockheed Martin.
[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:34.180]   I interviewed the CTO of Lockheed Martin.
[00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:37.180]   It breaks my heart as a person who loves engineering.
[00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:41.100]   Because of the cover of secrecy,
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:43.300]   we'll never get to know some of the incredible engineering
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:45.820]   that happens inside of Lockheed Martin, Boeing.
[00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:47.020]   - Raytheon. - Yeah.
[00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:50.020]   There's kind of this idea that these are,
[00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:52.300]   people have conspiracy theories
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:54.980]   and they kind of assign evil to these companies
[00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:58.480]   in some part, but I think there's beautiful people
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:00.180]   inside those companies, brilliant people,
[00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:03.260]   and some incredible science and engineering
[00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:04.380]   is happening there.
[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:08.980]   Anyway, that said, the CIA, the FSB, the MI6,
[00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:13.380]   Mossad, China, I know very little about the--
[00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:14.820]   - MSS, Ministry of State Security.
[00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:16.460]   - I don't know how much you know.
[00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:17.940]   (both laughing)
[00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:19.780]   Or just other intelligence agencies.
[00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:21.820]   In India, Pakistan, I've also heard--
[00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:26.820]   - Yeah, RAW is powerful and so is ISS, or ISSI.
[00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:28.660]   - And then, of course, European nations
[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:30.420]   and Germany and France. - France.
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:33.700]   Yeah, so what can you say about the power,
[00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:35.900]   the influence of the different intelligence agencies
[00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:37.640]   within their nation and outside?
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:39.760]   - Yeah, so to answer your question,
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.420]   your original question, which is the most powerful,
[00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:44.760]   I'm gonna have to give you a few different answers.
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:49.260]   So the most powerful intelligence organization in the world
[00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:53.180]   in terms of reach is the Chinese MSS,
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:54.820]   the Ministry of State Security,
[00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:59.820]   because they have created a single, solitary intelligence
[00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:04.220]   service that has global reach and is integrated
[00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:07.500]   with Chinese culture so that essentially,
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.780]   every Chinese person anywhere in the world
[00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:13.100]   is an informant to the MSS, because that's their way
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:16.140]   of serving the middle kingdom, zhongguo,
[00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:18.820]   the central kingdom, the Chinese word for China.
[00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:23.460]   So they're the strongest, the most powerful
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:24.860]   intelligence service in terms of reach.
[00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:27.180]   Most assets, most informants, most intelligence.
[00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:29.340]   - So it's deeply integrated with the citizenry.
[00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:30.860]   - Correct, with their culture.
[00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:33.020]   You know what a Chinese person who lives in Syria
[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:34.380]   thinks of themself as?
[00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:35.540]   A Chinese person.
[00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:38.180]   Do you know what a Chinese person, a Chinese national
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:40.180]   living in the United States thinks of themself as?
[00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:41.660]   A Chinese person, right?
[00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:44.500]   Americans living abroad often think of ourselves
[00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:47.980]   as expats, expatriates, living on the local economy,
[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:50.020]   embracing the local culture.
[00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:52.060]   That is not how Chinese people view traveling
[00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:52.900]   around the world.
[00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:54.500]   - And by the way, if I may mention,
[00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:59.500]   I believe the way Masada operates is similar kind of thing
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:04.460]   because people from Israel living abroad
[00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:07.740]   still think of themselves as Jewish and Israeli.
[00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:08.940]   - First.
[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:11.740]   - First, so that allows you to integrate the--
[00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:14.500]   - Culture and the faith-based aspects, exactly right.
[00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:17.100]   - But the number of people in Israel is much, much smaller
[00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:18.580]   than the number of people in China.
[00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:21.300]   - So when it comes to reach, China wins that game.
[00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:23.940]   When it comes to professional capability,
[00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:28.940]   it's the CIA by far because budget-wise, capability-wise,
[00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:31.500]   weapon system-wise, modern technology-wise,
[00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:34.100]   CIA is the leader around the world,
[00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:36.380]   which is why every other intelligence organization
[00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:38.940]   out there wants to partner with CIA.
[00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:40.860]   They want to learn from CIA.
[00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:42.100]   They want to train with CIA.
[00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:45.340]   They want to partner on counter-narcotics
[00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:47.980]   and counter-drug and counter-terrorism and counter-Uyghur,
[00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:50.380]   you name it, people want to partner with CIA.
[00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:52.820]   So CIA is the most powerful in terms of capability
[00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:57.460]   and wealth, and then you've got the idea,
[00:57:57.460 --> 00:58:01.620]   you've got tech, so tech alone,
[00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:05.980]   meaning corporate espionage, economic espionage,
[00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:09.060]   nothing beats DGSE in France.
[00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:10.700]   They're the top.
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:12.980]   They've got a massive budget that almost goes exclusively
[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:14.780]   to stealing foreign secrets.
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:16.780]   They're the biggest threat to the United States,
[00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:19.620]   even above Russia and above China.
[00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:22.220]   DGSE in France is a massively powerful
[00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:25.500]   intelligence organization, but they're so exclusively
[00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:29.660]   focused on a handful of types of intelligence collection
[00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:31.940]   that nobody even really thinks that they exist.
[00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:35.680]   And then in terms of just terrifying violence,
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:36.740]   you have Mossad.
[00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:38.340]   Mossad will do anything.
[00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:42.180]   Mossad has no qualms doing what it takes
[00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:45.460]   to ensure the survival of every Israeli citizen
[00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:46.500]   around the world.
[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:49.660]   Most other countries will stop at some point,
[00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:51.460]   but Mossad doesn't do that.
[00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:54.820]   - So it's the lines you're willing to cross.
[00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:57.420]   - And the reasons that you're willing to cross them.
[00:58:57.420 --> 00:59:02.740]   The CIA will let an American stay in jail in Russia
[00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:06.180]   unlawfully and seek a diplomatic solution.
[00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:07.900]   I mean, the United States has let people,
[00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:10.620]   there are two gentlemen from the 1950s
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:12.940]   who were imprisoned in China for 20 years
[00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:16.700]   waiting for diplomatic solutions to their release.
[00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:21.700]   So we do not kill to save a citizen, but Mossad will.
[00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:28.380]   - And then they'll not just kill,
[00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:31.660]   they'll do large scale infiltration.
[00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:32.980]   - These are amazing things.
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:37.540]   They spare no expense because it's a demonstration
[00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:38.380]   to their own people.
[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:40.620]   Again, going back to the whole idea of influence.
[00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:45.620]   Every intelligence operation that sees the light of day
[00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:47.860]   has two purposes.
[00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:51.380]   The first purpose is the intelligence operation.
[00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:53.540]   But if it was just the intelligence operation,
[00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:54.940]   it would stay secret forever.
[00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:56.780]   The second purpose of every successful
[00:59:56.780 --> 00:59:59.420]   intelligence operation, when they become public,
[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:02.180]   is to send a signal to the world.
[01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:05.420]   If you work against us, we will do this to you.
[01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:09.100]   If you work for us, we will take care of you in this way.
[01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:11.820]   It's a massive information campaign.
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:15.420]   - Do you think in that way, CIA is not doing a good job?
[01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:20.420]   Because there's the FSB, perhaps much less so, Jerry,
[01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:25.740]   but the KGB did this well, which is to send a signal,
[01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:31.260]   like basically communicate that this is a terrifying
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:33.500]   organization with a lot of power.
[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.740]   And so Mossad is doing a good job of that.
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:36.820]   - Correct.
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:39.740]   - The psychological information warfare.
[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:44.740]   And it seems like the CIA also has a lot of power
[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:47.940]   has a lot of kind of myths about it,
[01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:49.420]   conspiracy theories about it,
[01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:52.500]   but much less so than the other agencies.
[01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:54.900]   - CIA does a good job of playing to the mythos.
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:58.820]   So when General Petraeus used to be the director of CIA,
[01:00:58.820 --> 01:00:59.660]   2000--
[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:00.780]   - And your workout partner.
[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:01.620]   - And my workout partner.
[01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:02.460]   - I read about this.
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:05.220]   - So I loved and hated those workouts with Petraeus
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:07.900]   because he is a physical beast.
[01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:11.700]   He's a strong, fit, at the time, 60-something year old man.
[01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:12.940]   - Let me take a tangent on that
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:14.140]   'cause he's coming on this podcast.
[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:15.380]   - Oh, excellent, man.
[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:20.380]   - So can you say what you learned from the man
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:25.220]   in terms of, or like what you think is interesting
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:28.380]   and powerful and inspiring about the way he sees the world,
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:31.820]   or maybe what you learned in terms of how to get strong
[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:34.020]   in the gym or anything about life.
[01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:34.860]   - Two things right away.
[01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:36.180]   And one of them I was gonna share with you anyway,
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:37.500]   so I'm glad that you asked the question.
[01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:42.260]   So the first is that on our runs,
[01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:43.380]   and man, he runs fast,
[01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:45.700]   and we would go for six-mile runs through Bangkok.
[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:50.300]   And he talked openly about, I asked him,
[01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:55.140]   how do you keep this mystery,
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:02:00.140]   this epic mythology about your fitness and your strength,
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:04.760]   how do you keep all of this alive with the troops?
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.620]   And he had this amazing answer,
[01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:08.700]   and he was like, "I don't talk about it."
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:13.380]   Myths are born not from somebody orchestrating the myth,
[01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:16.980]   but from the source of the myth simply being secretive.
[01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:18.620]   So he's like, "I don't talk about it.
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:19.820]   "I've never talked about it.
[01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:21.140]   "I've never exacerbated it.
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:23.980]   "I just do what I do, and I let the troops talk."
[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:25.440]   And he's like, "When it's in favor,
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:27.480]   "when it goes in favor of discipline
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.740]   "and loyalty and commitment, I let it run.
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:33.320]   "If it starts getting destructive or damaging,
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:37.840]   "then I have my leadership team step in to fix it.
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.380]   "But when it comes to the mythos,
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:42.920]   "the myth of him being a super-powered soldier,
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:44.460]   "that's what he wants every soldier to be."
[01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:45.740]   So he lets it run.
[01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:48.860]   And it was so enlightening when he told me,
[01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:51.360]   "When there's a myth that benefits you, you just let it go.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:54.180]   "You let it happen because it gets you further
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:55.120]   "without you doing any work.
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.100]   "It costs no investment for you."
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:58.500]   - So the catalyst of the virality of the myth
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.500]   is just being mysterious.
[01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:02.020]   - And that's what CIA does well,
[01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:03.260]   to go back to your first question.
[01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:04.700]   What does CIA do?
[01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:06.540]   They don't answer any questions.
[01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:08.280]   They don't say anything.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:11.020]   And wherever the myth goes, the myth goes,
[01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:13.080]   whether it's that they sold drugs
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:14.860]   or used child prostitutes or whatever else,
[01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:17.120]   wherever the myth goes, they let it go.
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:18.840]   Because at the end of the day,
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.200]   everybody sits back and says,
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.240]   "Wow, I really just don't know."
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:23.840]   Now, the second thing that I learned from Petraeus,
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:27.160]   and I really am a big fan of Petraeus.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.120]   I know he made personal mistakes.
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:30.600]   You don't get to be that powerful
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:32.200]   without making personal mistakes.
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:33.440]   But when I worked out with him,
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:38.440]   the one thing that my commanding officer
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.920]   told me not to ask about,
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:43.320]   he was like, "Never ask the general about his family."
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.240]   I'm a family guy.
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:48.160]   So as soon as I met General Petraeus,
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:49.840]   one of the first things I asked him was,
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.660]   "Hey, what was it like raising a family
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:55.220]   "and being the commander of forces in the Middle East?
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:57.080]   "Like you weren't with your family very much."
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:59.080]   And the thing I love about the guy,
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:00.420]   he didn't bite off my head.
[01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:01.260]   He didn't snap at me.
[01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:02.340]   He didn't do anything.
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:04.780]   He openly admitted that he regretted
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:06.660]   some of the decisions that he made
[01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:11.160]   because he had to sacrifice his family to get there.
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:13.600]   Relationships with his children,
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.580]   absentee father, missing birthdays,
[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:19.160]   missing, we all say, we all say how sad it is
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.080]   to miss birthdays and miss anniversaries, yada, yada, yada.
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.080]   Everybody knows what that feels like.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.960]   Even business people know what that feels like.
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:26.040]   The actual pain that we're talking about
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:28.320]   is when you're not there to handle
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:29.960]   your 13-year-old's questions
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:31.640]   when a boy breaks up with her,
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:34.540]   or when you're not there to handle the bloody lip
[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:35.960]   that your nine-year-old comes back with
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.960]   from their first encounter with a bully.
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.800]   Those are the truly heartbreaking moments
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:42.400]   that a parent lives and dies by.
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:45.640]   He missed almost all of those
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:48.280]   because he was fighting a war that we forgot
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:50.240]   and we gave up on 20 years later, right?
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:53.300]   He's so honest about that.
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:57.040]   And it was really inspiring to me
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:59.180]   to be told not to ask that question.
[01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:02.940]   And when I broke that guidance, he didn't reprimand me.
[01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:05.580]   He just, he was authentic.
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:07.460]   And it was absolutely one of the big decisions
[01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:10.580]   that helped me leave CIA on my own in 2014.
[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:15.100]   - And he was honest on the sacrifice you make.
[01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:17.780]   - The same man, the same man who just taught me a lesson
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:21.460]   about letting a myth live,
[01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:24.420]   that same guy was willing to be so authentic
[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:27.940]   about this personal mistake.
[01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:30.820]   - I like complicated people like that.
[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:34.420]   So what did you make of that calculation
[01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:36.540]   of family versus job?
[01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:40.700]   You've given a lot of your life and passion
[01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:42.700]   to the CIA, to that work.
[01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:47.700]   You've spoken positively about that world,
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:49.040]   the good it does.
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:53.940]   And yet you're also a family man and you value that.
[01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:55.180]   What's that calculation like?
[01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:56.020]   What's that trade-off like for you?
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:57.860]   - I mean, for me, the calculation is very clear.
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:05:58.780]   It's family.
[01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:03.260]   I left CIA because I chose my family.
[01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:06.580]   And when my son was born, my wife and I found out
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:08.380]   that we were pregnant while we were still on mission.
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:09.280]   We were a tandem couple.
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:12.660]   My wife is also a former CIA officer, undercover like me.
[01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:14.940]   We were operating together overseas.
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:18.780]   We got the positive pregnancy test, like so many people do.
[01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:21.780]   And she cried.
[01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:23.300]   My wife was a badass.
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:26.380]   I was just, I was like the accidental spy,
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:28.340]   but my wife was really good at what she does.
[01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:32.300]   And she cried and she was like, what do we do now?
[01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:34.900]   It's what we've always wanted, a child,
[01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:37.860]   but we're in this thing right now.
[01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:41.260]   There's no space for a child.
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:44.940]   So long story short, we had our baby.
[01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:48.060]   We, CIA brought us back to have the baby.
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:50.580]   And when we started having the conversations about,
[01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:52.160]   hey, what do we do next?
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:54.420]   'Cause we're not the type of people to wanna just
[01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:57.580]   sit around and be domestic.
[01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:58.780]   What do we do next?
[01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:00.940]   But keep in mind, we have a child now.
[01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:02.620]   So here's some of our suggestions.
[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:04.140]   We could do this and we can do that.
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:06.340]   Let us get our child to a place where we can put him
[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:08.320]   into an international school or we can get him
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:11.720]   into some sort of program where we have,
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:15.820]   we can both operate together again during the day.
[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:19.100]   But CIA just had no, they had no patience
[01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:19.940]   for that conversation.
[01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:23.900]   There was no, family is not their priority.
[01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:26.140]   So the fact that we were a tandem couple,
[01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:29.100]   two officers, two operators trying to have a baby
[01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:30.660]   was irrelevant to them.
[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:32.740]   So when they didn't play with us,
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:37.740]   when they did nothing to help us prioritize parenthood
[01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:41.500]   as part of our overall experience,
[01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:43.140]   that's when we knew that they never would.
[01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:46.540]   And what good is it to commit yourself to a career
[01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:48.500]   if the career is always going to challenge the thing
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:50.200]   that you value most?
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:53.620]   And that was the calculation that we made to leave CIA.
[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:55.860]   Not everybody makes that calculation.
[01:07:55.860 --> 01:08:00.380]   And a big part of why I am so vocal about my time in CIA
[01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:04.140]   is because I am immensely appreciative
[01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:09.140]   of the men and women who to this day have failed marriages
[01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:12.140]   and poor relationships with their children
[01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:14.260]   because they chose national security.
[01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:17.420]   They chose protecting America over their own family.
[01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:21.780]   And they've done it even though it's made them
[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:23.620]   abuse alcohol and abuse substances
[01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:25.420]   and they've gotten themselves,
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:29.180]   they've got permanent diseases and issues
[01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:31.460]   from living and working abroad.
[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:35.460]   It's just insane the sacrifice that officers make
[01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:37.600]   to keep America free.
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:40.260]   And I'm just not one of those people, I chose family.
[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:44.380]   - You said that your wife misses it.
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:45.220]   Do you miss it?
[01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:46.060]   - We both miss it.
[01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:47.640]   We miss it for different reasons.
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:49.460]   We miss it for similar reasons, I guess,
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:50.900]   but we miss it in different ways.
[01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:55.300]   The people, the people at CIA are just amazing.
[01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:58.180]   They're people that, they're everyday people
[01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:00.460]   like the guy in the gown next door,
[01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:04.920]   but so smart and so dedicated and so courageous
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:06.820]   about what they do and how they do it.
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:08.940]   I mean, the sacrifices they make are massive,
[01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:10.700]   more massive than the sacrifices I made.
[01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:12.580]   So I was always inspired and impressed
[01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:13.660]   by the people around me.
[01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:16.600]   So both my wife and I absolutely miss the people.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:20.340]   My wife misses the work because you know everything.
[01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:25.220]   When you're inside, it's all, I mean, we had top secret.
[01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:27.140]   We had TSSCI clearances at the time.
[01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:30.460]   I had a Cat 6, Cat 12, which makes me nuclear cleared.
[01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:33.420]   My wife had other privy clearances that allowed her
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:37.300]   to look into areas that were specialized.
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:40.900]   But there was not, there wasn't a headline that went out
[01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:44.220]   that we couldn't fact check with a click of a few buttons.
[01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:46.260]   And she misses that 'cause she loved that kind of--
[01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:49.860]   - And now you're just one of us living in the,
[01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:51.900]   you know, the cloud of mystery.
[01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:53.420]   - Exactly. - Not really knowing anything
[01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:54.340]   about what's going on.
[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:57.140]   - Exactly, but for me, I've always been the person
[01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:59.020]   that likes operating.
[01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:00.980]   And you know what you still get to do when you leave CIA?
[01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:02.420]   You still get to operate.
[01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:04.300]   Operating is just working with people.
[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:06.140]   It's understanding how people think,
[01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:08.620]   predicting their actions, driving their direction
[01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:12.020]   of their thoughts, persuading them, winning negotiations.
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:14.060]   Like it's, you still get to do that.
[01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:15.460]   You do that every day.
[01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:18.540]   - And you can apply that in all kinds of domains.
[01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:21.020]   Well, let me ask you on that.
[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:24.300]   You were a covert CIA intelligence officer
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:25.980]   for several years.
[01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:28.660]   Maybe, can you tell me the story of how it all began?
[01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:30.700]   How, were you recruited?
[01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:32.580]   And what did the job entail,
[01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:34.260]   to the degree you can speak about it?
[01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:36.140]   - Feel free to direct me if I'm getting too boring
[01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:38.140]   or if the-- - No, every aspect
[01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:40.820]   of this is super exciting. (laughing)
[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:45.820]   - So I was leaving the United States Air Force in 2007.
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:51.260]   I was a lieutenant getting ready to pin on captain.
[01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:53.060]   My five years was up.
[01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:56.300]   And I was a very bad fit for the US Air Force.
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:58.940]   I was an Air Force Academy graduate, not by choice,
[01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:01.860]   but by lack of opportunity, lack of options otherwise.
[01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:03.780]   So I forced myself through the Academy,
[01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:07.220]   barely graduated with a 2.4 GPA.
[01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:09.460]   And then went on, the Air Force taught me how to fly.
[01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:12.020]   And then the Air Force taught me about nuclear weapons.
[01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:16.380]   And I ended up as a nuclear missile commander
[01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:20.860]   in Montana, and I chose to leave the Air Force
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:23.260]   because I didn't like shaving my face.
[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:24.300]   I didn't like having short hair,
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:26.300]   and I most definitely didn't like shining my shoes.
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:28.220]   And I did not wanna be one of the people
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:29.380]   in charge of nuclear weapons.
[01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:31.060]   So when I found myself as a person in charge
[01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:33.020]   of 200 nuclear weapons,
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:34.660]   I knew that I was going down the wrong road.
[01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:36.220]   - I have questions about this.
[01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:38.460]   And more importantly, I have questions about your hair.
[01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:40.700]   So you had short hair at the time?
[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:41.520]   - Yeah, you have to.
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:43.020]   Military regulations, you can't have hair
[01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:44.020]   longer than one inch.
[01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:44.860]   - Okay.
[01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:48.460]   - So is this the beautiful hair you have now
[01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:52.220]   that came to be in the CIA or after?
[01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:55.460]   - This, so I discovered I had messy hair in CIA
[01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:58.620]   'cause I used to go mouj, we called it mouj.
[01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:00.420]   I used to go Mujahideen style,
[01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:03.380]   big burly beard and crazy wacky hair.
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:05.660]   Because an ambiguously brown guy
[01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:07.780]   with a big beard and long hair
[01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:09.540]   can go anywhere in the world
[01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:12.300]   without anyone even noticing him.
[01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:14.660]   They either think that he's a janitor
[01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:18.940]   or they think that he's like some forgotten part of history
[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:21.660]   but nobody ever thinks that that guy is a spy.
[01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:23.660]   So it was the perfect, for me,
[01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:27.740]   it was one of my favorite disguises.
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:29.220]   It's what's known as a level two disguise.
[01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:30.580]   One of my favorite disguises to Don
[01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:33.980]   was just dilapidated brown guy.
[01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:37.740]   - Can you actually, we'll just take a million tangents.
[01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:39.620]   What's a level two disguise?
[01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:43.020]   What are the different levels of disguise?
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:44.220]   What are the disguises?
[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:46.740]   - Yeah, there's three levels of disguise by and large.
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:48.540]   Level one is what we also know,
[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:49.940]   what we also call light disguise.
[01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:52.980]   So that's essentially, you put on sunglasses
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:55.140]   and a ball cap and that's a disguise.
[01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:57.420]   You look different than you normally look.
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:59.740]   So it's just different enough
[01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:01.420]   that someone who's never seen you before,
[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:03.060]   someone who literally has to see you
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:05.180]   just from a picture on the internet,
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:06.540]   they may not recognize you.
[01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:08.140]   It's why you see celebrities walk around
[01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:11.980]   with ball caps and oversized jackets and baseball hats
[01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:12.940]   'cause they just need to not look
[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:13.940]   like they look in the tabloid
[01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:16.380]   or not look like they look in TV.
[01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:17.980]   That's level one.
[01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:19.860]   Let me jump from level one to level three.
[01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:22.300]   Level three is all of your prosthetics,
[01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:24.780]   all the stuff you see in "Mission Impossible,"
[01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:28.740]   your fake ears, your fake faces, your fat suits,
[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:32.420]   your stilts inside your feet, all that's level three.
[01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:35.900]   Whenever they make any kind of prosthetic disguise,
[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:37.100]   that's a level three disguise
[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:41.340]   because prosthetics are very damning
[01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:43.100]   if you are caught with a prosthetic.
[01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:45.340]   If you're caught wearing a Sutton,
[01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:47.260]   wearing a baseball hat and sunglasses,
[01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:49.500]   nobody's gonna say you're a spy.
[01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:54.140]   But when you're caught with a custom-made nose prosthetic
[01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:55.540]   that changes the way your face looks
[01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:57.700]   or when someone pops out a fake jaw
[01:13:57.700 --> 01:13:59.260]   and they see that your top teeth don't look
[01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:01.900]   like they did in this prosthetic,
[01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:04.700]   then all of a sudden you've got some very difficult questions
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:06.700]   to ask or to answer.
[01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:08.480]   So level three is extremely dangerous.
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:09.540]   Level one is not dangerous.
[01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:12.380]   Level two is long-term disguise.
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:14.220]   Level two is all the things that you can do
[01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:16.180]   to permanently change the way you look
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:17.740]   for a long period of time
[01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:20.420]   so that whether you're aggressed in the street
[01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:23.540]   or whether someone breaks into your hotel room or whatever,
[01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:24.720]   it's real.
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:27.300]   So maybe you get a tattoo.
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:28.860]   Maybe you cut your hair short.
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:29.780]   Maybe you grow your hair long.
[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:31.120]   Maybe you go bald.
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:32.540]   Maybe you start wearing glasses.
[01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:34.100]   Well, glasses are technically a prosthetic,
[01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:38.240]   but if you have teeth pulled,
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:42.220]   if you gain 20 pounds, really gain 20 pounds,
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:44.300]   or lose 15 pounds, whatever you might do,
[01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:45.580]   all of that's considered level two.
[01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:48.420]   It's designed for a long-term mission
[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:52.060]   so that people believe you are who you say you are
[01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:53.100]   in that disguise.
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:55.660]   - A lot of that is physical characteristics.
[01:14:55.660 --> 01:15:00.660]   What about what actors do, which is the--
[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:02.100]   - Method acting.
[01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:03.020]   - Yeah, the method acting,
[01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:07.160]   sort of developing a backstory in your own mind,
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:11.460]   and then you start pretending
[01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:15.900]   that you host a podcast and teach at a university
[01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:17.980]   and then do research and so on
[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:19.980]   just so that people can believe
[01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:22.860]   that you're not actually an agent.
[01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:24.700]   Is that part of the disguise levels or no?
[01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:28.180]   - So yes, disguise has to do with physical character traits.
[01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:29.580]   That's what a disguise is.
[01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:32.260]   What you're talking about is known as a cover legend
[01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:33.480]   when you go undercover,
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:35.620]   what you claim to be, who you claim to be.
[01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:38.160]   That's called your legend, your cover legend.
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:40.580]   Every disguise would theoretically have
[01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:42.380]   its own cover legend.
[01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:43.660]   Even if it's just to describe
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:45.300]   why you're wearing what you're wearing,
[01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:47.100]   it's all a cover.
[01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:50.460]   So the method acting, this is a fantastic point
[01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:52.780]   that I don't get to make very often, so I'm glad you asked.
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:55.300]   The difference between CIA officers in the field
[01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:57.420]   and method actors is that method actors
[01:15:57.420 --> 01:15:59.940]   try to become the character.
[01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:04.280]   They try to shed all vestiges of who they really are
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:05.900]   and become the character,
[01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:07.460]   and that's part of what makes them so amazing,
[01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:12.220]   but it's also part of what makes them mentally unstable
[01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:13.140]   over long periods of time.
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:15.740]   It's part of what feeds their depression, their anxiety,
[01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:16.580]   their personal issues,
[01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:18.940]   because they lose sight of who they really are.
[01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:20.740]   Field officers don't get that luxury.
[01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:24.420]   We have to always, always remember
[01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:26.900]   we are a covert CIA intelligence officer
[01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:28.580]   collecting secrets in the field.
[01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:29.860]   We have to remember that.
[01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:32.380]   So we're taught a very specific skill
[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:37.380]   to compartmentalize our true self separately
[01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:42.740]   but make that true self the true identity.
[01:16:42.740 --> 01:16:44.540]   So then we can still live and act
[01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:47.820]   and effectively carry out our cover legend
[01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:49.860]   without ever losing sight,
[01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:51.940]   without ever losing that compass true north
[01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:53.540]   of who we actually are.
[01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:55.100]   And then we can compartmentalize
[01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:56.820]   and secure all the information that we need,
[01:16:56.820 --> 01:17:00.380]   retain it, remember it, but then return to our true self
[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:03.140]   when we get back to a position of safety.
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:04.380]   - Is it possible to do that?
[01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:09.220]   So I just have kind of anecdotal evidence for myself.
[01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:12.260]   I really try to be the exact same person in all conditions,
[01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:13.820]   which makes it very easy.
[01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:17.180]   Like if you're not lying,
[01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:21.300]   it makes it very easy to, first of all, to exist,
[01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:23.900]   but also to communicate a kind of authenticity
[01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:26.460]   and a genuineness, which I think is really important.
[01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:29.180]   Like trust and integrity around trust
[01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:30.420]   is extremely important to me.
[01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:32.380]   It's the thing that opens doors
[01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:34.780]   and maintains relationships.
[01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:39.380]   And I tend to think like when I was in Ukraine,
[01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:42.820]   so many doors just opened to the very sort
[01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:46.100]   of high security areas and everywhere else too.
[01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:48.940]   Like I've just interacted with some incredible people
[01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:52.100]   without any kind of concerns, you know,
[01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:53.020]   who's this guy?
[01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:54.180]   Is he gonna spread it?
[01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:55.180]   You know, all that kind of stuff.
[01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:58.180]   And I tend to believe that you're able
[01:17:58.180 --> 01:18:00.860]   to communicate a trustworthiness somehow
[01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:05.060]   if you just are who you are.
[01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:07.180]   And I think, I suppose method actors
[01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:09.300]   are trying to achieve that by becoming something
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:14.300]   and they can, I just feel like there is very subtle cues
[01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:16.900]   that are extremely difficult to fake.
[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:20.580]   Like you really have to become that person,
[01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:22.060]   be that person.
[01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:25.060]   But you're saying as a CIA agent,
[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:27.740]   you have to remember that you are there
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:29.100]   to collect information.
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:31.100]   Do you think that gives you away?
[01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:33.940]   - So one of the flaws in your argument
[01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:38.220]   is that you keep referring to how you feel.
[01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:40.420]   I feel this, I feel that, I feel like this,
[01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:41.580]   I feel like that.
[01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:45.860]   That feeling is a predictable character trait
[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:46.740]   of all human beings.
[01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:49.060]   It's a pink matter, we call it pink matter.
[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:50.900]   It's a cognitive trait.
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:55.020]   You are not alone in trusting your feelings.
[01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:56.780]   All people trust their feelings.
[01:18:56.780 --> 01:18:59.620]   But because what CIA teaches us
[01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:03.340]   is how to systematically create artificial relationships
[01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:06.380]   where we're the one in control of the source
[01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:08.460]   that is giving us intelligence.
[01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:11.660]   And the core element to being able to control
[01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:13.020]   a relationship is understanding
[01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:14.940]   the pink matter truth of feelings.
[01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:19.900]   What all people feel becomes their point of view
[01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:21.460]   on what reality is.
[01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:23.380]   So when you understand and you learn how to manipulate
[01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:25.820]   what people feel, then you can essentially
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:28.340]   direct them to feel any way you want them to feel.
[01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:30.820]   So if you want them to feel like they can trust you,
[01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:32.140]   you can make them feel that way.
[01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:34.220]   If you want them to feel like you're a good guy
[01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:36.420]   or a bad guy, if you want them to feel like
[01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:37.460]   they should give you secrets
[01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:39.100]   even though their government tells them not to,
[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:40.020]   you can do that.
[01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:43.220]   There are men who make women feel like they love them
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:45.180]   and just so that the woman will sleep with them.
[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:47.460]   There are women who make men feel like they love them
[01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:49.620]   just so the men will give them their money.
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:52.860]   Manipulation is a core behavioral trait
[01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:54.780]   of all the human species
[01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:56.780]   because we all understand to some level
[01:19:56.780 --> 01:19:58.180]   how powerful feelings are,
[01:19:58.180 --> 01:19:59.540]   but feelings are not the same thing
[01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:01.220]   as logical, rational thought.
[01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:03.380]   They're two different sides of the brain.
[01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:06.260]   What CIA teaches us how to do is systematically
[01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:10.100]   tap into the right side, emotional side of the brain
[01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:13.100]   so that we can quickly get past
[01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:14.260]   all of the stuff you were just saying,
[01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:16.700]   all of the, well, don't you have to be convincing
[01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:18.140]   and don't you have to really know your story
[01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:20.380]   and don't you have to be able to defend it?
[01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:21.620]   Don't you have to have authenticity
[01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:25.820]   and don't you have to have genuine feelings?
[01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:27.620]   Yes, all of those things are true
[01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:29.820]   if you're having a genuine relationship,
[01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:31.300]   but in an artificial relationship,
[01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:32.780]   there's ways to bypass all of that
[01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:33.660]   and get right to the heart
[01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:35.380]   of making someone feel comfortable and safe.
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:37.660]   - I guess the question I'm asking
[01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:40.660]   and the thing I was implying
[01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:42.500]   is that creating an artificial relationship
[01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:45.500]   is an extremely difficult skill
[01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:47.980]   to accomplish the level,
[01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:51.820]   like how good I am at being me
[01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:56.340]   and creating a feeling in another person that I create.
[01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:58.260]   For you to do that artificially,
[01:20:58.260 --> 01:21:00.420]   that's gotta be, you gotta be,
[01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:03.700]   my sense is you gotta be really damn good at that.
[01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:05.820]   I would venture to say,
[01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:08.980]   I mean, I don't know how to measure
[01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:10.100]   how difficult the thing is,
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:13.980]   but especially when you're communicating with people
[01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:18.620]   whose job depends on forming trusting relationships,
[01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:20.220]   they're gonna smell bullshit.
[01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:26.620]   And to get past that bullshit detector is tough.
[01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:28.380]   It's a tough skill.
[01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:29.220]   - Well, it's interesting.
[01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:30.980]   So I would say that--
[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:32.700]   - Or maybe I'm wrong actually on that.
[01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:34.620]   - I would say that once you understand the system,
[01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:35.540]   it's not that hard.
[01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:37.020]   It makes a lot of sense.
[01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:39.580]   But I would also say that to your exact point,
[01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:42.180]   you are right that people smell bullshit.
[01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:43.740]   People smell bullshit.
[01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:45.100]   But here's the thing.
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:47.980]   If you come in smelling like goat shit,
[01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:49.900]   you still smell like shit,
[01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:51.820]   but you don't smell like bullshit.
[01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:53.780]   So they don't count you out right away.
[01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:57.060]   And if you come in smelling like rotten tomatoes,
[01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:59.260]   or if you come in smelling like lavender,
[01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:00.540]   or if you come in smelling like vanilla,
[01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:02.420]   or if you come in without any smell at all,
[01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:05.660]   all that matters is that you don't smell like bullshit.
[01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:10.500]   Here's the thing that's one of the secret sauces of CIA.
[01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:12.460]   When you look and act like a spy,
[01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:14.180]   people think you're a spy.
[01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:16.060]   If you look and act in any other way,
[01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:18.260]   you know what they never ever think you are?
[01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:21.060]   A spy.
[01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:22.180]   They might think you're an idiot.
[01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:24.900]   They might think you're trailer trash.
[01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:27.700]   They might think that you're a migrant worker,
[01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:30.780]   but they never think you're a spy.
[01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:35.500]   And that lesson in everyday life is immensely powerful.
[01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:39.660]   If you're trying to take your boss's job,
[01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:41.700]   as long as you don't ever look like the employee
[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:43.300]   who's trying to take the boss's job,
[01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:44.860]   the boss is focused on all the employees
[01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:46.660]   who are trying to take his job.
[01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:48.980]   Everybody's prioritizing whether they know it or not.
[01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:51.820]   The goal is to just not be the one that they're targeting.
[01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:54.100]   Target them without them knowing you're targeting them.
[01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:56.380]   - So people just, when they meet you,
[01:22:56.380 --> 01:22:58.180]   they put you in a bin.
[01:22:58.180 --> 01:23:01.020]   And if you want to avoid being put in a particular bin,
[01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:04.060]   just don't act like the person that would be,
[01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:06.180]   just show some kind of characteristics
[01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:07.420]   that bin you in some other way.
[01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:08.260]   - Exactly right.
[01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:09.540]   You have to be in a bin.
[01:23:09.540 --> 01:23:11.020]   Just choose the bin.
[01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:11.860]   (Lex laughing)
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:12.700]   - All right.
[01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:16.860]   So you knowing these methods,
[01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:19.140]   when you talk to people, especially in civilian life,
[01:23:19.140 --> 01:23:22.740]   how do you know who's lying to you and not?
[01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:24.640]   - That gets to be more
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:26.620]   into the trained skill side of things.
[01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:29.940]   There's body cues, there's micro expressions.
[01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:31.500]   I'm not a big fan of,
[01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:33.940]   I don't believe that micro expressions alone do anything.
[01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:35.660]   I also don't believe that micro expressions
[01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:37.820]   without an effective baseline do anything.
[01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:40.180]   So don't for a second think that I'm,
[01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:41.620]   all the people out there pitching
[01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:43.080]   that you can tell if someone's lying to you
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:46.100]   just by looking at their face, it's all baloney.
[01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:47.660]   In my world, that's baloney.
[01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:49.980]   - Like the way you move your eyes or something like that.
[01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:51.820]   - Without knowing a baseline, without knowing--
[01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:52.660]   - For that individual.
[01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:54.420]   - For that individual, then you actually don't know.
[01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:56.520]   And an individual's baseline is based on education,
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:58.360]   culture, life experience, you name it, right?
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:00.160]   So this is huge.
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:03.460]   But when you combine facial expressions
[01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:06.900]   with body movements, body language, nonverbal cues,
[01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:10.500]   and you add on top of that effective elicitation techniques
[01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:12.060]   that you are in control of,
[01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:15.260]   now you have a more robust platform
[01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:16.460]   to tell if someone's lying to you.
[01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:21.460]   - So there's a set of interrogation trajectories
[01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:26.140]   you can go down that can help you figure out a person.
[01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:30.340]   - Technically, they're interview concepts.
[01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:32.180]   Correct, because an interrogation,
[01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:33.620]   an interrogation is something very different
[01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:34.460]   than an interview.
[01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:36.100]   In the world of professionals,
[01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:37.340]   an interrogation is very different.
[01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:38.220]   - What's the difference?
[01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:40.820]   The nature of how relaxed the thing is or what?
[01:24:40.820 --> 01:24:42.360]   - So in an interrogation,
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:44.060]   there's a clear pattern of dominance.
[01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:45.580]   There's no equality.
[01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:47.220]   Also, there's no escape.
[01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:49.860]   You are there until the interrogator is done with you.
[01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:51.780]   Anybody who's ever been reprimanded by mom and dad
[01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:53.120]   knows what an interrogation feels like.
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:54.820]   Anybody who's ever been called into the principal's office
[01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:57.220]   or the boss's office, that's what interrogation feels like.
[01:24:57.220 --> 01:24:59.580]   You don't leave until the boss says you can leave.
[01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:01.260]   And you're there to say, to answer questions
[01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:02.820]   the boss asks questions.
[01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:05.700]   An interview is an equal exchange of ideas.
[01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:09.660]   You are in control of this interview, for sure.
[01:25:09.660 --> 01:25:11.540]   But if we were having coffee,
[01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:13.420]   I could take control if I wanted to take control.
[01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:15.140]   If I wanted to ask you personal questions, I would.
[01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:17.620]   If I wanted to talk to you about your background, I could.
[01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:19.420]   - Why am I in control of this interview exactly?
[01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:20.580]   - Because the person in control
[01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:22.500]   is the person asking questions.
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:23.340]   - Yeah, always.
[01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:25.840]   - I'm sitting here, as you've spoken about,
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:29.780]   my power here is I'm the quiet one listening.
[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:30.820]   (Lex laughs)
[01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:31.660]   - You're exactly right.
[01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:33.160]   Guess where this conversation goes?
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:34.000]   - Yeah.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.140]   - Anywhere you choose to take it,
[01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:36.580]   because you're the one asking questions.
[01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:38.300]   Every time I answer a question,
[01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:41.680]   I am creating a pattern of obedience to you,
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:43.300]   which subliminally, subconsciously,
[01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:45.780]   makes me that much more apt to answer your questions.
[01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:46.820]   - Of course, you can always turn that
[01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:48.500]   and start asking me questions.
[01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:53.940]   But you're saying that there's, through conversation,
[01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:55.580]   you can call it interviewing,
[01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:59.180]   you can start to see
[01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:05.660]   cracks in the story of the person
[01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:08.540]   and the degree to which they exaggerate or lie
[01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:12.140]   or to see how much they could be trusted,
[01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:13.120]   that kind of stuff.
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:15.060]   - What I'm saying is that, through a conversation,
[01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:16.620]   you develop a baseline, right?
[01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:20.140]   Like, even just in the first part of our conversation,
[01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:23.140]   I've been able to create some baseline elements about you.
[01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:25.580]   You've been able to create baseline elements about me.
[01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:27.640]   Maybe they're just not front of mind.
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:30.660]   From those baselines, now we can push through
[01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:34.340]   more intentional questions to test--
[01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:35.180]   - Got it.
[01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:36.980]   - To test whether or not the person is being truthful
[01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:39.100]   because they're operating within their baseline
[01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:42.500]   or if you are triggering sensitivities
[01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:43.480]   outside of their baseline,
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:45.480]   and then you can start to see their tells.
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:46.320]   - That's fascinating.
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:49.200]   Yeah, baseline, even the tells, right?
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:50.620]   The eye contact.
[01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:52.300]   You've probably already formed a baseline
[01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:54.580]   that I have trouble making eye contact.
[01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:56.900]   And so, if you ask me difficult questions
[01:26:56.900 --> 01:26:58.300]   and I'm not making eye contact,
[01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:00.580]   maybe that's not a good signal of me lying
[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:01.420]   or whatever. - Correct.
[01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:04.140]   - 'Cause I always have trouble making eye contact.
[01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:05.980]   Stuff like that, that's really fascinating.
[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:07.740]   - The majority of your eye movement is to the right.
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:08.580]   - Yeah.
[01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:10.300]   - My, your right, my left, right?
[01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:11.560]   Which is usually someone who's,
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.460]   if you ask micro-expressionists,
[01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:15.620]   that's someone who's referencing fact.
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:16.460]   - Yeah.
[01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:18.020]   - That's not necessarily what's happening for you
[01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:19.780]   because you're pulling concepts out of the air.
[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:20.620]   So, it's also a place
[01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:22.060]   that you reference something other than fact.
[01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:24.020]   It's a place for you to find creativity.
[01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:25.420]   So, if I just thought that you were lying
[01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:28.020]   because you look up into the right, I would be wrong.
[01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:29.300]   - That's so fascinating.
[01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:32.140]   And a lot of that has to do with like habits that are formed
[01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:33.100]   and all those kinds of things.
[01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:35.940]   Or maybe some right hand, left hand type of situation.
[01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:36.860]   - Right eye dominance.
[01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:37.680]   - Yeah, right eye dominance.
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:39.060]   - Is gonna make you look to the right.
[01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:40.800]   - Is this a science or an art?
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:41.780]   - It's a bit of both.
[01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:44.200]   I would say that like all good art,
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:47.460]   art is taught from a foundation of skills.
[01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:51.060]   And those skills are played,
[01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:53.660]   are taught in a very structured manner.
[01:27:53.660 --> 01:27:57.300]   And then the way that you use the skills after that,
[01:27:57.300 --> 01:27:59.460]   that's more of the artistic grace.
[01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:01.780]   So, I've always called espionage an art.
[01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:03.500]   Spying is an art.
[01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:06.040]   Being able to hack human beings is an art.
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:08.260]   But it's all based in a foundation of science.
[01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:10.300]   You still have to learn how to mix the color palette
[01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:11.640]   and use certain brushes.
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:15.540]   - Do you think of that as a kind of
[01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:17.540]   the study of human psychology?
[01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:20.460]   Is that what a psychologist does or a psychiatrist?
[01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:22.900]   What from this process have you learned
[01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:25.700]   about human nature?
[01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:26.660]   - Human nature? - Yeah.
[01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:30.060]   - I mean, I suppose the answer to that could be a book.
[01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:32.260]   But it probably will be a book.
[01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:33.300]   - I'll save you that, yeah.
[01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:37.700]   - But is there things that are surprising
[01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:38.980]   about human nature,
[01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:43.460]   surprising to us civilians that you could speak to?
[01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:45.740]   - Yes, one thing is extremely surprising
[01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:48.500]   about human nature, which is funny
[01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:49.940]   'cause that's not the answer I would have said.
[01:28:49.940 --> 01:28:52.880]   So, I'm glad that you clarified this specific question.
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:55.900]   The thing that's surprising about human nature
[01:28:55.900 --> 01:28:59.420]   is that human beings long,
[01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:02.780]   like in their soul,
[01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:06.740]   there's like a painful longing to be with other people.
[01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:08.700]   And that's really surprising
[01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:11.380]   because we all wanna pretend like we're strong.
[01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:14.020]   We all wanna pretend like we're independent.
[01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:17.540]   We all wanna pretend like we are the masters
[01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:18.740]   of our destiny.
[01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:22.100]   But what's truly consistent in all people
[01:29:22.100 --> 01:29:27.100]   is this longing to commune with others like us.
[01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:33.180]   My more practical answer about what I've learned
[01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:36.500]   to be the truth is that human nature is predictable.
[01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:38.900]   And that predictability is what gives people
[01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:41.800]   an incredible advantage over other people.
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:43.460]   But that's not the surprising piece.
[01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:45.100]   I mean, even when CIA taught me
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:47.460]   that human nature is predictable, it just made sense.
[01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:49.060]   I was like, "Oh yeah, that makes sense."
[01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:52.660]   But what I never ever anticipated was,
[01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:54.060]   no matter where I've been in the world,
[01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:54.980]   no matter who I've talked to,
[01:29:54.980 --> 01:29:59.300]   no matter what socioeconomic bracket is that longing,
[01:29:59.300 --> 01:30:01.020]   man, it hurts.
[01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:03.040]   Loneliness sucks.
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:04.500]   And togetherness feels good,
[01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:06.060]   even if you're together with someone you know
[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:07.260]   isn't the right person.
[01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:09.300]   It still feels better than being alone.
[01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:11.340]   - I mean, that's such a deep truth you speak to.
[01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:15.060]   And I could talk about that for a long time.
[01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:17.980]   There is, I mean, through these conversations,
[01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:20.580]   in general, whether it's being recorded or not,
[01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:26.940]   I hunger to discover in the other person that longing.
[01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:29.300]   You strip away the other things,
[01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:32.500]   and then you share in the longing for that connection.
[01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:34.860]   And I particularly also detected that
[01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:40.300]   in people from all walks of life,
[01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:44.460]   including people that others might identify as evil,
[01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:50.140]   or hard, as completely cold.
[01:30:50.140 --> 01:30:52.620]   It's there.
[01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:53.440]   - It's there.
[01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:56.980]   They've hardened themselves in their search.
[01:30:56.980 --> 01:30:59.140]   And who knows what dark place their brain is in,
[01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:03.640]   their heart is in, but that longing is still there.
[01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:06.260]   Even if it's an ember, it's there.
[01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:11.260]   It's the reason why in World War I and World War II,
[01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:13.900]   enemy combatants still shared cigarettes
[01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:17.380]   on the front lines during periods of holidays,
[01:31:17.380 --> 01:31:18.940]   or bad weather, or whatever else,
[01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:22.900]   because that human connection, man, it triumphs overall.
[01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:27.900]   - See, that's in part of what I refer to when I say love,
[01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:31.940]   because I feel like if political leaders
[01:31:31.940 --> 01:31:34.740]   and people in conflict at the small scale
[01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:39.740]   and the large scale were able to tune into that longing,
[01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:45.340]   to seek in each other that basic longing
[01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:49.460]   for human connection, a lot of problems could be solved.
[01:31:49.460 --> 01:31:53.000]   But of course, it's difficult,
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.000]   because it's a game of chicken.
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:00.700]   If you open yourself up to reveal that longing
[01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:03.760]   for connection with others, people can hurt you.
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:04.940]   - Well, I would go a step farther,
[01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:08.940]   and I would say that taking the connection away,
[01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:13.940]   punishing, penalizing people by removing the connection
[01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:18.140]   is a powerful tool, and that's what we see.
[01:32:18.140 --> 01:32:20.060]   That's why we send people to jail.
[01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:22.340]   That's why we put economic sanctions on countries.
[01:32:22.340 --> 01:32:24.300]   That's why we ground our children
[01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:25.900]   and send them to their rooms.
[01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:28.820]   We are penalizing them, whether we know it or not.
[01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:32.300]   We're using punitive damage by taking away
[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:36.460]   that basic human connection, that longing for community.
[01:32:36.460 --> 01:32:40.460]   What was your recruitment process and training process
[01:32:40.460 --> 01:32:45.460]   and things you could speak to in the CIA?
[01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:50.060]   - As I was leaving the Air Force, all that was on my mind,
[01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:52.580]   I don't know what you were like at 27,
[01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:55.000]   but I was a total dipshit at 27.
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.940]   I'm not much better now at 42, but--
[01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:58.300]   - Yeah, you and me both.
[01:32:58.300 --> 01:33:00.660]   (Lyle laughs)
[01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:01.660]   Think until you make it.
[01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:05.020]   - Yeah, but I was like, I just wanted to be anything
[01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:06.960]   other than a military officer.
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:09.520]   So I was actually in the process of applying
[01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:12.340]   to the Peace Corps through this thing called the internet,
[01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:16.020]   which was still fairly rudimentary in 2007.
[01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:18.700]   I had a computer lab that we went to,
[01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:20.220]   and it had 10 computers in it,
[01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:21.500]   and you had to log in and log out
[01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:22.980]   and slow internet and everything else.
[01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:25.340]   But anyways, I was filling out an online application
[01:33:25.340 --> 01:33:28.020]   to go work in the US Peace Corps.
[01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:29.980]   I wanted to grow my hair out.
[01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:33.140]   I wanted to stop wearing shoes that were shiny.
[01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:35.140]   I wanted to meet a hippie chick
[01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:37.300]   and have hippie babies in the wild,
[01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:40.460]   teaching Nigerian children how to read.
[01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:42.580]   So that was the path I was going down.
[01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:45.520]   And as I filled in all of my details,
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:47.380]   there came this page that popped up,
[01:33:47.380 --> 01:33:48.820]   and it was this blinking red page,
[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:50.340]   and it said, "Stop here.
[01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:53.180]   "You may qualify for other government positions.
[01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:55.800]   "If you're willing to put your application on hold
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:59.820]   "for 72 hours, that gives us a chance to reach out to you."
[01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:03.020]   So again, 27-year-old dipshit, I was like,
[01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:05.020]   "Sure, I'll put myself on hold
[01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:07.420]   "if I might qualify for other government opportunities."
[01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:09.520]   And then about a day later, I got a phone call
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:11.880]   from an almost unlisted number.
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:15.020]   It just said 703, which was very strange to see
[01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:18.660]   on my flip phone at the time, just one 703 area code.
[01:34:18.660 --> 01:34:23.420]   And I picked it up, and it was a person
[01:34:23.420 --> 01:34:26.020]   from Northern Virginia asking me if I would be,
[01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:28.740]   telling me that I was qualified for a position
[01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:30.860]   in national security, and if I would be interested,
[01:34:30.860 --> 01:34:32.900]   they'll pay for my ticket and fly me up
[01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:35.140]   to Langley, Virginia.
[01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:37.940]   They didn't say CIA, they said Langley.
[01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:39.220]   I put one and one together, and I was like,
[01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:41.060]   "Maybe this is CIA."
[01:34:41.060 --> 01:34:43.100]   Like, how cool is this?
[01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:45.340]   Or maybe this is all make-believe, and this is totally fake.
[01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:47.620]   So either way, it doesn't hurt me at all to say yes.
[01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:50.500]   They already have my phone number, so yes, yes, yes.
[01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:52.040]   And then I remember thinking,
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:54.780]   "There's no way that happened, and this isn't real."
[01:34:54.780 --> 01:34:57.580]   And then a day later, I got a FedEx,
[01:34:57.580 --> 01:35:00.180]   or an overnight delivery of an airplane ticket
[01:35:00.180 --> 01:35:03.260]   and a hotel reservation and a rental car reservation.
[01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:05.700]   And then I just kept doing the next thing,
[01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:07.860]   which I found out later on is a form of control.
[01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:10.540]   You just do the next thing that they tell you to do.
[01:35:10.540 --> 01:35:12.460]   And then before I knew it, I was interviewing
[01:35:12.460 --> 01:35:15.020]   in a nondescript building with a person
[01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:17.140]   who only told me their first name
[01:35:17.140 --> 01:35:19.380]   for a position with the National Clandestine Service.
[01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:21.300]   - So you never really got a chance to think about it
[01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:23.100]   because there's small steps along the way,
[01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:24.620]   and it kinda just leads you,
[01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:29.940]   and maybe your personality is such that,
[01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:30.820]   that's an adventure.
[01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:33.020]   - It's an adventure, and you don't,
[01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:34.300]   because it's one step at a time,
[01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:36.460]   you don't necessarily see the negative consequences
[01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:37.300]   of the adventure.
[01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:38.980]   You don't think about any of that.
[01:35:38.980 --> 01:35:41.660]   You're just stepping into the adventure
[01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:42.500]   one step at a time. - And it's easy.
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:43.680]   There's no work involved.
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:44.980]   Somebody else is doing all the work,
[01:35:44.980 --> 01:35:46.400]   telling me where to be and when.
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:48.340]   It's a lot like basic training in the military.
[01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:49.860]   Anybody who's ever been through basic training
[01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:52.220]   will tell you they hated the first few days,
[01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:54.540]   and then by the end, it was really comforting
[01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:56.460]   because you just did what you were told.
[01:35:56.460 --> 01:35:57.540]   They told you when to eat,
[01:35:57.540 --> 01:35:59.260]   they made the decision of what to eat,
[01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:01.300]   and then you just, you marched when they told you to march,
[01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:03.020]   shined your shoes when they told you to shine your shoes.
[01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:06.380]   Human beings love being told what to do.
[01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:08.740]   - What about the training process
[01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:14.900]   for becoming a covert CIA agent?
[01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:19.020]   - Yeah, so the interview process is--
[01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:20.380]   - Yeah, the interview process too.
[01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:22.220]   Was that, how rigorous was that?
[01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:23.820]   - It was very rigorous.
[01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:26.100]   That was where it became difficult.
[01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:28.620]   Everything up to the first interview was easy,
[01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:30.340]   but there's three interviews,
[01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:31.580]   and some people are lucky enough
[01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:34.580]   to have four or five interviews if something goes wrong
[01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:37.660]   or something goes awry with the first few interviews.
[01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:39.980]   And again, this might be dated from what I went through,
[01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:43.400]   but during the interview process is when they start,
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:45.580]   they do your psychological evaluations,
[01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:50.580]   they do your, they do personality assessments,
[01:36:50.580 --> 01:36:53.060]   they do skills assessments.
[01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:55.080]   They'll start sending you back to your,
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:57.860]   wherever you're living with assignments.
[01:36:57.860 --> 01:36:59.860]   Not Intel assignments,
[01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:02.740]   but actual like homework assignments.
[01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:05.500]   Write an essay about three parts of the world
[01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:08.120]   that you think will be most impacted
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:09.460]   in the next three to five years,
[01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:12.820]   or prioritize the top three strategic priorities
[01:37:12.820 --> 01:37:13.700]   for the United States,
[01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:17.900]   and put it into 250 words or 2,500 words
[01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:20.620]   and whatever else, double-spaced in this font,
[01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:22.580]   yada, yada, yada, like super specific stuff.
[01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:24.220]   It's kind of stressful,
[01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:26.060]   but it's just like going back to college again.
[01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:27.820]   So you go through all of those acts,
[01:37:27.820 --> 01:37:30.700]   and then you submit this stuff to some PO box
[01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:31.980]   that doesn't have,
[01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:33.180]   anybody's ever gonna respond to you.
[01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:36.300]   And then you hope, you just send it into the ether,
[01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:38.420]   and you hope that you sent it right.
[01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:40.100]   You hope that you wrote well enough.
[01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:42.460]   You hope that your assessment was right,
[01:37:42.460 --> 01:37:43.340]   whatever else it might be.
[01:37:43.340 --> 01:37:45.660]   And then eventually you get another phone call that says,
[01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:46.820]   "Hey, we received your package.
[01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:49.540]   You've been moved to the next level of interview.
[01:37:49.540 --> 01:37:51.300]   And now we need you to go to this other
[01:37:51.300 --> 01:37:53.580]   nondescript building in this other nondescript city."
[01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:55.660]   And then you start meeting,
[01:37:55.660 --> 01:37:59.540]   you start sitting in waiting rooms
[01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:00.540]   with other groups of people
[01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:02.660]   who are at the same phase of interview with you,
[01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:04.540]   which were some of the coolest experiences
[01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:05.900]   that I remember still.
[01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:07.340]   One of my best friends to this day,
[01:38:07.340 --> 01:38:10.260]   who I don't get to talk to 'cause he's still undercover,
[01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:12.260]   is a guy I met during those interview processes.
[01:38:12.260 --> 01:38:14.140]   And I was like, "Oh, we met.
[01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:14.980]   I saw what he was wearing.
[01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:16.820]   He saw what I was wearing.
[01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:18.340]   I was brown." - So you immediately connected,
[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:19.780]   and you liked the people there.
[01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:20.620]   - Close.
[01:38:20.620 --> 01:38:22.620]   More like we immediately judge each other
[01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:24.060]   'cause we're all untrained.
[01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:26.100]   So he looked at me and he was like,
[01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:27.740]   "Brown dude with crazy hair."
[01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:29.780]   And I was wearing, dude, I was dressed like a total ass.
[01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:32.700]   I was dressed in a clubbing shirt.
[01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:33.900]   I don't know why I thought it'd be a good idea
[01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:36.500]   to go to a CIA interview in a clubbing shirt
[01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:39.180]   with my buttons on button down to here.
[01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:40.540]   And he was like, "Yeah, you were really..."
[01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:42.060]   After we got in, he was like,
[01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:43.780]   "Yeah, dude, you were always really cool to talk to."
[01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:46.780]   But I was like, "There's no way that idiot's getting in."
[01:38:46.780 --> 01:38:47.940]   And I remember looking at him and being like,
[01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:50.180]   "Dude, you were just another white guy in a black suit.
[01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:52.540]   They're not looking for you, but here you are."
[01:38:52.540 --> 01:38:54.420]   So it was just those kinds of things were so interesting
[01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:56.820]   'cause we were totally wrong about what CIA was looking for.
[01:38:56.820 --> 01:38:59.900]   Until you're in, you have no idea what they're looking for.
[01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:02.620]   And you're just shooting in the dark.
[01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:05.820]   - Did they have you do a lie detector test?
[01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:07.380]   - Yes, it's called a polygraph.
[01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:08.540]   - Polygraph.
[01:39:08.540 --> 01:39:09.980]   How effective, just interesting,
[01:39:09.980 --> 01:39:12.780]   for our previous discussion, how effective are those?
[01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:14.040]   - Polygraphs are really interesting.
[01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:16.380]   So one of the things that people don't understand
[01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:17.860]   about polygraphs is that polygraphs
[01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:19.420]   aren't meant to detect a lie.
[01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:21.340]   Like they're called a lie detector,
[01:39:21.340 --> 01:39:23.820]   but they're not actually meant to detect a lie.
[01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:27.220]   They're built to detect variance
[01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:29.640]   from your physiological baseline.
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:33.320]   So they're essentially meant to identify sensitivities
[01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:35.180]   to certain types of questions.
[01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:37.360]   And then as they identify a sensitivity to a question,
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:40.580]   it gives the interviewer an additional piece of information
[01:39:40.580 --> 01:39:42.980]   to direct the next round of questions.
[01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:45.100]   So then from there, they can kind of see how sensitive
[01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:46.820]   you are to a certain level of questions.
[01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:50.700]   And your sensitivity could be a sign of dishonesty,
[01:39:50.700 --> 01:39:54.460]   but it could also be a sign of vulnerability.
[01:39:54.460 --> 01:39:57.340]   So the interrogator themselves, the interviewer themselves,
[01:39:57.340 --> 01:39:59.820]   they're the one that have to make the judgment call
[01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:00.660]   as to which one it is,
[01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:03.540]   which is why you might see multiple interviewers
[01:40:03.540 --> 01:40:05.820]   over the course of multiple polygraphs.
[01:40:05.820 --> 01:40:07.360]   But that's really what they're all about.
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:11.220]   So, I mean, outside of, they're extremely uncomfortable.
[01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:13.340]   Like they're mentally uncomfortable,
[01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:15.740]   but then there's also, you sit on a pad
[01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:17.500]   because the pad is supposed to be able to tell
[01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:19.780]   your body movements, but also your sphincter,
[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:22.180]   contractions or whatever.
[01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:24.540]   So you're sitting on this pad, you're plugged in,
[01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:26.300]   you're strapped in, you're tied up,
[01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:28.020]   and it takes so much time to get in there.
[01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:30.060]   And then they start asking you questions,
[01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:31.220]   baseline questions at first,
[01:40:31.220 --> 01:40:33.260]   and then other questions from there.
[01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:35.260]   And you're just answering the best you can.
[01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:36.320]   And you never know what they're seeing
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:37.160]   and you don't know what they're doing.
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:39.620]   And it's really hard not to get anxious of that anyways.
[01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:42.340]   - Are they the whole time monitoring the readings?
[01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:45.020]   - Yeah, from like a big, they've got multiple screens
[01:40:45.020 --> 01:40:47.840]   and they've got just, it's all information superiority.
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:50.000]   They have information superiority.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.480]   You're the idiot looking away from them
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:54.680]   or looking sideways of them and trying not to move
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:57.060]   because you're afraid that if you like have gas
[01:40:57.060 --> 01:40:57.920]   or if you move a little bit,
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:40:59.640]   it's gonna bury you from your baseline.
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:00.560]   And the whole time you're worried,
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:02.400]   your heart's racing and your blood pressure is increasing,
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:04.360]   which is a variance from baseline.
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:06.520]   So yeah, I mean, it's an interesting art.
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:08.040]   - Or your baseline. - Correct.
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:09.600]   - Maybe there's some people that are just chilling
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:11.840]   the whole time and that's their baseline.
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:12.920]   - Right, right.
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:14.920]   - But that's what they're doing, they're establishing.
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:16.880]   I mean, I guess that means the polygraph
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:21.880]   is a skill that you develop to do it well.
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:24.400]   - So when people talk about beating a lie detector,
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:26.240]   it's not that they're telling an effective lie.
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:27.060]   That's not hard.
[01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:30.220]   It's not hard to tell a lie to an interviewer.
[01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:33.120]   And the interviewer doesn't care if you're being honest
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:34.300]   or not honest about a topic.
[01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:36.800]   What they're looking for is sensitivity.
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:40.740]   If they see no sensitivity, that's a big sign for them.
[01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:43.540]   That's a big sign that you're probably a pathological liar.
[01:41:43.540 --> 01:41:46.920]   If you show sensitivity to many things,
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:49.320]   then that's a sign that you're probably an anxious person.
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:51.680]   And they can still reset their baseline
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:54.480]   because they can tell how your anxiety is increasing
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:56.720]   in 15-minute increments.
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:58.560]   It's a unique skill.
[01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:02.040]   I mean, a really good polygrapher is immensely valuable.
[01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:04.920]   But yeah, it's the misnomers, the misconceptions
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:07.240]   about polygraphs are vast.
[01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:09.560]   - You also mentioned personality tests.
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:10.960]   That's really interesting.
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:14.020]   So how effective are personality tests,
[01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:15.380]   one for the hiring process,
[01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:17.340]   but also for understanding a human being?
[01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:19.860]   - So personality is extremely important
[01:42:19.860 --> 01:42:20.860]   for understanding a human being.
[01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:22.780]   And I would say that there's 1,000 different ways
[01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:23.620]   of looking at personality.
[01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:28.100]   The only one that I count with any significance is the MBTI.
[01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:30.540]   And the MBTI is what all the leading spy agencies
[01:42:30.540 --> 01:42:32.460]   around the world use as well.
[01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:34.020]   - Well, that's kind of interesting to hear.
[01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:34.860]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:42:34.860 --> 01:42:36.540]   - 'Cause there's been criticisms of that kind of test.
[01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:38.420]   - There have been criticisms for a long time.
[01:42:38.420 --> 01:42:40.220]   - Yeah, and you think there's value.
[01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:41.380]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:43.140]   And there's a few reasons why, right?
[01:42:43.140 --> 01:42:45.540]   So first, MBTI makes the claim
[01:42:45.540 --> 01:42:49.220]   that your core personality doesn't change over time.
[01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:51.720]   And that's how it's calibrated.
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:53.300]   And one of the big arguments is that people say
[01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:55.740]   that your personality can change over time.
[01:42:55.740 --> 01:42:59.620]   Now, in my experience, the MBTI is exactly correct.
[01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:01.660]   Your core personality does not change
[01:43:01.660 --> 01:43:04.380]   because your core personality is defined
[01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:08.880]   as your personality when all resources are removed.
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:13.300]   So essentially, your emergency mode, your dire conditions,
[01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:15.580]   that is your core personality.
[01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:18.280]   We can all act a little more extroverted.
[01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:21.680]   We can all be a little more empathetic
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:25.060]   when we have tons of time and money and patience.
[01:43:25.060 --> 01:43:27.180]   When you strip away all that time, money, and patience,
[01:43:27.180 --> 01:43:28.700]   how empathetic are you?
[01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:31.300]   How much do you like being around other people?
[01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:33.060]   How much do you like being alone?
[01:43:33.060 --> 01:43:37.140]   Do you make judgments or do you analyze information?
[01:43:37.140 --> 01:43:38.860]   That's what's so powerful about MBTI
[01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:40.600]   is it's talking about what people are like
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:42.320]   when you strip away resources.
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:44.280]   And then, because it's so consistent,
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:46.380]   it's also only four codes.
[01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:49.740]   It's super easy to be able to assess a human being
[01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:54.020]   through a dialogue, through a series of conversations,
[01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:57.420]   to be able to hone in with high accuracy
[01:43:57.420 --> 01:44:00.620]   what is there for code, four-letter code.
[01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:04.120]   There's only 16 options, and it becomes extremely valuable.
[01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:08.560]   Is it perfectly precise, and does everybody do it the same?
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:10.920]   I mean, those things, the answers to those are no,
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:15.200]   but is it operationally useful in a short period of time?
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:18.240]   That is a resoundingly powerful yes.
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:20.320]   - Yeah, I only know, I think, the first letter.
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:22.320]   It's introverted and extroverted, right?
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:25.480]   I've taken the test before,
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:27.640]   just a crude version of the test,
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:30.280]   and that's the same problem you have with IQ tests.
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:33.200]   There's the right, thorough way of doing it,
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:34.920]   and then there's fun internet way.
[01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:35.880]   (Lex laughs)
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:40.880]   And do you mind sharing what your personality--
[01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:44.240]   - My type index? - Yes.
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:45.780]   - I'm an ENTP.
[01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:49.120]   That's an extrovert, intuitor, perceiver, thinker.
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:54.320]   ENT, thinker, P, perceiver.
[01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:59.200]   My wife is an ISFJ, which is the polar opposite of me.
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:01.280]   E, I'm extroverted, she's introverted.
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:03.020]   I'm an intuitor, she's a sensor.
[01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:05.920]   I'm a thinker, she's a feeler.
[01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:07.520]   I'm a perceiver, she's a judger.
[01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:12.120]   - Is there good science on long-term successful relationships
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:15.160]   in terms of the dynamics of that, the 16?
[01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:17.440]   I wonder if there's good data on this.
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:19.700]   - I don't think there's a lot of good data
[01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:22.000]   in personalities writ large,
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.580]   because there's not a lot of money to be made
[01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:27.240]   in personality testing, but I would say
[01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:32.240]   that with experience, with a good MBTI test,
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:38.880]   with a good paid test, a 400, 500 question test,
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:41.240]   once you understand your own code,
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:44.900]   and then you're taught how to assess the code of others,
[01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:46.640]   with those two things kind of combined,
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:48.800]   'cause then you have experience in learning,
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:53.800]   it becomes very useful, and you can have high confidence
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:55.800]   in the conclusions that you reach
[01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:58.040]   about people's professions,
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:00.560]   about people's relationships with family,
[01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:02.480]   about people's relationships professionally,
[01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:04.920]   people's capabilities to deal with stress,
[01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:07.600]   how people will perform when pushed
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:09.360]   outside of their comfort zones.
[01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:12.400]   Really, really powerful, useful stuff in corporate world
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:14.120]   and in the espionage world.
[01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:16.840]   - So in terms of compressed representation
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:18.260]   of another human being,
[01:46:18.260 --> 01:46:22.000]   you can't do much better than those four letters.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.240]   - I don't believe you can do much better.
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:26.360]   In my experience, I have not seen anything better.
[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:30.800]   - Yeah, it is kind of, it's difficult to realize
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:32.080]   that there is a core personality,
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:35.600]   or to the degree that's true, it seems to be true.
[01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:38.040]   It's even more difficult to realize
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:42.720]   that there is a stable, at least the science says so,
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:47.720]   a stable, consistent intelligence, unfortunately.
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:51.000]   You know, the G factor that they call.
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.260]   That if you do a barrage of IQ tests,
[01:46:53.260 --> 01:46:57.080]   that's going to consistently represent that G factor.
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:46:59.160]   And we're all born with that, and we can't fix it.
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:01.880]   And that defines so much of who we are.
[01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:03.040]   It's sad.
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:06.280]   - I don't see it as sad, because it's, for me,
[01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:08.960]   the faster you learn it, the faster you learn
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:13.960]   what your own sort of natural strengths and weaknesses are,
[01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:16.360]   the faster you get to stop wasting time
[01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:19.200]   on things that you're never gonna be good at,
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:21.160]   and you get to double down on the things
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:23.560]   that you're already naturally skilled or interested in.
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:26.600]   So there's always a silver lining to a cloud.
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:29.640]   But I know now that I will never be a ballerina,
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:30.880]   or a ballerino.
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:32.200]   I know that I'll never be an artist.
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:33.780]   I'll never be a musician.
[01:47:33.780 --> 01:47:35.280]   I'll never be any of those things.
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:37.640]   And when I was 18, that might have made me sad.
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:40.640]   But now at 42, I'm like, well, shit, awesome.
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:42.880]   I can go be something else good,
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:44.160]   instead of always being bad.
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:46.680]   - Why do you think you're not gonna be a ballerina?
[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:48.560]   - Because I'm not graceful.
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:51.640]   - And you've learned this through years of experience.
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:52.640]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:54.680]   - Well, I don't know if there's an MBTI equivalent
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:56.880]   for grace of movement.
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:58.880]   - I think it's called S, sensor.
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:47:59.700]   - Oh.
[01:47:59.700 --> 01:48:02.840]   - Yeah, because a sensor is someone who's able to interact
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:03.680]   with the world around them
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:06.140]   through their five senses very effectively.
[01:48:06.140 --> 01:48:07.440]   Like if you talk to dancers,
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:09.760]   dancers can actually feel the grace
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:10.760]   in all of their muscles.
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:13.560]   They know what position their finger is in.
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:14.400]   I don't have any idea.
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:15.940]   I don't know what position my feet are in right now.
[01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:17.000]   I'd have to look to make sure
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:18.600]   I actually feel the floor right.
[01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:20.320]   - Yeah, I definitely have.
[01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:21.360]   Oh, that's good to know.
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:23.480]   So I don't, you know, I'm not a dancer,
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:25.640]   but I do have that.
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:26.840]   - You're a musician, man.
[01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:29.480]   Like to be able to pluck a guitar.
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:30.760]   - Sure, yeah, that's true,
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:32.360]   that there is that physical component.
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:33.800]   But I think deeper,
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:35.880]   'cause there's a technical aspect to that
[01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:39.000]   that's just like, it's less about feel,
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.960]   but I do know jujitsu and grappling.
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:43.540]   I've done it all my life.
[01:48:43.540 --> 01:48:46.620]   I don't, you know, there's some people who are clumsy
[01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:47.720]   and they drop stuff all the time.
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:49.160]   They run into stuff.
[01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:51.960]   I don't, first of all, I don't know how that happens,
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:54.720]   but to me, I just have an awareness of stuff.
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:55.560]   Like if there's a little--
[01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:56.840]   - A spiritual orientation.
[01:48:56.840 --> 01:49:00.560]   - Yeah, like I know that there's a small object
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:03.800]   I have to step over and I have a good sense of that.
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:05.000]   It's so interesting.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:06.520]   Yeah, you're just like born with that or something.
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:09.600]   - My wife is brilliant and she still walks into doors.
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:10.440]   - Yeah.
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:11.820]   - I mean, she'll walk in a doorway,
[01:49:11.820 --> 01:49:13.320]   she'll bang her knee on the same wall
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:15.280]   that's been there for the last 50 years.
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:17.280]   - It's for some reason really hilarious.
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:18.120]   That's good for me.
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:20.300]   (Lex laughing)
[01:49:20.300 --> 01:49:23.360]   You've been asked, I think on Reddit,
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:25.240]   are there big secrets that you know
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:28.280]   that could land you and our country in terrible trouble
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:29.480]   if it came out to the public?
[01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:32.940]   And you answered, yes, I wish I could forget them.
[01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:36.700]   So let me ask you just about secrecy in general.
[01:49:36.700 --> 01:49:39.160]   Are these secrets or just other secrets,
[01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:43.240]   ones that the public will never know
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:47.360]   or will it come out in 10, 20, 50 years?
[01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:49.520]   I guess the deeper question is
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:53.560]   what is the value of secrecy and transparency?
[01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:56.840]   - The standard classification
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:59.240]   for all human intelligence operations
[01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:03.300]   is something called 25X2, 25 by two.
[01:50:03.300 --> 01:50:07.640]   So 50 years, 25 years times two years or times two rounds.
[01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:10.440]   So in essence, anything that I've seen
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:15.120]   has the first chance of becoming public domain,
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:17.360]   declassified after 50 years,
[01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:19.880]   unless there's some congressional requirement
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:22.200]   for it to be reviewed and assessed earlier.
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:24.680]   So by then, I'll be 80 something years old
[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:28.000]   or potentially dead, which is either way.
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:31.020]   That's when it can come out
[01:50:31.020 --> 01:50:34.240]   according to its typical classification.
[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:39.040]   The value of secrets I have seen
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:42.820]   is that secrets create space.
[01:50:42.820 --> 01:50:48.520]   Secrets give opportunity for security,
[01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:52.080]   they give opportunity for thinking, they give space.
[01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:55.100]   And space is an incredibly advantageous thing to have.
[01:50:55.100 --> 01:50:57.060]   If you know something somebody else doesn't know,
[01:50:57.060 --> 01:50:59.760]   even if it's just 15 or 20 minutes different,
[01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:02.600]   you can direct, you can change the course of fate.
[01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:05.420]   So I find secrets to be extremely valuable,
[01:51:05.420 --> 01:51:06.540]   extremely useful.
[01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:10.040]   Even at the place where secrets
[01:51:10.040 --> 01:51:12.340]   are being kept from a large mass,
[01:51:12.340 --> 01:51:15.520]   part of what all Americans need to understand
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:19.280]   is that one of the trade-offs
[01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:23.940]   to building a system of government
[01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:26.120]   that allows us to be first world
[01:51:26.120 --> 01:51:28.480]   and wealthy and secure and successful,
[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:30.680]   one of the trade-offs is that we have given up
[01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:32.560]   a great deal of personal freedom.
[01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:34.700]   And one of the personal freedoms that we give up
[01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:39.020]   is the freedom of knowing what we wanna know.
[01:51:39.020 --> 01:51:41.460]   You get to know what the government tells you,
[01:51:41.460 --> 01:51:43.060]   you get to know what you need to know
[01:51:43.060 --> 01:51:44.420]   or what you've learned yourself,
[01:51:44.420 --> 01:51:47.000]   but you don't get to know secrets.
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.740]   People who do get to know secrets know them for a reason.
[01:51:49.740 --> 01:51:51.840]   That's why it's called a need to know.
[01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:54.460]   - How difficult is it to maintain secrecy?
[01:51:54.460 --> 01:51:58.620]   - It's surprisingly difficult as technology changes.
[01:51:58.620 --> 01:52:00.260]   It's also surprisingly difficult
[01:52:02.380 --> 01:52:06.740]   as our culture becomes one where people want notoriety.
[01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:09.480]   People wanna be the person who breaks the secret.
[01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:13.060]   25 years ago, 40 years ago, that wasn't the case.
[01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:14.380]   There was a time in the United States
[01:52:14.380 --> 01:52:16.660]   where if someone gave you a secret,
[01:52:16.660 --> 01:52:20.060]   it was a point of personal honor not to share the secret.
[01:52:20.060 --> 01:52:22.580]   Now we're in a place where if someone tells you a secret,
[01:52:22.580 --> 01:52:24.940]   like that could turn into a Twitter post
[01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:26.340]   that gets you a bunch of thumbs up
[01:52:26.340 --> 01:52:27.500]   and a bunch of likes or whatever else.
[01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:28.320]   - An opportunity.
[01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:31.220]   - Right, so the value of secrets has changed.
[01:52:31.220 --> 01:52:34.180]   And now there's almost a greater value on exposing secrets
[01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:36.300]   than there is on keeping secrets.
[01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:38.380]   That makes it difficult to keep secrets,
[01:52:38.380 --> 01:52:40.780]   especially when technology is going in the same direction.
[01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:43.120]   - Yeah, where is the line?
[01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:45.060]   And by the way, I'm one of those old school people
[01:52:45.060 --> 01:52:46.020]   with the secrets.
[01:52:46.020 --> 01:52:51.020]   I think it's a karma thing.
[01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:52.980]   Again, back to the trust.
[01:52:52.980 --> 01:52:54.340]   I think in the short term,
[01:52:54.340 --> 01:52:57.260]   you can benefit by sharing a secret.
[01:52:57.260 --> 01:53:00.300]   But in the long term, if people know they can trust you,
[01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:05.060]   like the juicy of the secret, it's a test of sorts.
[01:53:05.060 --> 01:53:07.880]   If they know you can keep that secret,
[01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:10.100]   that means you're somebody that can be trusted.
[01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:14.140]   And I believe that not just effectiveness in this life,
[01:53:14.140 --> 01:53:17.380]   but happiness in this life is informing a circle
[01:53:17.380 --> 01:53:18.700]   of people you can trust.
[01:53:18.700 --> 01:53:22.220]   - Right, we're taught that secrets and lies are similar
[01:53:22.220 --> 01:53:24.300]   in that they have a limited shelf life.
[01:53:24.300 --> 01:53:26.380]   If you treat them like food,
[01:53:26.380 --> 01:53:29.200]   secrets and lies have a very limited shelf life.
[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:33.100]   So if you cash in on them while they're still fresh,
[01:53:33.100 --> 01:53:35.740]   you beat them before they spoil.
[01:53:35.740 --> 01:53:38.100]   You get to take advantage of them before they spoil.
[01:53:38.100 --> 01:53:43.100]   However, trust has no limit to its shelf life.
[01:53:43.100 --> 01:53:46.420]   So it's almost like you're trading a short term victory
[01:53:46.420 --> 01:53:48.340]   and losing a long term victory.
[01:53:48.340 --> 01:53:50.580]   It's always better to keep the secret.
[01:53:50.580 --> 01:53:53.620]   It's always better to let the lie live
[01:53:53.620 --> 01:53:56.080]   because it will eventually come to light
[01:53:56.080 --> 01:53:57.940]   from somebody else, not from you,
[01:53:57.940 --> 01:53:59.840]   because it already has a limited shelf life.
[01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:02.400]   But what you win in exchange for not being the one
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:05.500]   that cashed in on the secret is immense trust.
[01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:12.560]   - Let me ask you about lying and trust and so on.
[01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:15.680]   So I don't believe I've been contacted by
[01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:20.040]   or interacted with the CIA, the MI6, the FSB,
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:22.800]   Mossad, or any other intelligence agency.
[01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:25.300]   I'm kind of offended.
[01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:31.300]   But would I know if I was, so from your perspective?
[01:54:31.300 --> 01:54:33.420]   - No, you would not know if you were.
[01:54:33.420 --> 01:54:35.040]   For sure you've been on their radar.
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:36.620]   Absolutely, you've got a file.
[01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:38.100]   You've got a dossier somewhere.
[01:54:38.100 --> 01:54:39.540]   - Why would I be on their radar?
[01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:41.540]   - Because you're-- - Who's interesting?
[01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:46.300]   - It's not necessarily that you are interesting
[01:54:46.300 --> 01:54:48.900]   to someone as a foreign asset
[01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:51.680]   or an intelligence collection source,
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:54.460]   but your network is extremely interesting.
[01:54:54.460 --> 01:54:55.740]   - The networks are important.
[01:54:55.740 --> 01:54:57.880]   - Correct, if someone had access to,
[01:54:57.880 --> 01:54:59.880]   if someone was able to clone your phone,
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:02.520]   every time you cross a border,
[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:04.820]   you go through some sort of security.
[01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:06.500]   If you've ever been pulled into secondary
[01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:08.120]   and separated from your bag,
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:10.700]   that's exactly when and how people clone computers,
[01:55:10.700 --> 01:55:13.300]   they clone phones, they make whatever,
[01:55:13.300 --> 01:55:17.340]   photocopies of your old school planner,
[01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:18.440]   whatever it might be.
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:23.160]   But for sure, you are an intelligence target.
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:24.880]   It just may be that you're not suitable
[01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:28.880]   to be a person who reports foreign intelligence.
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:30.920]   We've gotta understand that all people
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:33.360]   are potential sources of valuable information
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:35.620]   to the national security infrastructure
[01:55:35.620 --> 01:55:39.000]   of our host country and any country that we visit.
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.520]   Someone like you with your public footprint,
[01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:43.920]   with your notoriety, with your educational background,
[01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:46.760]   with your national identifications
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:50.920]   becomes a viable and valuable target of information.
[01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:54.240]   - Yeah, so to speak to that,
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:58.200]   I take security pretty seriously,
[01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:03.200]   but not to the degree that it runs my life,
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:05.880]   which I'm very careful about.
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:07.760]   - That's good, I'm glad to hear that.
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:10.720]   - So the moment you start to think about germs,
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:14.120]   like you start to freak out
[01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:17.360]   and you become sort of paralyzed by the stress of it.
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:19.360]   So you have to balance those two things.
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:22.640]   If you think about all the things
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:24.000]   that could hurt you in this world
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:25.660]   and all the risk you could take,
[01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:29.200]   it can overwhelm your life.
[01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:32.640]   That said, the cyber world is a weird world
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:34.880]   because it doesn't have the same,
[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:39.320]   I know not to cross the street without looking each way
[01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:42.280]   because there's a physical intuition about it.
[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:45.040]   I'm not sure, I'm a computer science guy,
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:49.720]   so I have some intuition, but the cyber world,
[01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:51.600]   it's really hard to build up an intuition
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:53.280]   of what is safe and not.
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:57.640]   I've seen a lot of people just logging out of your devices
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:56:59.720]   all the time, like regularly.
[01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:01.760]   Just like that physical access step
[01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:03.360]   is a lot of people don't take.
[01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:07.920]   I can just like walk in into the offices of a lot of CEOs
[01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:10.000]   and it's like everything's wide open
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:13.480]   for physical access of those systems,
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:16.720]   which is kind of incredible for somebody,
[01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:18.400]   that sounds really shady, but it's not.
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:20.360]   I've written key loggers,
[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:22.000]   like things that record everything you type
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.480]   in the miles you move.
[01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:27.680]   And I did that for, during my PhD,
[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:30.160]   I was recording everything you do on your device
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:32.800]   and everything you do on your computer.
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:34.240]   Like people sign up to the study,
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:37.240]   they willingly do this to understand behavior.
[01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:38.480]   I was trying to use machine learning
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:42.200]   to identify who you are based on different biometric
[01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:43.960]   and behavioral things,
[01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:46.080]   which allows me to study human behavior
[01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:49.560]   and to see which is uniquely identifiable.
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:51.280]   And the goal there was to remove
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:53.120]   the need for a password.
[01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:56.080]   But how easy it is to write a thing
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:58.240]   that logs everything you type,
[01:57:58.240 --> 01:57:59.680]   I was like, wait a minute,
[01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:03.000]   like I can probably get a lot of people in the world
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.240]   to run this for me.
[01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:06.680]   I can then get all of their passwords.
[01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:10.840]   I mean, you could do so much.
[01:58:10.840 --> 01:58:13.080]   Like I can run the entirety of the CIA
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:16.560]   for just myself if I was,
[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:18.440]   and I imagine there's a lot of really good hackers
[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:21.360]   like that out there, much better than me.
[01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:25.800]   So I tried to prevent myself from being
[01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:27.560]   all the different low-hanging fruit
[01:58:27.560 --> 01:58:29.440]   attack vectors in my life.
[01:58:29.440 --> 01:58:33.120]   I tried to make it difficult to be that,
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:35.720]   but then I'm also aware that there's probably people
[01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:37.280]   that are like five steps ahead.
[01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:40.440]   - You're doing the right thing.
[01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:44.240]   What I always advocate is the low-hanging fruit
[01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:46.800]   is what keeps you from being a target of opportunity.
[01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:49.960]   Because you're half-assed hackers,
[01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:53.280]   you're lazy hackers, you're unskilled hackers.
[01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:54.720]   They're looking for low-hanging fruit.
[01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:57.240]   They're looking for the person who gets the Nigeria email
[01:58:57.240 --> 01:58:59.120]   about how you could be getting $5 million
[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:00.520]   if you just give me your bank account.
[01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:01.360]   - Exactly.
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:03.640]   - That's what they're looking for.
[01:59:03.640 --> 01:59:04.800]   The thing that's scary is that
[01:59:04.800 --> 01:59:06.400]   if you're not a target of opportunity,
[01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:09.160]   if you become a intentional target,
[01:59:09.160 --> 01:59:11.840]   then there's almost nothing you can do.
[01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:14.520]   Because once you become an intentional target,
[01:59:14.520 --> 01:59:17.280]   then your security apparatus,
[01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:24.000]   they will create a dedicated, customized way vector
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:27.240]   of attacking your specific security apparatus.
[01:59:27.240 --> 01:59:30.400]   And because security is always after, right?
[01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:32.960]   There's always, there's the leading advantage
[01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:34.960]   and the trailing advantage.
[01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:38.280]   When it comes to attacks, the leader always has the advantage
[01:59:38.280 --> 01:59:40.120]   because they have to create the attack
[01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:43.160]   before anybody else can create a way to protect
[01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:44.240]   against the attack.
[01:59:44.240 --> 01:59:45.640]   So the attack always comes first.
[01:59:45.640 --> 01:59:47.040]   And that means they always have the advantage.
[01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:49.720]   You are always stuck just leaning on,
[01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:52.320]   this is the best security that I know of.
[01:59:52.320 --> 01:59:54.760]   Meanwhile, there's always somebody who can create a way
[01:59:54.760 --> 01:59:57.120]   of attacking the best security out there.
[01:59:57.120 --> 01:59:59.160]   And once they win, they have a monopoly.
[01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:00.800]   They have all that time
[02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:04.120]   until a new defensive countermeasure is deployed.
[02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:07.120]   - Yeah, I tend to think exactly as you said,
[02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:09.800]   that the low-hanging fruit protects against,
[02:00:09.800 --> 02:00:11.760]   yeah, crimes of opportunity.
[02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:15.240]   And then I assume that people can just hack in
[02:00:15.240 --> 02:00:17.000]   if they really want.
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000]   - Think about how much anxiety we would be able to solve
[02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.480]   if everybody just accepted that.
[02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:22.960]   - Well, there's several things you do.
[02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:26.800]   First of all, to be honest, it just makes me,
[02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:28.720]   it keeps me honest.
[02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:33.240]   Not to be a douchebag or like not,
[02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:39.240]   yeah, to assume everything could be public.
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:43.640]   And so don't trade in information
[02:00:43.640 --> 02:00:46.060]   that could hurt people if it was made public.
[02:00:46.060 --> 02:00:47.840]   So I try to do that.
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:52.240]   And the thing I try to make sure is I,
[02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:54.560]   like Home Alone style, try to-
[02:00:54.560 --> 02:00:55.480]   - Booby trap.
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:58.960]   - I really would like to know if I was hacked.
[02:00:58.960 --> 02:00:59.800]   - Right.
[02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:04.800]   - And so I try to assume that I will be hacked and detect it.
[02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:07.200]   - Yeah, have a tripwire of some sort.
[02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:10.080]   - Yeah, tripwires through everything.
[02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:13.440]   And not paranoia tripwires, just like open door.
[02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:17.540]   But I think that's probably the future of life on this earth
[02:01:17.540 --> 02:01:19.440]   is you're going, like everybody of interest
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:20.620]   is going to be hacked.
[02:01:20.620 --> 02:01:24.120]   That hopefully inspires, now this is outside of company.
[02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:25.960]   There's, these are individuals.
[02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:30.100]   I mean, there's, of course, if you're actually operating,
[02:01:30.100 --> 02:01:31.480]   like I'm just a, who am I?
[02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:36.160]   I'm just a scientist person, podcasting person.
[02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:41.160]   So if I was actually running a company
[02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:46.200]   or was an integral part of some kind of military operation,
[02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:49.560]   then you have to probably have to have an entire team
[02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:52.880]   that's now doing that battle of like being,
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:56.320]   trying to be ahead of like the best hackers in the world
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:57.480]   that are attacking.
[02:01:57.480 --> 02:02:00.200]   But that requires a team that like full-time
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:01.760]   is their focus.
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:03.440]   Even then you still get in trouble.
[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:04.260]   - Correct, yeah.
[02:02:04.260 --> 02:02:06.660]   - So what I've seen as the norm,
[02:02:06.660 --> 02:02:09.980]   well, what I've seen as the cutting edge standard
[02:02:09.980 --> 02:02:13.300]   for corporations and the ultra wealthy
[02:02:13.300 --> 02:02:16.980]   and even intelligence organizations
[02:02:16.980 --> 02:02:19.340]   is that we have tripwires.
[02:02:19.340 --> 02:02:22.860]   It's better, if you can't prevent from being hacked,
[02:02:22.860 --> 02:02:26.620]   the next best thing is to know as soon as you get hacked
[02:02:26.620 --> 02:02:28.940]   because then you can essentially terminate
[02:02:28.940 --> 02:02:30.500]   all the information.
[02:02:30.500 --> 02:02:31.580]   If you know it fast enough,
[02:02:31.580 --> 02:02:32.900]   you can just destroy the information.
[02:02:32.900 --> 02:02:34.260]   This is what the ultra wealthy do.
[02:02:34.260 --> 02:02:36.060]   They have multiple phones.
[02:02:36.060 --> 02:02:38.860]   So as soon as one phone gets hacked, the tripwire goes off.
[02:02:38.860 --> 02:02:40.460]   The operating system is totally deleted
[02:02:40.460 --> 02:02:42.020]   along with all data on the phone.
[02:02:42.020 --> 02:02:44.380]   And a second phone is turned on
[02:02:44.380 --> 02:02:47.500]   with a whole new separate set of metadata.
[02:02:47.500 --> 02:02:49.820]   And now they, for them, there's no break in service.
[02:02:49.820 --> 02:02:52.020]   It's just, oh, this phone went black.
[02:02:52.020 --> 02:02:54.180]   It's got a warning on it that says it was hacked.
[02:02:54.180 --> 02:02:55.500]   So trash it 'cause they don't care
[02:02:55.500 --> 02:02:56.420]   about the price of the phone.
[02:02:56.420 --> 02:02:58.620]   Pick up the next phone and we move on.
[02:02:58.620 --> 02:03:01.060]   That's the best thing that you can do essentially
[02:03:01.060 --> 02:03:03.900]   outside of trying to out-hack the hackers.
[02:03:03.900 --> 02:03:06.860]   And then even in your intelligence and military worlds
[02:03:06.860 --> 02:03:09.540]   where cyber warfare is active,
[02:03:09.540 --> 02:03:11.740]   the people who are aggressing
[02:03:11.740 --> 02:03:16.400]   are not trying to create aggression that beats security.
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:19.220]   They're trying to find aggressive techniques,
[02:03:19.220 --> 02:03:21.860]   offensive techniques that have no security
[02:03:21.860 --> 02:03:23.220]   built around them yet.
[02:03:23.220 --> 02:03:26.020]   Because it's too cost and time intensive
[02:03:26.020 --> 02:03:28.740]   to protect against what you know is coming.
[02:03:28.740 --> 02:03:30.880]   It's so much more efficient and cost-effective
[02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:32.780]   to go after new vectors.
[02:03:32.780 --> 02:03:34.740]   So it just becomes like,
[02:03:34.740 --> 02:03:38.820]   it becomes almost a silly game of,
[02:03:38.820 --> 02:03:41.220]   your neighbor gets a guard dog,
[02:03:41.220 --> 02:03:43.020]   so you get a bigger guard dog.
[02:03:43.020 --> 02:03:45.020]   And then your neighbor gets a fence,
[02:03:45.020 --> 02:03:46.340]   so you're just constantly outdoing each other.
[02:03:46.340 --> 02:03:48.580]   It's called the security paradigm.
[02:03:48.580 --> 02:03:50.700]   People just, they just one-up each other
[02:03:50.700 --> 02:03:53.100]   because it's never worth it to just get to the same level.
[02:03:53.100 --> 02:03:54.620]   You're always trying to outdo each other.
[02:03:54.620 --> 02:03:58.140]   - Yeah, and then maybe like banks have to fight that fight,
[02:03:58.140 --> 02:04:00.660]   but not everybody can. - Not us, right.
[02:04:00.660 --> 02:04:02.400]   - Yeah, no, so you're saying I operate
[02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:04.140]   at the state of the art with the Tripwires.
[02:04:04.140 --> 02:04:06.260]   This is good to know. - Absolutely, man.
[02:04:06.260 --> 02:04:10.100]   - And also just not using anybody else's services,
[02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:12.660]   doing everything myself,
[02:04:12.660 --> 02:04:14.020]   so that it's harder to figure out
[02:04:14.020 --> 02:04:15.220]   what the heck this person is doing.
[02:04:15.220 --> 02:04:17.100]   'Cause if I'm using somebody else's service,
[02:04:17.100 --> 02:04:21.740]   like I did with QNAP. (laughs)
[02:04:21.740 --> 02:04:24.500]   I have a QNAP NAS I use for cold storage
[02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:27.300]   of unimportant things but are large videos.
[02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:28.380]   And I don't know if you know,
[02:04:28.380 --> 02:04:32.260]   but QNAP is a company that does NAS storage devices.
[02:04:32.260 --> 02:04:34.020]   And they got hacked.
[02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:38.820]   And everybody that didn't update as of a week ago
[02:04:38.820 --> 02:04:41.580]   from the point of the zero-day hack,
[02:04:41.580 --> 02:04:42.540]   everybody got hacked.
[02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:44.500]   It's several thousands of machines.
[02:04:44.500 --> 02:04:46.200]   And they asked,
[02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:50.600]   "You can get your data back if you pay,"
[02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:53.020]   I forget what it was, but it was,
[02:04:53.020 --> 02:04:55.420]   it was about a couple thousand dollars.
[02:04:55.420 --> 02:04:59.100]   And QNAP can get all the data back for their customers
[02:04:59.100 --> 02:05:00.820]   if they pay, I think, $2 million.
[02:05:00.820 --> 02:05:04.580]   But that came from me relying on the systems
[02:05:04.580 --> 02:05:05.620]   of others for security.
[02:05:05.620 --> 02:05:10.620]   I assumed this company would have their security handled.
[02:05:10.620 --> 02:05:13.320]   But then that was a very valuable lesson to me.
[02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:17.380]   I now have layers of security
[02:05:17.380 --> 02:05:21.460]   and also an understanding which data is really important,
[02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:24.300]   which is somewhat important, which is not that important.
[02:05:24.300 --> 02:05:26.500]   And layering that all together.
[02:05:26.500 --> 02:05:29.020]   - So just so you know, the US government, the military,
[02:05:29.020 --> 02:05:31.940]   woke up to that exact same thing about two years ago.
[02:05:31.940 --> 02:05:33.420]   It's still very new.
[02:05:33.420 --> 02:05:35.380]   I mean, they were sourcing,
[02:05:35.380 --> 02:05:37.540]   take night vision goggles, for example.
[02:05:37.540 --> 02:05:40.020]   They were sourcing components and engineering
[02:05:40.020 --> 02:05:41.700]   and blueprints for night vision goggles
[02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:44.020]   from three, four, five different subcontractors
[02:05:44.020 --> 02:05:45.420]   all over the country.
[02:05:45.420 --> 02:05:47.200]   But they never asked themselves
[02:05:47.200 --> 02:05:50.660]   what the security status was of those subcontractors.
[02:05:50.660 --> 02:05:54.780]   So, you know, fast forward a few years
[02:05:54.780 --> 02:05:57.900]   and all of a sudden they start getting faulty components.
[02:05:57.900 --> 02:06:00.060]   They start having night vision goggles that don't work.
[02:06:00.060 --> 02:06:02.080]   They start having supply chain issues
[02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:04.500]   where they have to change their provider.
[02:06:04.500 --> 02:06:07.780]   And the army doesn't know that the provider is changing.
[02:06:07.780 --> 02:06:09.300]   I mean, this is a strategy.
[02:06:09.300 --> 02:06:12.780]   The idea of going through third-party systems
[02:06:12.780 --> 02:06:15.420]   is identifying the vulnerability in the supply chain.
[02:06:15.420 --> 02:06:20.020]   That's a savvy offensive practice
[02:06:20.020 --> 02:06:24.260]   for more than just cyber hackers.
[02:06:24.260 --> 02:06:26.540]   - Let me ask you about physical hacking.
[02:06:26.540 --> 02:06:29.180]   So I'm now, like I'm an introvert,
[02:06:29.180 --> 02:06:31.340]   so I'm paranoid about all social interaction,
[02:06:31.340 --> 02:06:35.700]   but how much truth is there?
[02:06:35.700 --> 02:06:37.500]   It's kind of a funny question.
[02:06:37.500 --> 02:06:40.460]   How suspicious should I be when I'm traveling in Ukraine
[02:06:40.460 --> 02:06:42.020]   or different parts of the world
[02:06:42.020 --> 02:06:44.340]   when an attractive female walks up to me
[02:06:44.340 --> 02:06:46.100]   and shows any kind of attention?
[02:06:46.100 --> 02:06:46.940]   (Lex laughing)
[02:06:46.940 --> 02:06:49.900]   Is that like this kind of James Bond spy movie stuff
[02:06:49.900 --> 02:06:54.020]   or is that kind of stuff used by intelligence agencies?
[02:06:54.020 --> 02:06:55.820]   - I don't think it's used.
[02:06:55.820 --> 02:06:56.700]   It's absolutely used.
[02:06:56.700 --> 02:06:58.100]   It's called sexpionage.
[02:06:58.100 --> 02:07:02.660]   That's the term that we jokingly call it, is sexpionage.
[02:07:02.660 --> 02:07:05.940]   But yeah, the art of attraction, appeal,
[02:07:05.940 --> 02:07:11.380]   the manifestation of feelings through sexual manipulation,
[02:07:11.380 --> 02:07:14.320]   all of that is a super powerful tool.
[02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:15.740]   The Chinese use it extremely well.
[02:07:15.740 --> 02:07:18.020]   The Russians use it extremely well.
[02:07:18.020 --> 02:07:21.620]   In the United States, we actively train our officers
[02:07:21.620 --> 02:07:24.780]   not to use it because in the end,
[02:07:24.780 --> 02:07:26.700]   it leads to complications
[02:07:26.700 --> 02:07:28.420]   in how you professionally run a case.
[02:07:28.420 --> 02:07:30.140]   So we train our officers not to use it.
[02:07:30.140 --> 02:07:33.360]   However, you can't control what other people think.
[02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:34.740]   So if you're an attractive male
[02:07:34.740 --> 02:07:36.100]   or an attractive female officer,
[02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:40.460]   and you're trying to talk to an older general
[02:07:40.460 --> 02:07:43.380]   who just happens to be gay or happens to be straight
[02:07:43.380 --> 02:07:44.680]   and is attracted to you,
[02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:45.980]   of course, they're gonna be that much more willing
[02:07:45.980 --> 02:07:48.860]   to talk to an American who is also attractive.
[02:07:48.860 --> 02:07:50.740]   So it's hard to walk that back.
[02:07:50.740 --> 02:07:51.660]   - In all definitions.
[02:07:51.660 --> 02:07:54.340]   So it could be all elements of charisma.
[02:07:54.340 --> 02:08:00.980]   So attractiveness in a dynamic sense of the word.
[02:08:00.980 --> 02:08:02.140]   So it's visual attractiveness,
[02:08:02.140 --> 02:08:05.680]   but the smile, the humor, the wit, the flirting,
[02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:07.740]   all that kind of stuff that could be used
[02:08:07.740 --> 02:08:10.740]   to the art of conversation.
[02:08:10.740 --> 02:08:12.500]   - There's also elements of sexuality
[02:08:12.500 --> 02:08:14.740]   that people underestimate, right?
[02:08:14.740 --> 02:08:16.460]   So physical sexuality,
[02:08:16.460 --> 02:08:18.100]   physical attraction is the most obvious one.
[02:08:18.100 --> 02:08:20.580]   It's the one that everybody talks about and thinks about.
[02:08:20.580 --> 02:08:23.220]   But then there's also sapiosexuality,
[02:08:23.220 --> 02:08:25.260]   which is being sexually attracted
[02:08:25.260 --> 02:08:28.540]   to thoughts, to intelligence.
[02:08:28.540 --> 02:08:31.220]   And then you got all the various varieties
[02:08:31.220 --> 02:08:34.100]   of personal preferences.
[02:08:34.100 --> 02:08:36.700]   Some people like people of a certain color skin,
[02:08:36.700 --> 02:08:39.120]   or they like big noses, they like small noses,
[02:08:39.120 --> 02:08:40.780]   they like big butts, they like small butts,
[02:08:40.780 --> 02:08:42.260]   they like tall guys, they like bald guys,
[02:08:42.260 --> 02:08:43.940]   whatever it might be.
[02:08:43.940 --> 02:08:47.260]   You can't ever predict what someone's preferences,
[02:08:47.260 --> 02:08:50.980]   sexual arousal preferences are going to be.
[02:08:50.980 --> 02:08:53.540]   So then you end up walking into a situation
[02:08:53.540 --> 02:08:55.540]   where then you discover, you know,
[02:08:55.540 --> 02:08:59.100]   and just imagine, imagine being an unattractive,
[02:08:59.100 --> 02:09:01.140]   overweight, married guy,
[02:09:01.140 --> 02:09:04.780]   and you're walking into an asset or a target meeting
[02:09:04.780 --> 02:09:06.540]   with like a middle-aged female
[02:09:06.540 --> 02:09:09.020]   who is also not very attractive and also married.
[02:09:09.020 --> 02:09:11.700]   But then it turns out that that person is a sapiosexual
[02:09:11.700 --> 02:09:14.580]   and gets extremely turned on by intelligent conversation.
[02:09:14.580 --> 02:09:16.300]   That's exactly what you're there to do.
[02:09:16.300 --> 02:09:20.100]   Your mission is to have intelligent conversation
[02:09:20.100 --> 02:09:22.300]   with this person to find out if they have access to secrets.
[02:09:22.300 --> 02:09:24.620]   And by virtue of you carrying out your mission,
[02:09:24.620 --> 02:09:26.740]   they become extremely aroused and attracted to you.
[02:09:26.740 --> 02:09:29.620]   That is a very complicated situation.
[02:09:29.620 --> 02:09:30.780]   - Hard to know to trust.
[02:09:30.780 --> 02:09:32.700]   Like how do you know your wife,
[02:09:32.700 --> 02:09:33.640]   or how does your wife know
[02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:36.120]   that you're not a double agent from Russia?
[02:09:37.420 --> 02:09:42.020]   - There's a large element of experience and time
[02:09:42.020 --> 02:09:43.100]   that goes into that.
[02:09:43.100 --> 02:09:44.300]   She's also trained.
[02:09:44.300 --> 02:09:47.260]   And I think my wife and I also--
[02:09:47.260 --> 02:09:48.100]   - That's what you think.
[02:09:48.100 --> 02:09:50.340]   - Yeah, my wife and I also have the benefit
[02:09:50.340 --> 02:09:55.340]   of being recruited young and together where--
[02:09:55.340 --> 02:09:58.740]   - So over time, you can start to figure out things
[02:09:58.740 --> 02:10:00.500]   that are very difficult to,
[02:10:00.500 --> 02:10:03.380]   so you form the baseline,
[02:10:03.380 --> 02:10:04.820]   you start to understand the person's very,
[02:10:04.820 --> 02:10:06.100]   it becomes very difficult to lie.
[02:10:06.100 --> 02:10:08.380]   - The most difficult thing in the world is consistency.
[02:10:08.380 --> 02:10:10.500]   It's the most difficult thing in the world.
[02:10:10.500 --> 02:10:12.940]   Some people say that discipline or self-discipline,
[02:10:12.940 --> 02:10:14.820]   what they're really talking about is consistency.
[02:10:14.820 --> 02:10:17.300]   When you have someone who performs consistently
[02:10:17.300 --> 02:10:20.540]   over long periods of time, under various levels of stress,
[02:10:20.540 --> 02:10:22.000]   you have high, high confidence
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.680]   that that is the person that you can trust.
[02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:26.540]   You can trust, again, you can trust them
[02:10:26.540 --> 02:10:30.260]   to behave within a certain pattern.
[02:10:30.260 --> 02:10:33.200]   You can trust an asshole to be an asshole
[02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:36.760]   without trusting the asshole to take care of your kids.
[02:10:36.760 --> 02:10:40.040]   So I don't ever wanna mix up the idea of personal trust
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:42.400]   versus trusting the outcome.
[02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:44.560]   You can always trust a person to operate
[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:45.760]   within their pattern of behavior.
[02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:50.560]   It just takes time for you to get consistent feedback
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:52.280]   as to what that baseline is for them.
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:55.320]   - To form a good model, predictive model
[02:10:55.320 --> 02:10:57.120]   of what their behavior's going to be like.
[02:10:57.120 --> 02:10:58.440]   - Right, and you know, it's fascinating
[02:10:58.440 --> 02:11:02.420]   'cause I think the challenge is building that model quickly.
[02:11:03.300 --> 02:11:05.840]   So technology is one of those tools
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:07.060]   that will be able in the future
[02:11:07.060 --> 02:11:10.180]   to very quickly create a model of behavior
[02:11:10.180 --> 02:11:13.660]   because technology can pull in multiple data points
[02:11:13.660 --> 02:11:15.300]   in a very short period of time
[02:11:15.300 --> 02:11:17.860]   that the human brain simply can't pull in
[02:11:17.860 --> 02:11:20.140]   at the same period, at the same space, at the same speed.
[02:11:20.140 --> 02:11:22.340]   - Well, that's actually what I did my PhD on.
[02:11:22.340 --> 02:11:23.500]   That's what I did at Google,
[02:11:23.500 --> 02:11:26.000]   is forming a good representation,
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:29.340]   unique representation across the entire world
[02:11:29.340 --> 02:11:31.260]   based on the behavior of the person.
[02:11:31.260 --> 02:11:34.500]   The specific task there is so that you
[02:11:34.500 --> 02:11:35.780]   don't have to type in the password.
[02:11:35.780 --> 02:11:38.100]   The idea was to replace the password.
[02:11:38.100 --> 02:11:40.700]   But it also allows you to actually study human behavior
[02:11:40.700 --> 02:11:41.740]   and to think, all right,
[02:11:41.740 --> 02:11:44.100]   what is the unique representation of a person?
[02:11:44.100 --> 02:11:48.820]   'Cause we have very specific patterns
[02:11:48.820 --> 02:11:51.340]   and a lot of humans are very similar in those patterns.
[02:11:51.340 --> 02:11:52.980]   What are the unique identifiers
[02:11:52.980 --> 02:11:55.220]   within those patterns of behavior?
[02:11:55.220 --> 02:11:57.580]   And I think that's, from a psychology perspective,
[02:11:57.580 --> 02:11:59.300]   a super fascinating question.
[02:11:59.300 --> 02:12:00.980]   And from a machine learning perspective,
[02:12:00.980 --> 02:12:02.300]   it's something that you can,
[02:12:02.300 --> 02:12:04.620]   as the systems get better and better and better,
[02:12:04.620 --> 02:12:07.140]   and as we get more and more digital data
[02:12:07.140 --> 02:12:08.300]   about each individual,
[02:12:08.300 --> 02:12:11.740]   you start to be able to do that kind of thing effectively.
[02:12:11.740 --> 02:12:13.180]   - And it's, I mean, when I think of the fact
[02:12:13.180 --> 02:12:14.980]   that you could create a dossier on somebody
[02:12:14.980 --> 02:12:16.940]   in a matter of 24 or 48 hours,
[02:12:16.940 --> 02:12:21.140]   if you could wire them for two days, right?
[02:12:21.140 --> 02:12:22.340]   Internet of Things style.
[02:12:22.340 --> 02:12:23.780]   You put it in their underwear or whatever, right?
[02:12:23.780 --> 02:12:26.420]   Some chip that just reads everything.
[02:12:26.420 --> 02:12:27.580]   How heavy are they walking?
[02:12:27.580 --> 02:12:28.960]   How much time do they sleep?
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:30.580]   How many times do they open the refrigerator?
[02:12:30.580 --> 02:12:32.860]   When they log into their computer, how do they do it?
[02:12:32.860 --> 02:12:35.300]   Which hand do they use when they log in?
[02:12:35.300 --> 02:12:36.900]   What's their most common swipe?
[02:12:36.900 --> 02:12:38.420]   What's their most visited website?
[02:12:38.420 --> 02:12:42.740]   You could collect an enormous amount of normative data
[02:12:42.740 --> 02:12:43.660]   in a short period of time,
[02:12:43.660 --> 02:12:47.780]   where otherwise we're stuck the way that we do it now.
[02:12:47.780 --> 02:12:51.140]   Once or twice a week, we go out for a coffee for two hours.
[02:12:51.140 --> 02:12:52.220]   And two hours at a time,
[02:12:52.220 --> 02:12:55.000]   over the course of six, eight weeks, 12 weeks,
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:58.020]   you're coming up with a 50% assessment
[02:12:58.020 --> 02:13:00.420]   on how you think this person is going to behave.
[02:13:00.820 --> 02:13:02.720]   Just that time savings is immense.
[02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:06.300]   - Something you've also spoken about is private intelligence
[02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:10.560]   and the power and the reach and the scale
[02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:12.300]   and the importance of private intelligence
[02:13:12.300 --> 02:13:13.460]   versus government intelligence.
[02:13:13.460 --> 02:13:16.980]   Can you elaborate on the role of what is private intelligence
[02:13:16.980 --> 02:13:19.500]   and what's the role of private intelligence
[02:13:19.500 --> 02:13:22.300]   in the scope of all the intelligence
[02:13:22.300 --> 02:13:26.340]   that is gathered and used in the United States?
[02:13:26.340 --> 02:13:27.620]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[02:13:27.620 --> 02:13:30.620]   It's something that so few people know about.
[02:13:30.620 --> 02:13:33.920]   And it became a more mainstream topic
[02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:35.780]   with the Trump administration,
[02:13:35.780 --> 02:13:37.540]   because Trump made it no secret
[02:13:37.540 --> 02:13:40.300]   that he was going to hire private intelligence organizations
[02:13:40.300 --> 02:13:43.140]   to run his intelligence operations and fund them.
[02:13:43.140 --> 02:13:44.940]   So that really brought it to the mainstream.
[02:13:44.940 --> 02:13:46.860]   But going all the way back to 9/11,
[02:13:46.860 --> 02:13:48.900]   going all the way back to 2001,
[02:13:48.900 --> 02:13:51.980]   when the 9/11 attacks happened,
[02:13:51.980 --> 02:13:56.140]   there was a commission that was formed
[02:13:56.140 --> 02:14:00.700]   to determine the reasons that 9/11 happened.
[02:14:00.700 --> 02:14:02.460]   And among the lists that they determined,
[02:14:02.460 --> 02:14:04.180]   of course, they found out that the intelligence community
[02:14:04.180 --> 02:14:06.340]   wasn't coordinating well with each other.
[02:14:06.340 --> 02:14:08.320]   There were fiefdoms and there was infighting
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:10.340]   and there wasn't good intel sharing.
[02:14:10.340 --> 02:14:13.220]   But more than that, they identified that we were operating
[02:14:13.220 --> 02:14:18.260]   at Cold War levels, even though we were living in a time
[02:14:18.260 --> 02:14:20.440]   when terrorism was the new biggest threat
[02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:22.000]   to national security.
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:25.540]   So the big recommendation coming out of the 9/11 commission
[02:14:25.540 --> 02:14:27.380]   was that the intelligence organizations,
[02:14:27.380 --> 02:14:28.620]   the intelligence community,
[02:14:28.620 --> 02:14:30.700]   significantly increased the presence
[02:14:30.700 --> 02:14:33.020]   of intelligence operators overseas
[02:14:33.020 --> 02:14:36.100]   and in terms of analytical capacity
[02:14:36.100 --> 02:14:38.160]   here in the United States.
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:42.020]   When they made that decision, it completely destroyed,
[02:14:42.020 --> 02:14:44.720]   it totally was incongruent
[02:14:44.720 --> 02:14:46.320]   with the existing hiring process,
[02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:48.700]   because the existing hiring process for CIA or NSA
[02:14:48.700 --> 02:14:51.020]   is a six to nine month process.
[02:14:51.020 --> 02:14:55.140]   The only way they could plus up their sizes fast enough
[02:14:55.140 --> 02:14:57.780]   was to bypass their own hiring
[02:14:57.780 --> 02:15:00.720]   and instead go direct to private organizations.
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:04.900]   So naturally the government contracted with the companies
[02:15:04.900 --> 02:15:07.640]   that they already had secure contracts with,
[02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:12.640]   Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Khaki, you name it.
[02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:15.340]   And then over time from 2001 to now,
[02:15:15.340 --> 02:15:17.500]   or I guess that started really in 2004
[02:15:17.500 --> 02:15:19.860]   when they started significantly increasing
[02:15:19.860 --> 02:15:22.100]   the presence of private intelligence officers.
[02:15:23.380 --> 02:15:26.540]   From then until now, it's become a budgetary thing,
[02:15:26.540 --> 02:15:30.240]   it's become a continuity of operations thing.
[02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:33.820]   And now the reason Northern Virginia
[02:15:33.820 --> 02:15:37.620]   has become one of the wealthiest zip codes in America
[02:15:37.620 --> 02:15:40.220]   is because of the incredible concentration
[02:15:40.220 --> 02:15:43.420]   of private intelligence that is supporting CIA, NSA,
[02:15:43.420 --> 02:15:46.940]   DIA, FBI, and all the slew of IC partners.
[02:15:46.940 --> 02:15:49.300]   - By the way, does Palantir play a role in this?
[02:15:49.300 --> 02:15:51.180]   - Palantir is one of those organizations
[02:15:51.180 --> 02:15:54.140]   that was trying to pitch their product
[02:15:54.140 --> 02:15:57.460]   to an intelligence community because they have,
[02:15:57.460 --> 02:15:59.940]   it's a fantastic product on paper.
[02:15:59.940 --> 02:16:05.300]   But the challenge was the proprietary services,
[02:16:05.300 --> 02:16:08.940]   the proprietary systems that we used in CIA
[02:16:08.940 --> 02:16:13.500]   prior to Palantir continued to outperform Palantir.
[02:16:13.500 --> 02:16:16.420]   So just like any other business decision,
[02:16:16.420 --> 02:16:18.680]   if you've got homegrown systems
[02:16:18.680 --> 02:16:20.260]   that outperform external systems
[02:16:20.260 --> 02:16:23.380]   then it's not worth it to share the internal information.
[02:16:23.380 --> 02:16:24.220]   - Got it.
[02:16:24.220 --> 02:16:29.220]   So what, the close connection between Peter Thiel
[02:16:29.220 --> 02:16:33.140]   and Donald Trump, did that have a role to play
[02:16:33.140 --> 02:16:37.780]   in the, in Donald Trump's leveraging
[02:16:37.780 --> 02:16:40.620]   of private intelligence or is that completely disjoint?
[02:16:40.620 --> 02:16:45.520]   - I think that they're related but only circumstantially.
[02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:46.700]   Because remember, Donald Trump
[02:16:46.700 --> 02:16:48.980]   wasn't really investing in CIA.
[02:16:48.980 --> 02:16:53.780]   So the last thing he wanted to do was spend his network,
[02:16:53.780 --> 02:16:56.220]   WASTA, WASTA is a term that we call influence.
[02:16:56.220 --> 02:16:58.080]   It's an Arabic term for influence.
[02:16:58.080 --> 02:17:02.060]   Trump didn't wanna use his WASTA putting Thiel into CIA
[02:17:02.060 --> 02:17:04.900]   only to lose Thiel's contract as soon as Trump left office.
[02:17:04.900 --> 02:17:08.040]   So instead it was more valuable to put Peter Thiel's tool
[02:17:08.040 --> 02:17:09.500]   to use in private intelligence.
[02:17:09.500 --> 02:17:11.360]   And then of course, I think he nominated Peter Thiel
[02:17:11.360 --> 02:17:15.420]   to be his secretary of defense, secretary of state.
[02:17:15.420 --> 02:17:17.180]   At some point in time, he tried to present,
[02:17:17.180 --> 02:17:19.140]   like presidentially appoint Peter Thiel
[02:17:19.140 --> 02:17:23.140]   into a position of government authority.
[02:17:23.140 --> 02:17:27.740]   - What do you think of figures like Peter Thiel?
[02:17:27.740 --> 02:17:30.860]   Do they wield, and I'm sure there's figures
[02:17:30.860 --> 02:17:35.260]   of similar scale and reach and power
[02:17:35.260 --> 02:17:37.140]   in private intelligence.
[02:17:37.140 --> 02:17:40.660]   What do you think about their role and power
[02:17:40.660 --> 02:17:44.460]   in this whole, like without public accountability
[02:17:44.460 --> 02:17:47.260]   that you would think directors of CIA perhaps have?
[02:17:47.260 --> 02:17:49.940]   - So this is where private intelligence
[02:17:49.940 --> 02:17:51.980]   has both a strength and a weakness.
[02:17:51.980 --> 02:17:56.180]   The ultimate law overriding,
[02:17:56.180 --> 02:17:58.140]   that's overseeing private intelligence
[02:17:58.140 --> 02:18:03.140]   is not government legislation.
[02:18:03.140 --> 02:18:05.580]   It's the law of economics.
[02:18:05.580 --> 02:18:07.520]   If they produce a superior product,
[02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:09.340]   then they will have a buyer.
[02:18:09.340 --> 02:18:11.300]   If they do not produce a superior product,
[02:18:11.300 --> 02:18:13.100]   they will not have a buyer.
[02:18:13.100 --> 02:18:16.300]   And that's a very simple business principle.
[02:18:16.300 --> 02:18:20.820]   Whereas in the current national security infrastructure,
[02:18:20.820 --> 02:18:22.900]   you can create a crap product,
[02:18:22.900 --> 02:18:25.700]   but the taxpayer dollars are always going to be spent.
[02:18:25.700 --> 02:18:28.100]   So it's really thrown things for a loop,
[02:18:28.100 --> 02:18:29.760]   especially during the Trump administration.
[02:18:29.760 --> 02:18:32.260]   And this is one of the things that I will always say
[02:18:32.260 --> 02:18:34.660]   I liked about the Trump administration.
[02:18:34.660 --> 02:18:38.700]   It put a big blazing bright light
[02:18:38.700 --> 02:18:41.740]   on all of the flaws within our system.
[02:18:41.740 --> 02:18:45.700]   One of those flaws being this executive power
[02:18:45.700 --> 02:18:47.420]   over the intelligence organizations
[02:18:47.420 --> 02:18:50.460]   and the lack of accountability
[02:18:50.460 --> 02:18:51.540]   for intelligence organizations
[02:18:51.540 --> 02:18:53.040]   to produce a superior product.
[02:18:53.040 --> 02:18:59.040]   When that light got shown down,
[02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:01.620]   that's when you also saw Trump start to go after,
[02:19:01.620 --> 02:19:02.920]   if you remember, there was a period
[02:19:02.920 --> 02:19:04.400]   where he was taking security clearances
[02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:06.460]   away from retiring officers.
[02:19:06.460 --> 02:19:08.700]   That became a big hot issue.
[02:19:08.700 --> 02:19:11.580]   That became something that people were very opposed to.
[02:19:11.580 --> 02:19:14.860]   When they didn't realize that process
[02:19:14.860 --> 02:19:17.140]   of taking security clearances away,
[02:19:17.140 --> 02:19:19.940]   that incentivized seasoned senior officers
[02:19:19.940 --> 02:19:21.780]   to stay in service.
[02:19:21.780 --> 02:19:24.140]   Because with private intelligence paying a premium
[02:19:24.140 --> 02:19:25.340]   during the Trump administration,
[02:19:25.340 --> 02:19:26.980]   because Trump was paying a premium
[02:19:26.980 --> 02:19:29.220]   to the private intelligence world,
[02:19:29.220 --> 02:19:33.060]   when senior officers found that it was more profitable
[02:19:33.060 --> 02:19:35.580]   to retire early, keep their clearance,
[02:19:35.580 --> 02:19:37.260]   and go work for Raytheon,
[02:19:37.260 --> 02:19:41.500]   Trump saw that as bypassing service to the American people.
[02:19:41.500 --> 02:19:44.060]   You've made a career in CIA, you've made a career in NSA,
[02:19:44.060 --> 02:19:44.960]   you should stay there.
[02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:46.760]   If you leave, you lose your clearance
[02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:49.340]   because you no longer have a need to know.
[02:19:49.340 --> 02:19:51.940]   He upset the apple cart with that.
[02:19:51.940 --> 02:19:54.760]   And unfortunately, the narrative that came out in many ways
[02:19:54.760 --> 02:19:56.420]   was a negative narrative against Trump,
[02:19:56.420 --> 02:20:00.140]   when in fact, he was actually doing quite a service
[02:20:00.140 --> 02:20:01.080]   to the American people,
[02:20:01.080 --> 02:20:06.080]   trying to take away the incentive of senior officials
[02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:09.180]   leaving their service in order to just profiteer
[02:20:09.180 --> 02:20:10.220]   in the private intelligence world.
[02:20:10.220 --> 02:20:15.220]   - So in that way, he was kind of supporting the CIA
[02:20:15.220 --> 02:20:19.860]   in making sure that competent people
[02:20:19.860 --> 02:20:22.940]   and experienced people stay in CIA,
[02:20:22.940 --> 02:20:24.020]   incentivized to stay there.
[02:20:24.020 --> 02:20:27.540]   - Correct, I think that there was definitely,
[02:20:27.540 --> 02:20:29.060]   he understood incentives.
[02:20:29.060 --> 02:20:31.260]   I mean, Donald Trump understands incentives.
[02:20:31.260 --> 02:20:34.220]   So he was trying to incentivize them to stay,
[02:20:34.220 --> 02:20:36.860]   but I think he was also playing a safety card
[02:20:36.860 --> 02:20:40.220]   because he didn't want former CIA officials
[02:20:40.220 --> 02:20:42.180]   who were not listening to him
[02:20:42.180 --> 02:20:44.180]   to then move into private intel organizations
[02:20:44.180 --> 02:20:45.660]   that he may be hiring,
[02:20:45.660 --> 02:20:47.780]   only to then have them undermine him
[02:20:47.780 --> 02:20:49.460]   from both sides of the coin.
[02:20:49.460 --> 02:20:53.220]   So there was a little bit of offensive calculation
[02:20:53.220 --> 02:20:54.060]   in there as well.
[02:20:54.060 --> 02:20:56.700]   - But do the dynamics and the incentives of economics
[02:20:56.700 --> 02:20:58.820]   that you referred to that the private intelligence
[02:20:58.820 --> 02:21:01.940]   operates under, is that more or less ethical
[02:21:01.940 --> 02:21:06.740]   than the forces that maybe government agencies
[02:21:06.740 --> 02:21:07.580]   operate under?
[02:21:07.580 --> 02:21:08.540]   Like, what's your intuition?
[02:21:08.540 --> 02:21:12.780]   Is capitalism lead, so you mentioned it leads
[02:21:12.780 --> 02:21:16.900]   to maximizations of efficiency and performance,
[02:21:16.900 --> 02:21:19.940]   but is that correlated with ethical behavior
[02:21:19.940 --> 02:21:24.100]   when we're talking about such hairy activities
[02:21:24.100 --> 02:21:26.180]   like collection of intelligence?
[02:21:26.180 --> 02:21:27.940]   - The question of ethics is a great question.
[02:21:27.940 --> 02:21:31.660]   So let me start this whole thing out by saying,
[02:21:31.660 --> 02:21:36.660]   CIA hires people on a spectrum of our ability
[02:21:36.660 --> 02:21:41.900]   to be morally flexible, ethically flexible.
[02:21:41.900 --> 02:21:45.340]   All people at their heart are ethically flexible.
[02:21:45.340 --> 02:21:48.100]   I would never punch somebody in the face, right?
[02:21:48.100 --> 02:21:48.940]   Some people out there would say,
[02:21:48.940 --> 02:21:51.180]   "I would never hurt another human being."
[02:21:51.180 --> 02:21:53.740]   But as soon as a human being posed a direct threat
[02:21:53.740 --> 02:21:56.860]   to their daughter or their son or their mother,
[02:21:56.860 --> 02:21:58.100]   now all of a sudden they're gonna change
[02:21:58.100 --> 02:22:01.540]   their ethical stance in self-defense, right?
[02:22:01.540 --> 02:22:02.380]   But at the end of the day,
[02:22:02.380 --> 02:22:05.300]   it's still hurting another person.
[02:22:05.300 --> 02:22:07.540]   So what CIA looks for is people who are able
[02:22:07.540 --> 02:22:12.540]   to swing across that spectrum for lesser offenses, right?
[02:22:12.540 --> 02:22:16.320]   More flexibility.
[02:22:16.320 --> 02:22:21.820]   I do not believe that private intelligence
[02:22:21.820 --> 02:22:24.540]   and the laws of economics lend themselves
[02:22:24.540 --> 02:22:28.540]   to increased ethics or increased ethical behavior
[02:22:28.540 --> 02:22:29.580]   in the short term.
[02:22:30.500 --> 02:22:34.100]   But what ends up happening is that in the long term,
[02:22:34.100 --> 02:22:37.440]   in order to scale economic benefits,
[02:22:37.440 --> 02:22:42.440]   you are forced to act within norms of your customer base.
[02:22:42.440 --> 02:22:45.860]   So as the norms of that customer base
[02:22:45.860 --> 02:22:48.100]   dictate certain requirements,
[02:22:48.100 --> 02:22:50.540]   the company has to adapt to those requirements
[02:22:50.540 --> 02:22:52.960]   in order to continue to scale.
[02:22:52.960 --> 02:22:56.960]   So if a company tries to ostracize LGBTQ,
[02:22:58.740 --> 02:23:02.780]   or if they try to ostracize men or ostracize women,
[02:23:02.780 --> 02:23:05.640]   they're limiting their ability to grow economically.
[02:23:05.640 --> 02:23:09.740]   They have to adapt to whatever is the prevailing
[02:23:09.740 --> 02:23:12.500]   ethical requirement of their customer base.
[02:23:12.500 --> 02:23:13.740]   - That's such an interesting question
[02:23:13.740 --> 02:23:16.820]   'cause you look at big pharma and pharmaceutical companies
[02:23:16.820 --> 02:23:22.780]   and they have quite a poor reputation in the public eye.
[02:23:22.780 --> 02:23:27.300]   And some of it, maybe much of it is deserved,
[02:23:27.300 --> 02:23:29.580]   at least historically speaking.
[02:23:29.580 --> 02:23:32.100]   And so you start to wonder, well,
[02:23:32.100 --> 02:23:36.540]   can intelligence agencies use some of the same technique
[02:23:36.540 --> 02:23:38.920]   to manipulate the public,
[02:23:38.920 --> 02:23:42.940]   like what they believe about those agencies
[02:23:42.940 --> 02:23:45.060]   in order to maximize profit as well?
[02:23:45.060 --> 02:23:49.960]   Sort of finding shortcuts or unethical paths
[02:23:49.960 --> 02:23:52.740]   that allow you to not be ultimately
[02:23:52.740 --> 02:23:55.060]   responsible to the customer.
[02:23:55.060 --> 02:23:58.860]   - Absolutely, and I would go a step further to say that
[02:23:58.860 --> 02:24:01.900]   the covert nature of intelligence operations
[02:24:01.900 --> 02:24:07.500]   is really attractive when it comes to the private sector,
[02:24:07.500 --> 02:24:10.160]   because now they have all the same money
[02:24:10.160 --> 02:24:11.980]   with none of the oversight
[02:24:11.980 --> 02:24:14.380]   and all they have to do is deliver.
[02:24:14.380 --> 02:24:18.540]   So without the oversight, what's holding you back?
[02:24:18.540 --> 02:24:21.660]   And for anybody who's ever run a business,
[02:24:21.660 --> 02:24:22.860]   anybody who's ever started a startup
[02:24:22.860 --> 02:24:24.220]   or tried to make something succeed,
[02:24:24.220 --> 02:24:26.540]   we all know that there come those times
[02:24:26.540 --> 02:24:31.540]   where you have to skirt the boundaries of propriety
[02:24:31.540 --> 02:24:36.960]   or morality or commitments or promises to other people,
[02:24:36.960 --> 02:24:38.900]   because at the end of the day,
[02:24:38.900 --> 02:24:41.300]   if your business fails, it's on you.
[02:24:41.300 --> 02:24:45.140]   So if you promise to deliver something to a client,
[02:24:45.140 --> 02:24:46.300]   you've got to deliver it to the client,
[02:24:46.300 --> 02:24:48.620]   even if that means you stay up late
[02:24:48.620 --> 02:24:51.060]   or if you lie on your taxes, whatever it might be,
[02:24:51.060 --> 02:24:53.560]   there's a certain level of do or die.
[02:24:53.560 --> 02:24:56.580]   - Yeah, I personally have a sort of optimistic view
[02:24:56.580 --> 02:24:59.380]   that ultimately the best way
[02:24:59.380 --> 02:25:01.260]   is to stay within the ethical bounds,
[02:25:01.260 --> 02:25:02.740]   kind of like what you suggested.
[02:25:02.740 --> 02:25:05.860]   If you want to be a company that's extremely successful,
[02:25:05.860 --> 02:25:09.860]   is win with competence, not with cheating,
[02:25:09.860 --> 02:25:14.120]   'cause cheating won't, I believe, win in the long term.
[02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:20.220]   But in terms of being publicly responsible
[02:25:21.140 --> 02:25:24.840]   to your decisions, I mean, I've already been supposed
[02:25:24.840 --> 02:25:27.160]   to talk to Peter Thiel twice on this podcast,
[02:25:27.160 --> 02:25:28.700]   and it's just been complicated.
[02:25:28.700 --> 02:25:29.920]   (Lex laughing)
[02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:32.120]   If I were to put myself into his shoes,
[02:25:32.120 --> 02:25:35.400]   why do podcasts?
[02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:40.000]   The risk is too high to be a public person at all.
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.240]   And so I totally understand that.
[02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:47.120]   At the same time, I think if you're doing things
[02:25:47.120 --> 02:25:52.120]   by the book and you're the best in the world at your job,
[02:25:52.120 --> 02:25:56.680]   then you have nothing to worry about.
[02:25:56.680 --> 02:25:59.880]   And you can advertise that, and you help recruit.
[02:25:59.880 --> 02:26:02.800]   I mean, that's the work of capitalism,
[02:26:02.800 --> 02:26:07.160]   is you want to advertise that this is the place
[02:26:07.160 --> 02:26:10.440]   where the best people in the world at this thing work.
[02:26:10.440 --> 02:26:14.160]   - True, I think that your point of view is accurate.
[02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:19.160]   I would also say that the complexities
[02:26:19.160 --> 02:26:21.120]   of what makes somebody make a decision
[02:26:21.120 --> 02:26:26.180]   can only really be properly calculated with a baseline.
[02:26:26.180 --> 02:26:28.320]   So because there is no baseline that you or I have
[02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:31.840]   on Peter Thiel, it's difficult to really ascertain
[02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:34.000]   why he does or doesn't accept invites
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:35.440]   or why he does or doesn't appear.
[02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:40.440]   - Well, let me ask your opinion on the NSA.
[02:26:40.440 --> 02:26:44.080]   And then maybe you can mention about a bulk connection
[02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:46.480]   and collection in general in the CIA.
[02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:51.200]   But let's look at some history with the NSA and Snowden.
[02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:55.040]   What's your opinion on the mass surveillance
[02:26:55.040 --> 02:27:00.920]   that is reported to have been conducted by the NSA?
[02:27:00.920 --> 02:27:04.760]   We talked about ethics.
[02:27:04.760 --> 02:27:09.760]   Are you troubled by the, from a public perception,
[02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:15.000]   the unethical nature of mass surveillance
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.920]   of especially American citizens?
[02:27:17.920 --> 02:27:21.880]   - This is a topic that I never get tired of talking about,
[02:27:21.880 --> 02:27:25.320]   but it's very rare that anyone ever really agrees with me,
[02:27:25.320 --> 02:27:26.160]   just so you know.
[02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:27.840]   (laughing)
[02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:29.480]   - So I see where you're, well,
[02:27:29.480 --> 02:27:31.000]   I think there's a nuanced thing here.
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:32.440]   Maybe we'll find some agreement.
[02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:37.440]   - The truth is that the American experience after 9/11
[02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:40.640]   is nothing like the American experience now.
[02:27:40.640 --> 02:27:45.080]   So all the terminology, all the talk about privacy
[02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:47.120]   and privacy laws and mass surveillance
[02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:48.240]   and all this other stuff,
[02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:50.520]   it was a completely different time then.
[02:27:50.520 --> 02:27:52.040]   And that's not to say it was an excuse,
[02:27:52.040 --> 02:27:54.440]   because to this day I will still say,
[02:27:54.440 --> 02:27:58.480]   mass collection, bulk collection of data
[02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:02.160]   that allows for an expedient identification
[02:28:02.160 --> 02:28:06.560]   of a threat to national security benefits all of us.
[02:28:06.560 --> 02:28:09.560]   But people don't understand what they want.
[02:28:09.560 --> 02:28:11.120]   Like people don't understand what the value
[02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:13.240]   of their own privacy is.
[02:28:13.240 --> 02:28:14.320]   First of all, the fact that people think
[02:28:14.320 --> 02:28:16.720]   they have personal privacy is laughable.
[02:28:16.720 --> 02:28:19.120]   You have no privacy.
[02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:20.600]   The cell phone that you carry in your pocket,
[02:28:20.600 --> 02:28:22.560]   you're giving permission to those apps constantly.
[02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:24.280]   You're giving commercial organizations,
[02:28:24.280 --> 02:28:25.600]   what you and I have already said,
[02:28:25.600 --> 02:28:28.720]   are less tied to ethical responsibility.
[02:28:28.720 --> 02:28:31.800]   You're giving them permission to collect enormous amounts
[02:28:31.800 --> 02:28:34.240]   of private data from you all the time.
[02:28:34.240 --> 02:28:37.520]   And do you know what happens if AT&T or Verizon
[02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:40.840]   sees some nefarious activity on your account?
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:42.120]   They do nothing.
[02:28:42.120 --> 02:28:44.800]   They might send a note to FBI
[02:28:44.800 --> 02:28:47.200]   because they have to according to some checklist.
[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:49.640]   But when NSA was collecting intelligence
[02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:51.840]   on metadata from around the United States,
[02:28:51.840 --> 02:28:55.000]   they were very specifically looking for terrorist threats
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:56.600]   that would harm American lives.
[02:28:56.600 --> 02:29:00.480]   I don't, man, NSA can clone my phone.
[02:29:00.480 --> 02:29:02.040]   I will give them my children's phone.
[02:29:02.040 --> 02:29:04.880]   I will give them the passwords to every one of my accounts.
[02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:07.160]   If it means that there's a likelihood
[02:29:07.160 --> 02:29:10.000]   that my family will be safer from a nefarious actor
[02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.280]   who's intent on hurting us.
[02:29:12.280 --> 02:29:15.080]   NSA doesn't care about your affair.
[02:29:15.080 --> 02:29:17.160]   NSA doesn't care if you're cheating on your taxes.
[02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:20.880]   NSA doesn't care if you talk shit about your boss
[02:29:20.880 --> 02:29:22.800]   or if you hate the US president.
[02:29:22.800 --> 02:29:24.600]   Nobody cares about that.
[02:29:24.600 --> 02:29:28.000]   Your intelligence community is there to find threats
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:29.520]   to national security.
[02:29:29.520 --> 02:29:31.840]   That's what they're there to do.
[02:29:31.840 --> 02:29:35.680]   What Snowden did when he outed that whole program,
[02:29:36.720 --> 02:29:38.960]   the fact that the court, the justice system,
[02:29:38.960 --> 02:29:41.400]   the civilian justice system went back
[02:29:41.400 --> 02:29:44.320]   and essentially overruled the ruling
[02:29:44.320 --> 02:29:47.040]   of the intelligence courts before them
[02:29:47.040 --> 02:29:51.720]   just goes to show how the general mass community
[02:29:51.720 --> 02:29:53.560]   really shouldn't have a say
[02:29:53.560 --> 02:29:55.720]   in what happens in the intelligence community.
[02:29:55.720 --> 02:29:56.880]   They really shouldn't.
[02:29:56.880 --> 02:30:00.800]   You have politicians and you have the opportunity
[02:30:00.800 --> 02:30:03.760]   to elect people to a position and then you trust them.
[02:30:03.760 --> 02:30:05.880]   That's what a representative republic is.
[02:30:05.880 --> 02:30:07.320]   You vote the people in,
[02:30:07.320 --> 02:30:09.080]   you trust them to work on your behalf.
[02:30:09.080 --> 02:30:11.720]   They make decisions without running them by you.
[02:30:11.720 --> 02:30:14.520]   They make decisions that they believe
[02:30:14.520 --> 02:30:16.280]   are in the best interest of their constituency
[02:30:16.280 --> 02:30:19.760]   and that's how our form of democracy works.
[02:30:19.760 --> 02:30:22.080]   It worked.
[02:30:22.080 --> 02:30:23.560]   We were safer.
[02:30:23.560 --> 02:30:25.400]   Now that we don't have that information
[02:30:25.400 --> 02:30:27.240]   and now that there's this giant looming question
[02:30:27.240 --> 02:30:28.880]   of whether or not NSA is there to serve people
[02:30:28.880 --> 02:30:31.200]   or is collecting mass surveillance
[02:30:31.200 --> 02:30:33.400]   against all American people,
[02:30:33.400 --> 02:30:35.600]   that's not really a true accurate representation
[02:30:35.600 --> 02:30:36.880]   of what they were ever doing.
[02:30:36.880 --> 02:30:39.320]   They were looking for the needle in a haystack
[02:30:39.320 --> 02:30:42.680]   of the series of transactions in metadata
[02:30:42.680 --> 02:30:45.560]   that was going to lead to American deaths.
[02:30:45.560 --> 02:30:48.920]   We are now less secure because they can't do that
[02:30:48.920 --> 02:30:50.760]   and that bothers me.
[02:30:50.760 --> 02:30:53.800]   - So you said a few really interesting things there.
[02:30:53.800 --> 02:30:56.600]   So because you are kind of an insider,
[02:30:56.600 --> 02:30:58.200]   were for a time an insider,
[02:30:58.200 --> 02:31:00.640]   meaning you were able to build up an intuition
[02:31:00.640 --> 02:31:05.640]   about the good, the bad, and the ugly of these institutions,
[02:31:05.640 --> 02:31:07.200]   specifically the good.
[02:31:07.200 --> 02:31:09.520]   A lot of people don't have a good sense of the good.
[02:31:09.520 --> 02:31:11.360]   They know the bad and the ugly
[02:31:11.360 --> 02:31:13.960]   or can infer the bad and the ugly.
[02:31:13.960 --> 02:31:18.200]   You mentioned that the one little key little thing there
[02:31:18.200 --> 02:31:22.520]   at the end saying the NSA doesn't care
[02:31:22.520 --> 02:31:24.840]   about whether you hate the president or not.
[02:31:24.840 --> 02:31:28.640]   Now that's what people really worry about
[02:31:28.640 --> 02:31:32.400]   is they're not sure they can trust the government
[02:31:32.400 --> 02:31:35.880]   to not go into full dictatorial mode
[02:31:35.880 --> 02:31:39.160]   and based on your political preference,
[02:31:39.160 --> 02:31:43.080]   your oppositions, basically one of the essential powers,
[02:31:43.080 --> 02:31:48.040]   the freedom of speech in the United States
[02:31:48.040 --> 02:31:49.680]   is the ability to criticize your government.
[02:31:49.680 --> 02:31:50.520]   - Exactly.
[02:31:50.520 --> 02:31:53.340]   - And that, they worry, well,
[02:31:53.340 --> 02:31:57.520]   can't the government get a hold of the NSA
[02:31:57.520 --> 02:31:59.720]   and start to ask the basic question,
[02:31:59.720 --> 02:32:02.320]   well, can you give me a list of people
[02:32:02.320 --> 02:32:03.840]   that are criticizing the government?
[02:32:03.840 --> 02:32:05.280]   - Think about, so let's just walk through
[02:32:05.280 --> 02:32:06.320]   that exact example, right?
[02:32:06.320 --> 02:32:08.760]   Because this is, it's a preponderance,
[02:32:08.760 --> 02:32:10.560]   it's a preponderous fear.
[02:32:10.560 --> 02:32:14.360]   It's a ridiculous fear because you would have to tap
[02:32:14.360 --> 02:32:16.880]   on multiple elements of government for anything to happen.
[02:32:16.880 --> 02:32:20.840]   So for example, let's just say that somebody goes to the NSA
[02:32:20.840 --> 02:32:22.560]   and says, hey, can you give us a readout
[02:32:22.560 --> 02:32:25.400]   on all the people who are tweeting terrible things
[02:32:25.400 --> 02:32:26.400]   about the president?
[02:32:26.400 --> 02:32:28.960]   Okay, cool, here's your hundred million people,
[02:32:28.960 --> 02:32:30.240]   whatever it is, right?
[02:32:30.240 --> 02:32:31.400]   Here's all the people saying negative things
[02:32:31.400 --> 02:32:32.680]   about the government.
[02:32:32.680 --> 02:32:34.200]   So now they have a list.
[02:32:34.200 --> 02:32:35.480]   What do they do next?
[02:32:35.480 --> 02:32:37.080]   Well, let's just make it simple.
[02:32:37.080 --> 02:32:40.220]   They stay with NSA and they say, surveil them even more,
[02:32:40.220 --> 02:32:42.580]   tap their phones, tap their computers,
[02:32:42.580 --> 02:32:43.480]   I wanna know even more.
[02:32:43.480 --> 02:32:46.280]   So then they get this preponderance of evidence.
[02:32:46.280 --> 02:32:47.920]   What do you do with evidence?
[02:32:47.920 --> 02:32:49.920]   You take it to a court.
[02:32:49.920 --> 02:32:52.760]   Well, guess what no court is going to support?
[02:32:52.760 --> 02:32:56.920]   Anything that goes against the freedom of speech.
[02:32:56.920 --> 02:32:59.600]   So the court is not going to support what the executive
[02:32:59.600 --> 02:33:01.120]   is asking them to do.
[02:33:01.120 --> 02:33:03.080]   Even before you take somebody to court,
[02:33:03.080 --> 02:33:05.240]   you have to involve law enforcement.
[02:33:05.240 --> 02:33:08.100]   Essentially, you have to send some sort of police force
[02:33:08.100 --> 02:33:11.520]   to go apprehend the individual who's in question.
[02:33:11.520 --> 02:33:13.580]   Well, guess what doesn't meet criteria
[02:33:13.580 --> 02:33:16.480]   for any police force anywhere in the United States?
[02:33:16.480 --> 02:33:20.800]   Arresting people who say negative things
[02:33:20.800 --> 02:33:21.660]   about the president.
[02:33:21.660 --> 02:33:25.140]   Now, if somebody poses a threat to the life
[02:33:25.140 --> 02:33:27.860]   of a public figure or the threat to life of a politician,
[02:33:27.860 --> 02:33:29.360]   that's a completely different case,
[02:33:29.360 --> 02:33:31.320]   which means the standards of evidence are much higher
[02:33:31.320 --> 02:33:32.760]   for them to arrest that person.
[02:33:32.760 --> 02:33:36.200]   So unless you create a secret police force,
[02:33:36.200 --> 02:33:37.960]   then your actual public police force
[02:33:37.960 --> 02:33:39.280]   is never gonna take action.
[02:33:39.280 --> 02:33:42.720]   So all these people who are afraid of this exact situation
[02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:43.720]   that you're outlining,
[02:33:43.720 --> 02:33:46.700]   they need the creation of a secret police force,
[02:33:46.700 --> 02:33:48.620]   the creation of a secret court that operates
[02:33:48.620 --> 02:33:50.160]   outside the judicial system,
[02:33:50.160 --> 02:33:52.120]   the creation of a secret intelligence service
[02:33:52.120 --> 02:33:54.920]   that operates outside of foreign intelligence collection,
[02:33:54.920 --> 02:33:58.360]   all so that a handful of people who don't like the president
[02:33:58.360 --> 02:34:02.720]   get what, whisked away, assassinated, put in prison?
[02:34:02.720 --> 02:34:04.480]   Who knows what?
[02:34:04.480 --> 02:34:06.180]   Think about the resources that would be,
[02:34:06.180 --> 02:34:08.340]   the amount of money and time
[02:34:08.340 --> 02:34:10.900]   and how hard would it be to keep that secret,
[02:34:10.900 --> 02:34:13.040]   to have all of those things in motion.
[02:34:13.040 --> 02:34:15.880]   The reason it worked in Russia and Soviet Germany
[02:34:15.880 --> 02:34:19.560]   or Russia and communist Germany was because everybody knew
[02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:21.120]   there was a secret police.
[02:34:21.120 --> 02:34:24.720]   Everybody knew that there was a threat to speaking out
[02:34:24.720 --> 02:34:25.560]   against the government.
[02:34:25.560 --> 02:34:26.840]   It's completely different here.
[02:34:26.840 --> 02:34:28.700]   - Well, so there's a lot to say.
[02:34:28.700 --> 02:34:32.120]   So one is yes, if I was a dictator
[02:34:32.120 --> 02:34:35.400]   and I wanted to, and just looking at history,
[02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:38.400]   let me take myself out of it,
[02:34:38.400 --> 02:34:41.040]   but I think one of the more effective ways
[02:34:41.040 --> 02:34:43.040]   is you don't need the surveillance.
[02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:44.920]   You can pick out a random person
[02:34:45.480 --> 02:34:49.380]   and in a public display, semi-public display,
[02:34:49.380 --> 02:34:54.440]   basically put them in jail for opposing the government,
[02:34:54.440 --> 02:34:56.080]   whether they oppose it or not.
[02:34:56.080 --> 02:34:59.480]   And the fear, that sends a message to a lot of people.
[02:34:59.480 --> 02:35:02.120]   - That's exactly what you see happening in China.
[02:35:02.120 --> 02:35:03.520]   That's what you just laid out.
[02:35:03.520 --> 02:35:06.200]   It's genius, and that is the standard.
[02:35:06.200 --> 02:35:07.800]   - You don't need the surveillance for that.
[02:35:07.800 --> 02:35:09.080]   - Yep.
[02:35:09.080 --> 02:35:12.600]   - But that said, if you did do the surveillance,
[02:35:13.480 --> 02:35:17.240]   so that's the support, the incentives aren't aligned.
[02:35:17.240 --> 02:35:18.640]   It seems like a lot of work to do
[02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:21.240]   for the thing you could do without the surveillance.
[02:35:21.240 --> 02:35:25.720]   But yes, the courts wouldn't,
[02:35:25.720 --> 02:35:29.440]   if you were to be able to get a list of people,
[02:35:29.440 --> 02:35:31.600]   which I think that part you could do,
[02:35:31.600 --> 02:35:34.200]   that oppose the government,
[02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:37.000]   you could do that just like you said on Twitter publicly,
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:38.560]   you could make a list.
[02:35:38.560 --> 02:35:41.280]   And with that, you can start to,
[02:35:41.280 --> 02:35:43.140]   especially if you have a lot of data on those people,
[02:35:43.140 --> 02:35:46.440]   find ways in which they did violate the law.
[02:35:46.440 --> 02:35:48.880]   Not because they oppose the government,
[02:35:48.880 --> 02:35:50.280]   but because in some other way,
[02:35:50.280 --> 02:35:53.920]   they were parking tickets or didn't pay the taxes,
[02:35:53.920 --> 02:35:55.200]   that's probably a common one,
[02:35:55.200 --> 02:35:57.940]   or like screwed up something about the taxes.
[02:35:57.940 --> 02:36:00.640]   I just happen to know Russia and Ukraine,
[02:36:00.640 --> 02:36:03.040]   they're very good at this kind of stuff.
[02:36:03.040 --> 02:36:06.440]   Knowing how the citizens screwed everything up,
[02:36:06.440 --> 02:36:08.760]   because especially in those countries,
[02:36:08.760 --> 02:36:11.000]   everybody's breaking the law,
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.140]   because in a corrupt nation,
[02:36:13.140 --> 02:36:15.860]   you have to bend the law to operate the law.
[02:36:15.860 --> 02:36:18.880]   Like the number of people that pay taxes fully
[02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:22.600]   in those nations is just very low, not zero.
[02:36:22.600 --> 02:36:26.480]   And so they then use that breaking of the law
[02:36:26.480 --> 02:36:29.420]   to come up with an excuse to actually put you in jail
[02:36:29.420 --> 02:36:31.100]   based on that.
[02:36:31.100 --> 02:36:34.400]   So it's possible to imagine, but yes, I think,
[02:36:34.400 --> 02:36:39.900]   I think that's the ugly part of surveillance.
[02:36:39.900 --> 02:36:41.940]   But I do think, just like you said,
[02:36:41.940 --> 02:36:43.560]   the incentives aren't correct.
[02:36:43.560 --> 02:36:47.480]   Like you really don't need to get all of the secret police
[02:36:47.480 --> 02:36:49.900]   and all of these kinds of organizations working.
[02:36:49.900 --> 02:36:53.640]   If you do have a charismatic, powerful leader
[02:36:53.640 --> 02:36:55.860]   that built up a network that's able to control
[02:36:55.860 --> 02:37:00.620]   a lot of organizations to a level of authoritarianism
[02:37:00.620 --> 02:37:03.820]   in a government, they're just able to do the usual thing.
[02:37:03.820 --> 02:37:06.780]   One, have propaganda machine to tell narratives,
[02:37:06.780 --> 02:37:10.860]   two, pick out people that they can put in jail
[02:37:10.860 --> 02:37:12.340]   for opposing the state,
[02:37:12.340 --> 02:37:15.020]   and maybe loud members of the press
[02:37:15.020 --> 02:37:16.860]   start silencing the press.
[02:37:16.860 --> 02:37:18.980]   There's like a, there's a playbook to this thing.
[02:37:18.980 --> 02:37:21.140]   And it doesn't require the surveillance.
[02:37:21.140 --> 02:37:24.680]   The surveillance, you know what is useful
[02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:27.900]   for the surveillance is the thing you mentioned in China,
[02:37:27.900 --> 02:37:32.900]   which is encourage everybody in the citizenry
[02:37:32.900 --> 02:37:35.400]   to watch each other,
[02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:38.220]   to say there's enemies of the state everywhere.
[02:37:38.220 --> 02:37:40.380]   And then you start having children
[02:37:40.380 --> 02:37:42.840]   reporting on their parents and that kind of stuff.
[02:37:42.840 --> 02:37:46.020]   Again, don't need a surveillance state for that.
[02:37:46.020 --> 02:37:49.380]   Now the good of a surveillance system,
[02:37:49.380 --> 02:37:53.020]   if it's operating within ethical bounds,
[02:37:53.020 --> 02:37:55.540]   is that yes, it could protect the populace.
[02:37:55.540 --> 02:37:57.580]   So you're saying like the good,
[02:37:57.580 --> 02:38:01.760]   given on your understanding of these institutions,
[02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:03.620]   the good outweighs the bad.
[02:38:03.620 --> 02:38:04.460]   - Absolutely.
[02:38:04.460 --> 02:38:06.080]   Let me give you just a practical example.
[02:38:06.080 --> 02:38:07.800]   So people don't realize this,
[02:38:07.800 --> 02:38:10.440]   but there's multiple surveillance states that are out there.
[02:38:10.440 --> 02:38:12.080]   There are surveillance states that are close allies
[02:38:12.080 --> 02:38:13.560]   with the United States.
[02:38:13.560 --> 02:38:14.720]   One of those surveillance states
[02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:18.680]   is the United Arab Emirates, the UAE.
[02:38:18.680 --> 02:38:23.320]   Now I lived in the UAE from 2019 to 2020,
[02:38:23.320 --> 02:38:26.720]   came back on a repatriation flight after COVID broke out.
[02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:28.160]   And, but we were there for a full year.
[02:38:28.160 --> 02:38:31.880]   We were residents, we had IDs, we had everything.
[02:38:31.880 --> 02:38:35.220]   Now, when you get your national ID in the Emirates,
[02:38:35.220 --> 02:38:39.180]   you get a chip and that chip connects you to everything.
[02:38:39.180 --> 02:38:41.100]   It connects you to cameras,
[02:38:41.100 --> 02:38:44.060]   it connects you to your license plate on your car,
[02:38:44.060 --> 02:38:46.780]   to your passport, to your credit card, everything.
[02:38:46.780 --> 02:38:49.500]   Everything is intertwined, everything is interlinked.
[02:38:49.500 --> 02:38:51.060]   When you drive, there are no police.
[02:38:51.060 --> 02:38:52.540]   There are no police on the roads.
[02:38:52.540 --> 02:38:55.180]   Every 50 to a hundred meters,
[02:38:55.180 --> 02:38:57.980]   you cross a camera that reads your license plate,
[02:38:57.980 --> 02:38:59.240]   measures your speed.
[02:38:59.240 --> 02:39:00.780]   And if you're breaking the speed limit,
[02:39:00.780 --> 02:39:02.800]   it just immediately charges your credit card
[02:39:02.800 --> 02:39:04.520]   because it's tied, it's all tied together.
[02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:05.760]   Totally surveillance.
[02:39:05.760 --> 02:39:08.760]   That technology was invented by the Israelis
[02:39:08.760 --> 02:39:10.960]   who use it in Israel.
[02:39:10.960 --> 02:39:17.100]   When I was in Abu Dhabi and I was rear-ended at high speed
[02:39:17.100 --> 02:39:19.760]   by what turned out to be an Emirati official,
[02:39:19.760 --> 02:39:22.160]   a senior ranking official of one of the Emirates.
[02:39:22.160 --> 02:39:25.080]   It was caught on camera.
[02:39:25.080 --> 02:39:27.400]   His ID was registered, my ID was registered.
[02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:28.960]   Everything was tied back to our IDs.
[02:39:28.960 --> 02:39:31.780]   The proof and the evidence was crystal clear.
[02:39:31.780 --> 02:39:34.620]   Even still, he was Emirati, I was not.
[02:39:34.620 --> 02:39:37.580]   So when I went to the police station to file the complaint,
[02:39:37.580 --> 02:39:39.940]   it was something that nobody was comfortable with
[02:39:39.940 --> 02:39:41.180]   because generally speaking,
[02:39:41.180 --> 02:39:45.100]   Emiratis don't accept legal claims
[02:39:45.100 --> 02:39:46.820]   against their own from foreigners.
[02:39:46.820 --> 02:39:48.780]   But the difference was that I was an American
[02:39:48.780 --> 02:39:50.100]   and I was there on a contract
[02:39:50.100 --> 02:39:51.700]   supporting the Emirati government.
[02:39:51.700 --> 02:39:54.640]   So I had these different variances, right?
[02:39:54.640 --> 02:39:57.140]   Long story short, in the end,
[02:39:57.140 --> 02:39:59.780]   the surveillance state is what made sure
[02:39:59.780 --> 02:40:01.780]   that justice was played
[02:40:01.780 --> 02:40:06.220]   because the proof was incontrovertible.
[02:40:06.220 --> 02:40:09.280]   There was so much evidence collected
[02:40:09.280 --> 02:40:11.300]   because of the surveillance nature of their state.
[02:40:11.300 --> 02:40:12.860]   Now, why do they have a surveillance state?
[02:40:12.860 --> 02:40:14.360]   It's not for people like me.
[02:40:14.360 --> 02:40:16.620]   It's because they're constantly afraid
[02:40:16.620 --> 02:40:21.300]   of extremist terrorist activity happening inside Abu Dhabi
[02:40:21.300 --> 02:40:22.820]   or inside the UAE
[02:40:22.820 --> 02:40:25.140]   because they're under constant threat from Islam
[02:40:25.220 --> 02:40:27.020]   and they're from extremists
[02:40:27.020 --> 02:40:28.660]   and they're under constant threat from Iran.
[02:40:28.660 --> 02:40:32.100]   So that's what drives the people to want a police state,
[02:40:32.100 --> 02:40:33.700]   to want a surveillance state.
[02:40:33.700 --> 02:40:36.500]   For them, their survival is paramount
[02:40:36.500 --> 02:40:38.780]   and they need the surveillance to have that survival.
[02:40:38.780 --> 02:40:42.340]   For us, we haven't tasted that level of desperation
[02:40:42.340 --> 02:40:45.180]   and fear yet or hopefully never,
[02:40:45.180 --> 02:40:46.420]   but that's what makes us feel like
[02:40:46.420 --> 02:40:48.940]   there's something wrong with surveillance.
[02:40:48.940 --> 02:40:50.540]   Surveillance is all about the purpose.
[02:40:50.540 --> 02:40:52.140]   It's all about the intent.
[02:40:52.140 --> 02:40:53.980]   - Well, and like you said,
[02:40:53.980 --> 02:40:56.700]   companies do a significant amount of surveillance
[02:40:56.700 --> 02:41:00.420]   to provide us with services that we take for granted.
[02:41:00.420 --> 02:41:04.220]   For example, just one of the things to give props
[02:41:04.220 --> 02:41:06.140]   to the digital efforts
[02:41:06.140 --> 02:41:08.460]   of the Zelensky administration in Ukraine.
[02:41:08.460 --> 02:41:09.740]   I don't know if you're aware,
[02:41:09.740 --> 02:41:12.880]   but they have this digital transformation efforts
[02:41:12.880 --> 02:41:15.060]   where you could put, there's an,
[02:41:15.060 --> 02:41:20.380]   it's laughable to say in the United States,
[02:41:20.380 --> 02:41:22.020]   but they actually did a really good job
[02:41:22.020 --> 02:41:25.740]   at having a government app that has your passport on it.
[02:41:25.740 --> 02:41:27.140]   It's all the digital information.
[02:41:27.140 --> 02:41:28.940]   You can get a doctor.
[02:41:28.940 --> 02:41:31.700]   It's like everything that you would think America
[02:41:31.700 --> 02:41:35.740]   would be doing, like license, all that kind of stuff,
[02:41:35.740 --> 02:41:36.800]   it's in an app.
[02:41:36.800 --> 02:41:39.620]   You could pay each other, there's payment to each other.
[02:41:39.620 --> 02:41:41.460]   And that's all coming, I mean,
[02:41:41.460 --> 02:41:43.260]   there's probably contractors somehow connected
[02:41:43.260 --> 02:41:44.160]   to the whole thing,
[02:41:44.160 --> 02:41:46.860]   but that's like under the flag of government.
[02:41:46.860 --> 02:41:49.340]   And so that's an incredible technology.
[02:41:49.340 --> 02:41:51.980]   And I didn't, I guess, hear anybody talk about
[02:41:51.980 --> 02:41:55.020]   surveillance in that context, even though it is,
[02:41:55.020 --> 02:41:57.220]   but they all love it and it's super easy.
[02:41:57.220 --> 02:42:00.740]   And they, frankly, already, it's so easy and convenient.
[02:42:00.740 --> 02:42:02.700]   They've already taken for granted that,
[02:42:02.700 --> 02:42:04.420]   of course, this is what you do.
[02:42:04.420 --> 02:42:06.460]   Of course, your passport is on your phone.
[02:42:06.460 --> 02:42:09.180]   - Yeah, for everybody to have housed in a server
[02:42:09.180 --> 02:42:10.660]   that you have no idea where it's at.
[02:42:10.660 --> 02:42:13.220]   That could be hacked at any time by a third party.
[02:42:13.220 --> 02:42:14.720]   - They don't ask these kinds of questions
[02:42:14.720 --> 02:42:16.060]   because it's so convenient,
[02:42:16.060 --> 02:42:21.060]   as we do for Google, Facebook, Twitter,
[02:42:22.060 --> 02:42:27.060]   Apple, Microsoft products we use.
[02:42:27.060 --> 02:42:29.260]   - Security and convenience are on two opposite sides
[02:42:29.260 --> 02:42:30.820]   of another spectrum.
[02:42:30.820 --> 02:42:33.260]   The more convenient something is, the less secure.
[02:42:33.260 --> 02:42:36.240]   And the more secure something is, the less convenient.
[02:42:36.240 --> 02:42:38.860]   And that's a battle that we're always,
[02:42:38.860 --> 02:42:40.500]   we're always working with as individuals,
[02:42:40.500 --> 02:42:42.520]   and then we're trying to outsource that battle
[02:42:42.520 --> 02:42:44.540]   to our politicians, and our politicians are, frankly,
[02:42:44.540 --> 02:42:46.820]   just more interested in being politicians.
[02:42:46.820 --> 02:42:49.140]   - Yeah, that said, I mean, people are really worried
[02:42:49.140 --> 02:42:54.140]   about giving any one institution a large amount of power,
[02:42:54.140 --> 02:42:59.820]   especially when it's a federal government institution,
[02:42:59.820 --> 02:43:02.660]   given some history, first of all,
[02:43:02.660 --> 02:43:04.980]   just history of the corruption,
[02:43:04.980 --> 02:43:08.620]   of power-corrupting individuals and institutions,
[02:43:08.620 --> 02:43:13.620]   and second of all, myth or reality of certain institutions
[02:43:13.620 --> 02:43:17.740]   like the CIA misbehaving.
[02:43:17.740 --> 02:43:20.740]   - Well, let me actually ask you about Edward Snowden.
[02:43:20.740 --> 02:43:25.740]   So you, outside of the utility that you're arguing for
[02:43:25.740 --> 02:43:29.140]   of the NSA surveillance program,
[02:43:29.140 --> 02:43:34.140]   do you think Edward Snowden is a criminal or a hero?
[02:43:34.140 --> 02:43:38.180]   - In terms, in the eyes of the law, he's a criminal.
[02:43:38.180 --> 02:43:41.140]   He broke the law, he broke the confidence,
[02:43:41.140 --> 02:43:43.740]   he was under security obligation,
[02:43:43.740 --> 02:43:45.500]   and then when he ran away, he ran away
[02:43:45.500 --> 02:43:47.780]   to all of the worst villains in the world,
[02:43:47.780 --> 02:43:52.620]   from the US perspective, to basically seek protection.
[02:43:52.620 --> 02:43:58.580]   That's, that, how you act in the face of accusation
[02:43:58.580 --> 02:44:03.420]   is in essence part of the case that you build for yourself.
[02:44:03.420 --> 02:44:07.140]   So running away to China, Russia, Cuba,
[02:44:07.140 --> 02:44:09.940]   there was a Latin, Ecuador, I think,
[02:44:09.940 --> 02:44:11.880]   that just paints a very negative picture
[02:44:11.880 --> 02:44:13.620]   that does not suggest that you were doing anything
[02:44:13.620 --> 02:44:14.740]   that was ethical and upright,
[02:44:14.740 --> 02:44:16.220]   and in favor of the American people,
[02:44:16.220 --> 02:44:19.540]   if you're gonna run to American enemies to support yourself.
[02:44:19.540 --> 02:44:22.620]   So for sure, in the eyes of the law, he's a criminal.
[02:44:22.620 --> 02:44:26.260]   In the eyes of a group of people
[02:44:26.260 --> 02:44:30.940]   who are largely ignorant to what they lost,
[02:44:30.940 --> 02:44:32.780]   to them, he's a hero.
[02:44:32.780 --> 02:44:35.360]   To me, he's just kind of a sad case.
[02:44:35.360 --> 02:44:40.360]   I personally look at Snowden as a sad, unfortunate case.
[02:44:41.300 --> 02:44:45.180]   His life is ruined, his family name is tarnished,
[02:44:45.180 --> 02:44:50.140]   he's forever going to be a desperate pawn,
[02:44:50.140 --> 02:44:54.380]   and that's all because of the decisions that he made
[02:44:54.380 --> 02:44:55.600]   and the order that he made them.
[02:44:55.600 --> 02:44:57.220]   - I'm not sure his name is tarnished.
[02:44:57.220 --> 02:45:01.580]   I think the case you're making is a difficult case to make,
[02:45:01.580 --> 02:45:06.580]   and so I think his name represents fighting one man,
[02:45:08.380 --> 02:45:11.420]   it's like Tiananmen Square standing before the tank,
[02:45:11.420 --> 02:45:15.780]   is like one man fighting the government.
[02:45:15.780 --> 02:45:18.100]   And I think that there is some aspect
[02:45:18.100 --> 02:45:21.660]   which, taking that case aside,
[02:45:21.660 --> 02:45:24.740]   that is the American spirit,
[02:45:24.740 --> 02:45:28.980]   which is hold the powerful accountable.
[02:45:28.980 --> 02:45:31.420]   So whenever there's somebody in power,
[02:45:31.420 --> 02:45:34.620]   one individual can change,
[02:45:38.180 --> 02:45:39.420]   one man can make a difference.
[02:45:39.420 --> 02:45:40.700]   - Can make a difference, yeah.
[02:45:40.700 --> 02:45:42.300]   - Very Knight Rider of you.
[02:45:42.300 --> 02:45:45.260]   - I mean, that's the American individualism.
[02:45:45.260 --> 02:45:46.700]   And so he represents that,
[02:45:46.700 --> 02:45:49.620]   and I think there's a huge skepticism
[02:45:49.620 --> 02:45:52.940]   against large federal institutions.
[02:45:52.940 --> 02:45:56.540]   And I think if you look at the long arc of history,
[02:45:56.540 --> 02:45:58.980]   that actually is a forcing function
[02:45:58.980 --> 02:46:01.220]   for the institutions to behave their best.
[02:46:01.220 --> 02:46:06.460]   So basically hold them accountable.
[02:46:06.460 --> 02:46:11.300]   If what's nice about this is that we can agree to disagree,
[02:46:11.300 --> 02:46:13.700]   and history will be the one that decides.
[02:46:13.700 --> 02:46:17.100]   But once, like there's a reason
[02:46:17.100 --> 02:46:20.860]   that Edward Snowden needs to do something new
[02:46:20.860 --> 02:46:25.820]   every 16 or 18 months to remain relevant, right?
[02:46:25.820 --> 02:46:28.540]   Because if he didn't, he would just be forgotten.
[02:46:28.540 --> 02:46:30.620]   Because he was not a maverick
[02:46:30.620 --> 02:46:32.780]   who changed history for the better.
[02:46:32.780 --> 02:46:35.220]   He was a man who broke a law,
[02:46:35.220 --> 02:46:37.460]   and now he's on the run.
[02:46:37.460 --> 02:46:41.060]   And to some people, he is a hero.
[02:46:41.060 --> 02:46:42.860]   To other people, he is a criminal.
[02:46:42.860 --> 02:46:44.660]   But to the vast majority,
[02:46:44.660 --> 02:46:48.340]   he's just a blip on a radar of their everyday life
[02:46:48.340 --> 02:46:50.700]   that really makes no difference to them at all.
[02:46:50.700 --> 02:46:51.980]   - So actually let's linger on that.
[02:46:51.980 --> 02:46:54.420]   So just to clarify, do you think,
[02:46:54.420 --> 02:46:57.620]   are you making the difficult case
[02:46:57.620 --> 02:47:00.780]   that the NSA mass surveillance program
[02:47:00.780 --> 02:47:02.700]   was one, ethical, and two,
[02:47:02.700 --> 02:47:04.980]   made a better world for Americans?
[02:47:04.980 --> 02:47:08.300]   - I am making the case that at the time,
[02:47:08.300 --> 02:47:10.860]   it was exactly what we needed
[02:47:10.860 --> 02:47:13.140]   to feel safe in our own homes.
[02:47:13.140 --> 02:47:16.540]   - But what about to be safe, actually be safe?
[02:47:16.540 --> 02:47:17.740]   - So this is what's difficult,
[02:47:17.740 --> 02:47:20.960]   because any proof that they collected
[02:47:20.960 --> 02:47:23.540]   that actually prevented an attack from happening
[02:47:23.540 --> 02:47:24.940]   is proof we'll never know about.
[02:47:24.940 --> 02:47:27.500]   This is the really unfortunate side
[02:47:27.500 --> 02:47:28.540]   of intelligence operations.
[02:47:28.540 --> 02:47:30.540]   And I've been at the front end of this.
[02:47:30.540 --> 02:47:32.260]   You work your ass off.
[02:47:32.260 --> 02:47:33.740]   You take personal risk.
[02:47:33.740 --> 02:47:35.100]   You make personal sacrifice
[02:47:35.100 --> 02:47:38.300]   to make sure that something terrible doesn't happen.
[02:47:38.300 --> 02:47:40.060]   Nobody knows that that ever happens.
[02:47:40.060 --> 02:47:41.660]   - Does that have to be that way?
[02:47:41.660 --> 02:47:44.840]   Does it have to remain secret
[02:47:44.840 --> 02:47:49.840]   every time the NSA or the CIA saves the lives of Americans?
[02:47:49.840 --> 02:47:52.980]   - It does, for two reasons it has to be secret.
[02:47:52.980 --> 02:47:55.540]   First, the mythos.
[02:47:55.540 --> 02:47:58.940]   The same thing we were talking about with General Petraeus.
[02:47:58.940 --> 02:48:01.580]   You can't brag about your victories
[02:48:01.580 --> 02:48:05.300]   if you want to let the myth shape itself.
[02:48:05.300 --> 02:48:06.260]   You can't do that.
[02:48:06.260 --> 02:48:07.400]   The second thing is,
[02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:12.900]   once a victory is claimed,
[02:48:12.900 --> 02:48:16.880]   the danger comes from letting your enemy
[02:48:16.880 --> 02:48:19.060]   know that you claimed the victory,
[02:48:19.060 --> 02:48:20.260]   because they can reverse engineer
[02:48:20.260 --> 02:48:22.540]   and they can start to change how they did things.
[02:48:22.540 --> 02:48:24.700]   If a terrorist act, if a terrorist cell
[02:48:24.700 --> 02:48:27.620]   tries to execute an operation, the operation fails.
[02:48:27.620 --> 02:48:29.580]   From their point of view, they don't know why it failed.
[02:48:29.580 --> 02:48:30.780]   They just know that it failed.
[02:48:30.780 --> 02:48:33.220]   But then if the US or if the American government
[02:48:33.220 --> 02:48:37.740]   comes in and says, "We took apart this amazing attack,"
[02:48:37.740 --> 02:48:39.940]   now they have more information.
[02:48:39.940 --> 02:48:41.820]   The whole power of secrets, like we talked about before,
[02:48:41.820 --> 02:48:43.460]   the power of secrets is in knowing
[02:48:43.460 --> 02:48:44.640]   that not everybody has them.
[02:48:44.640 --> 02:48:46.660]   There's only a shelf life.
[02:48:46.660 --> 02:48:48.300]   So take advantage of the shelf life.
[02:48:48.300 --> 02:48:51.320]   You get space, so you gotta keep it a secret.
[02:48:51.320 --> 02:48:56.100]   There is no tactical advantage from sharing a secret
[02:48:56.100 --> 02:48:59.940]   unless you are specifically trying to achieve
[02:48:59.940 --> 02:49:01.940]   a certain tactical advantage from sharing that secret,
[02:49:01.940 --> 02:49:03.100]   which is what we've seen so much of
[02:49:03.100 --> 02:49:05.140]   with US intel sharing with Ukraine.
[02:49:05.140 --> 02:49:07.300]   There's a tactical advantage from sharing a secret
[02:49:07.300 --> 02:49:10.700]   about Russian military movements or weaknesses in tanks
[02:49:10.700 --> 02:49:14.060]   or supply chain challenges, whatever it might be.
[02:49:14.060 --> 02:49:16.340]   - Well, let me argue that there might be an advantage
[02:49:16.340 --> 02:49:19.780]   to share information with the American public
[02:49:19.780 --> 02:49:22.780]   when a terrorist attack is averted
[02:49:22.780 --> 02:49:28.440]   or the lives of Americans are saved,
[02:49:28.440 --> 02:49:30.060]   because what that does--
[02:49:30.060 --> 02:49:33.100]   - Is make every American think that they're not that safe.
[02:49:33.100 --> 02:49:36.420]   There is no tactical advantage there.
[02:49:36.420 --> 02:49:37.820]   - You think so? - Absolutely.
[02:49:37.820 --> 02:49:44.060]   If the Austin PD started telling you every day
[02:49:44.060 --> 02:49:48.140]   about these crazy crimes that they prevented,
[02:49:48.140 --> 02:49:49.860]   would that make you feel more safe?
[02:49:49.860 --> 02:49:51.460]   It would make you feel like they're doing their job.
[02:49:51.460 --> 02:49:53.620]   - Is that obvious to you, it'd make us feel less safe?
[02:49:53.620 --> 02:49:55.620]   'Cause if we see competence,
[02:49:55.620 --> 02:49:59.920]   that there is extremely competent defenders
[02:49:59.920 --> 02:50:02.940]   of this territory, of these people,
[02:50:02.940 --> 02:50:05.040]   wouldn't that make us feel more safe or no?
[02:50:05.040 --> 02:50:08.880]   - The human nature is not to assign competence.
[02:50:08.880 --> 02:50:13.880]   So empirically, humans overvalue losses
[02:50:13.880 --> 02:50:17.140]   and undervalue gains.
[02:50:17.140 --> 02:50:18.440]   That's something that we've seen
[02:50:18.440 --> 02:50:20.480]   from finance to betting and beyond.
[02:50:20.480 --> 02:50:23.600]   If the Austin Police Department starts telling you
[02:50:23.600 --> 02:50:26.800]   about all these heinous crimes that were avoided
[02:50:26.800 --> 02:50:28.960]   because of their hard work,
[02:50:28.960 --> 02:50:30.740]   the way that your brain is actually going
[02:50:30.740 --> 02:50:33.620]   to process that information is you are going to say,
[02:50:33.620 --> 02:50:36.840]   if this is all the stuff that they've stopped,
[02:50:36.840 --> 02:50:39.720]   how bad must this place be?
[02:50:39.720 --> 02:50:41.960]   How much more haven't they stopped?
[02:50:41.960 --> 02:50:45.400]   - I take your point, it's a powerful psychological point,
[02:50:45.400 --> 02:50:49.200]   but looking at the other picture of it,
[02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:52.620]   looking at the police force, looking at the CIA, the NSA,
[02:50:53.420 --> 02:50:56.660]   those people, and now with the police,
[02:50:56.660 --> 02:51:00.020]   they're seen, there's such a negative feeling
[02:51:00.020 --> 02:51:03.460]   amongst Americans towards these institutions.
[02:51:03.460 --> 02:51:06.620]   Who the hell wants to work for the CIA now
[02:51:06.620 --> 02:51:07.820]   and the police force?
[02:51:07.820 --> 02:51:11.880]   You're gonna be criticized.
[02:51:11.880 --> 02:51:16.980]   I mean, that's really bad for the CIA.
[02:51:16.980 --> 02:51:18.340]   It's terrible.
[02:51:18.340 --> 02:51:20.700]   As opposed to being seen as a hero.
[02:51:20.700 --> 02:51:25.060]   For example, currently, soldiers are, for the most part,
[02:51:25.060 --> 02:51:27.420]   seen as heroes that are protecting this nation.
[02:51:27.420 --> 02:51:32.700]   That's not the case for the CIA.
[02:51:32.700 --> 02:51:35.300]   - Soldiers weren't seen as heroes in the Vietnam War.
[02:51:35.300 --> 02:51:39.500]   You've gotta remember that when you,
[02:51:39.500 --> 02:51:43.580]   so first of all, public service is a sacrifice.
[02:51:43.580 --> 02:51:45.280]   We oftentimes forget that.
[02:51:45.280 --> 02:51:47.300]   We start to think, oh, government jobs are cushy
[02:51:47.300 --> 02:51:49.340]   and they're easy and it must be so easy
[02:51:49.340 --> 02:51:50.620]   to be the president 'cause then you're basically
[02:51:50.620 --> 02:51:51.800]   a celebrity overnight.
[02:51:51.800 --> 02:51:55.340]   Public service is a sacrifice.
[02:51:55.340 --> 02:51:56.720]   It's a grind.
[02:51:56.720 --> 02:52:00.500]   For all of the soldiers, the soldiers,
[02:52:00.500 --> 02:52:05.020]   the submariners, the missileers, the police officers,
[02:52:05.020 --> 02:52:07.660]   intelligence specialists, they all know what it's like
[02:52:07.660 --> 02:52:10.440]   to give things up, to serve a public
[02:52:10.440 --> 02:52:14.620]   that can turn its opinion at any given time.
[02:52:14.620 --> 02:52:16.900]   And history is what defines it.
[02:52:16.900 --> 02:52:18.500]   The more important thing is to understand
[02:52:18.500 --> 02:52:22.300]   that if you want a true, open, and fair democracy,
[02:52:22.300 --> 02:52:25.300]   you cannot control a narrative.
[02:52:25.300 --> 02:52:27.580]   And starting to share all of your victories
[02:52:27.580 --> 02:52:29.460]   or starting to share your biggest victories
[02:52:29.460 --> 02:52:31.620]   with the intent of shaping public opinion
[02:52:31.620 --> 02:52:33.700]   to be supportive of the police force
[02:52:33.700 --> 02:52:37.700]   or supportive of CIA or supportive of, you name it,
[02:52:37.700 --> 02:52:39.180]   is shaping a narrative.
[02:52:39.180 --> 02:52:43.300]   That is intentional operational use of influence
[02:52:43.300 --> 02:52:45.540]   to drive public opinion.
[02:52:45.540 --> 02:52:47.660]   That is something nobody wants to get into.
[02:52:47.660 --> 02:52:50.420]   It is much more professional to be a silent sentinel,
[02:52:50.420 --> 02:52:54.140]   a silent servant, humbly carrying the burden
[02:52:54.140 --> 02:52:56.040]   of public service in the United States
[02:52:56.040 --> 02:52:59.220]   where we are a fair and open democracy.
[02:52:59.220 --> 02:53:00.620]   - Why?
[02:53:00.620 --> 02:53:04.700]   Why not celebrate the killing of bin Laden?
[02:53:04.700 --> 02:53:05.520]   - We did.
[02:53:05.520 --> 02:53:06.820]   - The search, discovery, and the capture
[02:53:06.820 --> 02:53:08.380]   and the killing of bin Laden.
[02:53:08.380 --> 02:53:11.020]   Wasn't that, actually the details of that,
[02:53:11.020 --> 02:53:12.540]   how much of the details of that,
[02:53:12.540 --> 02:53:15.420]   how he was discovered, were made public?
[02:53:15.420 --> 02:53:17.500]   I think some of it was made public enough.
[02:53:17.500 --> 02:53:19.060]   Why not do that?
[02:53:19.060 --> 02:53:21.460]   Doesn't that make heroes out of the people
[02:53:21.460 --> 02:53:23.420]   that are servants?
[02:53:23.420 --> 02:53:28.420]   Or do people who serve to do service for this nation,
[02:53:28.420 --> 02:53:30.780]   do they always have to operate
[02:53:30.780 --> 02:53:33.600]   in a thankless manner in the shadows?
[02:53:33.600 --> 02:53:36.880]   - I think that's a very good question.
[02:53:36.880 --> 02:53:41.780]   The folks who I left behind when I left CIA,
[02:53:41.780 --> 02:53:45.700]   who continue to serve as faceless,
[02:53:45.700 --> 02:53:50.080]   nameless heroes every day, I am grateful to them.
[02:53:50.080 --> 02:53:56.740]   The truth is that if they were motivated by something else,
[02:53:56.740 --> 02:53:59.780]   they wouldn't be as good as they are at doing what they do.
[02:53:59.780 --> 02:54:03.940]   And I see your point about
[02:54:03.940 --> 02:54:07.000]   shouldn't we be celebrating our victories?
[02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.860]   But when celebrating our victories runs the risk
[02:54:09.860 --> 02:54:14.860]   of informing our enemies how we operate,
[02:54:15.160 --> 02:54:16.980]   giving away our informational advantage,
[02:54:16.980 --> 02:54:19.180]   giving away our tactical battlefield advantage,
[02:54:19.180 --> 02:54:22.260]   and running the risk of shaping a narrative intentionally
[02:54:22.260 --> 02:54:24.060]   among our own American people,
[02:54:24.060 --> 02:54:27.380]   now all of a sudden we're turning into exactly the thing
[02:54:27.380 --> 02:54:30.280]   that the American people trust us not to become.
[02:54:30.280 --> 02:54:34.180]   - Yeah, but then you operate in the secrecy
[02:54:34.180 --> 02:54:38.980]   and then there's corrupt and douchebag people everywhere.
[02:54:38.980 --> 02:54:42.900]   So when they, even inside the CIA and criminals,
[02:54:42.900 --> 02:54:45.900]   inside the CIA there's criminals in all organizations,
[02:54:45.900 --> 02:54:48.640]   in all walks of life, human nature is such
[02:54:48.640 --> 02:54:50.420]   that this is always the case,
[02:54:50.420 --> 02:54:53.220]   then it breeds conspiracy theories.
[02:54:53.220 --> 02:54:54.740]   - It does.
[02:54:54.740 --> 02:54:57.520]   And sometimes those conspiracy theories turn out to be true,
[02:54:57.520 --> 02:54:59.740]   but most times they don't.
[02:54:59.740 --> 02:55:02.620]   That's just part of the risk of being a myth.
[02:55:02.620 --> 02:55:05.820]   - Can you speak to some of the myths?
[02:55:05.820 --> 02:55:08.160]   So MKUltra.
[02:55:08.160 --> 02:55:09.760]   So- - Not a myth.
[02:55:09.760 --> 02:55:10.780]   - Not a myth.
[02:55:10.780 --> 02:55:14.500]   So this is a fascinating human experimentation program
[02:55:14.500 --> 02:55:17.380]   undertaken by the CIA to develop procedures
[02:55:17.380 --> 02:55:20.780]   for using drugs like LSD to interrogate people
[02:55:20.780 --> 02:55:23.940]   through, let's say, psychological manipulation
[02:55:23.940 --> 02:55:25.860]   and maybe even torture.
[02:55:25.860 --> 02:55:28.480]   The scale of the program is perhaps not known.
[02:55:28.480 --> 02:55:31.940]   How do you make sense that this program existed?
[02:55:31.940 --> 02:55:33.740]   - Again, you've gotta look through the lens of time.
[02:55:33.740 --> 02:55:35.420]   You've gotta look at where we were historically
[02:55:35.420 --> 02:55:36.260]   at that time.
[02:55:36.260 --> 02:55:38.460]   There was the peak of the Cold War,
[02:55:38.460 --> 02:55:41.840]   our enemies were doing the same kind of experimentation.
[02:55:41.840 --> 02:55:44.420]   It was essentially another space race.
[02:55:44.420 --> 02:55:48.960]   What if they broke through a new weapon technology
[02:55:48.960 --> 02:55:50.180]   faster than we did?
[02:55:50.180 --> 02:55:52.180]   What would that mean for the safety and security
[02:55:52.180 --> 02:55:54.720]   of the American people?
[02:55:54.720 --> 02:55:57.340]   So right decision or wrong decision,
[02:55:57.340 --> 02:56:00.220]   it was guided by and informed by
[02:56:00.220 --> 02:56:02.100]   national security priorities.
[02:56:02.100 --> 02:56:06.580]   So from this program that was designed to use drugs
[02:56:06.580 --> 02:56:08.780]   to drive interrogation and torture people
[02:56:08.780 --> 02:56:12.540]   was born something very productive, Operation Stargate,
[02:56:12.540 --> 02:56:17.440]   which was a chance to use remote viewing and metaphysics
[02:56:17.440 --> 02:56:19.140]   to try to collect intelligence.
[02:56:19.140 --> 02:56:21.500]   Now, even though in the end,
[02:56:21.500 --> 02:56:24.820]   the outcome of MKUltra and the outcome of Stargate
[02:56:24.820 --> 02:56:26.940]   were mixed, nobody really knows if they did or didn't do
[02:56:26.940 --> 02:56:28.380]   what they were supposed to do,
[02:56:28.380 --> 02:56:30.300]   we still know that to this day,
[02:56:30.300 --> 02:56:33.980]   there's still a demand in the US government and in CIA
[02:56:33.980 --> 02:56:37.980]   for people who have sensitivities to ethereal energies.
[02:56:37.980 --> 02:56:40.620]   - By the way, is there any proof
[02:56:40.620 --> 02:56:42.080]   that that kind of stuff works?
[02:56:42.080 --> 02:56:46.260]   It just shows that there's interest,
[02:56:46.260 --> 02:56:47.860]   it shows that there's openness
[02:56:47.860 --> 02:56:49.620]   to consider those kinds of things,
[02:56:49.620 --> 02:56:51.660]   but is there any evidence that that kind of stuff works?
[02:56:51.660 --> 02:56:53.660]   - If there's evidence, I haven't seen it.
[02:56:53.660 --> 02:56:58.820]   Speaking from a science-based point of view only,
[02:56:58.820 --> 02:57:02.940]   if energy and matter can always be exchanged,
[02:57:02.940 --> 02:57:05.020]   then a person who can understand
[02:57:05.020 --> 02:57:08.980]   and become sensitive to energy
[02:57:08.980 --> 02:57:11.440]   is a person who could become sensitive
[02:57:11.440 --> 02:57:13.620]   to what does become matter.
[02:57:13.620 --> 02:57:17.380]   - Yeah, I mean, the basics of the physics might be there,
[02:57:17.380 --> 02:57:19.900]   but a lot of people probably are skeptical.
[02:57:19.900 --> 02:57:21.500]   - I'm skeptical too, but I'm just trying to remain--
[02:57:21.500 --> 02:57:23.020]   - But you should be open-minded, right?
[02:57:23.020 --> 02:57:26.300]   I mean, that's actually, you know,
[02:57:26.300 --> 02:57:28.620]   that's what science is about, is remain open-minded,
[02:57:28.620 --> 02:57:30.520]   even for the things that are long shots,
[02:57:30.520 --> 02:57:31.460]   because those are the things
[02:57:31.460 --> 02:57:34.380]   that actually define scientific revolutions.
[02:57:34.380 --> 02:57:37.580]   What about Operation Northwoods?
[02:57:37.580 --> 02:57:41.580]   It was a proposed 1962 false flag operation
[02:57:41.580 --> 02:57:46.580]   by the DOD and the CIA to be carried out by the CIA
[02:57:46.580 --> 02:57:50.380]   to commit acts of terrorism on Americans
[02:57:50.380 --> 02:57:52.260]   and blame them on Cuba.
[02:57:52.260 --> 02:57:55.780]   So JFK, the president, rejected the proposal.
[02:57:55.780 --> 02:57:58.100]   What do you make that this was on the table,
[02:57:58.100 --> 02:57:59.380]   Operation Northwoods?
[02:57:59.380 --> 02:58:00.740]   - So it's interesting.
[02:58:00.740 --> 02:58:02.940]   First, I'm glad that JFK rejected it.
[02:58:02.940 --> 02:58:05.500]   That's a good sign.
[02:58:05.500 --> 02:58:09.180]   So we have to understand that good ideas
[02:58:09.180 --> 02:58:11.640]   are oftentimes born from bad ideas.
[02:58:11.640 --> 02:58:14.260]   I had a really good friend of mine
[02:58:14.260 --> 02:58:16.940]   who actually went on to become a pastor,
[02:58:16.940 --> 02:58:18.580]   and he used to say all the time
[02:58:18.580 --> 02:58:20.480]   that he wanted all the bad ideas on the table.
[02:58:20.480 --> 02:58:21.940]   Like, "Give me all your bad ideas,"
[02:58:21.940 --> 02:58:23.940]   every time we had any kind of conversation.
[02:58:23.940 --> 02:58:25.360]   And I was always one of those people who was like,
[02:58:25.360 --> 02:58:28.020]   "Isn't a bad idea just a waste of time?"
[02:58:28.020 --> 02:58:29.860]   And he was like, "No, 'cause the best ideas
[02:58:29.860 --> 02:58:31.420]   "oftentimes come from bad ideas."
[02:58:31.420 --> 02:58:35.060]   So again, Cuban Missile Crisis,
[02:58:35.060 --> 02:58:36.980]   mass hysteria in the United States
[02:58:36.980 --> 02:58:38.620]   about nuclear war from Cuba,
[02:58:38.620 --> 02:58:40.780]   missiles blowing up American cities
[02:58:40.780 --> 02:58:43.100]   faster than we could even see them coming.
[02:58:43.100 --> 02:58:46.020]   It makes sense to me that a president would go to,
[02:58:46.020 --> 02:58:48.500]   especially the part of CIA,
[02:58:48.500 --> 02:58:51.420]   which is the Special Activities Division,
[02:58:51.420 --> 02:58:52.940]   it makes perfect sense to me that the president
[02:58:52.940 --> 02:58:55.300]   would go to a division called Special Activities,
[02:58:55.300 --> 02:58:59.540]   whose job it is to create crazy ideas
[02:58:59.540 --> 02:59:02.420]   that have presidential approval,
[02:59:02.420 --> 02:59:04.580]   but nobody knows they exist.
[02:59:04.580 --> 02:59:07.060]   So it makes sense that he would challenge a group like that
[02:59:07.060 --> 02:59:09.260]   to come up with any wacky idea, right?
[02:59:09.260 --> 02:59:11.420]   Come up with anything, just let's start with something,
[02:59:11.420 --> 02:59:13.780]   'cause we can't bring nothing to the table.
[02:59:13.780 --> 02:59:15.740]   We have to do something about this Cuban issue.
[02:59:15.740 --> 02:59:17.700]   And then that's how an operation like that
[02:59:17.700 --> 02:59:19.220]   could reasonably be born.
[02:59:19.220 --> 02:59:20.860]   Not because anybody wants to do it,
[02:59:20.860 --> 02:59:22.480]   but because they were tasked by the president
[02:59:22.480 --> 02:59:26.500]   to come up with five ideas, and it was one of the ideas.
[02:59:26.500 --> 02:59:29.300]   That still happens to this day.
[02:59:29.300 --> 02:59:31.140]   The president will still come in,
[02:59:31.140 --> 02:59:33.020]   but he'll basically send out a notice
[02:59:33.020 --> 02:59:36.140]   to his covert action arm, and he will say,
[02:59:36.140 --> 02:59:39.580]   "I need this, and I need it on Wednesday."
[02:59:39.580 --> 02:59:41.900]   And people have to come back with options
[02:59:41.900 --> 02:59:44.380]   for the thing he asked for, a finding.
[02:59:44.380 --> 02:59:46.420]   He will issue a presidential finding,
[02:59:46.420 --> 02:59:48.560]   and then his covert action arms have to come back and say,
[02:59:48.560 --> 02:59:49.780]   "Here's how we would do this
[02:59:49.780 --> 02:59:51.680]   "and hide the hands of the Americans."
[02:59:51.680 --> 02:59:55.500]   - How gangster was it of JFK to reject it though?
[02:59:55.500 --> 02:59:56.540]   - It was baller, right?
[02:59:56.540 --> 02:59:57.460]   (Lex laughing)
[02:59:57.460 --> 03:00:00.020]   That's like, that is a mic drop right there.
[03:00:00.020 --> 03:00:01.260]   Nope, not doing that.
[03:00:01.260 --> 03:00:02.340]   So yep, doing that.
[03:00:02.340 --> 03:00:07.420]   - A thing that crosses an ethical line,
[03:00:07.420 --> 03:00:12.420]   even in a time where the entire human civilization
[03:00:12.420 --> 03:00:16.140]   hangs in a balance, still forfeit that power.
[03:00:16.140 --> 03:00:20.540]   That's a beautiful thing about the American experiment.
[03:00:20.540 --> 03:00:22.540]   That's a few times throughout the history
[03:00:22.540 --> 03:00:26.020]   that's happened, including with our first president,
[03:00:26.020 --> 03:00:27.000]   George Washington.
[03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:30.260]   Well, let me ask about JFK.
[03:00:30.260 --> 03:00:31.780]   (Lex laughing)
[03:00:31.780 --> 03:00:36.200]   - 25 times two, and they still keep that stuff classified.
[03:00:36.200 --> 03:00:42.620]   - So do you think the CIA had a hand
[03:00:42.620 --> 03:00:45.700]   in the assassination of JFK?
[03:00:45.700 --> 03:00:50.540]   - I cannot imagine, in any reasonable point of view,
[03:00:50.540 --> 03:00:53.540]   that the organization of CIA had anything to do
[03:00:53.540 --> 03:00:55.060]   with the assassination of JFK.
[03:00:55.060 --> 03:00:58.980]   - So it's not possible to infiltrate the CIA,
[03:00:58.980 --> 03:01:04.940]   a small part of the CIA, in order to attain political
[03:01:04.940 --> 03:01:09.340]   or criminal gains?
[03:01:09.340 --> 03:01:10.820]   - I think-- - Or financial.
[03:01:10.820 --> 03:01:13.980]   - Yeah, absolutely it's possible to infiltrate CIA.
[03:01:13.980 --> 03:01:17.640]   There's a long history of foreign intelligence services
[03:01:17.640 --> 03:01:20.340]   infiltrating CIA, from Aldrich Ames
[03:01:20.340 --> 03:01:23.460]   to Jerry Lee recently with China.
[03:01:23.460 --> 03:01:25.660]   So we know CIA can be infiltrated.
[03:01:25.660 --> 03:01:28.940]   Even if they are infiltrated,
[03:01:28.940 --> 03:01:33.940]   and even if that interlocutor executes on their own agenda
[03:01:33.940 --> 03:01:39.460]   or the agenda as directed by their foreign adversary,
[03:01:39.460 --> 03:01:41.580]   their foreign handler, that's different
[03:01:41.580 --> 03:01:45.100]   than organizational support for an event.
[03:01:45.100 --> 03:01:48.680]   So I do think it's possible they could have been infiltrated.
[03:01:48.680 --> 03:01:52.680]   At the time, especially, it was a major priority
[03:01:52.680 --> 03:01:56.100]   for the Cubans and the Russians to infiltrate some aspect
[03:01:56.100 --> 03:01:58.540]   of US intelligence.
[03:01:58.540 --> 03:02:03.460]   Multiple moles were caught in the years following.
[03:02:03.460 --> 03:02:06.600]   So it's not surprising that there would be a priority
[03:02:06.600 --> 03:02:09.500]   for that, but to say that the organization of CIA
[03:02:09.500 --> 03:02:12.300]   was somehow in cahoots with,
[03:02:12.300 --> 03:02:15.180]   to independently assassinate their own executive,
[03:02:15.180 --> 03:02:16.700]   that's a significant stretch.
[03:02:16.700 --> 03:02:18.700]   I've seen no evidence to support that,
[03:02:18.700 --> 03:02:21.540]   and it goes contrary to everything I learned
[03:02:21.540 --> 03:02:22.680]   from my time at CIA.
[03:02:22.680 --> 03:02:27.660]   - Well, let me ask you, do you think CIA played a part
[03:02:27.660 --> 03:02:31.260]   in enabling drug cartels and drug trafficking,
[03:02:31.260 --> 03:02:36.260]   which is another big kind of shadow
[03:02:36.260 --> 03:02:37.940]   that hangs over the CIA?
[03:02:37.940 --> 03:02:39.300]   - At the beginning of the drug war,
[03:02:39.300 --> 03:02:41.040]   I would imagine the answer is yes.
[03:02:41.040 --> 03:02:45.240]   CIA has its own counter-narcotics division,
[03:02:45.240 --> 03:02:47.700]   a division that's dedicated to fighting
[03:02:47.700 --> 03:02:51.380]   and preventing narcotics from coming into the United States.
[03:02:51.380 --> 03:02:53.460]   So when you paint a picture for me,
[03:02:53.460 --> 03:02:55.260]   like do you think the CIA was complicit
[03:02:55.260 --> 03:02:59.100]   in helping drug trafficking or drug use?
[03:02:59.100 --> 03:03:03.380]   When I say yes, my exception is I don't think they did that
[03:03:03.380 --> 03:03:05.640]   for Americans inside the United States.
[03:03:05.640 --> 03:03:07.740]   If the CIA can basically set it up
[03:03:07.740 --> 03:03:10.480]   so that two different drug cartels shoot each other
[03:03:10.480 --> 03:03:15.480]   by assisting in the transaction of a sale
[03:03:15.480 --> 03:03:20.100]   to a third country, and then leaking that that sale happened
[03:03:20.100 --> 03:03:23.180]   to a competing cartel, that's just letting cartels
[03:03:23.180 --> 03:03:25.660]   do what they do, that's them doing the dirty work for us.
[03:03:25.660 --> 03:03:27.220]   So especially at the beginning of the drug war,
[03:03:27.220 --> 03:03:29.860]   I think there was tons of space, lots of room
[03:03:29.860 --> 03:03:33.740]   for CIA to get involved in the economics of drugs
[03:03:33.740 --> 03:03:35.380]   and then let the inevitable happen.
[03:03:35.380 --> 03:03:38.260]   And that was way more efficient, way more productive
[03:03:38.260 --> 03:03:40.980]   than us trying to send our own troops in
[03:03:40.980 --> 03:03:43.960]   to kill a bunch of cartel warlords.
[03:03:43.960 --> 03:03:45.300]   So that makes a ton of sense to me.
[03:03:45.300 --> 03:03:47.300]   It just seems efficient, it seems very practical.
[03:03:47.300 --> 03:03:49.480]   I do not believe that CIA would like,
[03:03:49.480 --> 03:03:50.860]   I don't think all the accusations out there
[03:03:50.860 --> 03:03:53.600]   about how they would buy drugs and sell drugs
[03:03:53.600 --> 03:03:55.220]   and somehow make money on the side from it,
[03:03:55.220 --> 03:03:56.860]   that's not how it works.
[03:03:56.860 --> 03:03:59.660]   - So do you think there's, on that point,
[03:03:59.660 --> 03:04:04.060]   a connection between Barry Seale, the great governor,
[03:04:04.060 --> 03:04:06.620]   and then President Bill Clinton, Oliver North,
[03:04:06.620 --> 03:04:10.580]   and Vice President and former CIA Director George H.W. Bush
[03:04:10.580 --> 03:04:12.820]   and a little town with a little airport
[03:04:12.820 --> 03:04:14.900]   called Mena, Arkansas?
[03:04:14.900 --> 03:04:17.100]   - So I am out of my element now.
[03:04:17.100 --> 03:04:19.800]   This is one I haven't heard many details about.
[03:04:19.800 --> 03:04:24.800]   - Okay, so your sense is any of the drug trafficking
[03:04:24.800 --> 03:04:28.840]   has to do with criminal operations
[03:04:28.840 --> 03:04:30.760]   outside of the United States and the CIA
[03:04:30.760 --> 03:04:35.240]   just leveraging that to achieve its ends,
[03:04:35.240 --> 03:04:37.520]   but nothing to do with American citizens
[03:04:37.520 --> 03:04:39.840]   and American politicians?
[03:04:39.840 --> 03:04:43.320]   - With American citizens, again, speaking organizationally.
[03:04:43.320 --> 03:04:45.620]   So that would be my sense, yes.
[03:04:46.620 --> 03:04:50.500]   - Let me ask you about, so back to Operation Northwoods,
[03:04:50.500 --> 03:04:55.500]   because it's such a powerful tool,
[03:04:55.500 --> 03:04:59.980]   sadly powerful tool used by dictators throughout history,
[03:04:59.980 --> 03:05:01.920]   the false flag operation.
[03:05:01.920 --> 03:05:09.140]   So I think there's, and you said the terrorist attacks
[03:05:09.140 --> 03:05:14.140]   in 9/11 were, it changed a lot for us,
[03:05:15.180 --> 03:05:18.580]   for the United States, for Americans.
[03:05:18.580 --> 03:05:19.860]   It changed the way we see the world.
[03:05:19.860 --> 03:05:22.020]   It woke us up to the harshness of the world.
[03:05:22.020 --> 03:05:24.980]   I think there's, to my eyes at least,
[03:05:24.980 --> 03:05:27.320]   there's nothing that shows evidence
[03:05:27.320 --> 03:05:30.480]   that 9/11 was a quote, inside job.
[03:05:30.480 --> 03:05:35.480]   But is the CIA or the intelligence agencies
[03:05:35.480 --> 03:05:41.300]   or the US government capable of something like that?
[03:05:41.300 --> 03:05:42.700]   But that's the question.
[03:05:44.580 --> 03:05:47.820]   There's a bunch of shadieness about how it was reported on.
[03:05:47.820 --> 03:05:49.620]   I just can't.
[03:05:49.620 --> 03:05:51.560]   That's the thing I struggle with.
[03:05:51.560 --> 03:05:57.060]   While there's no evidence that there was an inside job,
[03:05:57.060 --> 03:05:59.300]   it raises the question to me,
[03:05:59.300 --> 03:06:02.940]   well, could something like this be an inside job?
[03:06:02.940 --> 03:06:06.600]   'Cause it sure as heck, now looking back 20 years,
[03:06:06.600 --> 03:06:09.460]   the amount of money that was spent on these wars,
[03:06:09.460 --> 03:06:11.660]   the military industrial complex,
[03:06:11.660 --> 03:06:14.140]   the amount of interest in terms of power
[03:06:14.140 --> 03:06:19.140]   and money involved, organizationally,
[03:06:19.140 --> 03:06:22.580]   can something like that happen?
[03:06:22.580 --> 03:06:24.180]   - You know Occam's razor.
[03:06:24.180 --> 03:06:28.140]   So, the Harem's razor is that you can never prescribe
[03:06:28.140 --> 03:06:32.560]   to conspiracy what could be explained through incompetence.
[03:06:32.560 --> 03:06:37.300]   That is one of, those are two fundamental guidelines
[03:06:37.300 --> 03:06:38.860]   that we follow all the time.
[03:06:38.860 --> 03:06:40.700]   The simplest answer is oftentimes the best,
[03:06:40.700 --> 03:06:43.300]   and never prescribe to conspiracy
[03:06:43.300 --> 03:06:45.140]   what can be explained through incompetence.
[03:06:45.140 --> 03:06:47.540]   - Can you elaborate what you mean by we?
[03:06:47.540 --> 03:06:50.860]   - We as intelligence professionals.
[03:06:50.860 --> 03:06:55.140]   - So, you think there's a deep truth to that second razor?
[03:06:55.140 --> 03:06:57.660]   - There is more than a deep truth.
[03:06:57.660 --> 03:07:01.900]   There's ages of experience for me and for others.
[03:07:01.900 --> 03:07:04.620]   - So, in general, people are incompetent.
[03:07:04.620 --> 03:07:09.060]   If left to their own means, they're more incompetent
[03:07:09.060 --> 03:07:13.780]   than they are malevolent at a large organizational scale.
[03:07:13.780 --> 03:07:17.380]   - People are more incompetent of executing a conspiracy
[03:07:17.380 --> 03:07:22.460]   than they are of competently, yeah,
[03:07:22.460 --> 03:07:25.200]   than they are of competently executing a conspiracy.
[03:07:25.200 --> 03:07:28.720]   That's really what it means, is that it's so difficult
[03:07:28.720 --> 03:07:31.380]   to carry out a complex lie that most people
[03:07:31.380 --> 03:07:33.260]   don't have the competency to do it.
[03:07:33.260 --> 03:07:35.260]   So, it doesn't make any sense to lead
[03:07:35.260 --> 03:07:36.400]   thinking of conspiracy.
[03:07:36.400 --> 03:07:40.280]   It makes more sense to lead assuming incompetence.
[03:07:40.280 --> 03:07:41.920]   When you look at all of the outcomes,
[03:07:41.920 --> 03:07:45.100]   all the findings from 9/11, it speaks to incompetence.
[03:07:45.100 --> 03:07:48.880]   It speaks brashly and openly to incompetence,
[03:07:48.880 --> 03:07:51.000]   and nobody likes talking about it.
[03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:53.800]   FBI and CIA to this day hate hearing about it.
[03:07:53.800 --> 03:07:56.320]   The 9/11 Commission is gonna go down in history
[03:07:56.320 --> 03:07:58.720]   as this painful example of the incompetence
[03:07:58.720 --> 03:08:01.080]   of the American intelligence community,
[03:08:01.080 --> 03:08:02.920]   and it's going to come back again and again.
[03:08:02.920 --> 03:08:04.200]   Every time there's an intel flap,
[03:08:04.200 --> 03:08:06.800]   it's gonna come back again and again.
[03:08:06.800 --> 03:08:08.640]   What are you seeing even right now?
[03:08:08.640 --> 03:08:12.120]   We missed the US intelligence infrastructure,
[03:08:12.120 --> 03:08:16.400]   misjudged Afghanistan, misjudged Hong Kong,
[03:08:16.400 --> 03:08:20.160]   misjudged Ukraine's and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
[03:08:20.160 --> 03:08:22.800]   Those were three massive misjudgments in a few years.
[03:08:22.800 --> 03:08:25.840]   - It's just embarrassing to think.
[03:08:25.840 --> 03:08:28.200]   - It's just embarrassing, exactly right.
[03:08:28.200 --> 03:08:32.520]   - So, all the sort of cover-up looking things
[03:08:32.520 --> 03:08:35.040]   around 9/11 is just people being embarrassed
[03:08:35.040 --> 03:08:36.560]   by their failures.
[03:08:36.560 --> 03:08:39.240]   - If they're taking steps to cover anything up,
[03:08:39.240 --> 03:08:43.760]   it's just their own, it's a painful reminder
[03:08:43.760 --> 03:08:46.200]   of their lack of competency at the time.
[03:08:46.200 --> 03:08:48.680]   Now, I understand that conspiracy theorists
[03:08:48.680 --> 03:08:51.900]   want to take inklings of information
[03:08:51.900 --> 03:08:55.760]   and put them together in a way that is the most damning,
[03:08:55.760 --> 03:08:59.240]   but that goes back to our point about overvaluing losses
[03:08:59.240 --> 03:09:00.800]   and undervaluing gains.
[03:09:00.800 --> 03:09:02.840]   It's just predictable human behavior.
[03:09:02.840 --> 03:09:07.100]   - Let me ask you about this because it comes up often.
[03:09:07.100 --> 03:09:10.400]   So, I'm from MIT and there's a guy
[03:09:10.400 --> 03:09:14.280]   by the name of Jeffrey Epstein that still troubles me
[03:09:14.280 --> 03:09:17.480]   to this day that some of the people I respect
[03:09:17.480 --> 03:09:20.840]   were interacted with this individual
[03:09:20.840 --> 03:09:23.840]   and fell into his influence.
[03:09:27.760 --> 03:09:31.960]   The charm, charisma, whatever the hell he used
[03:09:31.960 --> 03:09:36.960]   to delude these people, he did so successfully.
[03:09:36.960 --> 03:09:38.680]   I'm very open-minded about this thing.
[03:09:38.680 --> 03:09:40.400]   I just, I would love to learn more,
[03:09:40.400 --> 03:09:44.640]   but a lot of people tell me, a lot of people I respect,
[03:09:44.640 --> 03:09:47.880]   that there's intelligence agencies behind this individual,
[03:09:47.880 --> 03:09:49.920]   so they were using Jeffrey Epstein
[03:09:49.920 --> 03:09:54.120]   for getting access to powerful people
[03:09:54.120 --> 03:09:57.340]   and then to control and manipulate those powerful people.
[03:09:57.340 --> 03:10:00.920]   The CIA, I believe, is not brought up as often as Mossad,
[03:10:00.920 --> 03:10:04.360]   and so this goes back to the original aspect
[03:10:04.360 --> 03:10:06.960]   of our conversation is how much each individual
[03:10:06.960 --> 03:10:09.560]   intelligence agency is willing to go,
[03:10:09.560 --> 03:10:13.520]   to control, to manipulate, to achieve its means.
[03:10:13.520 --> 03:10:16.920]   Do you think there is, can you educate me if,
[03:10:16.920 --> 03:10:21.360]   obviously, you don't know, but you can bet,
[03:10:21.360 --> 03:10:23.960]   what are the chances the intelligence agencies
[03:10:23.960 --> 03:10:26.800]   are involved with the character of Jeffrey Epstein?
[03:10:26.800 --> 03:10:29.320]   In some way, shape, or form with the character of Epstein,
[03:10:29.320 --> 03:10:33.920]   it's 100% guaranteed that some intelligence organization
[03:10:33.920 --> 03:10:36.320]   was involved, but let's talk about why.
[03:10:36.320 --> 03:10:38.040]   Let's talk about why, okay?
[03:10:38.040 --> 03:10:38.880]   - Yeah.
[03:10:38.880 --> 03:10:41.800]   - There's multiple types of intelligence assets,
[03:10:41.800 --> 03:10:43.400]   just like we were talking earlier.
[03:10:43.400 --> 03:10:47.200]   There's foreign intelligence reporting assets,
[03:10:47.200 --> 03:10:51.920]   there's access agents, and then there's agents of influence.
[03:10:51.920 --> 03:10:54.920]   Three different categories of intelligence, right?
[03:10:54.920 --> 03:10:58.200]   One is when you talk about foreign intelligence reporters,
[03:10:58.200 --> 03:10:59.720]   these are people who have access to secrets,
[03:10:59.720 --> 03:11:02.000]   and their job is to give you their secrets
[03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:03.960]   in exchange for gold, or money, or alcohol,
[03:11:03.960 --> 03:11:05.360]   or prostitution, or whatever else, right?
[03:11:05.360 --> 03:11:07.080]   Their job is to give you secrets,
[03:11:07.080 --> 03:11:09.120]   and then you pay them for the secrets.
[03:11:09.120 --> 03:11:13.440]   Access agents, their job is to give you physical access,
[03:11:13.440 --> 03:11:17.640]   or digital access, to something of interest to you.
[03:11:17.640 --> 03:11:19.840]   So maybe they're the ones that open a door
[03:11:19.840 --> 03:11:21.320]   that should've been locked and let you come in
[03:11:21.320 --> 03:11:23.080]   and stick your thumb drive in the computer.
[03:11:23.080 --> 03:11:25.600]   Or maybe they're the ones that share a phone number
[03:11:25.600 --> 03:11:27.520]   with somebody, and then they're just like,
[03:11:27.520 --> 03:11:29.120]   just don't tell them you got the phone number from me.
[03:11:29.120 --> 03:11:31.240]   Their job is to give you access.
[03:11:31.240 --> 03:11:33.640]   Then you have these agents of influence.
[03:11:33.640 --> 03:11:38.640]   An agent of influence's job is to be part of your effort
[03:11:38.640 --> 03:11:42.800]   to influence the outcomes in some way
[03:11:42.800 --> 03:11:46.160]   that benefits your intelligence requirements, right?
[03:11:46.160 --> 03:11:48.480]   Of these three types of people,
[03:11:48.480 --> 03:11:52.880]   the least scrupulous and the most shady
[03:11:52.880 --> 03:11:54.800]   is your agent of influence,
[03:11:54.800 --> 03:11:55.920]   because your agent of influence
[03:11:55.920 --> 03:11:57.500]   understands exactly what they're doing.
[03:11:57.500 --> 03:11:59.880]   They know they're working with one guy,
[03:11:59.880 --> 03:12:02.400]   and they know they're using the influence
[03:12:02.400 --> 03:12:04.300]   to manipulate some other guy.
[03:12:04.300 --> 03:12:07.360]   When it comes to powerful people,
[03:12:07.360 --> 03:12:09.580]   especially wealthy, powerful people,
[03:12:09.580 --> 03:12:14.160]   the only thing that interests them is power.
[03:12:14.160 --> 03:12:16.440]   Money is not a challenge anymore.
[03:12:16.440 --> 03:12:19.520]   Prestige, notoriety, none of those things are a challenge.
[03:12:19.520 --> 03:12:21.400]   The rest of us, we're busy trying to make money.
[03:12:21.400 --> 03:12:23.160]   We're busy trying to build a reputation.
[03:12:23.160 --> 03:12:25.720]   We're busy trying to build a career, keep a family afloat.
[03:12:25.720 --> 03:12:27.460]   At the highest levels, they're bored.
[03:12:27.460 --> 03:12:28.860]   They don't need any of that.
[03:12:28.860 --> 03:12:30.480]   The only thing that they care about
[03:12:30.480 --> 03:12:32.400]   is being able to wield power.
[03:12:32.400 --> 03:12:35.680]   So a character like Jeffrey Epstein
[03:12:35.680 --> 03:12:38.000]   is exactly the kind of character
[03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:41.280]   that the Chinese would want, the Russians would want,
[03:12:41.280 --> 03:12:44.040]   Mossad would want, the French would want.
[03:12:44.040 --> 03:12:47.680]   It's too easy, because the man had access
[03:12:47.680 --> 03:12:52.200]   to a wide range of American influential people.
[03:12:52.200 --> 03:12:56.960]   For corporate espionage uses, for economic espionage uses,
[03:12:56.960 --> 03:12:59.440]   for national security espionage uses,
[03:12:59.440 --> 03:13:01.400]   it doesn't make any sense
[03:13:01.400 --> 03:13:03.640]   that a person like that wouldn't be targeted.
[03:13:03.640 --> 03:13:04.560]   It doesn't.
[03:13:04.560 --> 03:13:06.560]   - So the question is-- - Who?
[03:13:06.560 --> 03:13:12.520]   - Who, and whether, I think the really important distinction
[03:13:14.400 --> 03:13:18.160]   here is was this person, was Jeffrey Epstein created,
[03:13:18.160 --> 03:13:21.660]   or once he's achieved and built his network,
[03:13:21.660 --> 03:13:23.640]   was he then infiltrated?
[03:13:23.640 --> 03:13:26.840]   And that's a really sort of important difference.
[03:13:26.840 --> 03:13:29.520]   Like at which stage do you connect a person like that?
[03:13:29.520 --> 03:13:32.280]   You start to notice maybe they're effective
[03:13:32.280 --> 03:13:36.080]   at building a network, and then you start making,
[03:13:36.080 --> 03:13:38.640]   building a relationship to where at some point
[03:13:38.640 --> 03:13:41.060]   it's a job, they're working for you.
[03:13:41.060 --> 03:13:43.840]   Or do you literally create a person like that?
[03:13:43.840 --> 03:13:45.760]   - Yeah, so intelligence organizations
[03:13:45.760 --> 03:13:47.180]   have different strategies here.
[03:13:47.180 --> 03:13:49.820]   In the United States, we never create.
[03:13:49.820 --> 03:13:53.360]   We don't have a budget cycle that allows us to create.
[03:13:53.360 --> 03:13:55.320]   I mean, the maximum budget cycle
[03:13:55.320 --> 03:13:57.160]   in the United States is five years.
[03:13:57.160 --> 03:14:00.520]   So even if we were to try to invest in some seed operation
[03:14:00.520 --> 03:14:03.120]   or create some character of influence,
[03:14:03.120 --> 03:14:06.120]   essentially every year you have to justify
[03:14:06.120 --> 03:14:07.720]   why you're spending budget.
[03:14:07.720 --> 03:14:10.120]   And that becomes very difficult in a democracy like ours.
[03:14:10.120 --> 03:14:13.800]   However, Russia and China are extremely adept
[03:14:13.800 --> 03:14:17.240]   at seed operations, long-term operations.
[03:14:17.240 --> 03:14:20.920]   They are willing to invest and develop
[03:14:20.920 --> 03:14:25.920]   and create an agent that serves their purposes.
[03:14:25.920 --> 03:14:30.980]   Now, to create someone from scratch like Jeffrey Epstein,
[03:14:30.980 --> 03:14:34.100]   the probabilities are extremely low.
[03:14:34.100 --> 03:14:35.040]   They would have had to start
[03:14:35.040 --> 03:14:37.320]   with like a thousand different targets
[03:14:37.320 --> 03:14:39.360]   and try to grow a thousand different,
[03:14:39.360 --> 03:14:41.160]   if you will, influencers,
[03:14:41.160 --> 03:14:42.680]   and then hope that one of them hits
[03:14:42.680 --> 03:14:44.620]   kind of like a venture capital firm, right?
[03:14:44.620 --> 03:14:47.040]   Invest in many, hope that a few hits.
[03:14:47.040 --> 03:14:51.320]   More likely, they observed him at some point
[03:14:51.320 --> 03:14:53.360]   in his own natural rise.
[03:14:53.360 --> 03:14:55.540]   They identified his personal vulnerability,
[03:14:55.540 --> 03:14:57.620]   very classic espionage technique.
[03:14:57.620 --> 03:15:01.080]   And then they stepped in, introduced themselves mid-career
[03:15:01.080 --> 03:15:04.040]   and said, "Hey, we know you have this thing that you like
[03:15:04.040 --> 03:15:06.920]   "that isn't really frowned upon by your own people,
[03:15:06.920 --> 03:15:08.100]   "but we don't frown upon it.
[03:15:08.100 --> 03:15:10.480]   "And we can help you both succeed
[03:15:10.480 --> 03:15:14.920]   "and have an endless supply of ladies along the way."
[03:15:14.920 --> 03:15:18.200]   - I've recently talked to Ryan Graves, who's a lieutenant,
[03:15:18.200 --> 03:15:21.480]   Ryan Graves, who's a fighter jet pilot,
[03:15:21.480 --> 03:15:26.200]   about many things.
[03:15:26.200 --> 03:15:29.520]   He also does work on autonomous weapon systems,
[03:15:29.520 --> 03:15:32.740]   drones, and that kind of thing, including quantum computing.
[03:15:32.740 --> 03:15:37.240]   But he also happens to be one of the very few pilots
[03:15:37.240 --> 03:15:38.920]   that were willing to go on record
[03:15:38.920 --> 03:15:41.040]   and talk about UFO sightings.
[03:15:41.040 --> 03:15:45.600]   Does the CIA and the federal government
[03:15:45.600 --> 03:15:47.760]   have interest in UFOs?
[03:15:47.760 --> 03:15:51.680]   - In my experience at CIA, that is an area
[03:15:51.680 --> 03:15:54.720]   that remains very compartmented.
[03:15:54.720 --> 03:15:57.740]   And that could be one of two reasons.
[03:15:57.740 --> 03:15:59.640]   It could be because there is significant interest
[03:15:59.640 --> 03:16:02.040]   and that's why it's so heavily compartmented.
[03:16:02.040 --> 03:16:05.880]   Or it could be because it's an area that's non,
[03:16:05.880 --> 03:16:07.000]   that's just not important.
[03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:09.480]   It's a distraction, so they compartment it
[03:16:09.480 --> 03:16:12.540]   so it doesn't distract from other operations.
[03:16:12.540 --> 03:16:17.880]   One of the areas that I've been quite interested in
[03:16:17.880 --> 03:16:19.120]   and where I've done a lot of research
[03:16:19.120 --> 03:16:20.840]   and I've done some work in the private intelligence
[03:16:20.840 --> 03:16:23.180]   and private investigation side is with UFOs.
[03:16:23.180 --> 03:16:27.600]   The place where UFOs really connect
[03:16:27.600 --> 03:16:28.680]   with the federal government
[03:16:28.680 --> 03:16:31.040]   is when it comes to aviation safety
[03:16:31.040 --> 03:16:33.240]   and predominance of power.
[03:16:33.240 --> 03:16:37.000]   So FAA and the US Air Force and the US military
[03:16:37.000 --> 03:16:38.960]   are very invested in knowing what's happening
[03:16:38.960 --> 03:16:41.000]   in the skies above the United States.
[03:16:41.000 --> 03:16:43.640]   And that's of primary interest to them.
[03:16:43.640 --> 03:16:46.360]   When they can rule out the direct threat
[03:16:46.360 --> 03:16:48.320]   to national security of UFOs,
[03:16:48.320 --> 03:16:50.220]   then they become less interested.
[03:16:50.220 --> 03:16:54.400]   That said, when you have unexplained aerial phenomenon
[03:16:54.400 --> 03:16:58.920]   that are unexplained, that can't directly be tied
[03:16:58.920 --> 03:17:03.440]   to anything that is known of the terrestrial world,
[03:17:03.440 --> 03:17:07.880]   then they're left without an answer to their question.
[03:17:07.880 --> 03:17:10.640]   They don't know if it's a threat or not a threat.
[03:17:10.640 --> 03:17:12.560]   But I think the scarier concern
[03:17:12.560 --> 03:17:13.800]   for the US national government
[03:17:13.800 --> 03:17:15.280]   or for the US federal government,
[03:17:15.280 --> 03:17:16.960]   the scarier concern that nobody talks about
[03:17:16.960 --> 03:17:20.320]   is what if the UFO isn't alien?
[03:17:20.320 --> 03:17:25.320]   What if it is actually a cutting edge war machine
[03:17:25.880 --> 03:17:29.280]   that we are eons behind ever being able to replicate?
[03:17:29.280 --> 03:17:34.200]   - Or the other concern is that it's a system,
[03:17:34.200 --> 03:17:36.840]   it's a machine from a foreign power
[03:17:36.840 --> 03:17:38.720]   that's doing intelligence collection.
[03:17:38.720 --> 03:17:39.560]   - Correct.
[03:17:39.560 --> 03:17:41.200]   - So it's not just military purposes,
[03:17:41.200 --> 03:17:43.780]   it's actually collecting data.
[03:17:43.780 --> 03:17:46.240]   - Well, they fall, a lot of times the federal government
[03:17:46.240 --> 03:17:47.200]   will see the two as the same.
[03:17:47.200 --> 03:17:50.200]   It's a hostile tool from a foreign government.
[03:17:50.200 --> 03:17:53.640]   - So collection of information is a hostile act.
[03:17:53.640 --> 03:17:56.600]   - Absolutely, that's why the Espionage Act exists.
[03:17:56.600 --> 03:17:58.120]   That's why it's a criminal offense
[03:17:58.120 --> 03:18:00.340]   if you're committing espionage in the United States
[03:18:00.340 --> 03:18:03.320]   as a US citizen or a foreign citizen.
[03:18:03.320 --> 03:18:04.640]   - So I guess they keep digging
[03:18:04.640 --> 03:18:07.000]   until they can confirm it's not a threat.
[03:18:07.000 --> 03:18:10.640]   But it just, and you're saying that there's not,
[03:18:10.640 --> 03:18:13.240]   from your understanding, much evidence that they're doing so,
[03:18:13.240 --> 03:18:17.020]   it could be because they're compartmentalized.
[03:18:17.020 --> 03:18:21.520]   But you're saying private intelligence institutions
[03:18:21.520 --> 03:18:24.540]   are trying to make progress on this.
[03:18:24.540 --> 03:18:29.600]   Yeah, it's really difficult to know the scale.
[03:18:29.600 --> 03:18:31.480]   - Yeah, there's an economic interest
[03:18:31.480 --> 03:18:33.880]   in the private intelligence world.
[03:18:33.880 --> 03:18:36.000]   Because, for example, if you understand
[03:18:36.000 --> 03:18:39.960]   why certain aerial phenomenon are happening over a location,
[03:18:39.960 --> 03:18:43.320]   then you can use that to inform investors,
[03:18:43.320 --> 03:18:44.920]   whether to invest in that location
[03:18:44.920 --> 03:18:47.040]   or avoid investment in that location.
[03:18:47.040 --> 03:18:48.640]   But that's not a national security concern,
[03:18:48.640 --> 03:18:51.480]   so it doesn't matter to the federal government.
[03:18:51.480 --> 03:18:54.500]   - Could these UFOs be aliens?
[03:18:54.500 --> 03:18:57.280]   Now I'm going into a territory of you as a human being,
[03:18:57.280 --> 03:19:00.040]   wondering about all the alien civilizations
[03:19:00.040 --> 03:19:01.600]   that are out there.
[03:19:01.600 --> 03:19:03.940]   The humbling question.
[03:19:03.940 --> 03:19:05.520]   - We are not alone.
[03:19:05.520 --> 03:19:07.020]   - You think we're not alone?
[03:19:07.020 --> 03:19:10.320]   - It's an improbability that we are alone.
[03:19:10.320 --> 03:19:15.080]   If by virtue of the fact that sentient human life exists,
[03:19:15.080 --> 03:19:17.400]   intelligent human life exists,
[03:19:17.400 --> 03:19:19.320]   all the probabilities that would have to be destroyed
[03:19:19.320 --> 03:19:20.720]   for that to be true,
[03:19:20.720 --> 03:19:23.720]   simply speak over the galaxies that exist,
[03:19:23.720 --> 03:19:26.240]   that there's no possible way we're alone.
[03:19:26.240 --> 03:19:27.720]   It's a mathematical equation.
[03:19:27.720 --> 03:19:30.280]   It's a one or a zero, right?
[03:19:30.280 --> 03:19:32.560]   And for me, it has to exist.
[03:19:32.560 --> 03:19:34.900]   It's impossible otherwise, rationally,
[03:19:34.900 --> 03:19:36.320]   for me to think that we are truly
[03:19:36.320 --> 03:19:39.320]   the only intelligent life form in all of the universe.
[03:19:39.320 --> 03:19:43.960]   But to think that an alien life form
[03:19:43.960 --> 03:19:46.520]   is anything like us at all,
[03:19:46.520 --> 03:19:49.840]   is equally as inconceivable.
[03:19:49.840 --> 03:19:51.480]   To think that they're carbon-based,
[03:19:51.480 --> 03:19:55.600]   bipedal, humanoid, alien species
[03:19:55.600 --> 03:19:58.680]   that just happen to fly around in metal machines
[03:19:58.680 --> 03:20:03.200]   and visit alien planets in a way that they become observed,
[03:20:03.200 --> 03:20:05.800]   it's just silly.
[03:20:05.800 --> 03:20:07.120]   It's the world of sci-fi.
[03:20:07.120 --> 03:20:08.040]   - Well, let me push--
[03:20:08.040 --> 03:20:09.920]   - Every good scientist,
[03:20:09.920 --> 03:20:11.920]   'cause we always assume that they're superior to us
[03:20:11.920 --> 03:20:13.480]   in intelligence.
[03:20:13.480 --> 03:20:16.480]   When any scientist carries out an experiment,
[03:20:16.480 --> 03:20:18.160]   the whole objective of the experiment
[03:20:18.160 --> 03:20:23.160]   is to observe without being disclosed or being discovered.
[03:20:23.160 --> 03:20:26.320]   So why on earth would we think that this superior species
[03:20:26.320 --> 03:20:29.220]   makes the mistake of being discovered over and over again?
[03:20:29.220 --> 03:20:32.720]   - So to push back on that idea,
[03:20:32.720 --> 03:20:34.680]   if we were to think about us humans
[03:20:34.680 --> 03:20:36.500]   trying to communicate with ants,
[03:20:36.500 --> 03:20:39.440]   first, we observe for a while.
[03:20:39.440 --> 03:20:41.280]   There'll be a bunch of PhDs written,
[03:20:41.280 --> 03:20:45.120]   a bunch of people just sort of collecting data,
[03:20:45.120 --> 03:20:48.440]   taking notes, trying to understand about this thing
[03:20:48.440 --> 03:20:50.960]   that you detected that seems to be a living thing,
[03:20:50.960 --> 03:20:52.560]   which is a very difficult thing to define
[03:20:52.560 --> 03:20:55.160]   from an alien perspective or from our perspective
[03:20:55.160 --> 03:20:57.600]   if we find a life on Mars or something like that.
[03:20:57.600 --> 03:20:59.720]   Okay, so you observe for a while.
[03:20:59.720 --> 03:21:02.320]   But then if you want to actually interact with it,
[03:21:02.320 --> 03:21:04.440]   how would you interact with the ants?
[03:21:04.440 --> 03:21:06.880]   If I were to interact with the ants,
[03:21:06.880 --> 03:21:10.620]   I would try to infiltrate.
[03:21:10.620 --> 03:21:13.960]   I would try to figure out
[03:21:13.960 --> 03:21:15.400]   what is the language they use
[03:21:15.400 --> 03:21:16.960]   to communicate with each other.
[03:21:16.960 --> 03:21:21.840]   I would try to operate at their physical scale,
[03:21:21.840 --> 03:21:24.620]   like in terms of the physics of their interaction,
[03:21:24.620 --> 03:21:27.960]   in terms of the information methods,
[03:21:27.960 --> 03:21:30.960]   mediums of information exchange with pheromones
[03:21:30.960 --> 03:21:33.040]   or whatever, however the heck, ants.
[03:21:33.040 --> 03:21:36.000]   So I would try to mimic them in some way.
[03:21:36.000 --> 03:21:39.120]   So in that sense, it makes sense that
[03:21:39.120 --> 03:21:43.360]   the objects we would see,
[03:21:43.360 --> 03:21:45.880]   you mentioned bipedal, yes, of course it's ridiculous
[03:21:45.880 --> 03:21:50.240]   that aliens would actually be very similar to us,
[03:21:50.240 --> 03:21:54.800]   but maybe they create forms in order to be like,
[03:21:54.800 --> 03:21:58.280]   here, the humans will understand it.
[03:21:58.280 --> 03:22:00.920]   And this needs to be sufficiently different from humans
[03:22:00.920 --> 03:22:02.840]   to know that there's something weird.
[03:22:02.840 --> 03:22:05.080]   I don't know, I think it's actually
[03:22:05.080 --> 03:22:07.360]   an incredibly difficult problem of figuring out
[03:22:07.360 --> 03:22:10.440]   how to communicate with a thing way dumber than you.
[03:22:11.920 --> 03:22:14.680]   People assume if you're smart,
[03:22:14.680 --> 03:22:16.840]   it's easy to talk to the dumb thing,
[03:22:16.840 --> 03:22:19.260]   but I think it's actually extremely difficult
[03:22:19.260 --> 03:22:23.760]   when the gap in intelligence is just orders of magnitude.
[03:22:23.760 --> 03:22:26.320]   And so of course you can observe,
[03:22:26.320 --> 03:22:30.040]   but once you notice the thing is sufficiently interesting,
[03:22:30.040 --> 03:22:32.160]   how do you communicate with that thing?
[03:22:32.160 --> 03:22:34.320]   - So this is where, one of the things
[03:22:34.320 --> 03:22:38.720]   I always try to highlight is how conspiracies are born,
[03:22:38.720 --> 03:22:40.680]   because many people don't understand
[03:22:40.680 --> 03:22:44.360]   how easy it is to fall into the conspiratorial cycle.
[03:22:44.360 --> 03:22:47.560]   So the first step to a conspiracy being born
[03:22:47.560 --> 03:22:52.380]   is to have a piece of evidence that is true.
[03:22:52.380 --> 03:22:55.360]   And then immediately following the true evidence
[03:22:55.360 --> 03:22:57.280]   is a gap in information.
[03:22:57.280 --> 03:23:00.720]   And then to fill in the gap of information,
[03:23:00.720 --> 03:23:05.720]   people create an idea, and then the next logical outcome
[03:23:05.720 --> 03:23:08.080]   is based on the idea that they just created,
[03:23:08.080 --> 03:23:10.280]   which is an idea that's based on something
[03:23:10.280 --> 03:23:12.520]   that was imagined in the first place.
[03:23:12.520 --> 03:23:15.520]   So the idea, the factual thing is now two steps away,
[03:23:15.520 --> 03:23:17.280]   and then three steps away, four steps away,
[03:23:17.280 --> 03:23:18.120]   as the things go on.
[03:23:18.120 --> 03:23:20.340]   And then all of a sudden you have this kernel of truth
[03:23:20.340 --> 03:23:23.040]   that turned into this wild conspiracy.
[03:23:23.040 --> 03:23:26.080]   So in our example, you talked about humans
[03:23:26.080 --> 03:23:27.320]   trying to communicate with ants.
[03:23:27.320 --> 03:23:28.840]   Ants are not intelligent.
[03:23:28.840 --> 03:23:30.800]   There's no, ants are not an intelligent species.
[03:23:30.800 --> 03:23:33.800]   They're a drone species that's somehow commanded
[03:23:33.800 --> 03:23:36.080]   through whatever technology, whatever--
[03:23:36.080 --> 03:23:37.920]   - Spoken like a typical human, but yes.
[03:23:37.920 --> 03:23:40.120]   - Whatever biological thing is in the queen, right,
[03:23:40.120 --> 03:23:41.960]   but it's not a fair equivalent.
[03:23:41.960 --> 03:23:43.120]   But let's look at gorillas,
[03:23:43.120 --> 03:23:45.240]   or let's look at something in the monkey family, right?
[03:23:45.240 --> 03:23:48.480]   Where largely we agree that there is some sort
[03:23:48.480 --> 03:23:50.040]   of intelligence there, or dolphins,
[03:23:50.040 --> 03:23:52.160]   some sort of intelligence, right?
[03:23:52.160 --> 03:23:57.240]   It is a human thing, a human thing,
[03:23:57.240 --> 03:24:02.240]   to want to observe and then communicate and integrate.
[03:24:02.240 --> 03:24:06.620]   That's a human thing, not an intelligent life thing.
[03:24:06.620 --> 03:24:09.040]   So for us to even think that a foreign,
[03:24:09.040 --> 03:24:12.240]   an intelligent alien species would want to engage
[03:24:12.240 --> 03:24:16.920]   and communicate at all is an extremely human assumption.
[03:24:16.920 --> 03:24:18.200]   And then from that assumption,
[03:24:18.200 --> 03:24:20.160]   then we started going into all the other things you said.
[03:24:20.160 --> 03:24:23.040]   If they wanted to communicate, wouldn't they wanna mimic?
[03:24:23.040 --> 03:24:24.120]   If they wanted to mimic,
[03:24:24.120 --> 03:24:26.040]   wouldn't they create devices like ours?
[03:24:26.040 --> 03:24:29.320]   So now we're three steps removed from the true fact
[03:24:29.320 --> 03:24:32.420]   of there's something unexplainable in the skies.
[03:24:32.420 --> 03:24:37.800]   - Yeah, so the fact is there's something unexplainable
[03:24:37.800 --> 03:24:40.400]   in the skies and then we're filling in the gaps
[03:24:40.400 --> 03:24:43.280]   with all our basic human biases and assumptions.
[03:24:43.280 --> 03:24:45.040]   - Exactly. - But the thing is--
[03:24:45.040 --> 03:24:47.600]   - Now we're getting right back to Project Northwood.
[03:24:47.600 --> 03:24:48.800]   We need some plan.
[03:24:48.800 --> 03:24:50.440]   I don't care how crazy the idea is, guys,
[03:24:50.440 --> 03:24:51.520]   give me some plan.
[03:24:51.520 --> 03:24:53.400]   So that's where we come up with,
[03:24:53.400 --> 03:24:55.280]   maybe it's an alien species trying to communicate,
[03:24:55.280 --> 03:24:57.960]   or maybe it's an alien, a hostile threat
[03:24:57.960 --> 03:24:59.760]   that's trying to take over the world,
[03:24:59.760 --> 03:25:01.920]   or who knows what, maybe it's--
[03:25:01.920 --> 03:25:06.920]   - But you have to somehow construct hypotheses
[03:25:07.140 --> 03:25:10.120]   and theories for anomalies,
[03:25:10.120 --> 03:25:15.120]   and then from that, amidst the giant pile of the ridiculous,
[03:25:15.120 --> 03:25:21.600]   emerges perhaps a deeper truth over a period of decades.
[03:25:21.600 --> 03:25:24.440]   And at first that truth is ridiculed
[03:25:24.440 --> 03:25:29.280]   and then it's accepted, that whole process.
[03:25:29.280 --> 03:25:30.760]   - The Earth revolving around the sun?
[03:25:30.760 --> 03:25:32.920]   - Yeah, the Earth revolving around the sun.
[03:25:32.940 --> 03:25:37.420]   But to me it's interesting because it asks us
[03:25:37.420 --> 03:25:41.980]   looking out there with SETI, just looking for alien life,
[03:25:41.980 --> 03:25:45.620]   is forcing us to really ask questions about ourselves,
[03:25:45.620 --> 03:25:48.420]   about what is life, how special,
[03:25:48.420 --> 03:25:50.020]   first of all, what is intelligence,
[03:25:50.020 --> 03:25:52.620]   how special is intelligence in the cosmos?
[03:25:52.620 --> 03:25:55.840]   And I think it's inspiring and challenging
[03:25:55.840 --> 03:25:57.460]   to us as human beings,
[03:25:57.460 --> 03:26:00.340]   both on a scientific and engineering level,
[03:26:00.340 --> 03:26:01.900]   but also on a philosophical level.
[03:26:01.900 --> 03:26:04.480]   I mean, all of those questions are laid before us
[03:26:04.480 --> 03:26:06.540]   when you start to think about alien life.
[03:26:06.540 --> 03:26:09.520]   - So you interviewed Joe Rogan recently.
[03:26:09.520 --> 03:26:12.380]   And he said something that I thought was really,
[03:26:12.380 --> 03:26:14.780]   really brilliant during the podcast interview.
[03:26:14.780 --> 03:26:15.620]   He said that--
[03:26:15.620 --> 03:26:17.000]   - He's gonna love hearing that.
[03:26:17.000 --> 03:26:18.180]   (laughing)
[03:26:18.180 --> 03:26:19.020]   Go ahead, sorry.
[03:26:19.020 --> 03:26:21.980]   - He said that he realized at some point
[03:26:21.980 --> 03:26:25.520]   that the turn in his opinion about UFOs happened
[03:26:25.520 --> 03:26:29.240]   when he realized how desperately he wanted it to be true.
[03:26:30.380 --> 03:26:32.960]   This is the human condition.
[03:26:32.960 --> 03:26:35.820]   Our pink matter works the same way
[03:26:35.820 --> 03:26:36.940]   as everybody's pink matter.
[03:26:36.940 --> 03:26:38.500]   And one of the ways that our pink matter works
[03:26:38.500 --> 03:26:41.520]   is with this thing, with what's known as a cognitive bias.
[03:26:41.520 --> 03:26:42.900]   It's a mental shortcut.
[03:26:42.900 --> 03:26:45.140]   Essentially, your brain doesn't want to process
[03:26:45.140 --> 03:26:46.620]   through facts over and over again.
[03:26:46.620 --> 03:26:48.980]   Instead, it wants to assume certain facts are in place
[03:26:48.980 --> 03:26:50.280]   and just jump right to the conclusion.
[03:26:50.280 --> 03:26:52.940]   It saves energy, it saves megabytes.
[03:26:52.940 --> 03:26:56.300]   So what Joe, what Joe or Joe Rogan,
[03:26:56.300 --> 03:26:57.820]   I feel weird calling him Joe, I don't know him,
[03:26:57.820 --> 03:26:59.660]   but what Joe identified on his own--
[03:26:59.660 --> 03:27:00.620]   - Mr. Rogan.
[03:27:00.620 --> 03:27:03.100]   - What Mr. Rogan identified on his own
[03:27:03.100 --> 03:27:06.940]   was his own cognitive loop.
[03:27:06.940 --> 03:27:10.360]   And then he immediately grew suspicious of that loop.
[03:27:10.360 --> 03:27:11.920]   That is a super powerful tool.
[03:27:11.920 --> 03:27:13.380]   That is something that most people
[03:27:13.380 --> 03:27:15.660]   never become self-actualized enough to realize,
[03:27:15.660 --> 03:27:17.300]   that they have a cognitive loop,
[03:27:17.300 --> 03:27:20.200]   let alone questioning their own cognitive loop.
[03:27:20.200 --> 03:27:23.500]   So that was, when it came to this topic specifically,
[03:27:23.500 --> 03:27:25.940]   that was just something that I thought was really powerful
[03:27:25.940 --> 03:27:30.940]   because you learn to not trust your own mind.
[03:27:30.940 --> 03:27:34.660]   - Just for the record, after he drinks one whiskey,
[03:27:34.660 --> 03:27:36.460]   all that goes out.
[03:27:36.460 --> 03:27:38.820]   I think that was just in that moment in time,
[03:27:38.820 --> 03:27:41.780]   - A moment of brilliance.
[03:27:41.780 --> 03:27:42.940]   - A moment of brilliance.
[03:27:42.940 --> 03:27:44.660]   'Cause I think he still is,
[03:27:44.660 --> 03:27:50.900]   he's definitely, one of the things that inspires me about Joe
[03:27:50.900 --> 03:27:53.420]   is how open-minded he is, how curious he is.
[03:27:53.420 --> 03:27:57.420]   He refuses to let the conformity and the conventions
[03:27:57.420 --> 03:28:00.620]   of any one community, including the scientific community,
[03:28:00.620 --> 03:28:04.220]   be a kind of thing that limits his curiosity,
[03:28:04.220 --> 03:28:08.760]   of asking what if, the whole, it's entirely possible.
[03:28:08.760 --> 03:28:10.180]   I think that's a beautiful thing.
[03:28:10.180 --> 03:28:13.700]   And it actually represents what the best of science is,
[03:28:13.700 --> 03:28:15.540]   that childlike curiosity.
[03:28:15.540 --> 03:28:18.580]   But, so it's good to balance those two things,
[03:28:18.580 --> 03:28:20.380]   but then you have to wake up to it.
[03:28:22.380 --> 03:28:24.460]   Is there a chance this is true,
[03:28:24.460 --> 03:28:27.140]   or do I just really want it to be true?
[03:28:27.140 --> 03:28:27.980]   And that--
[03:28:27.980 --> 03:28:29.820]   - Like the hot girl that talks to you overseas?
[03:28:29.820 --> 03:28:31.180]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:28:31.180 --> 03:28:34.060]   For a brief moment.
[03:28:34.060 --> 03:28:37.940]   There's actually a deeper explanation for it
[03:28:37.940 --> 03:28:39.580]   that I'll tell you off the mic,
[03:28:39.580 --> 03:28:42.940]   that perhaps a lot of people can kind of figure out.
[03:28:42.940 --> 03:28:43.780]   Anyway--
[03:28:43.780 --> 03:28:44.860]   - Just to take it one step further,
[03:28:44.860 --> 03:28:45.780]   'cause I love this stuff.
[03:28:45.780 --> 03:28:48.860]   Personally, I love Pink Matter stuff.
[03:28:48.860 --> 03:28:50.060]   In your interview with Jack Barsky,
[03:28:50.060 --> 03:28:52.260]   Jack's a good friend of mine, a good dude.
[03:28:52.260 --> 03:28:53.100]   - Yeah, incredible person.
[03:28:53.100 --> 03:28:55.820]   - Yeah, in your conversation with Jack Barsky,
[03:28:55.820 --> 03:28:58.540]   you guys, he started talking to you about
[03:28:58.540 --> 03:29:02.740]   how his recruiters were feeding back to him his own beliefs,
[03:29:02.740 --> 03:29:05.700]   his own opinions about himself, how smart he was,
[03:29:05.700 --> 03:29:08.380]   how good he was, how uniquely qualified he was.
[03:29:08.380 --> 03:29:10.460]   That's all Pink Matter manipulation.
[03:29:10.460 --> 03:29:12.420]   Feeding right back to the person
[03:29:12.420 --> 03:29:14.140]   what they already think of themselves
[03:29:14.140 --> 03:29:17.700]   is a way to get them to invest and trust you faster,
[03:29:17.700 --> 03:29:21.220]   because obviously you value them for all the right reasons,
[03:29:21.220 --> 03:29:23.020]   because that's how they see themselves.
[03:29:23.020 --> 03:29:28.020]   So that loop that the KGB was using with Jack,
[03:29:28.020 --> 03:29:31.140]   Jack did not wake up to that loop at the time.
[03:29:31.140 --> 03:29:33.020]   He woke up to it later.
[03:29:33.020 --> 03:29:35.240]   So it happens to all of us.
[03:29:35.240 --> 03:29:37.220]   We're all in a loop.
[03:29:37.220 --> 03:29:39.660]   It's just, whether it's about oat milk,
[03:29:39.660 --> 03:29:41.180]   or whether it's about aliens,
[03:29:41.180 --> 03:29:44.780]   or whether it's about the Democrats trying to take your guns,
[03:29:44.780 --> 03:29:47.060]   whatever it is, everybody's in a loop,
[03:29:47.060 --> 03:29:49.100]   and we've gotta wake up to ask ourselves,
[03:29:49.100 --> 03:29:50.300]   just like you said,
[03:29:50.300 --> 03:29:53.860]   is it true, or do we just really want it to be true?
[03:29:53.860 --> 03:29:55.740]   And until you ask yourself that question,
[03:29:55.740 --> 03:29:58.260]   you're just one of the masses trapped in the loop.
[03:29:58.260 --> 03:30:00.340]   - Yeah, that's the really,
[03:30:00.340 --> 03:30:03.580]   the Nietzsche gaze into the abyss.
[03:30:03.580 --> 03:30:05.060]   It's a dangerous thing.
[03:30:05.060 --> 03:30:08.620]   That's the path to insanity, is to ask that question.
[03:30:08.620 --> 03:30:11.020]   You wanna be doing it carefully,
[03:30:11.020 --> 03:30:14.300]   but it's also the place where you can truly discover
[03:30:14.300 --> 03:30:15.980]   something fundamental about this world
[03:30:15.980 --> 03:30:17.300]   that people don't understand,
[03:30:17.300 --> 03:30:21.820]   and then that, and lay the groundwork for progress,
[03:30:21.820 --> 03:30:24.940]   scientific, cultural, all that kind of stuff.
[03:30:24.940 --> 03:30:25.780]   - Absolutely.
[03:30:25.780 --> 03:30:28.860]   - What is one spy trick?
[03:30:28.860 --> 03:30:31.220]   This is from a Reddit that I really enjoy.
[03:30:31.220 --> 03:30:32.660]   What's one spy trick,
[03:30:32.660 --> 03:30:36.900]   and you're full of a million spy tricks.
[03:30:36.900 --> 03:30:37.820]   People should follow you.
[03:30:37.820 --> 03:30:39.220]   You do an amazing podcast.
[03:30:39.220 --> 03:30:40.460]   You're just an amazing person.
[03:30:40.460 --> 03:30:42.020]   - Thank you.
[03:30:42.020 --> 03:30:45.060]   - What is the one spy trick you would teach everyone
[03:30:45.060 --> 03:30:47.980]   that they can use to improve their life instantly?
[03:30:47.980 --> 03:30:50.820]   Now, you already mentioned quite a few,
[03:30:50.820 --> 03:30:54.100]   but what else could jump to mind?
[03:30:54.100 --> 03:30:56.620]   - My go-to answer for this has not really changed much
[03:30:56.620 --> 03:30:57.660]   over the last few years.
[03:30:57.660 --> 03:31:00.020]   So the first, the most important spy trick
[03:31:00.020 --> 03:31:01.660]   to change everything immediately
[03:31:01.660 --> 03:31:05.300]   is something called perception versus perspective.
[03:31:05.300 --> 03:31:09.180]   We all look at the world through our own perception.
[03:31:09.180 --> 03:31:12.540]   My dad used to tell me, my stepdad used to tell me
[03:31:12.540 --> 03:31:13.660]   that perception is reality,
[03:31:13.660 --> 03:31:17.420]   and I was arguing this with him when I was 14 years old.
[03:31:17.420 --> 03:31:19.340]   I told you so, dad, you're still wrong.
[03:31:19.340 --> 03:31:20.520]   - Yeah.
[03:31:20.520 --> 03:31:22.620]   - But perception is your interpretation
[03:31:22.620 --> 03:31:25.420]   of the world around you, but it's unique only to you.
[03:31:25.420 --> 03:31:28.820]   There's no advantage in your perception.
[03:31:28.820 --> 03:31:30.640]   That's why so many people find themselves arguing
[03:31:30.640 --> 03:31:33.420]   all the time, trying to convince other people
[03:31:33.420 --> 03:31:35.460]   of their own perception.
[03:31:35.460 --> 03:31:37.780]   The way that you win any argument,
[03:31:37.780 --> 03:31:39.780]   the way that you get ahead in your career,
[03:31:39.780 --> 03:31:44.780]   the way that you outsell or outrace anybody
[03:31:44.780 --> 03:31:47.460]   is when you move off of perception
[03:31:47.460 --> 03:31:49.620]   and move into perspective.
[03:31:49.620 --> 03:31:52.320]   Perspective is the act or the art
[03:31:52.320 --> 03:31:56.340]   of observing the world from outside of yourself.
[03:31:56.340 --> 03:31:59.440]   Whether that's outside of yourself as like an entity,
[03:31:59.440 --> 03:32:02.420]   just observing in a third from a different point of view,
[03:32:02.420 --> 03:32:05.140]   or even more powerful, you sit in the shoes,
[03:32:05.140 --> 03:32:07.420]   you sit in the seat of the person opposite you,
[03:32:07.420 --> 03:32:10.180]   and you think to yourself, what is their life like?
[03:32:10.180 --> 03:32:11.620]   What do they feel right now?
[03:32:11.620 --> 03:32:13.940]   Are they comfortable?
[03:32:13.940 --> 03:32:14.780]   Are they uncomfortable?
[03:32:14.780 --> 03:32:15.620]   Are they afraid?
[03:32:15.620 --> 03:32:16.540]   Are they scared?
[03:32:16.540 --> 03:32:18.700]   What's the stressor that they woke up to this morning?
[03:32:18.700 --> 03:32:19.740]   What's the stressor that they're gonna go
[03:32:19.740 --> 03:32:21.640]   to sleep with tonight?
[03:32:21.640 --> 03:32:24.700]   When you shift places and get out of your own perception
[03:32:24.700 --> 03:32:27.240]   and into someone else's perspective,
[03:32:27.240 --> 03:32:29.220]   now you're thinking like them,
[03:32:29.220 --> 03:32:31.620]   which is giving you an informational advantage.
[03:32:31.620 --> 03:32:33.300]   But you know what they're all doing?
[03:32:33.300 --> 03:32:36.940]   Everyone else out there is trapped in their own perception.
[03:32:36.940 --> 03:32:39.300]   Not thinking about a different perspective.
[03:32:39.300 --> 03:32:42.500]   So immediately you have superior information,
[03:32:42.500 --> 03:32:44.020]   superior positioning.
[03:32:44.020 --> 03:32:46.380]   You have an advantage that they don't have.
[03:32:46.380 --> 03:32:48.760]   And if you do that to your boss,
[03:32:48.760 --> 03:32:50.100]   it's gonna change your career.
[03:32:50.100 --> 03:32:51.380]   If you do that to your spouse,
[03:32:51.380 --> 03:32:52.520]   it's gonna change your marriage.
[03:32:52.520 --> 03:32:53.940]   If you do that to your kids,
[03:32:53.940 --> 03:32:55.780]   it's gonna change your family legacy.
[03:32:55.780 --> 03:32:58.060]   Because nobody else out there is doing it.
[03:32:58.060 --> 03:33:01.900]   - It's so interesting how difficult empathy is for people,
[03:33:01.900 --> 03:33:03.780]   and how powerful it is.
[03:33:03.780 --> 03:33:07.220]   Especially for, like you said, the spouse, like intimacy.
[03:33:07.220 --> 03:33:10.060]   Stepping outside of yourself,
[03:33:10.060 --> 03:33:11.940]   and really putting yourself in the shoes
[03:33:11.940 --> 03:33:14.700]   of the other person, considering how they see the world.
[03:33:14.700 --> 03:33:17.820]   I really enjoy that,
[03:33:17.820 --> 03:33:22.540]   because how does that exactly lead to connection?
[03:33:22.540 --> 03:33:26.600]   I think when you start to understand
[03:33:26.600 --> 03:33:30.000]   the way the other person sees the world,
[03:33:30.000 --> 03:33:32.260]   you start to enjoy the world through their eyes,
[03:33:32.260 --> 03:33:35.660]   and you start to be able to share, in terms of intimacy,
[03:33:35.660 --> 03:33:39.080]   share the beauty that they see together.
[03:33:39.080 --> 03:33:41.020]   Because you understand their perspective.
[03:33:41.020 --> 03:33:43.740]   And somehow you converge as well.
[03:33:43.740 --> 03:33:46.060]   Of course, that allows you to gather information better,
[03:33:46.060 --> 03:33:47.300]   and all that kind of stuff.
[03:33:47.300 --> 03:33:50.400]   And that allows you to work together better,
[03:33:50.400 --> 03:33:53.340]   to share in all different kinds of ways.
[03:33:53.340 --> 03:33:55.780]   But for intimacy, that's a really powerful thing.
[03:33:55.780 --> 03:34:00.780]   And also for, actually, people you really disagree with,
[03:34:00.920 --> 03:34:03.160]   or people on the internet you disagree with, and so on.
[03:34:03.160 --> 03:34:07.400]   I find empathy is such a powerful way
[03:34:07.400 --> 03:34:09.720]   to resolve any tensions there.
[03:34:09.720 --> 03:34:12.480]   Even people like trolls, or all that kind of stuff.
[03:34:12.480 --> 03:34:15.360]   I don't deride them, I just kind of put myself
[03:34:15.360 --> 03:34:20.360]   in their shoes, and it becomes an enjoyable camaraderie
[03:34:20.360 --> 03:34:21.720]   with that person.
[03:34:21.720 --> 03:34:23.160]   - So I want to draw a pretty hard line
[03:34:23.160 --> 03:34:26.680]   between perspective and empathy.
[03:34:26.680 --> 03:34:30.400]   Because empathy is, frankly, an overused term
[03:34:30.400 --> 03:34:33.740]   by people who don't really know
[03:34:33.740 --> 03:34:34.960]   what they're saying sometimes.
[03:34:34.960 --> 03:34:35.960]   I think you know what you're saying,
[03:34:35.960 --> 03:34:37.160]   but the vast majority of people listening--
[03:34:37.160 --> 03:34:39.280]   - I would argue that, but that's fine.
[03:34:39.280 --> 03:34:41.360]   - As soon as you say empathy, they're gonna just be like,
[03:34:41.360 --> 03:34:43.480]   oh yeah, I've heard this a thousand times.
[03:34:43.480 --> 03:34:47.840]   Empathy is about feeling what other people feel.
[03:34:47.840 --> 03:34:51.720]   - It's more about feeling, would you say?
[03:34:51.720 --> 03:34:53.060]   - Yeah, it's about feelings.
[03:34:53.060 --> 03:34:54.880]   It's about understanding someone else's feelings.
[03:34:54.880 --> 03:34:58.080]   Feeling, it's not the same as sympathy,
[03:34:58.080 --> 03:34:59.320]   where you feel their feelings.
[03:34:59.320 --> 03:35:01.880]   Empathy is about recognizing that they have feelings,
[03:35:01.880 --> 03:35:04.400]   and recognizing that their feelings are valid.
[03:35:04.400 --> 03:35:07.360]   Perspective is more than just feelings.
[03:35:07.360 --> 03:35:11.400]   It's about the brain, it's about the pink matter
[03:35:11.400 --> 03:35:14.560]   on the left side and the right side of the brain.
[03:35:14.560 --> 03:35:17.720]   Yes, I care about feelings, and this goes directly
[03:35:17.720 --> 03:35:18.760]   to your point about connection.
[03:35:18.760 --> 03:35:22.720]   Yes, I care about feelings, but I also care about objectives.
[03:35:22.720 --> 03:35:25.760]   What is your life, what is your aspirational goal?
[03:35:25.760 --> 03:35:27.480]   What was it like to grow up as you?
[03:35:27.480 --> 03:35:29.060]   What was it like to experience this,
[03:35:29.060 --> 03:35:30.840]   and how did this shape your opinion on that?
[03:35:30.840 --> 03:35:35.720]   And what is it that you're going to do next?
[03:35:35.720 --> 03:35:38.840]   More than just feelings, actual tactical actions.
[03:35:38.840 --> 03:35:41.120]   And that becomes extremely valuable
[03:35:41.120 --> 03:35:43.620]   in the operational world, because if you can get
[03:35:43.620 --> 03:35:46.320]   into someone's head, left brain and right brain,
[03:35:46.320 --> 03:35:48.740]   feelings and logic, you can start anticipating
[03:35:48.740 --> 03:35:50.200]   what actions they're gonna take next.
[03:35:50.200 --> 03:35:52.640]   You can direct the actions that they're going to take next,
[03:35:52.640 --> 03:35:54.200]   because you're basically telling them the story
[03:35:54.200 --> 03:35:56.000]   that's in their own head.
[03:35:56.000 --> 03:35:58.760]   When it comes to relationships and personal connection,
[03:35:58.760 --> 03:36:02.280]   we talked about it earlier, the thing that people
[03:36:02.280 --> 03:36:05.640]   want the most is community.
[03:36:05.640 --> 03:36:08.160]   They want someone else who understands them.
[03:36:08.160 --> 03:36:11.800]   They want to be with people, they don't want to be alone.
[03:36:11.800 --> 03:36:15.800]   The more you practice perspective, empathy or no empathy,
[03:36:15.800 --> 03:36:19.240]   the more you just validate that a person is there.
[03:36:19.240 --> 03:36:22.360]   I am in this time and space with you in this moment.
[03:36:22.360 --> 03:36:24.260]   Feelings aside, right?
[03:36:24.260 --> 03:36:27.440]   That is powerful.
[03:36:27.440 --> 03:36:29.160]   That is intimate.
[03:36:29.160 --> 03:36:31.000]   And whether you're talking about lovers
[03:36:31.000 --> 03:36:32.880]   or whether you're talking about a business exchange
[03:36:32.880 --> 03:36:35.880]   or whether you're talking about collaborators in a crime,
[03:36:35.880 --> 03:36:39.200]   I'm here with you, ride or die, let's do it, right?
[03:36:39.200 --> 03:36:41.040]   That's powerful.
[03:36:41.040 --> 03:36:46.040]   - How much of what you've learned in your role at the CIA,
[03:36:46.040 --> 03:36:49.800]   transfer over to relationships, to business relationship,
[03:36:49.800 --> 03:36:51.400]   to other aspects of life?
[03:36:51.400 --> 03:36:53.900]   This is something you work closely with powerful people
[03:36:53.900 --> 03:36:55.160]   to help them out.
[03:36:55.160 --> 03:36:57.880]   What have you learned about the commonalities,
[03:36:57.880 --> 03:36:59.880]   about the problems that people face?
[03:36:59.880 --> 03:37:04.880]   - Man, I would say about a solid 95% of what I learned
[03:37:04.880 --> 03:37:07.480]   at CIA carries over to the civilian world.
[03:37:07.480 --> 03:37:12.480]   That 5% that doesn't, it would carry over in a disaster.
[03:37:12.480 --> 03:37:18.280]   Knowing how to shoot on target with my non-dominant hand
[03:37:18.280 --> 03:37:20.760]   really only has one purpose.
[03:37:20.760 --> 03:37:23.200]   It's not gonna happen day to day, right?
[03:37:23.200 --> 03:37:25.520]   Knowing how to do a dead drop that isn't discoverable
[03:37:25.520 --> 03:37:28.560]   by the local police force isn't gonna be useful right now,
[03:37:28.560 --> 03:37:30.600]   but it could be useful in a disaster.
[03:37:30.600 --> 03:37:32.780]   But the 95% of stuff that's useful,
[03:37:32.780 --> 03:37:34.540]   it's all tied to the human condition.
[03:37:34.540 --> 03:37:39.540]   It's all tied to being able to understand
[03:37:39.540 --> 03:37:43.000]   what someone's thinking, understand what someone's feeling,
[03:37:43.000 --> 03:37:45.520]   direct their thoughts, direct their emotions,
[03:37:45.520 --> 03:37:47.960]   direct their thought process, win their attention,
[03:37:47.960 --> 03:37:51.080]   win their loyalty, win influence with them,
[03:37:51.080 --> 03:37:54.880]   grow your network, grow your own circle of influence.
[03:37:54.880 --> 03:37:58.480]   I mean, all of that is immensely, immensely valuable.
[03:37:58.480 --> 03:38:00.860]   As an example, the disguise,
[03:38:00.860 --> 03:38:03.240]   the disguise thing that we talked about earlier.
[03:38:03.240 --> 03:38:06.600]   Disguise in and of itself has mixed utility.
[03:38:06.600 --> 03:38:08.000]   If you're Brad Pitt and you don't want anybody
[03:38:08.000 --> 03:38:08.840]   to know you're Brad Pitt,
[03:38:08.840 --> 03:38:10.320]   you put on a level one disguise and that's great.
[03:38:10.320 --> 03:38:12.320]   Or maybe you call me and I walk you through
[03:38:12.320 --> 03:38:14.380]   a level two disguise so that you can go to Aruba
[03:38:14.380 --> 03:38:16.240]   and nobody's gonna know you're in Aruba, right?
[03:38:16.240 --> 03:38:17.080]   Whatever it is.
[03:38:18.080 --> 03:38:21.720]   But even there with the 5% that doesn't apply
[03:38:21.720 --> 03:38:24.800]   to everyday life, there's still elements that do.
[03:38:24.800 --> 03:38:28.800]   For example, when a person looks at a human being's face,
[03:38:28.800 --> 03:38:32.260]   the first place they look is the same part of the face
[03:38:32.260 --> 03:38:34.200]   as if they were reading a piece of paper.
[03:38:34.200 --> 03:38:36.920]   So in English, we start from the top left
[03:38:36.920 --> 03:38:38.740]   and we read left to right, top to bottom.
[03:38:38.740 --> 03:38:40.860]   So when an English speaking person
[03:38:40.860 --> 03:38:42.260]   interacts with another person,
[03:38:42.260 --> 03:38:45.520]   the first thing they look at isn't their eyes.
[03:38:45.520 --> 03:38:49.040]   It's the upper left from their point of view,
[03:38:49.040 --> 03:38:52.060]   corner of their face, right?
[03:38:52.060 --> 03:38:54.760]   They look there and the information they get
[03:38:54.760 --> 03:38:58.280]   is hair color, hair pattern, skin color, right?
[03:38:58.280 --> 03:38:59.120]   That's it.
[03:38:59.120 --> 03:39:01.000]   Before they know anything else about the face.
[03:39:01.000 --> 03:39:02.760]   This is one of the reasons why somebody can look at you
[03:39:02.760 --> 03:39:05.000]   and then you ask them, what color are my eyes?
[03:39:05.000 --> 03:39:06.360]   I don't really remember.
[03:39:06.360 --> 03:39:07.800]   Because the way they read the face,
[03:39:07.800 --> 03:39:10.280]   they read it from left to right, top to bottom.
[03:39:10.280 --> 03:39:11.560]   So they're paying a lot of attention
[03:39:11.560 --> 03:39:12.920]   to the first few things they see
[03:39:12.920 --> 03:39:14.120]   and then they're paying less attention
[03:39:14.120 --> 03:39:14.960]   as they go down the face.
[03:39:14.960 --> 03:39:16.120]   It's the same scrolling behavior
[03:39:16.120 --> 03:39:18.920]   that you see on the internet, right?
[03:39:18.920 --> 03:39:21.360]   So when you understand that through the lens of disguise,
[03:39:21.360 --> 03:39:23.220]   it allows you to make a very powerful disguise.
[03:39:23.220 --> 03:39:24.880]   The most important part of your disguise
[03:39:24.880 --> 03:39:27.360]   is here if you're English speaking, right?
[03:39:27.360 --> 03:39:29.360]   Here if you're speaking some foreign languages
[03:39:29.360 --> 03:39:31.160]   that read right to left, right?
[03:39:31.160 --> 03:39:33.160]   If it's Chinese, you know that they're gonna look
[03:39:33.160 --> 03:39:35.880]   from here down 'cause they read left down.
[03:39:35.880 --> 03:39:37.080]   - So interesting.
[03:39:37.080 --> 03:39:37.920]   (Lex laughs)
[03:39:37.920 --> 03:39:39.160]   So yeah, knowing that really helps you
[03:39:39.160 --> 03:39:40.480]   sort of configure the things
[03:39:40.480 --> 03:39:41.760]   in terms of physical appearance.
[03:39:41.760 --> 03:39:43.040]   That's interesting. - Correct, correct.
[03:39:43.040 --> 03:39:45.280]   So when it comes to how to make a disguise,
[03:39:45.280 --> 03:39:47.720]   not so useful to the ultra wealthy usually.
[03:39:47.720 --> 03:39:50.060]   But when it comes to how to read a face
[03:39:50.060 --> 03:39:52.640]   or more importantly, how people are going to read your face,
[03:39:52.640 --> 03:39:53.900]   that's extremely important.
[03:39:53.900 --> 03:39:57.600]   Because now you know where to find the first signs
[03:39:57.600 --> 03:39:59.600]   of deception in a baseline or anything else.
[03:39:59.600 --> 03:40:03.600]   - You mentioned that the idea of having privacy
[03:40:03.600 --> 03:40:10.280]   is one that we kind of, we think we can,
[03:40:10.280 --> 03:40:12.400]   but we really don't.
[03:40:12.400 --> 03:40:14.960]   Is it possible for maybe somebody like me
[03:40:14.960 --> 03:40:18.060]   or a regular person to disappear from the grid?
[03:40:18.060 --> 03:40:19.120]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[03:40:19.120 --> 03:40:20.440]   And it's not as hard as you might think.
[03:40:20.440 --> 03:40:21.640]   It's not convenient.
[03:40:21.640 --> 03:40:24.680]   Again, convenience and security.
[03:40:24.680 --> 03:40:26.460]   You can disappear tomorrow, right?
[03:40:26.460 --> 03:40:27.760]   I can walk you through three steps right now
[03:40:27.760 --> 03:40:29.200]   that's gonna help you disappear tomorrow.
[03:40:29.200 --> 03:40:31.320]   But none of them are convenient.
[03:40:31.320 --> 03:40:33.600]   They're all extremely secure, right?
[03:40:33.600 --> 03:40:35.200]   The first thing you do is every piece
[03:40:35.200 --> 03:40:36.880]   of digital technology you have
[03:40:36.880 --> 03:40:41.240]   that is connected to you in any way is now dead.
[03:40:41.240 --> 03:40:42.520]   You just let the battery run out.
[03:40:42.520 --> 03:40:43.360]   - Forever.
[03:40:43.360 --> 03:40:44.720]   - Forever, you never touch it again,
[03:40:44.720 --> 03:40:46.440]   starting at this moment.
[03:40:46.440 --> 03:40:50.220]   What you have to do is go out and acquire a new one.
[03:40:50.220 --> 03:40:52.920]   Realistically, you will not be able to acquire a new one
[03:40:52.920 --> 03:40:55.640]   in the United States by buying it.
[03:40:55.640 --> 03:40:58.700]   Because to do so, you would tie it to your credit card,
[03:40:58.700 --> 03:41:00.840]   you would tie it to a location, a time, a place,
[03:41:00.840 --> 03:41:02.280]   a registered name, whatever else.
[03:41:02.280 --> 03:41:04.840]   So you would have to acquire it essentially by theft
[03:41:04.840 --> 03:41:07.460]   or through the black market.
[03:41:07.460 --> 03:41:09.680]   So you would want something because you're gonna need
[03:41:09.680 --> 03:41:13.040]   the advantage of technology without it being in your name.
[03:41:13.040 --> 03:41:16.440]   So you go out and you steal a phone or you steal a laptop,
[03:41:16.440 --> 03:41:17.680]   you do whatever you have to do to make sure
[03:41:17.680 --> 03:41:19.240]   that you can get on with the password
[03:41:19.240 --> 03:41:20.560]   and whatever else that might be,
[03:41:20.560 --> 03:41:22.360]   as dirty or as clean as you want that to be.
[03:41:22.360 --> 03:41:24.340]   We're all morally flexible here.
[03:41:24.340 --> 03:41:27.140]   But now you have a technological device
[03:41:27.140 --> 03:41:29.040]   that you can work with.
[03:41:29.040 --> 03:41:31.320]   And then from there on,
[03:41:31.320 --> 03:41:32.660]   you're just doing whatever you have to do,
[03:41:32.660 --> 03:41:35.040]   whether you're stealing every step of the way
[03:41:35.040 --> 03:41:38.720]   or whether you run a massive con.
[03:41:38.720 --> 03:41:42.320]   Keep in mind that we often talk about con men and cons.
[03:41:42.320 --> 03:41:43.520]   Do you know what the root,
[03:41:43.520 --> 03:41:46.520]   the word that con is a root word for?
[03:41:46.520 --> 03:41:48.040]   Confidence.
[03:41:48.040 --> 03:41:49.320]   That's what a con man is.
[03:41:49.320 --> 03:41:51.600]   A con man is a confidence man.
[03:41:51.600 --> 03:41:54.340]   Just somebody who is so brazenly confident
[03:41:54.340 --> 03:41:55.800]   that the people around them,
[03:41:55.800 --> 03:41:58.640]   living in their own perception, not perspective,
[03:41:58.640 --> 03:42:00.360]   in their perception, they're like,
[03:42:00.360 --> 03:42:01.960]   well, this guy really knows what he's talking about.
[03:42:01.960 --> 03:42:04.000]   So I'm gonna do what he says.
[03:42:04.000 --> 03:42:05.560]   So you can run a massive con
[03:42:05.560 --> 03:42:07.200]   and that can take care of your finances,
[03:42:07.200 --> 03:42:10.240]   that can take care of your lodging, whatever else it is.
[03:42:10.240 --> 03:42:13.020]   You are whoever you present yourself to be.
[03:42:13.020 --> 03:42:15.680]   So if you wanna go be,
[03:42:15.680 --> 03:42:18.320]   if you wanna be Bill for the afternoon,
[03:42:18.320 --> 03:42:19.840]   just go tell people your name is Bill.
[03:42:19.840 --> 03:42:21.520]   They're not gonna question you.
[03:42:21.520 --> 03:42:24.080]   - So the intelligence,
[03:42:24.080 --> 03:42:28.720]   the natural web of intelligence gathering systems
[03:42:28.720 --> 03:42:32.000]   we have in the United States and in the world,
[03:42:32.000 --> 03:42:35.880]   are they going to believe for long that you're Bill?
[03:42:36.760 --> 03:42:37.720]   Are they--
[03:42:37.720 --> 03:42:39.880]   - Until you do something that makes them think otherwise.
[03:42:39.880 --> 03:42:41.040]   If you are consistent,
[03:42:41.040 --> 03:42:43.240]   we talked about consistency being the superpower.
[03:42:43.240 --> 03:42:46.640]   If you are consistent, they will think you're Bill forever.
[03:42:46.640 --> 03:42:49.040]   - How difficult is that to do?
[03:42:49.040 --> 03:42:50.720]   - It's not convenient.
[03:42:50.720 --> 03:42:51.920]   It's quite difficult.
[03:42:51.920 --> 03:42:53.840]   - Does that require training?
[03:42:53.840 --> 03:42:55.760]   - It does require training.
[03:42:55.760 --> 03:42:57.760]   - 'Cause why do criminals always get caught?
[03:42:57.760 --> 03:42:59.960]   - Because they stop being consistent.
[03:42:59.960 --> 03:43:02.400]   Criminals, I've,
[03:43:04.880 --> 03:43:07.120]   I never hesitate to admit this,
[03:43:07.120 --> 03:43:09.040]   but people tell me I should hesitate to admit it.
[03:43:09.040 --> 03:43:10.480]   So now I hesitate
[03:43:10.480 --> 03:43:13.440]   because of the guidance I've gotten to hesitate, right?
[03:43:13.440 --> 03:43:14.360]   I like criminals.
[03:43:14.360 --> 03:43:16.400]   I'm friends with a number of criminals
[03:43:16.400 --> 03:43:17.920]   because the only people who get me,
[03:43:17.920 --> 03:43:20.940]   like right away who get me, are criminals
[03:43:20.940 --> 03:43:23.120]   because we know what it's like
[03:43:23.120 --> 03:43:25.360]   to basically abandon all the rules,
[03:43:25.360 --> 03:43:26.680]   do our own thing our own way,
[03:43:26.680 --> 03:43:29.080]   and watch the world just keep turning.
[03:43:29.080 --> 03:43:33.880]   Most people are so stuck in the trap
[03:43:33.880 --> 03:43:36.080]   of normal thought and behavior
[03:43:36.080 --> 03:43:36.920]   that when I tell them,
[03:43:36.920 --> 03:43:39.280]   they just don't, just go tell people your name is Bill.
[03:43:39.280 --> 03:43:42.560]   Most people are gonna say, "Psh, that's not gonna work."
[03:43:42.560 --> 03:43:44.640]   But a criminal will be like, "Oh yeah, I did that once.
[03:43:44.640 --> 03:43:46.260]   "I just told everybody my name is Nancy.
[03:43:46.260 --> 03:43:48.880]   "I'm a dude and they still believe me."
[03:43:48.880 --> 03:43:50.400]   Criminals just get it, right?
[03:43:50.400 --> 03:43:53.560]   So what happens with criminals
[03:43:53.560 --> 03:43:56.440]   is they go to the school of hard knocks.
[03:43:56.440 --> 03:44:00.360]   They go to, they learn criminal behavior on the job.
[03:44:00.360 --> 03:44:02.680]   Spies go to school.
[03:44:02.680 --> 03:44:05.040]   We go to the best spy school in the world.
[03:44:05.040 --> 03:44:07.880]   We go to Langley's, the farm, right?
[03:44:07.880 --> 03:44:10.160]   What's known as Field Tradecraft Course, FTC,
[03:44:10.160 --> 03:44:12.440]   in a covert location for a covert period of time
[03:44:12.440 --> 03:44:13.560]   and covert, covert, covert.
[03:44:13.560 --> 03:44:14.640]   So if anybody from CIA is watching,
[03:44:14.640 --> 03:44:16.240]   I'm not breaking any rules.
[03:44:16.240 --> 03:44:19.120]   It's all on Wikipedia, but it's not coming from me.
[03:44:19.120 --> 03:44:20.520]   But we do, that's how we do it.
[03:44:20.520 --> 03:44:24.880]   They train us from 100 years of experience
[03:44:24.880 --> 03:44:27.120]   and the best ways to carry out covert operations,
[03:44:27.120 --> 03:44:30.760]   which are all just criminal activities overseas.
[03:44:30.760 --> 03:44:32.320]   We learn how to do it the right way
[03:44:32.320 --> 03:44:33.320]   so that we don't get caught.
[03:44:33.320 --> 03:44:34.460]   We learn how to be consistent.
[03:44:34.460 --> 03:44:37.720]   More importantly, we learn how to create an operation
[03:44:37.720 --> 03:44:39.940]   that has a limited lifespan,
[03:44:39.940 --> 03:44:43.160]   because the longer it lives, the more at risk you are.
[03:44:43.160 --> 03:44:46.400]   So you want operations to be short, concise,
[03:44:46.400 --> 03:44:49.780]   on the X, off the X, limit your room for mistakes.
[03:44:49.780 --> 03:44:52.200]   Criminals want the default
[03:44:52.200 --> 03:44:55.040]   to wanting these long-term operations,
[03:44:55.040 --> 03:44:57.000]   'cause they don't wanna have to recreate a new way
[03:44:57.000 --> 03:44:59.020]   to make money every 15 days.
[03:45:00.520 --> 03:45:03.920]   - You mentioned if anybody from the CIA is watching,
[03:45:03.920 --> 03:45:07.920]   so I've seen you talk about the fact
[03:45:07.920 --> 03:45:10.400]   that sort of people that are currently working at the CIA
[03:45:10.400 --> 03:45:14.400]   would kind of look down on the people who've left the CIA
[03:45:14.400 --> 03:45:16.800]   and they ride them, especially if you go public,
[03:45:16.800 --> 03:45:19.880]   especially if there's a book and all that kind of stuff.
[03:45:19.880 --> 03:45:22.380]   Do you feel the pressure of that to be quiet,
[03:45:28.080 --> 03:45:30.640]   to not do something like this conversation
[03:45:30.640 --> 03:45:31.600]   that we're doing today?
[03:45:31.600 --> 03:45:33.240]   - I feel the silent judgment.
[03:45:33.240 --> 03:45:35.420]   That's very real.
[03:45:35.420 --> 03:45:37.000]   I feel it for myself and I feel it for my wife,
[03:45:37.000 --> 03:45:38.640]   who doesn't appear on camera very often,
[03:45:38.640 --> 03:45:40.880]   but who's also a former CIA.
[03:45:40.880 --> 03:45:42.720]   We both feel the judgment.
[03:45:42.720 --> 03:45:47.580]   We know that right now, three days after this is released,
[03:45:47.580 --> 03:45:50.400]   somebody's gonna send an email on a closed network system
[03:45:50.400 --> 03:45:52.120]   inside CIA headquarters,
[03:45:52.120 --> 03:45:53.880]   and there's a bunch of people who are gonna laugh at it,
[03:45:53.880 --> 03:45:56.080]   a bunch of people who are gonna say that who knows what,
[03:45:56.080 --> 03:45:56.920]   it's not gonna be good stuff.
[03:45:56.920 --> 03:45:58.640]   - Who do you respect probably?
[03:45:58.640 --> 03:46:01.960]   - A bunch of people who I'm trying to bring honor to,
[03:46:01.960 --> 03:46:04.800]   whether I know them or respect them is irrelevant.
[03:46:04.800 --> 03:46:08.000]   These are people who are out there doing the deed every day,
[03:46:08.000 --> 03:46:09.920]   and I wanna bring them honor,
[03:46:09.920 --> 03:46:13.020]   and I wanna do that in a way that I get to share
[03:46:13.020 --> 03:46:15.640]   what they can't share and what they won't share
[03:46:15.640 --> 03:46:17.140]   when they leave, because they will also feel
[03:46:17.140 --> 03:46:19.880]   the silent pressure, the pressure to,
[03:46:19.880 --> 03:46:21.720]   the shame, the judgment, right?
[03:46:21.720 --> 03:46:25.440]   But the truth is that I've done this now long enough.
[03:46:25.440 --> 03:46:27.960]   The first few times that I spoke out publicly,
[03:46:27.960 --> 03:46:32.160]   the response to being a positive voice
[03:46:32.160 --> 03:46:34.960]   for what the sacrifice is that people are making,
[03:46:34.960 --> 03:46:39.020]   it's so refreshing to be an honest voice
[03:46:39.020 --> 03:46:43.120]   that people don't normally hear that it's too important.
[03:46:43.120 --> 03:46:44.280]   One day I'm gonna be gone,
[03:46:44.280 --> 03:46:46.340]   and my kids are gonna look back on all this,
[03:46:46.340 --> 03:46:48.360]   and they're gonna see their dad
[03:46:48.360 --> 03:46:51.000]   trying to do the right thing for the right reasons.
[03:46:51.000 --> 03:46:53.480]   And even if my son or daughter ends up at CIA,
[03:46:53.480 --> 03:46:55.280]   and even if they get ridiculed for being,
[03:46:55.280 --> 03:46:57.640]   oh, you're the Bustamante kid, right?
[03:46:57.640 --> 03:47:00.080]   Your dad's a total sellout, whatever it might be.
[03:47:00.080 --> 03:47:02.800]   Like, I want them to know, you know,
[03:47:02.800 --> 03:47:05.800]   dad was doing what he could to bring honor
[03:47:05.800 --> 03:47:07.280]   to the organization, even when he couldn't
[03:47:07.280 --> 03:47:09.480]   stay in the organization anymore.
[03:47:09.480 --> 03:47:11.460]   - So you said when you were 27,
[03:47:11.460 --> 03:47:14.120]   I think you didn't know what the hell you were doing.
[03:47:14.120 --> 03:47:20.280]   So now that you're a few years older and wiser,
[03:47:20.280 --> 03:47:24.720]   let me ask you to put on your wise sage hat
[03:47:24.720 --> 03:47:27.480]   and give advice to other 27-year-olds,
[03:47:27.480 --> 03:47:30.960]   or even younger, 17, 18-year-olds
[03:47:30.960 --> 03:47:34.200]   that are just out of high school, maybe going to college,
[03:47:34.200 --> 03:47:35.520]   trying to figure out this life,
[03:47:35.520 --> 03:47:37.600]   this career thing that they're on.
[03:47:37.600 --> 03:47:39.840]   What advice would you give them
[03:47:39.840 --> 03:47:42.040]   about how to have a career,
[03:47:42.040 --> 03:47:44.520]   or how to have a life they can be proud of?
[03:47:44.520 --> 03:47:47.700]   - Well, it's a powerful question, man.
[03:47:47.700 --> 03:47:51.160]   - Have you figured it out yet yourself?
[03:47:51.160 --> 03:47:52.000]   - No.
[03:47:52.560 --> 03:47:54.880]   I think I'm a grand total of seven days
[03:47:54.880 --> 03:47:56.280]   smarter than I was at 27.
[03:47:56.280 --> 03:47:58.000]   It's not a good average.
[03:47:58.000 --> 03:47:58.820]   - Progress.
[03:47:58.820 --> 03:48:01.120]   There's still time.
[03:48:01.120 --> 03:48:02.680]   - There's still time.
[03:48:02.680 --> 03:48:04.920]   So for all the young people out there
[03:48:04.920 --> 03:48:07.120]   deciding what to do,
[03:48:07.120 --> 03:48:10.080]   I would just say the same thing that I would say,
[03:48:10.080 --> 03:48:12.400]   that I do say and I will say to my own kids.
[03:48:12.400 --> 03:48:14.360]   You only have one life.
[03:48:14.360 --> 03:48:16.600]   You only have one chance.
[03:48:16.600 --> 03:48:20.320]   If you spend it doing what other people expect you to do,
[03:48:21.260 --> 03:48:25.440]   you will wake up to your regret at some point.
[03:48:25.440 --> 03:48:29.240]   I woke up when I was 38 years old.
[03:48:29.240 --> 03:48:32.040]   My wife, in many ways, is still waking up to it
[03:48:32.040 --> 03:48:34.800]   as she watches her grandparents pass
[03:48:34.800 --> 03:48:37.480]   and an older generation pass away.
[03:48:37.480 --> 03:48:42.940]   The folks that really have a blessed life
[03:48:42.940 --> 03:48:45.200]   are the people who learn early on
[03:48:45.200 --> 03:48:50.200]   to live with their own rules, live their own way,
[03:48:50.200 --> 03:48:53.780]   and live every day as if it's the last day.
[03:48:53.780 --> 03:48:58.160]   Not necessarily to waste it by being wasteful or silly,
[03:48:58.160 --> 03:49:00.040]   but to recognize that today is a day
[03:49:00.040 --> 03:49:04.580]   to be productive and constructive for yourself.
[03:49:04.580 --> 03:49:06.140]   If you don't want a career,
[03:49:06.140 --> 03:49:07.880]   today's not the day to start pursuing a career
[03:49:07.880 --> 03:49:09.720]   just because someone else told you to do it.
[03:49:09.720 --> 03:49:11.200]   If you wanna learn a language,
[03:49:11.200 --> 03:49:13.760]   today's a day to find a way to buy a ticket
[03:49:13.760 --> 03:49:15.720]   to another country and learn through immersion.
[03:49:15.720 --> 03:49:17.960]   If you want a date, if you wanna get married,
[03:49:17.960 --> 03:49:20.440]   if you want a business, today is the day
[03:49:20.440 --> 03:49:25.200]   to just go out and take one step in that direction.
[03:49:25.200 --> 03:49:28.600]   And as long as you, every day you just make one new step,
[03:49:28.600 --> 03:49:30.360]   just like CIA recruited me.
[03:49:30.360 --> 03:49:32.080]   Just do the next thing.
[03:49:32.080 --> 03:49:34.480]   If the step seems like it's too big,
[03:49:34.480 --> 03:49:36.060]   then there's probably two other steps
[03:49:36.060 --> 03:49:37.640]   that you can do before that.
[03:49:37.640 --> 03:49:40.400]   Just make constant progress, build momentum,
[03:49:40.400 --> 03:49:43.920]   move forward, and live on your own terms.
[03:49:43.920 --> 03:49:47.000]   That way you don't ever wake up to the regret.
[03:49:47.000 --> 03:49:49.960]   And it'll be over before you know it.
[03:49:49.960 --> 03:49:51.960]   Whether you regret it or not, it's true.
[03:49:51.960 --> 03:49:55.500]   - What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?
[03:49:55.500 --> 03:49:56.680]   What's the meaning of life?
[03:49:56.680 --> 03:49:57.760]   - Self-respect.
[03:49:57.760 --> 03:50:00.220]   That's a fast answer.
[03:50:00.220 --> 03:50:01.880]   There's a story behind it if you want the story.
[03:50:01.880 --> 03:50:03.680]   - I would love to have the story.
[03:50:03.680 --> 03:50:06.360]   - There's a covert training base in Alabama,
[03:50:06.360 --> 03:50:10.160]   in the south, far south, in like the armpit of America,
[03:50:10.160 --> 03:50:12.520]   where elite tier one operators
[03:50:12.520 --> 03:50:16.080]   go to learn human intelligence stuff.
[03:50:16.080 --> 03:50:18.920]   And there's a bar inside this base.
[03:50:18.920 --> 03:50:23.920]   And on the wall is just, it's scribbles of opinions.
[03:50:23.920 --> 03:50:27.840]   And the question in the middle of the wall says,
[03:50:27.840 --> 03:50:29.360]   "What's the meaning of life?"
[03:50:29.360 --> 03:50:33.060]   And all these elite operators over the last 25 or 30 years,
[03:50:33.060 --> 03:50:34.440]   they all go, they get drunk,
[03:50:34.440 --> 03:50:35.520]   and they scribble their answer,
[03:50:35.520 --> 03:50:37.320]   and they circle it with a Sharpie, right?
[03:50:37.320 --> 03:50:42.320]   Love, family, America, freedom, right? Whatever.
[03:50:42.320 --> 03:50:43.640]   And then the only thing they have to do
[03:50:43.640 --> 03:50:45.120]   is if they're gonna write something on there,
[03:50:45.120 --> 03:50:48.080]   they have to connect it with something else on the wall,
[03:50:48.080 --> 03:50:49.060]   at least one other thing.
[03:50:49.060 --> 03:50:50.000]   So if they write love,
[03:50:50.000 --> 03:50:51.440]   they can't just leave it floating there.
[03:50:51.440 --> 03:50:53.600]   They have to write love in a little bubble
[03:50:53.600 --> 03:50:54.960]   and connect it to something else,
[03:50:54.960 --> 03:50:56.680]   connect it to family, whatever else.
[03:50:56.680 --> 03:50:58.040]   When you look at that wall,
[03:50:58.040 --> 03:51:02.720]   the word self-respect is on the wall,
[03:51:02.720 --> 03:51:04.440]   and it's got a circle around it.
[03:51:04.440 --> 03:51:06.600]   And then you can't see any other word
[03:51:06.600 --> 03:51:09.640]   because of all the things that connect to self-respect.
[03:51:09.640 --> 03:51:13.960]   Just dozens of people have written over,
[03:51:13.960 --> 03:51:14.920]   have written their words down
[03:51:14.920 --> 03:51:16.560]   and been drawn and scribbled over
[03:51:16.560 --> 03:51:19.160]   because of all the lines that connect with self-respect.
[03:51:19.160 --> 03:51:20.820]   So what's the meaning of life?
[03:51:20.820 --> 03:51:24.120]   From my point of view, I've never seen a better answer.
[03:51:24.120 --> 03:51:25.060]   It's all self-respect.
[03:51:25.060 --> 03:51:27.440]   If you don't respect yourself, how can you do anything else?
[03:51:27.440 --> 03:51:28.360]   How can you love someone else
[03:51:28.360 --> 03:51:29.660]   if you don't have self-respect?
[03:51:29.660 --> 03:51:31.000]   How can you build the business you're proud of
[03:51:31.000 --> 03:51:31.920]   if you don't have self-respect?
[03:51:31.920 --> 03:51:33.160]   How can you raise kids?
[03:51:33.160 --> 03:51:34.340]   How can you make a difference?
[03:51:34.340 --> 03:51:35.960]   How can you pioneer anything?
[03:51:35.960 --> 03:51:39.040]   How can you just wake up and have a good day
[03:51:39.040 --> 03:51:41.200]   if you don't have self-respect?
[03:51:42.800 --> 03:51:44.320]   - The power of the individual,
[03:51:44.320 --> 03:51:48.320]   that's what makes this country great.
[03:51:48.320 --> 03:51:52.200]   I have to say, after traveling quite a bit in Europe,
[03:51:52.200 --> 03:51:55.720]   and especially in a place of war,
[03:51:55.720 --> 03:51:57.080]   coming back to the United States
[03:51:57.080 --> 03:51:58.400]   makes me really appreciate
[03:51:58.400 --> 03:52:02.280]   about the better angels of this nation,
[03:52:02.280 --> 03:52:04.960]   the ideals it stands for, the values it stands for.
[03:52:04.960 --> 03:52:09.960]   And I'd like to thank you for serving this nation for time,
[03:52:09.960 --> 03:52:12.600]   and humanity for time.
[03:52:12.600 --> 03:52:16.800]   And for being brave enough and bold enough
[03:52:16.800 --> 03:52:19.480]   to still talk about it, and to inspire others,
[03:52:19.480 --> 03:52:24.480]   to educate others, for having many amazing conversations,
[03:52:24.480 --> 03:52:28.480]   and for honoring me by having this conversation today.
[03:52:28.480 --> 03:52:30.080]   You're an amazing human.
[03:52:30.080 --> 03:52:31.360]   Thanks so much for talking today.
[03:52:31.360 --> 03:52:32.800]   - Lex, I appreciate the invite, man.
[03:52:32.800 --> 03:52:33.640]   It was a joy.
[03:52:33.640 --> 03:52:36.240]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation

[03:52:44.080 --> 03:52:47.000]   from Sun Tzu in the art of war.
[03:52:47.000 --> 03:52:52.120]   Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night.
[03:52:52.120 --> 03:52:55.400]   And when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.
[03:52:55.400 --> 03:52:59.520]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
