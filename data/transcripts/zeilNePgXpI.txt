[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Caleb writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, what do you do when you're bored of reading the Bible?"
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   I pray my little acronym or acrostic, whatever you call it, I-O-U-S, I-O-U's,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   and I say this, Tony, because I take unbelievably strong encouragement
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   from the fact that the psalmist had to pray this way.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   It isn't just the person who asked that question, Caleb, or me,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   who struggled with feeling excited about the Bible, but the psalmist did.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   So here's my I-O-U-S, I, incline my heart to your testimonies and not to getting gain.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Psalm 119, verse 36. Isn't that amazing?
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   That's amazing that the psalmist would ask God to incline his heart to the Word.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   What? You're not inclined to the Bible sometimes, Mr. Psalmist?
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Or, "O, open my eyes that I may see wonderful things out of your Word."
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Psalm 119, verse 18. So the psalmist can go to the Word and not see anything?
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Just like we can stare at a page and some days the pages are blank and we feel horrible
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   because of how insensitive we are, so we join the psalmist in praying,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   "O God, open my eyes and then you, I-O-U, unite my heart to fear your name."
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Psalm 86, 11, where my heart is all fragmented. It's going in every direction.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   I'm looking at a fly on the wall or hearing something in my driveway,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   and I get distracted in a hundred ways. And the psalmist does too, and he's pleading,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   "O God, get my heart together so it can focus. I-O-U."
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   And then maybe the most important one of all, "Satisfy me in the morning with your steadfast love."
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Psalm 94, verse 11. So that's what I do, Caleb.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I join the psalmist in pleading, "Incline my heart, open my eyes, unite my heart, satisfy my heart.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   O God, don't leave me in this season of boredom or blankness or deadness."
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   And then I got a long list of other things I do, but let me just tick them off.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   I won't linger over them long because I think that right there is probably the most important thing.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   But I look at things that the Bible says about the Bible to rekindle my love for the Bible.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   "Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies." Good, I want that.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   "And your words are inspired and profitable for every good work." And I want that.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   "And your word awakens faith." Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word. And I want that.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   "And your word gives life." We're born through the word.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   "And your words are life. To whom shall we go?" I want life.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   "And your words make me holy. Sanctify them in the truth. Your word is truth." I want to be holy.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   "Your word gives freedom. You'll know the truth, and the truth will make you free."
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Don't you want all those things, Caleb? Well, they're only found in the word of God.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   That's the way I preach to myself, so I'm preaching that way to Caleb.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   So I look to see what the Bible says about the Bible.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   And then when I'm really in need, I read sermons by those who are not bored by the Bible.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   For me, that's often Jonathan Edwards.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I come away from a sermon by Jonathan Edwards loving the Bible, wanting to see what he saw,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   wanting to feel what he felt. So let that happen.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Or go to church and listen to pastors who are gifted in opening the word by exalting over the word
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   so that what they love in the word and see in the word kindles you.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And oh my, the list goes on and on. But I'll probably stop there and say,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   "Caleb, you're not alone. We all are up and down in the degree to which we love to read the Bible."
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   And maybe the last thing I should say is, even when you don't feel like it,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   keep tending the garden like a farmer who has to get out there every day and pull the weeds and till the soil,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   not because that day the fruit is going to grow up, but sooner or later, in God's sovereign timing,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   it'll grow if you tend your garden.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Thank you, Pastor John. And for more on the IOUs, see chapter 9 of Pastor John's book,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   "When I Don't Desire God, How to Fight for Joy," which is a book you can download for free at DesiringGod.org.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke. Thanks for listening.
