[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   What we did was we broke the entire landscape of tools that you can use to search for flights and hotels into a couple categories.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.100]   Yeah, so first we have flight search tools.
[00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.300]   So you know you want to go from this airport to that airport, you know your dates of travel.
[00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.200]   Press go and tell me what flights are available, how much they cost with points.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.500]   Another category is flight discovery, and that's where the tools are broader.
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.100]   Then the next two categories are around hotel searches.
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.600]   So you have hotel points and you want to use them.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:42.800]   You know you're going to be going to Paris during July 6th to the 20th and show me what hotels are available and how much do they cost with points.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.600]   The other category I'm calling impossible to find hotel awards.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.300]   So this is where you have your heart set on a particular hotel, but it's a popular hotel.
[00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.800]   It's rarely available with points. Tools like this will help you find when it is available.
