[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.000]   the Gospel according to Saint John in the first chapter and the seventeenth verse.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   The seventeenth verse in the first chapter of the Gospel according to Saint John.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   "For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ."
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Now we've been examining this great and most important and momentous statement here
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   in the prologue of John's Gospel for a number of Sunday mornings.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   And we have said that we are doing so in order that we may truly understand and appreciate
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   as we should what the blessings of grace, the grace of God in Jesus Christ our Lord, really are
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   and what they bring to us.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Now we've been at pains to emphasize that this statement, this text, does not in any way
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   detract from or derogate from the value of the law.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   That isn't what it's meant to do.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   We've seen that the law was given by God and that it has a very special function and purpose
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   in the grand object and plan of salvation of Almighty God.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   But we have also seen, and this is the thing that the Apostle emphasizes,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   that the law, after all, was only preparatory, that it was a kind of signpost or fingerpost
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   pointing to Christ, or to use that great expression of the Apostle,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   "It was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ."
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   And therefore we've arrived at the point at which we can continue drawing certain deductions
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   from what we've seen.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   The question that must arise always in our minds as we face this text is,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   "Why did John put it in this particular way and manner?"
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And the answer undoubtedly is what I've already been suggesting.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   That is, that he wants to show the superiority of grace.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Now you don't need to detract from the law to show the superiority of grace.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   That is what John is anxious to do.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   He wants to show that in the Lord Jesus Christ grace and truth have come,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   and how these Christian people to whom he was writing should be rejoicing in it
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   and should be glorying in it.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   They were not doing so for various reasons as we have seen.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And the Apostle writes his Gospel in order to remind them again of the things
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   they'd already believed, but which they were not fully understanding and comprehending.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   That's why the Gospels were ever written, the four Gospels.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   That's why every epistle was ever written.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Not to evangelize, but to remind people who've already been evangelized,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   who've already believed the truth, of what exactly they have believed,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   in order that they may rejoice in it as they ought.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Very well, I can put it therefore as a question at this very moment.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Do we rejoice in grace as we ought?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   It's an appropriate question to ask during this season of Advent.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Does it rarely fill us with a sense of joy and of praise unto God?
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Does it lead us ever to say thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift?
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Now that is the position as John was anxious to present it to these people.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   You remember in his epistle, his first epistle, he puts it in much the same way.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   He says, "These things write I unto you, that your joy might be full."
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   That's why he wrote that epistle.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   He says, "We want you to have fellowship with us,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   and our fellowship indeed is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ."
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And he says, "I write that your joy may be full."
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   That was his object.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   It's precisely the same object that he has here in writing his Gospel.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   He wants to know that these people are really rejoicing in the blessings of grace.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   He says, "We are not under law any longer. We are under grace now."
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   And so he wants them to understand this and to know exactly what they have inherited.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   In other words, the Lord Jesus Christ came into this world in order to bring grace and truth.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   It's the whole meaning of the Incarnation. It's the whole purpose.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And he wants these people to enter into the full enjoyment of this.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   And his way of putting it here is to contrast it with what the law had done.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   The law did many wonderful things as we've seen, things which are absolutely essential.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   But it couldn't go any further. It could but point.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   "Well, what it pointed to us comes," says John.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   "Let's enter into the possession of it. Let's enter into the enjoyment of it.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Let's experience this as we were meant to do."
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Well, now then, that's what we are doing.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   And having shown the function and the purpose of the law,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   and having seen the position of the Christian believer with respect to the law,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   we are now in a position to look at grace more positively,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   and to see what it is that it really brings to us and why we should all be rejoicing in it.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Very well, here's the way John does it. He says,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   "The law, all right, it was wonderful, but it stopped there. Grace and truth have come."
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Now, the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, you'll notice, does very much the same thing.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Did you notice that sixth verse in the eighth chapter?
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   He says, "He, our Lord, is the mediator of a better government,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   which was established upon better promises."
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   These men are all saying the same thing.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Hebrews does nothing but this very thing that we have in this verse.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   If you like, you can say that the whole of that great epistle to the Hebrews
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   is nothing but a commentary on John 1, 17.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   That's precisely its message.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   So is the epistle to the Romans. So is the epistle to the Galatians.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   They're grand expositions of this one text that we are examining so carefully and so minutely.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Now then, a better covenant, he says, established upon better promises.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   What does this mean?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Well, let's ask the question, "Wherein does grace then excel over the law?"
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   What are these better promises? What is this better covenant?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   What is this thing that makes John delight to be able to say,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   "The law was given by Moses, grace and truth have come by Jesus Christ"?
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   What is this? What is this plus?
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   What is this extra? What is this wonderful thing?
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   That's what we're going to do.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   If you like, we'll use the language of the hymn we've just been singing.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   I'm going to tune your hearts.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   I have a feeling they need to be tuned.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Singing expresses the state of the soul.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Where were the trumpets as we sang that last hymn?
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Where was the triumph? Where was it?
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Our hearts need to be tuned.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   That's the way we show that we've grasped this and we've realized it.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And we are rejoicing in it.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   God's people are meant to be a rejoicing people.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   We are not meant to be uncertain and hesitant and unhappy and doubtful and tentative.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Not at all.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   We are to realize this and to show that we do.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   It's the whole message of the New Testament.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Well, very well. What is this contrast?
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   What is this better thing that grace has brought?
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Well, let me just concentrate on two things this morning.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   The first great contrast between grace and law is this, of course, that grace gives.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   The law gives nothing.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   The law makes demands.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   The law presents a bill.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   The law says, "Here's the account. Are you ready to settle it?"
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   But grace is altogether different.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   That's why everybody likes John 3, 16.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   "God so loved the world that he gave."
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   He's not making a demand in Christ, in Advent, and in the whole message of the gospel.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   It's his giving.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   "Gave." "He sent."
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   These are the terms.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Well, now, this is most important.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   There's nothing legalistic about grace, whereas law, of course, is essentially legalistic.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   That's why that term that the apostle uses in Romans 6, 23,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   is again such a wonderful expression of this very point.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   "The wages of sin is death.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   You see, wages and a gift.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Wages, exact calculation.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   What's been done bears the result.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   And there it is.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   It's ledger. It's bookkeeping.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   It has that sort of exactness which is always the characteristic of law,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   and rightly the characteristic of law.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   But when you come to the realm of grace, you're in a new world altogether.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   No longer wages.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   You don't talk about wages here.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   This is the gift of God.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Oh, you remember how our Lord himself has established that point once and forever
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   in his great parable of the laborers in the vineyard.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   You remember those men who'd gone in at the beginning,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   and he promised he'd give them a penny for the work.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   And then later on, he engaged some more and gave them a penny.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Then there were some people who were only engaged at the eleventh hour.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   And when the time came to settle, the men who'd gone in at the first hour
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   were amazed that the men who'd gone in at the eleventh hour
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   were given the penny exactly as they'd done.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   They said, "This is unjust. This is unfair.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   We've been here all the day.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   The heat and the burden of the day, we've toiled.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   These men have come in at the last hour,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   and you've given them exactly what you've given us.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   This isn't right," they said.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Why did our Lord speak that parable?
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   He had only one object.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   It was to tell them that they're no longer under law but under grace.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   He says, "Isn't it right to do as I please?
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   You've had your just wages.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   You've had what was promised in your contract.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   You've got no right to complain at all.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   You said you'd do this work for one penny.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   You've done the work. Here's your penny.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   If you're living in that realm and thinking like that, very well.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Be content with your penny.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   But that's not my way of doing things.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Can't I do as I like with mine own?
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   I'm the one who gives grace and gives freely."
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   He gives a penny to those who've only worked for an hour.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   That's the contrast between grace and law,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   all this difference between demanding and giving.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   But I want to emphasize that grace not only gives, but it gives freely.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Here is the great note, of course, of the whole of the gospel,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   perhaps stated more perfectly than anywhere else,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   in Romans 3 and verse 24,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   where the apostle puts it in such striking manner,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   having said, "For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God,
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   being justified freely by his grace
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus."
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Freely, justified freely by his grace.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   He's already shown that nobody could pay anything.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   "All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   The whole world lieth guilty before God.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   When we were utterly helpless, penniless, hopeless,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   God justifies us freely."
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   I mustn't stay with this.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   We spent last Sunday morning on it.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   But my dear friends, are you happy about justification by faith only?
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Do you realize that you're forgiven in spite of what you are?
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Do you realize that the position of everybody is,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   "Nothing in my hands I bring.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Simply to thy cross I cling, justified freely.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Come ye, come ye unto the waters.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Come, buy without money and without price."
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   The evangelical prophet, you see, had been given a glimpse of it.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   That's it. That's the Christian salvation.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   So don't look at your own blackness and unworthiness
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   and what you haven't done.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   It doesn't matter.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   You'd never have enough to pay.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   You come as a pauper. Everybody does.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   It's the free gift of God, being justified freely by his grace.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   It's free grace that is the glorious message of the Christian salvation.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   But let's move on to another aspect.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Grace not only gives freely, but it gives very richly.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   And here's the thing I want to emphasize.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   It gives richly.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   You get it, of course, in this prologue. Listen.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   "And of his fullness have we received, and grace for grace,"
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   which means grace upon grace and upon grace.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   There's no end to it. It comes as an endless stream,
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   wave upon wave upon wave, grace upon grace.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   This is a way of expressing the freeness, the richness of God's grace.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Of course, as we shall see, God willing,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   it is the great theme, in a sense, of the whole of this Gospel of John.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   You've got it again in the case of the woman of Samaria, John 4, 14.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   "Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   But the water that I shall give him shall be in him as a well of water
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   springing up into everlasting life." No end to it.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   "Plenteous grace in thee is found," says Charles Wesley,
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   "grace to cover all my sin.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Let the healing streams abound.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   Make me, keep me pure within.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Thou of life, the fountain of it.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Freely let me take of thee the richness of this grace that is given so freely."
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Or take another expression in John 6, 35.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   "Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   He that cometh to me shall never hunger,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   and he that believeth on me shall never thirst."
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   That's it.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   All this is but an expression of this richness of the giving of grace.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Grace not only gives and gives freely, but it gives very richly.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   But I must take you back again to what we read at the beginning,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   because it is in many ways the most wonderful expression of all this
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   in detail, worked out by the Apostle Paul,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   who is simply expounding these glorious statements of our Lord.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   But look at Romans 5 again. Let me pick out certain verses for you.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Look at verse 15.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   "But not as the offense, so also is the free gift."
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   What he means is this.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   He says, you know, there is a kind of opposite in this.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   The offense of the grace of God.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   But he says, you don't stop at that.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   It isn't just exact.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   The grace of God, he says, doesn't just balance our transgressions and our sin.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   It isn't that.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   No, no. His whole point is that there is a superabundance about grace.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   So he says, "Not as the offense, so also is the free gift."
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   The free gift doesn't correspond in that respect with the offense.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   "For if through the offense of one many be dead."
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   "Much more the grace of God and the gift by grace,"
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   "which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many."
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   You see, there he is. He is stating it.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   He wants to bring out this notion that grace is abounding.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   You immediately think of John Bunyan, don't you?
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   "Grace abounding to the chief of sinners."
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   But look at verse 16.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   He can't stop saying this.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   "And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift."
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   "The gift," he said, "doesn't correspond in degree to the sinning."
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   "One man sinned, that was Adam, and certain consequences followed."
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   "One man, Christ, has done what was necessary for our salvation,"
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   "and certain consequences follow."
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   "Well, it appears to be an exact parallel, but it isn't," he says.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   "Not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift."
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   Well, why?
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   "Well, the judgment was by one to condemnation."
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   "Oh, but the free gift is of many offenses and to justification."
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   Much more again, you see.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   And on he goes, verse 17.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   "For if by one man's offense death reigned by one,"
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   "much more," here's the point, "much more,"
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   "they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness"
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   "shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ."
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Same point.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   And then let's hurry on to the 20th verse.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   "Moreover the law entered that the offense might abound."
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   "But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound."
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Now, the translators were in difficulties there.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   It's almost impossible to translate what the apostle wrote at that point.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   Much more did grace abound.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   The sin abounded as a result of the law,
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   but grace did much more abound.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   It superabounded.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   That's what he really says.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   "That as sin hath reigned unto death,"
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   "even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life,"
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   "by Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   Now, there it is.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   The apostle brings it out, I say, in his own perfect manner.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   The much more, the abounding, the superabounding.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Grace gives, grace gives freely.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   But all the riches of God's grace.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Well, let's go on.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Listen to the apostle again in 2 Corinthians 8, 9.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   "For you know the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   This is the kind of grace that I'm talking about, he says.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   "You know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   "that though he was rich."
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   What's the measure of that richness, riches?
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   Oh, it's the riches of God.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   It's eternal. It's everything.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   "Though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor."
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   There's the measure of this superabundance of grace.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   "Though he was so rich, yet for your sakes he became poor,"
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   "that you through his poverty might be made rich."
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   I say grace gives.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   What does it give?
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Well, it gives that.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   He left the courts of glory.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   He left all the signs of this glory.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   He was born as a babe in a stable.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   And the parents who were so poor that they couldn't afford a lamb,
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   they could just give turtledoves when they came to present their offering.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   That's the measure of the riches of the giving of grace.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   "Who was so rich, yet for our sakes he became poor,"
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   "that we through his poverty might be made rich."
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   And again you see the apostle bursts out saying,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   "Thanks be unto God for what for his unspeakable gift."
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   No language can describe it.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   The gift is so great, it baffles all the vocabularies.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   It is an unspeakable, inexpressible gift.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   That's the measure of the richness of the giving of grace.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   And then I could keep you endlessly with this,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   because as I say it's the great theme.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   But listen to it in a particularly wonderful statement of it
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   in the epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Ephesians 1, 7.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   "In whom we have redemption through his blood,"
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   "the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace."
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Riches of his grace.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   But the apostle's only starting.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   And he always works up.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   The more he says a thing, the more he sees the wonder of it.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   There it was, Ephesians 1, 7.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   But listen to Ephesians 2, 7.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   "That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace."
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   You see, first of all, according to the riches of his grace.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Now it becomes the exceeding riches of his grace.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   But you see, even that isn't enough.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   So when you go on to the third chapter,
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   and you come there to the eighth verse,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   you find he puts it like this.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   "Unto me who am less than the least of all saints is this grace given."
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   What for?
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   "That I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ."
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Riches, exceeding riches, unsearchable riches.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   That's it.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   You can't measure it.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   It baffles all attempts to do so.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   So here we have it put before us in this striking manner by the apostle
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   as he expands what we have in the prologue of John's Gospel.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   "Of his fullness we receive and grace upon grace."
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   There's no end to it.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   Here is this everlasting life that goes bubbling up.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   It's all the result of the freeness by which grace gives us these benefits from God.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Very well, James is not to be ousted in this matter.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   He says, "God giveth liberally."
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   God doesn't merely give.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   He giveth liberally.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Does any of you lack wisdom?
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   Go and ask God.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   He says, "He giveth liberally and upbraideth not."
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   It's the message of all.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   But let me hurry to another aspect.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   The manifold and the varied ways in which grace is given to us.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   And here I quote the apostle Peter, 1 Peter 4.10,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   "As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   as good stewards of the manifold grace of God."
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   It's a manifold grace.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   It's a variegated grace.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   It's endless in its expressions and in its forms.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   What's he mean?
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Well, let me just give you a glimpse into this.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   We can't hope to deal with it exhaustively, but let me give you just a glimpse into it.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   This manifold grace of God.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   What is this?
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   Well, have you ever considered restraining grace?
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   Have you ever thanked God for the way in which he restrains you?
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   What would we all have been if he hadn't restrained us?
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   What would we still often do if he didn't restrain us?
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   You see, grace not only urges us forward and leads us, it holds us back at times.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Restraining grace.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   A man once wrote like this, "How oft to sure destruction my feet had gone astray,
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   yet though not patient shepherd been guardian of my way."
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   The hand that is placed upon us, that holds us back when anger or temper or resentment
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   or something threatens to engulf us.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   The hand of God quietly, gently laid upon us and it pacifies us and keeps us calm and quiet
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   and holds us back.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   The restraining grace of God.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   I sometimes think that when we do arrive in the glory and look back upon the journey,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   we shall thank God for his restraining grace as much as for anything else.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   Haven't you been conscious of it?
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   How God has suddenly held you.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   You can't explain it in any other terms.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   You were on the point of something.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   You were held back.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Well, read the 73rd Psalm.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   That man gives a wonderful expression to it there.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   His feet had well now slipped, he'd almost, but he didn't quite.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   He was led to go to the house of God and there he was given the understanding that he needed.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   The restraining grace, that's one way of looking at it.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   But then think of supporting grace.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   The supporting grace of God in trials and troubles and tribulations.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   Oh, is there anything more wonderful than this?
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   I suppose the classic description of that is the one that is given by the great apostle
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   in 2 Corinthians chapter 11, the thorn in the flesh, you remember?
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Thrice he prayed that it might be taken away.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   Felt he couldn't go on, felt he could do nothing.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   How could he do it with this thorn in the flesh?
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   But you remember the answer?
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   My grace is sufficient for thee.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   And he found that it was.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   So he's able to say that when I am weak, then am I strong.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   I grow a glory in infirmities now, says Paul.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   Because in infirmities I understand the supporting grace of God in a way that I never could otherwise.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   When darkness seems to hide his face, I rest on his unchanging grace.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   In every high and stormy gale, my anchor holds within the veil.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   On Christ the solid rock I stand.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   All other ground is sinking sand.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   Do you know the supporting grace of God, my friends?
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   He giveth liberally.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   It's grace upon grace, it's abounding, it's abundant grace.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   Do you know it?
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   In the hour of trial and troubles, when you're surrounded and almost overwhelmed,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   are you aware that you're being held, supported, sustained?
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   Well, think of it in terms of temptations.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Temptations within and temptations without.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   James has got a very great statement with respect to this in that fourth chapter of his epistle, you remember.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   He's talking about the lusts which are in the flesh and which lead to war and various things like that.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   And he says, "You adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?"
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   He doesn't mean literal adulterers and adulteresses.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   He means all who are committing spiritual adultery by being worldly-minded.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   The friendship of the world is enmity against God.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   Whosoever, therefore, will be a friend of the world is an enemy of God.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   Do you think that the scripture saith in vain?
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   "The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy."
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   Well, what can we do about it?
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   Who are we to stand against all this?
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Here's the answer. "He giveth more grace."
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   "He giveth more grace."
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   "Wherefore, he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble."
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   "So that though we are fighting the world, the flesh, and the devil, God giveth not merely grace, but more grace."
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   "Sufficient grace."
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   "More than enough for us, whatever our circumstances or position may chance to be."
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   "So that we should make a prayer like this."
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   "O Lamb of God, still keep me close to thy wounded side."
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   "Tis only there in safety and peace I can abide."
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   "What snares and foes surround me, what troubles thrive within,"
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   "the grace that sought and found me alone can keep me clean, and it will."
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   "I say again, plenteous grace with thee is found."
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   "Grace to cover all my sin."
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   "Let the healing stream abound."
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   "Make me, keep me, pure within, and he will."
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   This wonderful supporting grace of God and his enabling grace.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   And then let me give you another glimpse of it before I leave this heading.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   The keeping and the preserving grace of God.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   "He which hath begun a good work among you," he says to the Philippians, says Paul to the Philippians,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   "He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ."
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   It's the great theme of Philippians.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   "I know both how to be abased and how to abound."
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   "I can do all things through Christ, which strengtheneth me."
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   "His grace is sufficient."
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   "He's able to make all grace to abound," says Paul to the Corinthians.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   "Don't be worried. He's able to make all grace to abound."
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   "My God shall supply all your needs."
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   He says again to those Philippians.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   "He'll supply all your needs through Christ Jesus and his grace."
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   "Quite so," says Augustus. "Stop, lady."
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   "The work which his goodness began, the arm of his strength will complete."
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   "His promise is yea, and amen, and was never, and never was forfeited."
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   "Yet, things future, nor things that are now, nor all things of below, nor above,"
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   "can make him his purpose forgo, or sever my soul from his love."
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   "The grace that buys us will keep us and preserve us."
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   "No man shall be able to pluck them out of my hands," says our Lord in the 10th chapter of John's Gospel.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   "If grace ever lays hold on you, it'll never let you go."
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   "There is no falling from grace."
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   "The final perseverance of the saints is guaranteed by the enabling, preserving, keeping grace of God."
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   "It's a variegated grace. It's a manifold grace."
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   "I'm only giving you glimpses into it."
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   "There is a prevenient grace, a grace that goes ahead of us and prepares the way for us,"
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   "so that when we arrive at the position, we find that grace has been there before us."
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   "The psalmist is always celebrating that particular fact."
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   "Grace, then, you see, gives in a variety, an almost endless variety of ways."
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   "There's one great contrast."
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   "The Lord demands grace gives, and all the giving of grace."
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   "My dear friends, are you receiving grace upon grace?"
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   "That's what we're meant to."
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   "That's why John writes his Gospel."
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   "That's the whole point of the prologue."
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   "The rest of the Gospel is an exposition of this prologue."
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   "This abundant, superabundant, abounding."
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   "Do we know it? Are we receiving it?"
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   "Are we rejoicing in it as we ought?"
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   "What does Christmas, what does Advent mean to us?"
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   "Do we realize that Christ came in order that we might be enjoying this kind of thing?"
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   "Or do we feel we are left to ourselves,"
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   "and we are holding on to our bit of Christianity desperately, just managing?"
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   "Oh, shame upon us."
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   "My grace is sufficient for thee, and it's more than sufficient."
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   "It's more than we can ever need."
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   "There's no end to it."
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   "It springs up like a fountain unto everlasting life."
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   "But let me hurry to say just a word on this other matter."
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   "Grace not only gives, but grace reigns."
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   "That as sin hath reigned unto death," says Romans 5, 21,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   "even so might grace reign through righteousness,"
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   "unto everlasting life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   "Now then, what's he mean?"
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   "Well, he means it's got power in it."
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   "The whole trouble with the law is that it lacks power."
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   "The law, what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh."
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   "God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,"
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   "and for sin, condemns sin."
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   "The law hasn't got any power."
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   "It's all right, it makes its statements, but it can do nothing."
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   "And it can't give us power."
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   "It can't do anything in that way, that it can't help us."
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   "It can't give us power."
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   "Do this," it says, "but leaves it to me."
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   "But the glorious thing about grace is that it reigns."
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   "It's got power."
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   "That's the meaning of reigning, isn't it?"
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   "There's no point in a monarch if the monarch hasn't got power."
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   "A monarch can't reign without power."
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   "The whole essence of reigning and of monarchy"
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   "is that there is power, that there is authority,"
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   "there is ability to do things."
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   "The word is a command, it's executive,"
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   "and it must be carried out."
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   "Well, according to the apostle Grace, reigns."
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   "And it is the great theme of the New Testament."
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   "What does it do?"
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   "Well, I only want to emphasize one aspect."
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   "It's to interpret more fully what I said at the end last Sunday morning."
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   "Grace is that which enables God's great plan and purpose"
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   "to be carried out in us."
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   "What is that purpose?"
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   "Oh, I quoted Titus 2, 14 last Sunday."
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   "It is this, to separate unto himself a peculiar people,"
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   "to fill us of good works, to redeem us from all iniquity."
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   "I ended by saying this, that to the Christian,"
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   "the commandments of God are not grievous."
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   "The grace of God in Christ has come,"
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   "not merely that we might be forgiven,"
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   "not only that we might be justified,"
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   "but to enable us to live the life that God would have us live,"
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   "to keep the commandments of God."
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   "That's the purpose."
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   "And grace enables us to do this."
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   "That is why to the Christian the commandment is not grievous."
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   "Let me show you what I mean."
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   "Grace, I say, is powerful."
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   "It reigns."
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   "How?"
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   "Well, Ephesians 2 tells us that it quickens us."
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   "Do you remember how the apostle introduces the whole notion of grace there?"
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   "He puts it like this."
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   "He's saying, 'But God, who is rich in mercy,"
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   "for his great love wherewith he loved us,"
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   "even when we were dead in sins,"
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   "hath quickened us together with Christ."
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   "By grace he has saved."
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   "You see," he says, "it's grace that does it."
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   "Grace is the dynamic power."
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   "You were dead, you were buried in sin,"
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   "quickened by grace."
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   "Grace reigns, so it puts life into the dead,"
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   "brings us under our feet,"
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   "raises us up with Christ,"
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   "quickens us and regenerates us."
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   "Then it goes on to sanctify us,"
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   "and this is the thing I'm concerned about."
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   "It enables us, I say, to live according to God's holy law."
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   "It explains why the law is not grievous."
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   Now, let me show you the meaning of this statement in Hebrews 8, 6.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   "This better covenant," he says, "has now been given."
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   "Now he hath obtained a more excellent ministry,"
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   "by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant,"
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   "which was established on better promises."
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   What's he mean by this?
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   Well, now he tells us. Listen.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   "Where, then, lies the superiority of grace over law?"
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   Well, it's here.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   "Where does the new covenant excel over the old?"
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   "Why do we glory in the new dispensation"
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   "and that we are not in the old dispensation this morning?"
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   "Why do I say I am Christ's men, not Moses' men?"
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Here's the answer.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   Here's the great difference.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   "Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers"
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   "in the day when I took them by the hand"
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   "to lead them out of the land of Egypt."
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   That's the covenant he made through Moses.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   That's the law.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   "But as they continued not in my covenant"
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   "and I regarded them not," saith the Lord.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   "This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel"
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   "after those days," saith the Lord.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   Now, here it is.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   "I will put my laws into their mind"
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   "and write them in their hearts."
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   That's a description of Christianity.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   So Christianity, you see, doesn't do away with law.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   You see why I've been contending for that all along.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   The Christian doesn't say, "I've got nothing to do with law."
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   "I'm a Christian now."
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   But, my friend, what Christianity, what the grace of God does is this.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   It's to put the law of God into your mind and into your heart.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   It doesn't dismiss it.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   But this is the difference.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   It means this, that the law is now within us and not without us.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   The law given through Moses was on tables of stone.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   It's no longer there. It's inside.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   So that Paul, in writing to the Corinthians,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   in the second epistle and in the third chapter
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   and in the third verse, you remember, puts it like this.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   He says, "You are our epistle,"
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   "written in our hearts, known and read of all men,"
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   "forasmuch as you are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ,"
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   "ministered by us, written not with ink,"
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   "but with the Spirit of the living God,"
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   "not in tables of stone, but in the fleshy tables of the heart."
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   Same thing, exactly.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   The law of Moses was outside us, written on stones.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   There it was, thundering at us and saying,
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   "Do this and thou shalt live outside me."
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   But it's now inside me.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   That's the difference between grace and law,
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   that grace puts the law inside me instead of outside me.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   And what a wonderful difference this makes.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   It makes this difference, according to the Apostle John,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   that a Christian cannot continue living a life of sin.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   Had you realized that? Listen.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   1 John 3, 8 and 9.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   "He that committeth sin is of the devil."
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   When he says, "committeth sin," he means go on living in it,
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   lying down in it, it being his habit.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   "He that committeth sin is of the devil,"
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   "for the devil sinneth from the beginning."
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   "For this purpose the Son of God was manifested,"
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   "that he might undo, destroy the works of the devil."
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   Listen. "Whosoever is born of God"
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   "doth not commit sin."
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Now that obviously doesn't mean that he never falls into sin.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Otherwise there isn't a single Christian in the world.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   It means this.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   "Whosoever is born of God"
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   "doth not go on committing sin or being mastered by sin."
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   Why not?
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   "For his seed remaineth in him,"
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   "and he cannot sin because he is born of God."
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   Now that isn't teaching sinless perfection.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   But what it is teaching is this,
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   that the seed of God which is in man
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   means that he cannot go on being a slave of sin.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   He is born of God. The seed remains in him.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   And it keeps him from that.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   The law, in other words, is in him, now not outside him.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   It's not on a table of stone over there.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   It's in the fleshy tables of the heart.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   The seed is in him. He is born of God.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   And he cannot go on sinning.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   Or if you like it in terms of Philippians 2, 12 and 13,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   Why?
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   "Oh, it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do."
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   God works in us both to will and to do of his good pleasure,
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   of his commandments, of his law.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   That's it.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   He's enabling us to do it by working in us.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   Or look at it like this.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   "I will write it," he says, "in their minds."
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   And this is most wonderful.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   It means that we understand it.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   The trouble with men under the law is that they're like children.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   The child hears the parents saying,
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   "You mustn't do this and you mustn't do that."
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   Well, he doesn't do them, perhaps, but he resents it.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   He doesn't understand why.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   He doesn't see the point or the purpose.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   He thinks he ought to be allowed to do anything he wants to do.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   But the parent says, "No."
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   And the child gives obedience, but oftentimes grudgingly and complainingly
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   and feeling it's hard and it's all wrong.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   That's men under the law.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   But the moment the law is written in the mind, one understands.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   When we get older, we thank our parents for their prohibitions
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   as well as their encouragements.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   We thank them for the discipline they exercised upon us,
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   for the things they taught us not to do and the things they taught us to do.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   We are now adults and we understand it.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   When I was a child, I thought as a child, but not now.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   I've become a man.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   I've got an understanding very well.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   Now, the law written in the mind gives us understanding
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   and it enables us to see things like this.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   It enables us to see that what matters is not the letter of the law
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   but the spirit of the law.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   And that's a most wonderful discovery.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   As long as you're looking at the mere letter, you hate it.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   But once you see the spirit and the object and the purpose,
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   you begin to enjoy it.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   Write the laws in the mind, what for?
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   Well, in order that they may understand.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   God's laws are quite inevitable because of the character of God.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   Let me say it with reverence.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   God had to give the Ten Commandments.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   God couldn't give any other commandment.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   The Ten Commandments are a transcript of God's own holy character.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   So one's not surprised at the Ten Commandments.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   One doesn't resent them.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   One sees that they are what they are because of the character of God.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   One sees that they're absolutely right, they're essentially right.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   If the whole world kept the Ten Commandments this morning, it would be paradise.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   Now the law written in the mind enables me to see that.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   Then it enables me to see that these commandments of God
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   are but right for the children of God.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   And therefore I ought to rejoice in them.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   We are His workmanship, says Paul, to the Ephesians, Ephesians 2.10.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   We are His workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works,
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   that He might walk in them.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   In other words, he says you've been born again in order that you might live this life.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   Thank God that it's such a wonderful life.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   You no longer complain.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   You say this is a marvelous thing that I'm now to live that kind of life.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   You don't resent it, you rejoice in it.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   In other words, we can sum it up like this.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   Be ye holy, for I am holy, saith the Lord.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   The moment a man sees that, he no longer resents the law.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   God's saying I want you to live like this because this is what I am.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   I am holy, be ye holy.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   So you don't kick against the gospel and say it's narrow and prohibitive.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   You say this is God's life, and I'm to live God's life.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   And then you've got this marvelous argument of the hope.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   Every man that hath this hope in him, says John, purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   If you really believe you're going to heaven, if you want to go to heaven,
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   well then, says John, surely to be logical you must be beginning to prepare to go for heaven.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   A man who says he wants to go to heaven, and yet he's living to the full in this life,
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   and wants to live that life and feels Christianity is narrow,
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   well the real trouble with him is he's a fool, he can't think straightly.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   So if you resent the commandments of God, don't talk to me about heaven.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   Don't talk about spending your eternity looking into the face of God.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   He that hath this hope in him, purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   That's the law written in the mind.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   No longer on stones outside, but in the mind, in the fleshy tables of the heart also.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   In other words, he says I will write it in their minds and in their hearts.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   I'll give them a new disposition.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   I'll give them a heart of flesh instead of a heart of stone.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   I'll make them desire to keep my law. I'll make them love my law.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   They'll no longer hate the law when it condemns them.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   When they fall into sin and the law condemns, they'll say absolutely right.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   I've been a fool. I shouldn't have done that. I'm unworthy. Oh, how can God forgive me?
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   The true Christian never argues with the law when it condemns him.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   He admits it. He confesses it. He humbles himself.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   And he repents in a godly repentance.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   I will write them in my heart, yes.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   When a man is born again, he looks at it like this.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   He says that law of God, of course I'll keep it.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   I'll keep that in order to please God.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   He sent his only son from heaven to earth for me.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   Christ who was so rich became poor that I might live.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   And all I am to do now is to show him that I love him, that I want to thank him.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   How can I do it? By keeping his commandments, by pleasing him,
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   by living the life that he wants me to live.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   I will write my laws in their mind and I will imprint them upon their hearts
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   so that they'll understand it and they'll love it and they'll rejoice in keeping it.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   Well, there it is, hurriedly and inadequately.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   That's the superiority of grace.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   You see, it gives in abundance and it enables me to live this abundant life.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   It gives me power, it reigns and it will go on reigning
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   until all the people of God are spotless and pure without any wrinkles,
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   glorified and perfect and well-pleasing in the sight of God
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   who is no longer ashamed to call us his people,
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   nor Christ ashamed to call us his brethren.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   My dear friends, are we rejoicing in grace?
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   Are we able to say the law was given by Moses?
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   But thank God, grace and truth have come in Jesus Christ
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   and we are being bathed by the showers of God's superabundant grace.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   Is that our position? It's meant to be?
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   It's the whole meaning of Christmas and the incarnation,
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   the death and the cross and everything.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   Oh, let us pray God to open our understanding by his Holy Spirit
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   that we may see the triumphs and the glories of the grace of God.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   Very well, to that end, let us join in singing hymn number 159.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   159.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   Come, thou long-expected Jesus, born to set thy people free.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   From our fears and sins releases, let us find our rest in thee. 159.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   [organ music]
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   [singing]
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
