[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   Today on Grace To You.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.260]   Your life ought to demonstrate your transformation.
[00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.060]   You too be patient, strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near.
[00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:16.480]   Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all transgression.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.800]   And there's one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.880]   That is as narrow as it gets.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.660]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:36.160]   I determine to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:57.520]   Grace To You
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.520]   Now,
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.800]   we are going back to the book of Ephesians, so open your Bible to Ephesians, chapter 4.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.700]   The text that we're looking at, and this will be our fourth look at this text, is Ephesians
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.440]   4:1-6.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.140]   Let me read it to you.
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.680]   "Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.020]   with which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing
[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.340]   tolerance for one another in love.
[00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.440]   Being diligent to preserve the
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.700]   unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace.
[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.260]   There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling,
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.080]   one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and through
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.720]   all and in all."
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.980]   This is a profoundly significant portion of Scripture.
[00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.360]   And the heart of this text is in verse 3.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:05.840]   Where the apostle is calling for us to be diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.240]   in the bond of peace.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:17.120]   And what we've been learning along the way is that our Lord wants unity in His church,
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.120]   unity.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.640]   In fact, verse 3 is really the sum of this.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.980]   It's the high point of this text.
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.280]   "Be diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit."
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.120]   "Be diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.520]   That is important to the apostle Paul.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.280]   Now what kind of unity are we talking about?
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:47.300]   Well first of all, let's identify it as internal unity, internal unity.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.780]   That is, it is the possession of the divine life.
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.100]   Anyone who's in Christ is a new creation.
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.200]   Christ lives in us.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.480]   We are one.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.220]   We are one.
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.740]   All who are in Christ are one.
[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.240]   We are the one church.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.560]   We possess that internal spiritual life.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:22.100]   So the question that Paul is bringing us to, back to Ephesians 4, is how do we make the
[00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.080]   internal external?
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.120]   How do we make that which is invisible?
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.900]   As to the life of God visible?
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:42.400]   How do we live to make our divine calling visible?
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.520]   That's what Paul is talking about here.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.020]   Verse 1, Paul says, "I implore you, walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.240]   you have been called."
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.800]   Axios is the word for worthy.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.040]   It means equivalent.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.340]   The life ought to demonstrate your transformation.
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.500]   Since you have a high, holy, heavenly calling that has taken you out of the kingdom of darkness
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.400]   and put you into the kingdom of God's dear Son, has taken you out of death and put you
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.340]   into life, since you now possess the life of God, it ought to be manifest.
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.300]   There ought to be an equivalence between that identity, that spiritual internal reality,
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.960]   and your external life.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:37.320]   So how do we take what is true of us internally and make it visible externally?
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.080]   What does a worthy life look like?
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.400]   Well, we went from the call to the characteristics.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:54.960]   Let's go back to verse 2, the characteristics of a worthy life: "With all humility and gentleness,
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.840]   with patience."
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:04.160]   Showing tolerance for one another in love.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:11.260]   And those will lead to verse 3, "The preservation of the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.300]   peace."
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.380]   The goal is in verse 3, the manifest unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.720]   The means is verse 2.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.720]   So what is the Word of God asking?
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.780]   "What is the Word of God asking of me?"
[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.240]   What is Paul begging for in this worthy life, this worthy walk?
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.840]   He starts with all humility.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.360]   Yes, it's a high, holy, heavenly walk.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.660]   It is a privilege beyond comprehension that God, the triune God, lives in us.
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:55.940]   It is the most exalted reality in the universe for any created being.
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:06.980]   And yet we are to demonstrate it, not by being proud about it, but by all humility,
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.980]   lowliness.
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.940]   "Walk worthy of the Lord by recognizing how unworthy you are."
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.380]   The next one, gentleness or meekness.
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.000]   What is the Lord demanding of us?
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.820]   That we be gentle-hearted, no retaliation, no anger, no bitterness, no vindictiveness,
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.140]   no hostility, no revenge.
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.400]   This is not weakness; it's power under control.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:41.000]   This is not passive acceptance of all that is wrong or all that is sinful, but it is
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:52.520]   righteous indignation only when God is dishonored, not when things don't go well for you or me.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.700]   It is zeal for your house.
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.200]   The psalmist said, "That eats me up," and Jesus fulfilled that.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.880]   This is the meekness and the gentleness that doesn't get angry, doesn't get self-protective,
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:12.020]   self-assertive, vindictive, bitter, hostile, go after revenge.
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:20.260]   There's a third virtue in verse 2 with patience: makrothymia .
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.700]   Very common word in the New Testament.
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.580]   Patience, it's just that.
[00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.440]   It's patience.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:38.820]   It's endurance, endurance in trouble, testing, temptation, deprivation.
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:52.480]   It's the ability to stay faithful, joyful, peaceful, content, no matter what.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.460]   Like Paul said, "I've learned in all contentment."
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.020]   All conditions to be content.
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:03.880]   Patience, let me just give you some ways to think about it, is the attitude that never
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:11.640]   gives in in the midst of negative circumstances, never.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:17.940]   It is said of Abraham in Hebrews 6:15 that Abraham patiently waited and received the
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.800]   promise.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.340]   God made a promise to Abraham, and it didn't look like it was ever going to come to pass,
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.340]   or that it was even possible.
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:31.920]   He didn't want Sarah to have a child, but he waited patiently in a very, very difficult
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.140]   situation.
[00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:40.020]   And you could stretch it even to a second aspect.
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:45.120]   This is the attitude that takes everything that comes from everyone.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:51.220]   First Thessalonians 5:14 says, "Be patient with everyone."
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.100]   That's everyone.
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.220]   "And not all people are patient."
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.220]   That's everyone.
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.220]   "And not all people are patient."
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:09:00.700]   "And not all people are easy to be patient with."
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:07.520]   And no one who maybe mostly is patient is always patient.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.000]   What is this saying?
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:25.100]   This is to say that you are patient when you bear insult, injury, persecution, and you
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:31.320]   unfairness, false accusation, criticism, hatred.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:39.840]   And those two ugly sins: jealousy and envy, and you take it, and there's no bitterness,
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.480]   and there's no irritation, and there's no complaint, and there's no wanting to strike
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.060]   back.
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:59.100]   1 Corinthians 13:4 says, summing it up, "Love is patient."
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.520]   Patience is this third virtue.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:09.180]   The attitude that can endure negative circumstances for a very long time, the attitude that takes
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.560]   anything from anyone and never retaliates.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.040]   And a third way to look at it is the attitude that accepts God's plan and His plan.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.040]   "And time for everything."
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:29.000]   And that also takes me back to James 5: "Therefore be patient," - verse 7, brethren - "until the
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   coming of the Lord."
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.940]   Well, that's a long time.
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:40.940]   We don't have any guarantee of any intervention until the Lord comes back.
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:47.020]   So that sets the standard: "How long should I be patient until the Lord gets here?"
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:52.680]   "The farmer waits for the precious produce of the soil, being patient about it until
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.400]   it gets the early and late rain."
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.400]   "You too be patient.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.360]   Strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near."
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:08.100]   We're basically told to be patient in extended negative circumstances, to be patient no matter
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:17.000]   who gives us what, and to be patient until the end of life or the return of the Lord.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:24.200]   So how do you have unity in a church?
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:33.660]   You have it when you have humility and meekness and this astonishing endurance and patience.
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:45.580]   This is Christian living: humility, meekness, patience.
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.980]   And then there's a fourth.
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:53.160]   This is a characteristic: showing tolerance for one another in love.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:59.740]   I like the LSB in this one: "bearing with one another in love."
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:07.260]   Bearing something, carrying a person in love, even though they're hostile, even though they're
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.420]   difficult, even though they're an enemy.
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:16.960]   Matthew 5: "You're never more like God than when you love your enemy."
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:24.720]   So the path to preserving the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace is the path of
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:29.720]   humility, gentleness, patience, and forbearing love.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.380]   What do we mean by that?
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.720]   I think Peter gives us a good insight in 1 Peter 4:8.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:42.140]   A lot of places you could look, but this one I think is vivid.
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:45.940]   1 Peter 4:8, "Above all."
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:46.940]   Now, this is above all.
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:52.260]   Again, we're back talking about the priorities of our Christian life.
[00:12:52.260 --> 00:13:02.180]   "Keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins."
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.180]   Keep fervent.
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.540]   It's ectonēs .
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:10.860]   It means to stretch a muscle as far as you could stretch it.
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:16.920]   In other words, extend love as far as it is possible to reach.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.100]   To extend it.
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:26.760]   To the point, Peter says, that it covers a multitude of sins.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:35.900]   This is where the unity of the church comes, from humility and gentleness, and from patience
[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:45.660]   and forbearing love that extends itself even to covering people's sins, even sins against
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:46.900]   us.
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:54.840]   Listen to the love defined in 1 Corinthians 13.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.580]   Love is patient, verse 4.
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.780]   Love is kind and is not jealous.
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:05.940]   Love does not brag, is not arrogant, doesn't act unbecomingly, does not seek its own, is
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:14.780]   not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, does not rejoice in unrighteousness,
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.780]   but rejoices with the truth.
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:22.760]   Lovers all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.660]   Love never - what?
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:28.740]   - fails.
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:34.980]   This is the love that endures everything and covers that with silence.
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.840]   Love covers.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:46.760]   That's taken from Proverbs 10:12: "Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all transgressions."
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:52.440]   This is the love that seeks nothing but someone else's good.
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:15:00.380]   "No matter what anyone does to me, I will never seek harm on that person.
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.860]   I will never seek to get revenge.
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:10.920]   I will ever and always only seek for that person's highest good."
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:15.660]   This kind of love is unconquerable benevolence.
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:16.740]   It is invincible.
[00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.920]   It is invincible goodwill.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:23.860]   And by the way, the word "love" here is agape, which is the love of the will.
[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.800]   You can't command people's emotions.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.000]   This is not emotional love.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:35.440]   This is the love of the will that says consciously and matter-of-factly, "I will set myself aside
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:45.000]   for the sake of another, even though the other is my enemy who has done evil against me."
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.620]   This is the love that we control.
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:54.220]   Again, it doesn't mean that we're spineless and sentimental, because times come when - to
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:16:00.780]   borrow from a little later in Ephesians 4 - we have to speak the truth in love.
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:05.200]   Nothing more loving than confronting sin.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.280]   We have to rebuke and speak the truth in love when it is appropriate, because that's what
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.280]   love does.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:16.600]   But look, only humble people can live like this.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:25.220]   Only humble people are gentle and patient and so extensive in their loving that it's
[00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:30.500]   God-like, and they actually love their enemies, and they stretch their love to cover a multitude
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:34.760]   of sins.
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:43.760]   And when you live like that, verse 3 becomes a reality: "Being diligent to preserve the
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.480]   unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace."
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.980]   You get to unity.
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.640]   You don't create it; it's been created internally, right?
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.060]   We saw that by the Spirit.
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:17:02.100]   But you get to preserve that and make it manifest when you take the path of humility, gentleness,
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:07.700]   patience, and forbearing love.
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:15.600]   This is the diligence required to preserve the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:16.360]   Be diligent.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.840]   That's spidadzantos .
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:22.020]   It means to endeavor.
[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:25.120]   Paul used it in writing to Timothy and Titus.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.620]   Make every effort, the NAS translates it.
[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.360]   Make every effort.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:39.660]   Or 2 Timothy 2:15, same thing: "Make every effort to rightly divide the word of truth."
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:46.240]   Do everything possible in your life to preserve this unity of the Spirit.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.240]   And the last thing, the last thing that we need to do is to be diligent to preserve the
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.240]   unity of the Spirit.
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.240]   And the last thing that we need to do is to be diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.240]   and the bond of peace by the path that we have just laid out.
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.240]   The first thing that we need to do is to be diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:56.320]   and the bond of peace by the path that we have just laid out.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:05.120]   Working at unity is primarily working not on somebody else, but on your own life, right?
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:10.880]   Working on unity means humbling yourself.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:16.120]   You pursue it not by being concerned about others, but being concerned about yourself.
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:20.260]   What is the bond of peace?
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:25.620]   If we're going to preserve the unity of the Spirit, that is the internal unity of common
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:30.520]   life, in the bond of peace, what is the bond?
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:35.620]   What causes peace in the congregation to be a reality?
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:42.860]   I think Paul answers that in Colossians 3:14 when he says, "The bond of perfection is love."
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:46.000]   The bond of perfection is love.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.160]   That's why Paul in 1 Timothy 1:5 says, "The goal of our instruction is love from a pure
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.160]   heart."
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:59.880]   "The goal of our commandment," the LSB says, "is love from a pure heart."
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:08.560]   I mean, the goal of everything we do in teaching you the Word of God is this kind of love that
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:15.880]   leads to the preservation of unity, so that the testimony of the church is one that is
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:21.840]   one of loving transformation.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:28.960]   And that ground in the collective assembly of God's people becomes the ground of credibility
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.240]   for personal witness.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.200]   So what do we say to sum it up?
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.640]   It's the obliteration of self.
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.620]   That's what it is.
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.640]   That's the path.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:51.560]   As long as self is at the center, as long as your feelings, your desires, your rights,
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:56.820]   your privileges, your prestige, your place, your concerns are the chief concern, we will
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:02.660]   never see this kind of unity.
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:12.520]   And if we don't, we will have denied the very essence of the Christian faith, because the
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.080]   Christian faith is all about unity.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:21.280]   And that brings me to a few comments about verses 4 to 6.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:26.980]   We saw the call to the worthy life in verse 1, the characteristics of the worthy life
[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:28.400]   in 2 and 3.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.540]   Here's the creed, the creed.
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:33.920]   This is magnificent.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:40.400]   Verse 4: "There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.400]   your calling.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:48.660]   One faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and
[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.940]   in all."
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:54.600]   This is stunning, absolutely stunning.
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:21:02.360]   In my mind, it is the single greatest statement on the exclusivity of the Christian faith
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:08.440]   anywhere on the pages of Scripture.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.680]   There's one body, that's the church.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.280]   There's just one church.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:17.740]   I know people say, "We have denominational distinctives."
[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:22.520]   Well, get rid of them.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:30.020]   There's only one church, and there's one Spirit, and there's one eternal hope, and there's
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:34.560]   one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.460]   That is as narrow as it gets.
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.460]   That is the exclusivity of biblical truth.
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:40.820]   That is the exclusivity of Christianity.
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.160]   That is the exclusivity of the Holy Spirit.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:56.360]   There's only one church, one body, not many churches, not many acceptable religions, only
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.360]   one.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.820]   There's only one Spirit, the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:10.900]   All other spirits are demonic, false spirits, only one Spirit, only one hope of your calling.
[00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.040]   That is to say, "We are called."
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:25.180]   One heavenly hope, and then there's only one Lord, just one, not more than one, just
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:28.000]   one.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.380]   Then there's only one faith, and that's the objective common faith, the faith once for
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:36.780]   all delivered to the saints, the content of the gospel.
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:41.920]   It's called by Jude the most holy faith.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:47.180]   There's only one baptism.
[00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:51.640]   That is to say, there's only one union with Christ in His death and resurrection that
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:55.880]   brings about salvation and eternal life.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:03.480]   And there's only one God, not many, only one.
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:11.800]   This is the most hated of all Christian truths, that there's only one.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.720]   I've written about this in the New Testament.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.720]   It's the most hated of all Christian truths, that there's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:32.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:36.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:40.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:42.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:43.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:46.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:47.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:52.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:54.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:02.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:03.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:04.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:10.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:12.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:28.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.720]   There's only one God, not many, not many.
