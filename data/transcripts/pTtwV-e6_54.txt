[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Beeping]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   [Beeping]
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   [Music]
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Welcome back to Ask the Compound.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   A show where you, the audience, provide the questions, we try to provide the answers.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   I gotta give the audience credit, I laughed at a few of the questions this week.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   People are being creative, funny.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Yeah, we got a good crowd.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Today's show is sponsored by Fabric by Gerber Life.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Every time I get on a plane, Duncan, my wife, has a morbid conversation of,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   "What if something happened to you? What would we do?"
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Which is very morbid, but I guess she's planning, risk averse.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Life insurance is the first thing I did when I had my first child.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Fabric by Gerber Life was designed by parents for parents to help you get a high-quality,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   surprisingly affordable term life insurance policy in less than 10 minutes.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Term life makes sense, it's very simple.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   We've got some questions on this before.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   You basically go from start to covered in less than 10 minutes.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   No health exam required.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   It's all online, your schedule, no appointments, no piles of paperwork.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Just do it when it's convenient for you.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   It's pretty easy.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Join the thousands of parents who trust Fabric to protect their family,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   applying just minutes at meetfabric.com/atc.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   That's meetfabric.com/atc, M-E-E-T-Fabric.com/atc.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Policies are issued by Western Southern Life Insurance Company.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Not available in certain states.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Prices are subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Pretty easy. I tried it.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   And it just gives you an estimate right away.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   $500,000 of coverage.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   I especially like the point that they say you could be able to get it potentially
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   without having to do a health exam because I do not like going to a doctor.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Okay. You're scared of needles?
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Yeah. I mean, who's not? Who likes needles?
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   I don't like needles, but I'm not scared of them.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   I don't mind them.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   I did a blood draw two weeks ago.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   I don't even flinch anymore.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Okay. I'm not afraid of needles unless they're, like, right here.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   You know, once they're here, they're a problem.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   No offense, that doesn't surprise me.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   I don't know how to take that, but sure. Okay.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Let's do some questions.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Okay. Up first today we have a question from--
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   That's why you drink oat milk because it keeps you healthier
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   and keeps you away from the doctor.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I mean, it's probably not because of that necessarily,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   but, yeah, I definitely try to stay out of the doctor.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Okay. So up first today we have a question from Pete.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Ben, I love reading your work.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Stocks, bonds, and cash are categories to compare, but it hit me.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   As a retired boomer, what about home ownership as a comparison?
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Stay warm.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   I'm trying to stay warm.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   It's so cold here.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I think one of the things in middle age
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   is that I've learned to appreciate the seasons more, though.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Every year around February or March when there's still snow in Michigan,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   I complain, but we had our first big snowfall the past week or so,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   like 24 inches.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   It was, like, 6 degrees yesterday.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   It's pretty. I kind of like it.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Ask me again in a month and I'll hate it.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   You said 6 degrees?
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   6, yes.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   It was, like, -10 wind chill.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Very cold.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Kids like it. They have a lot of snow days.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   All right. This question is in response to my recent piece
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   on historical returns for stocks, bonds, and cash.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Aswath Damodaran has this website for NYU where he updates every year
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   the annual returns for each.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   John, throw up my chart here.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I update this one every year.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Average returns, best return, worst return for stocks, bonds, and cash.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   There are typically a fair number of requests for other asset classes
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   whenever I post this kind of data, and as luck would have it,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Damodaran actually added housing and gold this year to the mix.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   So I now have from 1928 to 1923 annual returns for stocks, bonds,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   cash, housing, and gold.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Here they are.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Stocks are around 10% per year.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Bonds are closer to 5.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Cash is 3.3%.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Real estate, which is the Case-Shiller Index.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   John, you can do a chart off.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Case-Shiller Index is 4.2% per year.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Gold is 4.9%, and then inflation of 3% per year.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   So you can do the real returns on your own.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   I don't have to do the calculations for you.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   So real estate is kind of between a little bit less than gold and fixed income.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Not the greatest.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   John, do the next chart on.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I broke this down by decade because I find this stuff interesting.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   So I did all these asset classes again.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Stocks, bonds, cash, real estate, gold, and inflation.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   The one interesting thing about real estate,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   the only down decade it's ever had was the 1930s during the Great Depression era.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Every other decade has been positive,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   while these other categories have all had negative.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   The 2020s is the aberration, right?
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   So we've already had 10.2% annualized returns for housing.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   We've never had an annualized return that high before.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   The highest return we've ever had was the '70s when it was up 8.7% per year,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   but there was also 7.5% inflation during that decade.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   So the total return of close to 50% that we've seen in nationwide housing prices this decade
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   is already higher than what we saw for the whole decade of the '90s, the 2000s, and the 2010s.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   So we've pulled forward a lot of gains.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   So look at these historical returns and you think, well, wait a minute.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   The stock market crushes housing returns.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   I thought housing was supposed to be the best investment.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Does this mean housing is a lousy investment?
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Not necessarily.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   The Case-Shiller Index does a good job of tracking housing prices on a national basis,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   but I don't think that necessarily means it's realistic for most people
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   in terms of the proxy for their returns or housing in general.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Calculating returns on stocks, bonds, and cash is pretty straightforward.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   You take the starting value, the ending value, add in any cash flows.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Gold is really easy.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   It's the starting value and the ending value, and that's your total return.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   None of these historical returns include taxes and fees, of course,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   but the frictions are so much lower these days because fees and bid-ask spreads,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   and that stuff's all lower, tax-deferred retirement accounts, all that stuff.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   What are you chuckling about?
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Nicole just logged on to the compound chat handle.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   It's confusing because multiple people from the same account.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   She types in all caps.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Housing is the most unique of all financial assets in a lot of ways.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   First of all, there's the leverage component.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Sure, some people may pay cash for their house, but most people borrow.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Let's say you put 20% down, dunk it on a $450,000 house.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Then it subsequently rises 20%, 25%.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   You have a house that's worth $560,000, $2,000, and $500.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   What's your return on that asset?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   It's up 25%.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   I was just thinking about what year I'd have to time travel back to
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   to find a house for that price.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Okay, what if it's actually 125%?
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Because you put 20% down, that's $90,000.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Your house went up by over $100,000.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Technically, the money you put down is a 125% gain.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   So maybe housing is even better than most people think.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Well, it depends.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   In the life of your loan, you have to pay interest expense, insurance,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   property taxes, maintenance, upkeep, people refinance, which costs money.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Wait, I'm sorry.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Did you just say interest expense?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Well, the interest expense on your loan.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   I thought you meant there was another mortgage insurance type thing,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   another fee.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   It's a secret.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Well, there's a lot of other bank fees you have to pay when you buy
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   that they kind of make up.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Plus, like I said, the bid-ask spread for ETFs and index funds
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   are infinitesimally small these days.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   For the housing market, the frictions are still really high.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   So moving costs, closing costs, inspections, title insurance,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   and all these other fees that banks more or less make up.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Selling your house requires these same fees along with realtor costs.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   So there's a lot of ancillary costs as well.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   So even if you were the kind of person like me who would track all these
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   expenses in a spreadsheet -- I don't actually do this,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   but someone like me probably does.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Even if you had all of these expenses to tell at your true cost
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   of home ownership, right?
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   I have everything.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   I know my outlays for my mortgage, for insurance, for all this stuff.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   If you weren't paying your mortgage, you'd be renting somewhere,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   and you have to live somewhere.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   So how do you calculate the difference between, well,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   what I'm paying in my mortgage versus what I would be paying in rent,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   plus the inflation component of that?
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   So adding it all up -- and I don't think there's a single person in America
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   who knows what their actual return on their house is.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   I think it's basically impossible to calculate.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   So I don't think you'd have to make so many assumptions
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   to come up with the actual number.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   You can look at the price numbers.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Sure, it's 1% or 2% above inflation,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   but the Robert Shiller numbers are probably directionally right,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   but that says nothing about the actual return most homeowners get
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   because of leverage and all these other costs and stuff.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   If you're buying and selling rental properties, it's probably easier.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   To track your expenses, you know what's coming in for rent,
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   and you can net it out.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   I think you can calculate what the return is.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   For some people, it's probably much higher than they assume,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   because, again, if you're doing it out of that initial investment
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   and there's leverage involved, even a small, steady stream of returns,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   when you have that leverage and you're only putting 20% down,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   that can juice those returns big time.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   For a lot of people, it's probably worse than they think
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   because they don't realize the frictions for buying and selling.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   They put too much in for renovations.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   They buy in the wrong location, all this stuff.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   So I don't think we should be comparing the roof over your head
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   to a Vanguard S&P 500 Index Fund.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Vanguard doesn't give you a place to live.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Vanguard does not provide mudrooms or open spaces to entertain
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   or walk-in closets.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   If I had to guess, it's probably closer to the stock market
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   than the bond market for true returns for most people,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   but I think it's far too circumstantial to put an actual number on it.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   So I'd like to look at my house as more of a home than a financial asset,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   but it does provide a really nice hedge against inflation
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   because my mortgage is fixed, and then I can borrow against it if need be.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   And for most people, it's just really a form of forced savings
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   because most of the middle class, that's their biggest financial asset by far.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   But I don't think you compare it to stocks or bonds or crypto
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   or anything like that.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   I think housing is so much more of an emotional asset
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   that it's impossible to gauge what that actual return really is.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Do most people who seriously invest in real estate,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   do they have some equation where it breaks down with square footage
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   and how much they expect to have to pay in general upkeep and maintenance?
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Well, the biggest thing is they call it the cap rate.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   But yeah, you could put a number on it like the fees are going to be
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   1% to 2% a year of the cost or whatever.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   You could estimate that somehow depending on the location.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   And yeah, someone who's doing rental properties, that's much easier.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   They look for a cap rate on what they're getting and what they're netting out,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   and then I guess you could add some equity in there somehow.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   But yes, it's way more complicated than most people think.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   So I don't think there really is a number.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   I don't think you can just take the price you paid for it
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   and then the price you get when you sell, and that's your return.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   There's so much more that goes into it than that.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Do you say "ruff" or "roof"?
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   I don't know. What did I-- "ruff"?
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   I just corrected myself. I said "ruff," and then I said "roof."
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   I don't even know which I'm supposed to say.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Let me know in the comments.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   I guess I'm a "ruff" guy.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Okay. Cool. Good advice there.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   And that's a popular one too.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   I think part of what's happening just as a layman is I think a lot of people
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   are paying up for housing right now and are trying to justify it as being like,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   "Okay, well, it's at least an investment."
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   I think that's why we're seeing more and more of these questions.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   And again, I think it's more of a forced savings vehicle
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   than an investment for most people, but that can be a good thing too.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing, but you're right.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   The fact that prices have been going up so much in the last couple of years,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   more people are looking at it that way.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   And I think there's just a lot of stuff you have to take into consideration
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   that most people don't.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   All right. Up next we have a question from Mike.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   "I've got a bunch of 2020 stocks."
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   I can relate to this one so much it hurts.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   I should just say right off.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   "I've got a bunch of 2020 stocks"-- may give a couple examples--
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   "down upwards of 70% all the way to 99%
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   "with the losses representing maybe 8% of the value of my portfolio.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   "Psychologically, they bother me, but I have no immediate need to sell.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   "No capital gains to offset.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   "Is it best to hold and just see if they recover in some years
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   "or just cut bait, take the ordinary income deduction,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   "prevent further losses, and reinvest the tax savings into an index fund?
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   "With the $3,000 win, I'd have carryover losses to claim
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   "for a decade or more. #NotToBrag."
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   All right.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Mike here included some of the tickers, and I've got to be honest,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   I've never heard of this one company, SKLZ, is skills with a Z.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   I've heard of it, but I don't know anything about it.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   My first point of advice would be never buy a company
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   that trades out the S for the Z.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   There's no way that it's going to end well.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   SKLZ, I'm sorry.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   In what world is a company with a Z in the end of it
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   instead of an S going to outperform?
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   That's just never going to happen.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   This company is down like 99%.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Funny enough, the Russell 3000, which is essentially
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   the entire liquid U.S. stock market,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   so that's the S&P 500 plus the small and mid-caps,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   there's nearly 2,700 stocks in it, which is kind of false advertising
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   because the Russell 3000 doesn't have 3,000 stocks.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   On white charts yesterday, I ran a screen for historical drawdown
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   from all-time highs for these stocks, Duncan.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Out of 2,700 stocks that make up the U.S. stock market,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   how many were down 70% or worse from all-time highs?
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   What's your guess? Percentage of a total.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   25%?
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   That's actually pretty close, 26%.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   He mentioned a stock, he owns stocks down 99%.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Again, 25% of stocks, and we're right near the all-time highs,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   a quarter of stocks in the index, in the market,
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   are 70% or worse off of all-time highs.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   There are more than 40 stocks that are down 99% or worse.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   That would put our guy Mike here in the bottom 1.5% of stock pickers,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   I guess we want to look at it that way, for these stocks, which is nice.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   10% of stocks are down 90% or worse.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   One out of every 10 stocks is down 90% or worse from all-time highs.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   44% of them are down 50% or more.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Almost half of all stocks in the index are down 50% or more from their highs.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   Tons of big losers, which is a feature, not a bug, of the stock market.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   One of my favorite research pieces that I come back to all the time,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   and I think it's worth repeating, is called "The Agony and the Ecstasy"
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   by Michael Semblis from J.P. Morgan, who's been on the Compounded Friends before.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Yeah, he was great.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   John threw up the first chart. I love looking back at this data.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Semblis found that more than 40% of all companies that were ever in the Russell 3000 index
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   experienced a catastrophic stock price loss, which was defined as a 70% decline
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   from a price in peak levels, which is not recovered.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   It's 70% and you don't make it back.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   You can see he broke it down by sector as well.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   Show the next one, John.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Around 40% of the time, a single stock experienced negative absolute returns,
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   which would have underperformed a simple position in cash.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   So holding T-bills, 40% of stocks underperformed cash.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   2/3 of the time, those stocks underperformed the actual index itself.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   So holding the index, you'd think, well, half of the stocks are going to do well
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   and half of them are going to underperform. That's not the case at all.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   It's mostly mega-winners, which they define as these huge, huge winners,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   and there's 10% of them since 1980 that are defined as mega-winners in the Russell 3000.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   So most stocks don't do very well.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   John, one more. Show the next one.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   Wait, why don't we just focus on buying the mega-winners?
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Yeah, that's it. So it's 10% of them.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   John, fill that chart back up.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   The winners generate these enormous returns,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   but the median stock ends up underperforming the index itself.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   So that's the thing.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   If you were the world's greatest stock pick, you'd say,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   "I'll just hold the best stocks. Good luck with that."
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   The problem is, what if you own some of these stocks that end up being mega-winners?
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Amazon was down 95% during the dot-com bubble and it recovered.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   One of the biggest, best stocks ever.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   NVIDIA was down almost 70% at one point in 2022.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   Facebook, not meta. I'm never going to call it meta.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Just like Google is not alphabet and Twitter is not X,
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   I will not call them that. It's Facebook.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Facebook was down 70% in 2022 and recovered all its losses.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Netflix has experienced three separate 70%-plus drawdowns in its history.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Career? Yeah, it works.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   It's recovered from the first two.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   It's still 30% away from the most recent highs in the new one.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   But history says you're better off just cutting bait, right?
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Do you actually believe in any of these companies?
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   I don't know. Maybe you could hold on to one of them as a lottery ticket or as a reminder.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   I have one stock in my fund portfolio account in Robinhood that I picked.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   I'm not going to name names, but someone at our company actually recommended it to me.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   It immediately went up 100% and now it's down 75% from where I bought it.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   I think I have the same one.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   I think I know who you're talking about.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   It didn't kill me because it's such a small percent.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   I kind of hold it there just as a reminder of just keep buying index funds, Ben,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   because the big winners will be in there and the losers won't matter.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   So I prefer index funds because it is extraordinarily difficult to pick stocks.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   But it's probably just best to move on.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   I don't think you'll regret it.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   If one of these really turns around after falling 99%, it'll be a miracle.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Unless you think that it's literally going to be the drink of the future or something,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   I see no reason to hold on to something when you're down big.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   What was Oatly down from all-time highs at the worst point?
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   Like 98% probably.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   If I pull up the chart, basically, yes, you can't even see it.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   It's pretty brutal.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   If you get cut in half and cut in half, you're approaching zero,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   but you can never actually hit zero, that's Oatly.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Yeah, that's what it feels like.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Something on this note that is kind of funny is back when I was in college,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   in like 2008, I guess, 2008, the market wasn't doing so well.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   And so I was like, "I should buy some stocks."
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   And so I took a little bit of money and bought a couple of things.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   I bought Microsoft, which I still own, the same share.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   I bought one share of Microsoft.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   And then I bought some shares of a company called Hemp
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   that was supposed to be like weed stock and, "Oh, this is the future,"
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   which is what people are still saying.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   No, no, no, it was supposed to be like cannabis, I guess.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Microsoft, that's a pretty good purchase, though.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   Microsoft has worked out great.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Hemp did not work out.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   And several others that I bought did not work out.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Kudos on the Microsoft purchase.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   That data, though, for real, that's basically an argument for cap weighting
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   versus equal weighting, right?
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Yes.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   I mean, equal weighting, I guess, it's diversification.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   The whole point about cap weighting is that the mega winners
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   really help offset the losers.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Right.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   Equal weighting is the kind of strategy, though,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   that just has a little more turnover, probably.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   But it can still make sense, too.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   All right, next question.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Up next, we have a question from James.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   I'm in my late 20s, married, and expecting our first child this year.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   I have over $100,000 cash saved, but over $50,000 in student loans
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   with a 4% rate.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   I have a large bonus coming in Q1, greater than my student loan amount.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   My bonus is nearly half of my total compensation,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   making traditional budgeting difficult.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   I'm doing my best to max 401(k), IRA, HSA, and 529,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   but I really want to put my family in a house that is more comfortable
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   and safe, even though it wouldn't be the end of days if we stay where we are.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   I'm having difficulty balancing my desire to super save and pay off debt
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   with my desire to get a house I truly feel like my family needs.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   On top of this, I would like to be charitable
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   and help those who are not as fortunate.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   How do I balance all these desires when I'm not quite at the level
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   where my total compensation is large enough to just do it all?
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   As a podcast host, I'm legally obligated here to say
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   there's a lot to unpack here.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Right, because that's what you say when you host a podcast.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   There's a variable income component, student loans, buying a house,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   tax-deferred retirement accounts, charitable giving.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   This is certainly a financial planning question
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   with a little bit of everything, so let's bring in an expert
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   who's used to helping people make better financial decisions,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   Mr. Kevin Young.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   Hey, Kevin.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Kevin's a CFP.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Hey, guys.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Kevin, I think there's this idea that once you have some money
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   or make a good income, your financial problems magically disappear,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   but it's much like investing where you can never completely take risk away.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   Risk just changes shape.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   That's the same thing when it comes to finances.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   I think all this stuff can be overwhelming.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   So where to begin?
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   I guess how do you help people rank order their financial goals
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   and decisions?
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Because as with a lot of this stuff, there's no right or wrong answer here.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   A lot of it just depends on what you want to focus on.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   Yeah, I think for me the thing that popped out was what he mentioned
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   about buying a house.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   That seemed to sort of be the top of mind.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   And the other thing to consider is where you are in your life, right?
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Our colleague Nick Maggiuli, yeah, he talks about just keep buying,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   but he also talks about flexibility.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   He wrote a blog post, I think it was last year
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   or maybe the year before, talking about not maxing your 401(k)
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   and sort of how that kind of flies in the face of conventional
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   financial planning 101.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   But for this person, if he's got other goals and he's in his late 20s,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   you've got plenty of time to max out your 401(k).
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   So maybe it makes sense to not max out the 401(k)
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   and give yourself a little bit more flexibility by saying,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   "Hey, instead of putting away $23,000 in the 401(k) this year,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   maybe I'll put away $17,500, or maybe I'll put away $15,000,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   or I'll match what my company puts in."
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   I do think there's a big psychological hurdle for that
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   because if you max out your 401(k) and then you pull it back,
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   you feel like you're doing less or you're losing something.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   So I think it's really hard for people to go backwards
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   after you've crossed that line in the sand.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   It is.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   And I always say that with the caveat that you've got to be purposeful
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   with the money that you're not contributing, right?
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   So if you are getting an extra couple hundred bucks in your paycheck,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   are you just spending that or are you putting it into the account
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   that you're going to use to put the down payment on in your house?
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Right. You're still getting ahead financially if you're using that money
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   for something else.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Absolutely.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   As long as you're not blowing it on something, then you're still saving.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Absolutely. And he also mentioned an IRA.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   I was definitely not maxing out my 401(k) and an IRA when I was in my 20s.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   So, I mean, frankly, I'm not even doing it now, but that's another story.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Kids are expensive, right?
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   So there's all these different things, and that's actually part of it, right,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   is that maxing out an HSA is great if you're starting a family.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   Doctor's appointments are insane.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   So all these things that he wants to accomplish, I think--
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   and, again, I just leaned towards the house because he mentioned it.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   If the house is something that really will give you a lot of peace of mind
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   and you'll feel really good about that, then it's okay to say,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   "Hey, I'm not going to put $23,000 away in my 401(k)
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   or $30,000 combined between the 401(k) and the IRA."
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Especially with that first kid coming along, you know that the house
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   is such an important piece of the family and not just a financial plan.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   And he talks about paying off the student loans.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   The rates are still relatively low.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   To your point about flexibility, I don't see the need to pay those off,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   especially if you have all these other goals.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   I think that one in the hierarchy of the goals,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   if you said the rates were 8%, maybe I would reconsider.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   But at 4% rates, I think you push that one down,
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   and that's one of the last goals you have to worry about.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   100%.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   Yeah, I wonder if they refinanced to get that low.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   7% is around where mine are.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Sounds like you need to email James back.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   Yeah, luckily I don't have a massive amount.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   But yeah, and then the other thing is the charitable giving.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   I guess the thing is, yeah, give yourself a little bit of a break.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   If you're in your 20s and you've got all this stuff figured out already
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   and you're maxing stuff out and you're trying to buy a house,
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   give yourself a break if you're not completely optimizing everything perfectly
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   and there's going to be some give and take and some course corrections along the way.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   And sometimes if you have a huge goal like this, like buying a house,
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   the other goals have to take a back seat for a while.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   And then the house is purchased and you're done saving for the down payment,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   now you can shift things around.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   And it's okay to make those changes.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   I know for people who are blinders on with the financial stuff,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   it can be tough to make those changes.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   But that's the whole point of a financial plan is that it's going to change.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Yeah, perfect is the enemy of good, right?
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   And so we come across this a lot with people trying to optimize
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   every single thing that they do.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   And it can cause more stress than is good for you.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   So I think your advice of just kind of taking the big goal first
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   and then trying to kind of waterfall it down from there.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Yeah. And my thing on the charitable giving side of things,
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   I treated it like it was a dollar cost average where I put it on automatic
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   every month I give to a couple organizations.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   And then once a year, usually around Christmas time,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   I'll look at that again and change it and increase it a little bit.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   But I think that's the kind of thing too that you can put just like your
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   contributions where you can kind of put it on automatic
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   and not have to think about it all the time.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Yeah. And if there's some part of you that just feels like you should be doing
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   something from a charitable sense, maybe it's not writing a check.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Maybe it's writing a smaller check and volunteering.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   There's a lot you can do that isn't necessarily writing a check
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   when it comes to charitable endeavors.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   So that might be a good proxy for now while you're feeling like the dollar
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   should be going elsewhere.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Cool. And I also noted here,
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   is there anything else that they're not thinking of that they should consider
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   with a child on the way, financial tips or any planning they should do?
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   Just be ready to throw your financial plan out the window multiple times
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   with kids because Kevin's right, kids are expensive.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   When I told my brother out we were having twins,
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   he had twins six months before us and he laughed and he said,
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   "Yeah, throw your financial plan out the window because kids are expensive."
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   So I think you have to be a little more – be willing to be more flexible.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   The good thing about kids is that you spend way less money on yourself
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   because you have no time to spend on yourself anymore.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   It's the beginning, right?
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   There's always another expense coming up that you didn't think about.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   Yes.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   And at what age can you get them going with an IRA if they do something for you?
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   You can do that, right? You've talked about it before?
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   Yes, I think they technically have to have some type of income, right?
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   Ben had talked about how people have their kids –
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   I've heard people who work around – there was a blogger I knew
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   who would show pictures of his kids in his blog and pay them an income.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   I don't know how the IRS feels about that.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   There you go. Probably not good.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   Yes. I don't know if my kids are cracked up for that yet.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   I don't know if they –
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   Well, and remember, now the 529 rules, right?
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   You can eventually convert that to a Roth if it goes unused.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   Yes, 529 is actually pretty – all right, let's do another one.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   Good to know.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   Okay, up next we have a question from Harry.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   I was let go from my construction job in October, but I landed on my feet
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   and was back to work in November.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   What should I do with my old 401(k)?
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   It seems like you can roll it into another account or do a cash withdrawal.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   Are there penalties associated with each?
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   If I do a rollover, should I open a new IRA or just move it to my existing Roth IRA?
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   We own our home, but this could be a good down payment for the lot behind our house,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   especially if there are no tax penalties.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   We're young newlyweds and very financially secure.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   I feel like you don't hear that phrase a lot.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   I have a feeling the answer is to wait and roll half to my new 401(k) when it's open
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   and take the resting cash for an emergency or down payment.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   But I would love to hear your thoughts.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   You usually don't hear that from someone who's just let go from their job too,
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   so kudos for being – and this also shows how dynamic the U.S. economy is, right?
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   This person was let go from their job one month.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   The next month found another one is already thinking.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   I do think there's another psychological component to this where you leave a job
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   and you have some 401(k) money and you look at it and you say,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   "Well, I've been saving for a few years."
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   It's almost like found money.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   People treat it differently than they would otherwise.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   If they would have stayed at this company and kept putting money into the 401(k),
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   they would never think about pulling it out.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   But now that it's there and it's like, "Well, you know, it's just like $15,000.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   What if I just pulled it out and used it to make a down payment or change it to this?"
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   I take a pretty hard line on retirement savings, like using for other purposes.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   Unless there's an emergency or there are no other options,
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   if it's earmarked for retirement, keep it for retirement.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   I think, Kevin, you can correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   If he's taking it out for a down payment for something, there's going to be a penalty on it.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   There's going to be some taxes to pay.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   Yeah, you're going to get hit with taxes and penalties on that
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   unless it's a first-time home purchase and there's some rules around that.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   It doesn't sound like that's the case here if you're just buying another lot.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Yeah, so you're going to pay ordinary income tax on that plus a 10% penalty.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   And so it's definitely, unless you really need it, which sounds like you don't,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   the options are, yeah, you're either going to roll it into your new company's 401(k).
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   If they have a decent plan, that's probably a perfectly fine option,
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   generally going to be really low cost.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   You can borrow against it if you really needed to access it.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Again, that wouldn't be the first place to go for liquidity.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   Or you're right, you could roll it into an IRA, whether it's a Roth or a traditional,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   depending on how the 401(k) is set up.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   But those would be the two options.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   I would really try to avoid cashing it out because you're going to pay quite a bit.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   Yeah, you probably give yourself more options by just rolling it over into an IRA.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   And I don't think you have to be in a rush, too.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   A lot of companies will let you keep it there for a while.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   And as long as the costs and fees are not egregious,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   you can keep it there while you try to figure out what you're going to do with it.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Yeah, I mean, most 401(k)s are not going to boot you off the platform.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   They're happy to have your assets and cliffhanger basis points.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   Yeah, they don't want you to leave, probably.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   I feel like I have heard there that sometimes they start charging you an additional fee
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   if you're no longer employed. I feel like I've heard that.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   Good point. Yeah, that can happen.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   And, you know, I would just take a look at what the, you know,
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   some company 401(k) plans are not as good as others.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   I mean, there might be the only options you have in the new company 401(k)
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   might be really expensive mutual funds.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   And in that case, you'd be better off just putting into a self-directed IRA
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   and buying low-cost ETFs.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   Or they might only have a couple options to invest in.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   But again, you cannot take a loan against an IRA.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   You can take it against a 401(k).
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   So there's one little piece that the 401(k) might make some more sense
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   if you ever think, you know, you might need to borrow against it.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   Yeah, but Harry's saying that he's financially secure.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   I would just roll it over. Don't overthink it.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   Probably best to have the control than anything else.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   Is there any reason to roll his traditional 401(k) into a Roth IRA?
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Or is that not worth the taxes that they would end up paying on that?
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   Or should I just open a traditional IRA?
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Yeah, well, it sounds like you might have a Roth, given the question.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Or maybe there's a combination of the two.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   A Roth 401(k) potentially?
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   Yeah. But, you know, yeah, you could.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   But just generally speaking, you could do a conversion.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   Again, you're going to pay taxes to do it.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   But, you know, the gamble on that is that you are paying, you know,
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   if you're in a lower tax bracket now, it's less painful to do.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   And that money is going to be tax-free in the future.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   But, you know, if he is, you know, on the upwards trajectory in his career,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   it could be a good time to take advantage of that.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   But, you know, given that we obviously don't know what tax rates are going to be,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   it's probably fine to just keep it as it is.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   Congrats on finding a new job so quickly.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   But I would not treat this as found money.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   It's set aside for retirement for a reason. Keep it there.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   Good advice.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   All right. One more.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Okay. Last but not least, we have a question from Nick.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   I'm a 40-year-old investor with roughly $2 million in investable assets
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   split evenly between a typical assets under management wealth advisor
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   and my own self-managed personal accounts.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   When looking at annual performance,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   the AUM wealth advisor accounts averaged about 13% gains,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   mostly in individual stocks and the taxable account,
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   whereas on my own, largely through low-cost broad market ETFs,
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   I averaged 23% returns in 2023.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   This pattern has held for the last few years.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   So my question is--this gets fiery.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   So my question is what in the actual expletive is the point of using an AUM advisor?
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   What would be the actual valid reasons to use an AUM wealth advisor?
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   I'm not looking for a sales pitch.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   I'm looking for the actual point of using one.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   I'm leaning towards just moving all into my own personal accounts.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Our first not to brag of the day
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   and our first four-letter word that we had to bleep out--
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   listen, if they're simply investing your money for you
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   and they're just picking stocks,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   they are not a financial advisor; they're an investment advisor.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   Now, I'm not saying that there's anything wrong
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   with outsourcing your investments for some people.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   Some people need that.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   But if you're just paying them to allocate or pick stocks,
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   that's a different thing than a financial advisor.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   So I would--and this is obviously the thing you want to do up front,
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   so maybe they're realizing this after the fact.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   Performance is not the only reason that you have this kind of change of heart,
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   but it's certainly something to think about.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   So if they're doing something for you besides asset allocation,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   security selection, or fund selection,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   I would have that conversation to help understand that.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   So Kevin, when you're talking to prospects or clients,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   how do you try to tell them the things that you're doing for them
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   beyond just investing?
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   Because we've had plenty of clients come to us who assume,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   "Listen, you're managing my portfolio, you're managing my investments,"
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   and that's a big part of what we do, but it's not the only thing.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   I actually had a conversation with a client this week
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   who, after the meeting, emailed us and said,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   "Listen, I thought the investments were the important thing,
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   but now I realize it's so much more than that.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   It's taxes and insurance and estate planning and financial planning
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   and all these other things you do that I didn't even realize before."
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   So I think that--so how do you communicate that to people?
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   Yeah, so I tell potential clients all the time,
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   "Do not hire somebody for performance,"
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   because as many times as you hear it on the TV ads or see it in print,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   it does not mean you're going to have success in the future.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   And also just think about--yeah, to your point,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   what does this person think that they're doing for you?
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   If you hire them purely to manage their money and invest it for you
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   and try to get an outsized return, I could see why you have a gripe.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   But please note that beating the index is really, really, really difficult,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   which is why index investing has become so popular.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   Because over time, I think it's something like 90% of professionals
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   don't beat their benchmark.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   So if they don't have a shot, why--if you can't beat them, join them.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   And it's worth understanding what your allocation with them--
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   if they have more cash or bonds or national stocks or alternatives,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   whatever it is, that's fine.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   But if they're investing your money in a way that you don't agree with,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   that's not going to work, right?
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   And for your personal accounts to return 23% last year,
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   I'm guessing you're mostly large-cap U.S.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   The advisor or the AUM person might have been investing in small caps
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   and international and emerging markets.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   And maybe against their benchmark, they did perfectly fine.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   I'd also say, well, okay, that's last year.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   What happened in 2022?
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   It's easy to think it's simple when the markets are up.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Yes, exactly.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   And so to your point, Ben, you mentioned all those things earlier.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   If you are looking for somebody purely to grow your portfolio
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   as fast as possible, risk management be damned,
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   then, yeah, maybe you want somebody who's going to just try to shoot the lights
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   out on returns.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   But what we talk about a lot is that we're wealth managers.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   We are here to literally manage your money.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   You've become wealthy in some way, shape, or form.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   Our job is to keep you that way.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   And so focusing on the emotional components, right?
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   What did you do in March of 2020?
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   Did you sell everything?
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   What did you do in the taper tantrum?
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   What did you do in '08?
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   So getting a sense of that behavioral management,
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   getting a sense of what their goals are,
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   understanding how to invest which dollars for what event in life.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   And if this guy doesn't have a very complex situation,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   maybe he doesn't need it.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   We have plenty of people who, in our audience,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   who are DIY investors and they do it all themselves.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   And that's fine.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   Not everyone needs an advisor.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   But if he has a complicated enough financial life where he's dealing with
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   estate planning and insurance and taxes and needs someone to stand between him
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   and making a mistake, that's a financial advisor you're looking for.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   So maybe you just have the wrong one or maybe you realize,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   "I don't need one."
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   Yeah, I would actually bet that the vast majority of our clients were former
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   do-it-yourselfers and they found us by watching this show or listening to Josh
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   or Animal Spirits or whatever it is and said,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   "Hey, I was fine doing this on the way up,
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   but now I'm getting ready to retire and there's so much about the
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   distribution aspect that I don't understand and taxes and all the other things."
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   And that's where it might make sense to say,
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   "I want to enjoy my retirement.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   I don't want to sit at a computer all day and watch my stock portfolio."
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   I agree.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   So I think peace of mind is a big thing.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   But if you're happy doing it yourself and you've got a good process and,
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   you know, Ben, you've written on this before,
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   like write down your investment policy statement and make sure that you stick
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   to it.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   And there's a lot you can do in that area and save yourself the fee.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   So, yeah.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   And the point of AUM is there's an incentive to grow the pot, right,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   to grow the wealth, right?
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   That's the idea there.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   That'd be the hope.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Yep.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   Great questions this week.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   Thanks to Kevin for coming in and helping us.

[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   If a guy wears a quarter zip like that,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   you know that he knows what he's doing, okay?
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   That's the truth, right?
