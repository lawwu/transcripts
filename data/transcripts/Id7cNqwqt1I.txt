[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440]   Saks, the United States is maybe not going to send weapons to
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.620]   Ukraine indefinitely. And they're asking them to sit down
[00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.340]   and negotiate something that people on the left started to do
[00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.740]   and got a got smashed for something you've been pushing
[00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.700]   for. So I guess mini victory lap for you, Saks. What's the end
[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.140]   game here?
[00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.300]   Well, yeah, I mean, I've been talking common sense about this
[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.620]   for months to saying that we need to be open to diplomacy,
[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.120]   because total defeat for Russia also means a maximum risk of
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.220]   nuclear war. I mean, these things go hand in hand. That's
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.540]   the paradox of this war is that if Russia faces the prospect of
[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.180]   a total defeat, that's when they're most likely to escalate
[00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.340]   this conflict into something much, much worse. So therefore,
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.580]   we need to be open to diplomacy. But it was good to hear
[00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.860]   administration officials over the past week say things that
[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.180]   I've been saying for months, and that I've been accused of being
[00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.940]   like a Putin sympathizer for. So apparently, there's a bunch of
[00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.140]   Putin sympathizers in the administration. And just to read
[00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.140]   you some of these remarks, actually, I want to play like a
[00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.540]   fun game with you guys instead of just Oh, really? Yeah. So I'm
[00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.020]   just mentioning these quotes. I want to get a game called Millie
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.380]   or sacks. So I want you guys to guess, okay, whether it was
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.860]   General Millie who said the quote, or whether I said the
[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.740]   quote, okay, does that sound like a fair, fair game? Yes.
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.060]   Fair game. Let's put some game show music here.
[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.660]   Milly or sacks.
[00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.460]   I'm going to read you like four or five quotes. And you guys are
[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.060]   gonna say whether it was Millie or sacks who said it
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.420]   first quote, who said it General Millie, or sacks.
[00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.340]   One of the lessons that should have been learned from World War
[00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.020]   One is that European powers refusal to negotiate compounded
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.620]   the human suffering and led to millions more dead. Milly or
[00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.140]   sacks,
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.500]   sacks. I'm going sacks. I'm going sacks. It's a very
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.180]   historic
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.140]   Millie said, Oh, next one. Next one. Go, go, go. Okay. A
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.380]   regional war turned into the First World War because all
[00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.300]   parties made maximalist demands and assumed others were
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.740]   bluffing. It can happen again.
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.180]   Sack Millie or sack going sack because you said bluffing that
[00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.660]   bluffing is a word that you would use.
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.660]   All right, that was sacks.
[00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.340]   That was sacks. maximalist. Yes. Okay. I would never say
[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.940]   maximalist. Yes, he would never say bluffing. Yeah, go ahead.
[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.940]   Well, there's an opportunity to negotiate when peace can be
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.020]   achieved. Seize it. Milly, Milly or sacks. Milly, Milly. It's
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.700]   very pithy. It's pithy like Millie.
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.500]   All right. That was Millie.
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.300]   Yes. I'm up to and one to and one me and you. I'm two for one.
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.420]   It's deeply irresponsible not to try for diplomacy when the
[00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.340]   stakes are so high.
[00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.540]   sacks. sacks. That's an emotional statement. I go
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.100]   mills.
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.900]   It was sacks.
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.900]   Damn it. Two and two, three.
[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.140]   There has to be a mutual recognition that military
[00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.820]   victory is probably in the true sense of the word may not be
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.100]   achievable through military means and therefore you need to
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.020]   turn to other means.
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.620]   That's Millie. It's a word salad. I go Millie word salad.
[00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.100]   Hold on. Hold on. It's a Millie word salad. It's too too
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.340]   convoluted for sacks.
[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.940]   sacks. I go Millie. I go Millie.
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:49.660]   I think it's Millie.
[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.380]   That's Millie.
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.180]   Yeah. Word salad Millie. That's it. I caught up now I'm three
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.660]   and two tied with Chema.
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.340]   Last one.
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.380]   Last one. Okay.
[00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.220]   It must be our objective now to help achieve a ceasefire and
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.780]   negotiate a peace rather than protract the conflict.
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.500]   Hmm. Wow. It's so formal.
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.180]   Millie.
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.500]   So formal. It feels like somebody said that on the steps
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.260]   of like a building outside. It's very formal. It's well
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.580]   spoken. It's crisp. Can we hear it one more time? May we hear it
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.100]   one more time?
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.500]   It must be our objective now to help achieve a ceasefire and
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.220]   negotiate a peace rather than protract the conflict.
[00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.460]   Millie. It's a little too formal for a podcast. But in a tweet,
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.540]   it wouldn't be so it could be a sex tweet, but I'm thinking so
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.420]   pocket. I gotta go Millie. I gotta go Millie.
[00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.220]   sacks.
[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.620]   You can't tell Millie from sacks is what we've learned. What a
[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.980]   great game. Right now we're gonna play the next game. This
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:54.060]   is called Bernie Madoff or SP Bernie Madoff or SP
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:16.700]   Alright, everybody, welcome to the all in pod with us again,
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.100]   the dictator in a beautiful purple sweater sweater, Karen,
[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.900]   man, it's the fall season. So the triggering will be inside
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.660]   the inside of this is suede. Oh, very nice. Very nice. So
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.020]   multiple animals killed. I mean, your pleasure. Yeah. All
[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.260]   right. What animal do they kill to make suede? Like a type of
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.260]   leather or what is that? I hope it's an endangered one.
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.020]   Actually, that version of sway that he's wearing is from a
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.180]   white rhino. So they just take the hide and they throw
[00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.820]   everything else away. Oh my god. So
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:59.460]   can we take this out of the show? These are ivory buttons.
[00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.180]   I think it's baby seal fur around the
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.900]   how many baby seals were killed to make your outfit?
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.780]   Right? Also with us is the Sultan of Science, David
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.700]   freeberg racing from the airport. How was a jet blue
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.420]   mint? I heard you upgraded to mint. No comment.
[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.780]   What you don't want to talk about the $1200 upgrade you did
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.140]   to your jet blue ticket. You don't want to talk about jet
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.620]   blue mint. Why? Are you embarrassed to fly commercial?
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.660]   What did you eat?
[00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.660]   Are you embarrassed to fly J cow? Yeah.
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:39.180]   I'm the president. I'm like, hold on mint coming through.
[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.780]   Then I start spreading out. I think Jake out classes like the
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.820]   seat by the bathroom.
[00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:49.220]   In the back. Hey, did you save 150 bucks each way? What is jet
[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.980]   blue mint the name of like jet blue mint is their first class?
[00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:57.980]   Coast to coast. It is so delightful. They just have
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.580]   figured out a way to make like sleeper seats, you know, that
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.580]   are very nice. And that's great. upgraded service where they they
[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.980]   put like a little wall between you and everybody else. It's
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.620]   kind of like having a private plane if you didn't and sax is
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.340]   here. The whole cruise here basically. We'll have a surprise
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.420]   bestie guestie jumping in in the middle of this. I'm not gonna
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.220]   tell you who will because nothing's going on this way.
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.300]   Nothing is going on this week. I mean, there's so much to talk
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.700]   about. Let's just start with the elections. And then we have to
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.580]   start with my mayor culpa. Usually this is like throwing
[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.500]   red meat to sacks. But I mean, at this point, alright, so
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.580]   DeSantis won by double digits in Florida, he got a huge amount of
[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.220]   the vote, but all the Trump high profile Trump back candidates
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:41.220]   seem to have lost Dr. Oz, Dan Cox, just, it was a shellacking,
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.140]   I guess, or the red wave became like a puddle, or like an
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.220]   eyedropper or something. But some of the Trump back
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.900]   candidates did win some of the Peter Thiel collection, JD Vance
[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.420]   one. So I guess that's a big win for Trump candidate, though,
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.100]   because if you remember when Trump went to stump for JD
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.860]   Vance, he forgot his name.
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.020]   So when you're on your side, you don't need friends.
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.460]   Anybody that Trump actually cared about, turned out to be
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.940]   just a complete dud and lost. And everybody that kind of, you
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.900]   know, had to keep him somewhat around just so that he didn't
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:21.660]   throw bombs actually did decently. But I mean, Trump is
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.900]   a just a weight on the neck of the Republican Party. And it's
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.500]   time to just get rid of them.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.100]   Saks, what happened? Your red wave?
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.500]   Yeah, listen, I got this wrong. I think there's a few reasons
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.140]   for it. So I think when you get an election wrong, you have to
[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.660]   admit it and figure out what you've what you what your
[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.620]   mistake was. Otherwise, you're not going to improve. I mean,
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.940]   number one, I was looking at, you know, the RCP polling this
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.740]   real clear politics where they take an average of all the
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.220]   different polls, they were adding a factor to it, they were
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.340]   showing, by the way, plus three or plus four in the Senate for
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.340]   Republicans. But they were adding a factor to it based on
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.340]   the underweighting that the pollsters did in the last
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.580]   election cycle. And it turns out that the pollsters I think did a
[00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.780]   pretty decent job correcting their polls. And so the RCP
[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.900]   overweight turned out to be just basically completely wrong. The
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.300]   other thing that I got wrong was I was looking at the
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.620]   fundamentals. I mean, three quarters of Americans think
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.860]   we're on the wrong track. And we're in a recession. So based
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:22.020]   on that, you would think that this would be a great year for
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:26.140]   Republicans. And in fact, the out of power party usually wins
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.900]   in a midterm and Biden's popularity is at historic lows
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:35.260]   at like 41 42%. So everything was teed up for the Republicans.
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.100]   So what went wrong, I think a couple of things. Number one,
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.060]   two days before the election, Trump basically comes out and
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:44.100]   pre announces that he's running. Oh, yeah. You know, this
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.060]   basically plays into the narrative that has already
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.220]   created that this is a, this is not a referendum on Biden. It's
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.580]   a referendum on democracy. And basically, Trump made it into a
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.180]   choice election, who do you like better Biden or Trump. And the
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.980]   fact of the matter is, if you look at the exit polling, as
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:04.740]   unpopular as Biden is, Trump is even more unpopular. So that did
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.580]   absolutely nothing to help the Republicans. And I think it
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.380]   really hurt them at the margins. The other thing that turned out
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.060]   I think the other big thing that helped Democrats was Dobbs. And
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.700]   I never thought that it wouldn't be a factor. But if you looked
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:21.460]   at the polling before the election, 15% of likely voters
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.860]   said that it was their number one issue. If you looked at exit
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.700]   polling, after the election, it was 28%. So Dobbs turned out to
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.700]   be twice as significant as what the early polling was showing.
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.140]   And if you remember, Jason, go back to the episode we did on
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.940]   abortion. I said the shrewd play for Republicans here was the
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.660]   Roberts compromise. What did Roberts want to do, he basically
[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:44.300]   was going to allow the 15 week restriction on abortion, but not
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:48.940]   have the headline of Roe v. Wade overturned. And that basically
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.820]   is what to Santa's implemented in Florida, he basically
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.900]   restricted abortion after 15 weeks. It's the purple state
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.260]   compromise. It's where I think the purple states and where most
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.380]   of the country's going to end up. And the sooner Republicans
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.140]   get their heads wrapped around that fact, the better they're
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.420]   going to be long term.
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.420]   Yes, you one question there, sex. Who stacked the Supreme
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.180]   Court deliberately to turn over Roe v. Wade?
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:15.060]   Listen, I mean, there, this was a long term priority of
[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:15.620]   Republicans.
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.300]   That's not a question.
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.340]   Well, no, we do have to recognize that Trump said he
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.540]   would do that he did it. So this is doubly Trump's fault.
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.540]   Every party nominates justices that align with their values
[00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:26.580]   have been in cycles.
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.820]   And he's going Trump said he would specifically do it in
[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.980]   order to know what the president doesn't choose who dies in the
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.220]   Supreme Court and when? Yeah, right.
[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.780]   Yeah, it's also more complicated than that. Because what this
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.060]   Dobbs decision did is throw the issue back to the states. And
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.460]   the fact of the matter is that now it's up to each of these
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.460]   states to determine where they're going to come out on
[00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.980]   this issue. So if you look at there were ballot initiatives in
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:56.900]   red states like Kansas, and like Kentucky, Kentucky, that's
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.980]   right. That's what I'm saying is there are pro life ballot
[00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:02.780]   initiatives in red states that lost and so you can see all
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:06.100]   over the country that the Republicans tried to go too far,
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.180]   or they do try to go too far when they try to impose a total
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:13.380]   ban. Yeah, it seems to be popular. Is this what I'm saying
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.540]   is the purple state compromise. It's what DeSantis did in
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.620]   Florida. It seems like most of the country we talked about this
[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.300]   on that episode. Yeah, most of the countries in the messy
[00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:26.700]   middle, they want abortion to be safe, legal, rare and early.
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.820]   They're willing to support it in say the first 15 weeks. But then
[00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.140]   after that, there needs to be some restrictions that I'm
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.340]   saying most of the country supports that. Now, it's also
[00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:40.180]   the case that Democrats though, are staking out a pretty extreme
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.780]   position too, because most of the Democrats were taking the
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:46.180]   position that abortion should be legal up into the ninth month,
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.580]   which is not even that's more radical than even row, row said
[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:53.060]   that you can restrict it after 23 weeks. So you know, what we
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.940]   said on that podcast, Jason was the party that gets the middle
[00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:59.100]   first on this issue is the one that's going to do well just
[00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:02.260]   this issue. Yeah. And I think yes, I think it's true on this.
[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.500]   And I think it's true on other things. So look, I think the
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:08.500]   Republicans can correct here pretty easily. If they listen to
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:13.500]   folks like DeSantis and young Ken and camp, people who
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.180]   understand that they have there's a compromise here. And
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:20.500]   the ones who basically insist on pushing a total ban are going to
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.380]   go down in flames.
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.820]   There's a couple of things I think that are worth looking at
[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.560]   now that we have all the exit polling and the results. The
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:34.860]   Democrats strategy of helping to promote these extremist MAGA
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.660]   candidates in the primaries turned out to be a huge winning
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.780]   strategy because every single one that they helped put up
[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:45.580]   against the Democrat, the Democrats won. But number two,
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:49.740]   so what that shows is the extreme right cannot field a
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:53.940]   winning candidate. But on the other side, all of these extreme
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:58.700]   left leaning Democrats also did not do very well either. And so
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.660]   you're back to David, what you said, which is we have been
[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:05.180]   saying for a while, the winning strategy is that messy middle.
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:08.860]   It's the moderate person that kind of like tax to the center.
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.340]   And this is what you see everywhere around the country,
[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.340]   all of the battle ballot initiatives, every time you had
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:19.100]   an extremist ballot initiative, whether it was a complete ban on
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.900]   abortion in a red state, or whether it was a tax, the rich
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.980]   policy in a blue state, they failed. And so I think the
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.940]   message that you have to take away is the extreme left doesn't
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.460]   work. The extreme right doesn't work. Right. If you look at, for
[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:37.020]   example, like Kathy Hockel almost lost in New in New York
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:41.220]   State, because of who because of like AOC and all of that
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:45.580]   extremist progressive rank and file of that party. So people
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.300]   need to really understand and look at the data on the ground.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.860]   If you want to win in 24, you got to be in the middle and you
[00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.740]   got to clean up all this extremist rhetoric,
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:57.140]   Freiburg, any thoughts? I think the Georgia Senate runoff race
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:02.740]   that we had in the 2020 election, cost the US $10
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:07.300]   trillion. And I think it because if you'll remember, that was the
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:12.060]   race that when the Democrats won, tip the power in Senate to
[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.460]   the Democrats, and all this legislation for the last two
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:19.500]   years was passed, including a lot of the fiscal stimulus and
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.100]   spending that very likely may have faced significantly more
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:27.060]   opposition than could have been faced, where the Democrats have
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:31.820]   the White House, and the Senate in the house. And so that single
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.700]   seat and the loss of that seat in the runoff to the Democrat
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:41.980]   Party, I think ended up allowing a lot of loose behavior over the
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.340]   last two years, that's going to cost this country for a very
[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:48.340]   long time. And in part, perhaps we could argue a lot of the
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.980]   inflationary pressure. And now the debt load, the US debt load
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.460]   increasing by $10 trillion in the last two years since that
[00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:58.100]   election, by the way. And so I think one of the most important
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:02.540]   things that perhaps people don't cognizantly recognize, but feel
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.740]   in some way, is that having a balance of power is really
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.860]   important in this country. And so to some degree, while there
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.340]   may be issues that folks can argue about disagree about,
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:15.220]   there may be candidates that are vile to us, I think ultimately,
[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.300]   folks are recognizing the benefit and the value and having
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:22.460]   a good legislative debate and a good check and balance in this
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:26.060]   country. And so I think there's a lot of what Saks is saying
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:29.140]   that ties into that kind of emotional conditioning that's
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.580]   probably underway. Okay, Saks, Trump said he was going to
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.180]   announce he went after to Santa's called him to
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.900]   sanctimonious. Obviously, the Trump endorsements here didn't
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:43.060]   help. Roe v. Wade didn't help the situation. What is going to
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:47.180]   happen here? Is the Republican Party finally going to cut ties?
[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:51.060]   Because they want to start winning? Or is Trump going to
[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.900]   just announce next week and cause massive chaos? What's
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.900]   going to happen in the Republican Party in the coming
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.700]   weeks? Because we're 14 months away from Iowa, right? I mean,
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:02.380]   this is so now the next issue, the question comes down to do
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.180]   Republicans want to start winning elections? Yes or no.
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.140]   And freeberg brought up the right point in the last
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:11.060]   election cycle. He's right that the reason why we got 10
[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:14.860]   trillion dollars of unnecessary spending is because of that
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.740]   Georgia runoff seat, we're about to have another one where Purdue
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.700]   won that seat on election night. And then we're not wanting in
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.500]   the runoff. Why did things go against Purdue? Because Trump
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.980]   had a six week hissy fit. After the election, the Georgia
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:32.180]   runoff happened on January 5. And then all culminated in the
[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:36.460]   ride on January 6. So the fact of the matter is Trump has been
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:40.180]   having this extended hissy fit and living in denial since the
[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:44.580]   loss in 2020. And as a result of that, we lost the Georgia
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:47.900]   runoff, I think we did worse than we had to in this midterm,
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.340]   I think we're going to lose the Georgia runoff again, if Trump
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:53.540]   continues with these antics. And so it really comes down to
[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.980]   Republicans, do you want to win? And look, I know that there's
[00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:01.380]   call it 40% of the country passionately loves Trump. But
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:05.220]   here's the problem. He's capped at 40%. Independents and
[00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:08.340]   moderates, centrists will not give the guy another look. And
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.620]   so you cannot win a major national election in this
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:15.620]   country with 40% of the vote, no matter how passionate that 40%
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:19.820]   is, you know what 40% is 40% is Charlie quest, the guy who
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:24.260]   distances beat who wiped out in Florida, that was a 6040
[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:28.660]   election. That is what a 40% of the electorate looks like
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:34.140]   landslide. It's a landslide. Exactly. So the bottom line is
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.580]   that who your messenger is in politics is incredibly
[00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.380]   important. And Trump just gives his enemies way too much to work
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.100]   with. Now, if he weren't a Republican, it might be
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.420]   different. Take Federman, for example, okay, this guy
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.500]   Federman, okay, he's being portrayed as this man of the
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.220]   people. He's got the goatee and the, the tattoos and the hoodie
[00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.460]   or whatever. Who is he really? He's a trust fund kid who never
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.780]   had a job until his mid 40s. But the press completely gives him a
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.860]   pass on that they would never do that for Republican and Federman
[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:05.980]   were Republican, the press would expose him in two seconds. Now,
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.420]   that's a complaint. But the fact of the matter is Republicans
[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.980]   just have to accept it. These are the rules of the game. If
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.940]   you're a Republican candidate for office, you have to be
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.700]   perfect. You have to be focused, you have to be disciplined, you
[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:19.060]   have to be to Santa's, you cannot give your opponents
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:22.900]   something unnecessary to work with every fight to Santa's picks
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.420]   has been a smart fight that he's won. And same thing with Glenn
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.420]   young kid as well. He doesn't give his opponents things to
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.220]   work with. And unless Republicans realize that these
[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.340]   are the kinds of candidates we need to nominate in this media
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.500]   environment, we're going to keep losing elections.
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:40.740]   Yeah. Tomas, any final thoughts here? As we wrap up election,
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:43.820]   I'm going to DC next week doing the rounds. High five and
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.460]   slapping. Yeah, just to finish the thought. One other quote
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.420]   from New Hampshire Governor Kristin Nunez, who's kind of a,
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.580]   he's a Republican who's been in spats with Trump. He said,
[00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:57.900]   Listen, the message of this election is first fix crazy,
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:02.660]   then fix policy. If you're coming across like you're crazy,
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:06.540]   their voters will reject you. Now, that doesn't mean you can't
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:10.060]   stand for principle. Rhonda Santa says that Florida is where
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.980]   woke goes to die. He says we will fight woke in the
[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.140]   boardrooms will fight in the classrooms. This is certainly
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:17.260]   not a liberal position. These are pretty conservative
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.020]   positions he's taking, but he does it in a calculated
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:20.940]   disciplined way.
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:26.340]   I'll say this right now. He is a winning candidate. And the
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:30.620]   scale of Reagan, if the Democrats also don't figure out
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.660]   how to clean up their act, because the other message that's
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:38.020]   so interesting, that I took away is the legislative agenda that
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:42.860]   works is actually what Biden has always believed. The problem
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.940]   is that Biden seems to get distracted or confused or
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:49.860]   hijacked by the left wing of his party. And they introduced all
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.420]   these unbelievably crazy iterations of progressive policy
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:57.100]   that just are not popular, even in blue states, just look at the
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:02.900]   number of bills that failed. So he also has to fix what he's
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:03.700]   doing, by the way,
[00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:07.940]   it's he doesn't think that could fail the US judge in Texas. I'm
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:11.580]   not sure you can tell me if this is legit or, or not.
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:14.260]   No, they stayed that we should talk about that in the context
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:15.340]   of the economy, actually.
[00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.740]   That was predictable. That was predictable that the college
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.380]   loans thrown out is completely unconstitutional for a president
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.460]   to spend half a trillion dollars without Congress's approval.
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.980]   capital on Jamal's point here to Santa's one Miami Dade County,
[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:31.620]   which went for Hillary by 30 points, okay, he showed that a
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:37.260]   competent executive a an energetic, youthful operator who
[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:41.260]   actually runs the state well, okay, can win over moderate
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.900]   house and independents and Democrats. Now he's a winner.
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.860]   These are the types of candidates Republicans are. Yeah,
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:49.300]   he's a winner. He's a winner. We got a call breaking in here. We
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.740]   have a special bestie guest. He knows it's been a big newsweek.
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.380]   It's not just the elections, FTX, crypto exchange went belly
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.900]   up. And we thought, well, let's bring somebody in who's super
[00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:01.300]   credible in crypto. And that's friend of the pod. He's credible
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.660]   because he's wearing a tie. Yeah. Hey, Brian Armstrong. How
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.100]   are you doing? Brian Armstrong? You look fantastic. What are you
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.460]   testifying today? I'm doing great. It's not it's not Mon
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:14.620]   Claire. And it's not Laura Piana. But normally, I just I
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:17.580]   just wear the black t shirt and the hoodie. But you know, when
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.420]   times like this, I got to go talk to media policymakers,
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.940]   regulators, and it's a it's a good time to, you know, spruce
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:27.180]   up the image. This is a week to break out the tie. Yeah. Hey,
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:29.660]   listen, men's warehouse. It never looked better. You look
[00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.100]   great. Thank you. I see a red tie. And I think fiscally
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:32.780]   responsible.
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:40.460]   I guess Brian just to kick it off. FTX in spectacular fashion
[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:43.980]   blew up this week. And it's pretty gnarly. You run an
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:47.180]   exchange as well. What's your take on what happened with FTX?
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.620]   And then what is your position in terms of making sure your
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.660]   customers understand that Coinbase is not going to have a
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.020]   similar fate to all the other exchanges that seem to be
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.780]   blowing up every couple of months? Yeah.
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.900]   Well, first of all, I mean, I think we were all shocked that
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:05.260]   somebody like Sam, who seemingly is so smart and and capable,
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.860]   ended up in this really the situation where he appears to
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.620]   have done something quite unethical and illegal. So you
[00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:14.860]   know, my job right now this week has been to go out there and
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.140]   just help people understand that Coinbase is not like that we've
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.500]   been pursuing a different strategy for the last 10 years.
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:24.220]   We're a public company, we're we're regulated, our financial
[00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.060]   statements are audited, they can show that, you know, customer
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.620]   funds are segregated, they're backed one to one, we're not
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.140]   investing customer assets without their explicit
[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.980]   direction. And so that's been the first step is just to make
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.180]   sure people understand that. But then after that, we need to kind
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.900]   of think about how we go forward as an industry here and both
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.220]   take a long term perspective, make sure the good companies in
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.340]   the space aren't allowing one or two bad actors to kind of mess
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.660]   it up for everybody else. And it feeds into the whole regulatory
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:54.780]   story too, because companies like Coinbase are already
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.900]   regulated, but we're regulated like a traditional financial
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.540]   service business. But we don't have clarity about the crypto
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.940]   specific regulations, like what's a commodity, what's the
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:06.540]   security. And that lack of regulatory clarity, I believe
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.100]   has pushed a lot of this business offshore to these less
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.820]   regulated exchanges. That's part of what caused the blow up
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:15.220]   today. They were based in the Bahamas, you know, and they just
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.740]   there's not sophisticated financial regulators overseeing
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:18.460]   what they were doing.
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:23.780]   Brian, there's a lot to unpack. But maybe we can just take a
[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.940]   step back and for the uninitiated, or for the person
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:30.660]   who's only been just following this very superficially, can you
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.860]   just in a nutshell, explain what happened?
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:37.420]   Yeah, so my understanding is, and again, this is from people
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.420]   I've talked to, and I spoke with Sam and CVC briefly during this,
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.340]   but I didn't get details from them. I got it from other
[00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:45.340]   people. You spoke to them this week. Yeah, I mean, this was all
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:48.340]   going down. I mean, I spoke to Sam about, you know, he was
[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:51.220]   trying to raise emergency financing and things like that.
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:54.300]   And I spoke to CZ about why he was considering buying the asset.
[00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:58.620]   I thought it was a bad idea. But my understanding what happened
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.860]   at this point, again, I don't have all the facts. This is just
[00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:05.900]   my understanding is that, you know, FTX was in a position
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:09.580]   where they had this market maker Alameda that was investing in
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.100]   risky things. And that's fine, like market makers, hedge funds,
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.580]   they're designed to take more risk. It appears at this point
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:19.180]   that back during the last shakeup in the crypto industry,
[00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:22.740]   where you know, Terra Luna and Voyager and Celsius and three
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:26.620]   arrows went under, it appears that Alameda took a big loss at
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:30.420]   that time as well. They may have even been underwater. And instead
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.140]   of just saying, Hey, you know, this hedge funds gonna blow up
[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:35.060]   to which would have been unfortunate people would have,
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.260]   you know, Sam would have lost money. It's embarrassing, but
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.780]   it's not illegal for a hedge fund to blow up. It happens with
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:44.180]   some regularity. Instead of just letting it blow up. It seems
[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:46.860]   like at this point, he took customer funds,
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.060]   but you have to explain he also he owns both. That's for the
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:53.580]   people that may not understand that. Right. So it's a related
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.620]   related parts. He owns his own exchange called FT x and he owns
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.180]   his own hedge fund called Alameda,
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:01.780]   which operates inside of FT x as well as in other places, right.
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:06.500]   But again, Alameda seems to have blown up. Sorry, Brian, back to
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:11.140]   you. Yeah, so it seems that they had this solvency issue. And
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:14.060]   instead of just letting it blow up, Sam basically said, Hey, we
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:17.340]   have a bunch of customer assets over here at FT x, or he somehow
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:21.660]   basically made a loan from FT x into Alameda to try to prop it
[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:24.900]   up. I don't know why he did that. I mean, that that's the
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.540]   moment in my mind where he crossed the line into probably
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:31.660]   committing fraud. And I think he probably lied to users lied to
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.820]   investors. And he went around and tried to bail out these
[00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:38.100]   different companies like like Voyager and BlockFi and to sort
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:41.260]   of prop up this thing and maybe he thought he could trade his
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:44.500]   way out of it or something. I'm not sure. But that seems to be
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:45.900]   where the mistake was made.
[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:49.340]   Brian, can I ask one question, which I which I think will help
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:52.860]   frame the contagion risk set of questions that everyone's
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:56.220]   having. When people have an asset, we all talk about
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.620]   customer deposits and customer assets held at these exchanges.
[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:03.260]   But those assets and those deposits are very often some
[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.980]   form of coin, I have some amount of Bitcoin, some amount of
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:10.100]   ether, some amount of something else. Is it the case that there
[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:15.300]   is an assumption of total asset value that's held in a in a
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:18.980]   portfolio of coins that doesn't necessarily match the
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:23.380]   individual users accounts. And then when one coin goes down in
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:27.060]   value nominally to dollars, that the whole value of the portfolio
[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.580]   goes down, and now you can't actually make the customers
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:33.540]   whole. So in the statements that have been made by these guys and
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:37.660]   other exchanges, that we have enough liquidity to cover
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:40.740]   customers accounts, that the assumption might be we have
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:43.940]   enough liquidity, if you assume the current market price for a
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:47.300]   whole bunch of different coins. But then if one coin tanks, the
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.780]   total liquidity tanks, and they don't actually have it matched
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:52.380]   up correctly, because now the customer account value didn't go
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:56.580]   down as much as the exchange of the total asset value. Does that
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.700]   make sense? And is that part of the contagion risk that's going
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:02.940]   on here is that they're not matched truly between customer
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:06.220]   accounts, and the exchanges, you know, holding of coins.
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:09.580]   So not exactly. Okay, so if you're a regulated financial
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:13.100]   service business, that's but you're not a bank, you know,
[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.500]   we're regulated as a trust company, a money transmitter,
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:19.220]   etc. You're required to hold customer assets one for one,
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:22.660]   information omitted in the the asset. So in other words, if you
[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:25.420]   say you the customer has one Bitcoin, you have to hold one
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:28.780]   Bitcoin, if they say they have $100, you have to hold $100. And
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.820]   so that's the case with Coinbase. You don't have to take
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:33.140]   our word for it. By the way, you can look at our audited public
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:36.140]   financial statements as a public company with an independent, you
[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.540]   know, big four accounting firm who went to go verify all of
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:42.300]   that. And that's what various custodians and exchanges, that's
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.700]   what they all should be doing. If by the way, if you're
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.500]   regulated as a bank, you can actually go invest some of
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.900]   those, but there's very strict regulation around that and
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.220]   capital requirements and whatnot. And we're not a bank.
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:56.740]   So we hold one to one. Now, if you're an investment fund, or a
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:00.300]   hedge fund, or or something like that, then you can try to take
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.300]   positions in different coins and different assets, and they could
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.140]   go up and they could go down, you know, you may you may lose
[00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:08.660]   your investors money, but there's no such thing as the
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:13.220]   customer assets being involved in that there needs to be clear
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:16.940]   segregation of those customer funds. And from from what an
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.700]   investment fund would be or corporate funds. And that's
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:22.380]   where they got in trouble. They basically co mingled customer
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.100]   funds with their hedge fund.
[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:27.020]   Classic. Can you explain the contagion, by the way, just so
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:29.300]   we can, because everyone's been talking about the contagion and
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.980]   understanding what's next. So that's what I just want to Yeah,
[00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.700]   because I think people are gonna be asking that a lot this
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:34.060]   weekend.
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:37.300]   Yeah, so I do think there's there is some contagion risk
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:40.700]   here. I think there's other firms that had, first of all,
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.060]   there's firms that had money just sitting in FTX. And that's
[00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:45.620]   now going through bankruptcy court. So that's been bad. I
[00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:47.860]   mean, multi coin came out publicly and said that they had
[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:52.580]   10% of their portfolio sorted on FTX. There's other firms that
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:57.780]   Alameda may have had loans with. And those firms are probably
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:01.180]   struggling. I, you know, I don't want to say who, but we have
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:04.060]   received a couple of inbound calls from other people trying
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:06.980]   to get emergency financing. There's people who may have just
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:10.300]   totally different from FTX and Alameda, they may have just had
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:13.260]   their own portfolio that they took margin or leverage on to
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.300]   buy crypto. And now as the prices have come down a little
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:19.500]   bit, they're getting stopped out. So that's all been very
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:22.260]   challenging. And I again, just for the sake of clarity, I
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:25.260]   should say that Coinbase did not have any material exposure to
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.620]   Alameda, FTX or FTT token.
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.540]   Can we just talk about this issue of customer deposits,
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:32.060]   because this is really the crux of the issue from a legal
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:34.900]   standpoint, right? I mean, I remember when I was doing PayPal
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:38.340]   like 22 years ago, and the company was like six months away
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.260]   from running out of money. I remember the lawyers told us
[00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:44.140]   really clearly, you cannot use customer deposits to fund the
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.820]   operating expenses of your business. In other words, if
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:49.540]   this business ends up going bankrupt, you'll still have all
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.180]   the customer money there and they'll be able to get it back.
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:54.660]   And you know, it was really clear, like, hey, if you use
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:58.260]   customer funds to pay for the burn of the business to operate
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:02.860]   the business, that is a do not pass go go directly to jail type
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:06.540]   offense. And so like, that's really the heart of this. Now, I
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:11.220]   read in some articles covering this, that the way it worked, is
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:17.180]   that Alameda had a bunch of these FTT or these FTX FTF
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:21.020]   called FTT. And they basically use that as like a marker as
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:24.900]   collateral. So they basically borrowed, what is it like 6
[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:29.700]   billion of customer funds from FTX, and then they use their own
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:33.820]   token to then as collateral. So I'd stop it. Yeah, exactly. And
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:38.660]   then what happened is apparently like CZ got wind of this, and he
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.980]   owned a whole bunch of these tokens. And he signaled that he
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:44.580]   was going to dump it and the price basically went down. And
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:47.420]   so now all of a sudden, the collateral for the customer
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:50.540]   loans was insufficient. And then there was a run on the bank. And
[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:52.740]   by the way, this has happened. This happens in the public
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:55.660]   markets a lot as well. So like when you see heavily shorted
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:58.700]   names, or when you know that certain hedge funds are on the
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:03.420]   brink, other hedge funds will go in and essentially force a
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:06.180]   margin call and a stop out because then it's what causes
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:08.860]   all of these runs. And if you look actually inside a GameStop,
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:12.260]   the reason why you got all this gamification in the GameStock
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.860]   equity and a bunch of these other names was in part because
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:19.180]   of this dynamic folks that are highly levered folks that don't
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:24.260]   have the right matching of risk. And what happens is they're
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:29.980]   solvent, but a liquid. And then if you run the instrument into
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:33.900]   the ground, they both become insolvent and illiquid all at
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:39.020]   the same time. So Brian, the question is, now that we know
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:42.580]   what happened, which is all of these crazy inner party related
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:46.100]   transactions, and, you know, all of this stuff seems very
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:51.660]   illegal. There was a bankruptcy filing today. And up until
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:57.020]   today, it seemed like this issue was really about FTX International
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:02.700]   and Alameda and it didn't touch FTX us, which for a lot, a long
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:06.180]   time tried to position itself as, you know, well run and
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.220]   regulated as coinbase to be, you know, they tried to say that.
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:12.380]   But now if you look inside the Wall Street Journal, all the
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:15.180]   articles say that this is actually FTX group. So the whole
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:18.540]   thing seems to be imperiled. Can you just help us explain that
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:22.260]   because there now that's a lot of us people that were following
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.620]   the rules thinking that this thing was matched one to one
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:29.900]   that may be also affected? Yeah. So, look, I don't know who
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:33.980]   inside FTX is and its orbit of companies actually knew that the
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:38.260]   fraud had been taking place. I, it would not surprise me. I have
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:41.860]   no idea, to be honest, but it would not surprise me if FTX us
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.900]   people and employees had no idea that this was happening. I'm
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:47.820]   imagining if Sam was doing when he when he started doing this,
[00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:50.100]   he probably wanted to keep it to a very small group. Otherwise,
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.420]   this is the kind of thing that leaks and the whole thing blows
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:57.180]   up. Now, that being said, I don't necessarily think FTX us
[00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:00.180]   is worth anything as a business right now because of the brand
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:03.780]   being so tainted. And there probably was not great
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:07.420]   separation of these entities in the sense of, you know, like,
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:10.820]   did they have truly separate boards and beneficial owners and
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:15.940]   governance and it Sam seems to have, you know, it appears that
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:19.180]   they didn't FTX didn't really have a CFO or maybe even like a
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:23.380]   real board or anything like that. And so it's hard to match.
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:26.700]   We found on red, there was an article that appeared that said
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:30.740]   that the head of compliance at FTX was also the head of
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:34.420]   compliance at a poker site called ultimate bet, which in
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:38.740]   the 2010s, did this exact thing, apparently some version of this
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:42.260]   where they went in and they looked at whole cards of poker
[00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:45.300]   players. And then a few employees inside the business
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:47.540]   would basically play against these folks knowing what the
[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:51.180]   whole cards were, ran this cheat stole millions of dollars.
[00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:55.780]   Somehow that person found a way to be head of compliance at FTX
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:59.460]   Yeah, 10 years later, which is incredible. But back to this
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:02.300]   question. So So now what happens now is you have the
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:06.180]   international business, and the US business and Alameda research
[00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:11.660]   all rolled up into this one frozen entity, right? With now
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:14.780]   regulators having to so do you know what happens in a process
[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:18.940]   like this? Like, is it that the DOJ and the SEC get priority?
[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:23.300]   Or is there some international monetary like who, who's who
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:27.300]   unwinds all of this? How do people get their money back if
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:27.820]   at all?
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.900]   Yeah, so I'm not an expert at this. But my high level
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.460]   understanding is that the bankruptcy courts will
[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:36.380]   essentially, and I believe they filed bankruptcy in the US,
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:38.500]   which is an interesting thing. I didn't know why they did that
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.700]   versus Bahamas. But anyway, the bankruptcy court will basically
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:45.220]   go through and try to find any assets of value. So I mean, they
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:48.020]   must they still have some tokens and value, they have a venture
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:52.060]   portfolio, they you know, I think Sam owns 9% of Robin Hood,
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:54.620]   there's various things that they may own. And then they'll kind
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:57.980]   of auction those off to various bidders on distressed assets,
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.940]   and then try to distribute those funds to the customers. I don't
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:02.580]   know the exact process beyond that, though.
[00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:05.340]   I mean, if you remember the Madoff, wind down took many
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:08.980]   years. And for years, he was trying to find assets, and then
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.380]   he found a market sold them. There's this the trustee, I
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:14.380]   think he's still active. And then, you know, it's tried to
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.100]   redistribute the funds, obviously, so many more
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.740]   customers here than there was with Madoff. But it can be a
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:21.980]   very long and winding process to identify all the assets, then
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:24.900]   run the market sale process on them, then figure out who gets
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.820]   what first, and then distribute.
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.660]   There was an interesting thing that Larry Summers did, I think
[00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:34.020]   for Bloomberg, where he was asked whether this was Lehman or
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:38.380]   Enron. And he said, it seems more like an Enron than it is a
[00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:41.420]   Lehman. And Brian, I'm just curious how you think about it.
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:44.540]   Like, is this sort of a fraud perpetuated by a group of
[00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:49.420]   executives to essentially take advantage of a situation? Or do
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:52.020]   you think that this is more like a Lehman situation, which is a
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:55.620]   well run business, I guess that just, you know, got caught in a
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:56.540]   liquidity trap?
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:36:00.940]   I think it's my guess is it's a little more like Enron in the
[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:03.340]   sense that I mean, yes, they were over levered and that kind
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:07.140]   of thing. But the minute that they moved customer funds in
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:11.340]   some way, shape or form to backstop the hedge fund that that
[00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:14.820]   was, in my mind, fraud. And you know, that's more like Enron.
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.940]   Do you think now that we have to open the gates on regulation,
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:21.140]   like the whole point of crypto in some ways was, you know,
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:26.540]   trust nobody. And, you know, decentralization is the key. But
[00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:30.380]   here, what we see is a lot of people were tricked into trusting
[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:34.300]   FTX and having their deposits there. And it was a centralized
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:37.140]   exchange, which caused all these problems. So it's like, it
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.860]   almost violates the principles of what the whole product market
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:45.180]   fit was supposed to be. So what what should sort of the observer
[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:48.380]   expect? And what do you expect as a business in terms of how
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.460]   governments now react to all of this?
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:54.180]   Yeah, I think it's really important to distinguish between
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:56.900]   the centralized players in crypto, which are custodians,
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:00.860]   exchanges, etc. Coinbase has a big business there. And the
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:03.940]   decentralized players, which are, you know, self custodial
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:08.820]   wallets, defy protocols, web three, that whole world. So the
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:12.740]   centralized players should be regulated. And today, they're
[00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:15.300]   regulated already, like, like kind of traditional financial
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:19.140]   service businesses. But they don't have the regulation clear
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.740]   when it comes to the crypto aspects. So for instance, in the
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.260]   US, we actually don't still have clarity about what is a
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:27.500]   commodity, what's the security? Should which one should CFTC
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.500]   regulator versus SEC, that kind of thing. And that lack of
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:34.660]   regulatory clarity, and frankly, the the climate of regulation by
[00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:37.580]   enforcement, the negative rhetoric from you know, chair
[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:39.780]   guns, Lord in particular, has created this sort of chilling
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:42.820]   effect in the US that has pushed a lot of that centralized
[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:47.580]   actors activity offshore. In fact, 95% of the trading volume
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:50.140]   in crypto is now outside the United States. And it's come
[00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:53.340]   down a lot since the beginning of this year, even now, the
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:56.420]   decentralized players, self custodial wallets, defy web
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:59.860]   three. This is where crypto really has an opportunity to
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:03.780]   make a more fair and free and transparent system because you
[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:06.340]   can go look at any smart contract to see exactly what
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:09.460]   it's doing. Anybody can audit the code. If you have a self
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:11.940]   custodial wallet, you can just trust yourself, you don't have
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:15.540]   to trust any other into intermediary out there. And
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:18.540]   that's where you get true decentralization. And I think
[00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:21.900]   that's actually now those areas still have a couple of their own
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.780]   challenges. You know, sometimes people will lose their password
[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:27.020]   or their phone, and they'll lose their own money. So if you're
[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:29.620]   if you're trusting yourself, you still have the you have to trust
[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:31.700]   you know, that you're going to do that piece correctly. But
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:34.180]   there's a lot of good things we can do there around making
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:37.100]   social recovery mechanisms and NPC wallets and things like
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:40.980]   that. We remember just a couple of months ago, Gary Gensler
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:43.660]   started saying, Hey, these things are all securities. And
[00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:46.700]   you went and visit the SEC a couple years ago, or you try to
[00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:49.060]   they wouldn't meet with you. You were very public, you did a
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.460]   tweet storm. We talked about this on my other pod, that hey,
[00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:54.660]   like we want to meet, we want to talk about that. Now we're still
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:57.540]   in a position where the SEC is position is these are all
[00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:00.780]   securities, which means the anything that's trading, it
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:04.060]   would have to be limited to accredited investors, etc. What
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:07.260]   should the United States do here? And how close are we to
[00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:10.380]   getting clarity? Because I know you're trying to talk to the SEC
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:13.500]   directly about can we just get some clarity here? Can people
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:17.300]   buy these tokens or not? What is the status of Are they tokens?
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:19.940]   Are they securities? Or are they not here in the United States?
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:23.980]   Yeah. So luckily, since then, we have had a lot of productive
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:27.980]   dialogue with both the SEC and the CFTC and Treasury and all
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:31.340]   kinds of people in Congress. And I do think the US is making some
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.740]   steps in the right direction. There was actually there was a
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:36.820]   bill going through Congress recently called the DC CPA or
[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:39.420]   the stab now Bozeman bill. Although it's having some
[00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:43.260]   challenges now, frankly, due to this FTX blow up because SBF was
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:45.820]   one of the people sort of pushing that bill forward. But
[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:49.500]   regardless of that, the sort of system that we should have is
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.380]   there should be a clear designation between what is a
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:56.980]   crypto commodity, and that can be regulated by the CFTC. And
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:59.980]   what is a crypto security? Now this is one of those legal, by
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:02.660]   the way, what is also a stable coin and artwork and other
[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:07.260]   things that are not any of those things. The challenge lies in
[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:10.620]   that there's kind of a fuzzy line between what is a commodity
[00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:14.020]   and what is a security and a lot of this law is based around the
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:17.780]   Howie test, which says a security is an investment in a
[00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:22.340]   common enterprise with an expectation of profit. And so
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:25.340]   it's basically a point based system. And in the absence of
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:28.100]   really getting a clear list between the CFTC and the SEC or
[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:30.860]   in this turf battle, I would love it if you know, they could
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:33.180]   basically put out a list, get their heads together and put out
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:36.620]   a list, hey, CFTC is going to do these SEC is going to do these a
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:38.860]   bunch maybe are in the middle, let's let the courts figure that
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:41.940]   out or whatever. But that just hasn't happened. And it's a it's
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:43.540]   a missed opportunity in the US.
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:47.420]   So if the Howie test is not perfect, given the dynamic
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:50.740]   nature of cryptocurrencies and all the innovation, if Brian
[00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:53.420]   Armstrong was going to say, hey, this is in the best interest of
[00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:57.780]   Americans, balancing, you know, some amount of security and
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:01.900]   safety for people making bets on this currency, and allowing
[00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:05.380]   innovation, what would you say is the best definition, the best
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:11.100]   way for us to regulate crypto coins, putting NF T's aside
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:12.420]   putting down site just specifically,
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:15.740]   hold on, let me just tweak your question. Sure, build on it,
[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:18.140]   because we because we should switch to SPF as well. And just
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:21.380]   talk about the person. But to me, it seems the whole issue if
[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:23.740]   you come back, like, what is the first string that you pulled
[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:27.340]   that unraveled the sweater was the fact that these tokens were
[00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:30.780]   created out of thin air, they had no meaningful value,
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:34.340]   somebody prescribed a value. And all of a sudden, everybody else
[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:36.540]   in the economy all of a sudden said, Yeah, I'll take that as
[00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:39.820]   collateral. Look, you cannot do that in the regular world. I
[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:43.300]   can't call JP Morgan and say, I've invented this thing. It's
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:47.460]   called a share in XYZ. And I'd like you to margin loan, you
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:50.620]   know, give me a loan against it. So Brian, explain like, there's
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:53.780]   a ton of these tokens that have been engineered, right? And
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.700]   there's been a ton of these tokens that have been sold. So
[00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:01.300]   what should people do that own these things thinking that there
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:05.260]   was going to be some safety or value or, you know, like, how do
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:07.780]   you think about all of these tokens that are that that could
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:12.420]   be as basically as as fragile and shitty and worthless as FTT?
[00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:15.900]   Hmm. Yeah, well, there, there is this concept of like an
[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.420]   exchange token, and there's a couple other firms out there
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:20.780]   that have them. And that's something we haven't done. And I
[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:24.100]   do, I think, I think you're right, like, the actual utility
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:26.420]   of those things is a little questionable. And so if
[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:30.260]   someone's going to sort of mark those up on a low supply, and
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:33.140]   then a low float, and then somehow leverage that, that
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.580]   that's going to get yourself into trouble. But look, I don't
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:37.740]   want to throw out the entire concept of people creating
[00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:41.060]   tokens, I think there's actually a lot of good stuff there. And
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:44.260]   it comes down to this idea of if you're trying to raise money for
[00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:47.740]   your company, and a token through a token, that's fine,
[00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:50.780]   that should be a security. And there should be a regulated way
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:54.220]   to do that in the US, like go register it with the SEC, you
[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:57.020]   know, let it trade on broker dealers. That's, that's what
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:59.820]   we've been wanting to do for a long time. And the SEC is taking
[00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:02.260]   their time getting there. They don't, you know, get into her to
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:05.860]   be honest, he doesn't seem that excited about the idea of this
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:09.500]   whole industry existing. And so anyway, but it should it should
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.460]   exist, and it should be happening in a regulated way. So
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:13.580]   if people want to issue a token that's raising money for a
[00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:16.860]   company, let's regulate it as a security. If they want to issue
[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:20.420]   a token that's truly on a decentralized protocol, or has
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:24.300]   some other purpose, like voting in a Dow or rewards or something
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:27.300]   like that, then that's probably not a security. And let's be
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.980]   honest about that and allow those things to trade in a
[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:31.820]   different environment, a different regulator under the
[00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:32.420]   CFTC,
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:34.260]   we're probably running out of time with you, because you said
[00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:36.700]   you had a hard stop. So let's ask the million dollar question,
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:41.420]   tell us about SPF. Like, what's who is this character? When did
[00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:44.220]   you first suspect? Yeah, what's your read on the psychology that
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:47.140]   this wasn't legit? Do you think that it was his altruistic
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:51.300]   intent, that allowed himself to convince himself to do this? Or
[00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:53.580]   do you think this was like malicious the whole way? Or
[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:54.780]   what's your sense of the guy?
[00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:58.540]   So again, I'm speculating here. I mean, I've spent time with
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:02.380]   I've met him a bunch of times. And I have to say, I did not see
[00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:06.420]   this coming. Like he, he appeared to me to be a very
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:10.340]   bright, credible, competent person, perhaps a bit young,
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:13.380]   perhaps, you know, a bit reckless at times, but not
[00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:17.740]   unethical and not not committing fraud. I definitely did not see
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:20.540]   that. You know, if I look back to see, were there any warning
[00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:24.100]   signs that I should have thought twice about it? You know, one of
[00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:27.980]   the things I noticed was that in 2021, you know, Coinbase had a
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:30.580]   good year, we did 7 billion in revenue for a billion of
[00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:33.820]   positive EBITDA, we went, we became public as a company. At
[00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:37.340]   that time, FTX did about 1 billion in revenue. And I knew
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:40.940]   how much money we had for our venture budget, and just like,
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:43.540]   different investments we wanted to make. And I knew their
[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:46.700]   revenue. And I had to scratch my head a bunch of times. And I was
[00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:49.780]   like, where is this guy getting all this liquidity? Because he
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:52.460]   was like buying 9% of Robin Hood, he was putting like a
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:54.580]   billion dollars into this, he was donating to all these
[00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:58.540]   politicians. And I was like, I, it did not make sense to me
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:00.660]   where he was getting all this cash, people just kept telling
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:03.820]   me, oh, his market maker Alameda is just printing cash. I guess
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:06.380]   like, okay, I guess, you know, it seems like a conflict of
[00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:08.340]   interest to own an exchange to market maker. That's why we
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:12.420]   haven't done it. But more power to him, I guess. And so I was
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:15.620]   surprised I didn't speak up. I cannot I can't explain the
[00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:18.820]   psychology of it at this point, whether he's a pathological
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:22.300]   liar, or if he's started off good, and somehow under the
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:26.180]   pressure of this whole thing went bad. But the minute you
[00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:28.420]   can, you can go watch the interviews, he's, he's, he's
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:32.940]   lying to people about why he's, he's, you know, bailing out
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:36.140]   Voyager and BlockFi. And he's saying, and he knew at that
[00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:39.260]   time that most likely he knew that at that time that they were
[00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:42.220]   not solvent Alameda was not solvent. And so that's where he
[00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:44.140]   crossed a major line in my book.
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:47.260]   And we see it time and time again, Elizabeth Holmes, Bernie
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:49.860]   Madoff, I mean, once the lie gets too big, you can't get out
[00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:53.580]   of it anymore. If that's the case, really incredible.
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:57.380]   And the most important thing at this point, Brian, is that the
[00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:01.860]   United States makes a decision on do we want to be in crypto?
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:04.260]   Do we want to have a say in this and create a regulatory
[00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:07.340]   framework that entrepreneurs like yourself can deal with?
[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:10.260]   That is the most important thing to happen in the next year. But
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:13.620]   you're saying the SEC is not motivated? I guess? Why are they
[00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:15.220]   not motivated? They're just cya?
[00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:18.020]   Well, they're motivated. Now. This is a political issue now.
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:21.140]   So they but let's hear Brian's answer here. What do you find
[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:24.580]   out? Who did SPF give all this money to because he was touted
[00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:27.340]   as one of the future biggest donors, the Democratic Party,
[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:30.860]   Democratic Party wants signals. So if you want signals, I would
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:33.420]   say there was a pretty big signals here. Number one, he
[00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:36.820]   says going to donate a billion dollars Democratic Party. And he
[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:39.620]   kept touting this like effective altruism, whatever the saving
[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:43.980]   the world stuff. Now, why do you need to do that? Unless your
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:47.260]   reputation laundering and trying to buy political protection?
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:49.940]   Come on, okay. You don't think that was a little bit of a
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:54.140]   signal? Right here? I'll tell you, I'll tell you an even more
[00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:59.420]   explicit signal. We he pitched us in that $17 billion round. And
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:03.180]   I did a zoom with him. And after the zoom, I'm like, this
[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:05.900]   doesn't make much sense. But I'll have my team do some work.
[00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:09.060]   We did some work. And we sent him a two page deck. And we said,
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:13.500]   here are our recommendations for taking the next step. One was
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:16.780]   the formation of a board. The second was the creation of dual
[00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:19.700]   class doc. The third was some reps and warranties around
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:23.140]   affiliated transactions and related party transactions. And
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:26.340]   the person that worked there, called us back and literally,
[00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:30.660]   I'm not I'm not kidding, you said, go fuck yourself, was
[00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:34.060]   quote, unquote, the response to us. We're like, okay, so that
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:37.500]   was the easy decision. But message receives message
[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:40.220]   received. But I still thought, okay, I'll just put that in the
[00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:43.460]   bucket of these guys are unbelievably arrogant and smug.
[00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:46.740]   But Brian, I thought what you thought, which is, maybe it's
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:49.220]   because they've printed, they've created some money making
[00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:53.460]   machine in the Bahamas. And so they have that level of
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:58.220]   confidence. You know, I, it but then to see this thing to the
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:01.900]   extent of which is now we're only scratching the surface,
[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:04.420]   guys, you know that we're gonna find that stuff every day.
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:06.820]   The postmortem is gonna be crazy. But Brian, to the
[00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:09.980]   question I asked before about the SEC, and what should happen,
[00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:12.980]   you said, I want to pick up on what you said, which is the SEC
[00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:15.820]   doesn't seem motivated. Why is the SEC in your mind not
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:16.380]   motivated?
[00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:19.780]   Well, I think you're right that I hope that they use this as a
[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:24.180]   moment to come together and help, you know, local companies
[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:28.860]   in the US being built here to end up in a better place. And I
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:31.700]   do believe you know, David, I think said it's right, it is a
[00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:34.460]   political issue. At this point, there's going to be a major
[00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:38.220]   impetus to get the clarity here in the US and hopefully to help
[00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:40.340]   build the companies here in the US that are going to serve the
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:44.260]   rest of the world, and in every major financial hub. So we're
[00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:46.420]   committed to building that together with all the regulators
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:49.620]   around the world. And crypto is here to stay. This is a
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:52.900]   temporary setback. But I'm here to keep building and make this
[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:53.380]   thing happen.
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:56.340]   All right, we really appreciate you taking the time.
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:49:04.420]   I mean, story after story here about, you know, SPF was going
[00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:07.620]   to create this billion dollar philanthropy to, you know, save
[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:10.980]   the world improve humanities, long term prospects, number two
[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:15.180]   donor to the entire Democratic Party, and on and on and on. And
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:18.700]   like, quite frankly, what this shows is you want to know what
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:21.580]   effective altruism means. It means that you steal other
[00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:25.420]   people's money, while bragging about saving the world, while
[00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:28.260]   taking a big chunk for yourself. That's what it means.
[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:32.580]   There was a research paper in 2011. And this research team
[00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:36.480]   looked at drug addicts and drug abusers 4000 people. And they
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:40.100]   found that the biggest addicts had the highest intelligence,
[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:45.060]   that you were twice as likely to become an abuser and addict. If
[00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:48.380]   you were any kind of intelligent, quintile, quintile,
[00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:52.260]   but they were measuring. And I someone explained this to me at
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:56.580]   the time, that the smarter you are, the more you can convince
[00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:59.220]   yourself that when you're doing bad things, you're actually
[00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:01.700]   doing good things. Even if you're doing bad things to
[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:04.380]   yourself or bad things to other people that you really may
[00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:07.340]   actually care about, you can convince yourself that there's
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:11.380]   some reason to keep doing it. He seems like a brilliant guy. I
[00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:14.580]   think that to some extent, he may actually, I don't know the
[00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:19.140]   guy, but he may actually believe that the, you know, the the ends
[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:22.520]   did justify the means, and he thought that he was doing good
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:26.040]   for the world. And this was something that had to be done in
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:28.140]   some way. And oh, it just got a little bit away from me. But
[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:32.860]   it's, it's still I think the problem is bigger than FT x. And
[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:36.220]   I'll say the uncomfortable part out loud, and nobody needs to
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:40.140]   necessarily comment if you don't want to. But there were an
[00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:46.140]   enormous number of venture firms that talk their their way into
[00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:50.700]   just completely doing zero work here. I mean, and the the tip of
[00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:54.940]   the spear is this thing. Who's the guy that works at founders
[00:50:54.940 --> 00:51:01.100]   fund? bulgar bull jars? zebul jar zebul. Delia. Delia. Thank
[00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:04.940]   you. Yeah, that tweet that he had where he basically took the
[00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:07.580]   snapshot of the Sequoia transcript was one of the
[00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:11.660]   funniest things that I've ever seen. I mean, this was a $215
[00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:15.980]   million decision, and Sequoia documented it and put it on
[00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:19.820]   their own website. And I think that's an example of something
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:22.220]   that was happening, which is people just look the other way
[00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:24.180]   and didn't even want to do the layer of work.
[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:27.020]   Chamat, let me just string together a couple of things
[00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:29.540]   we've talked about over the past few episodes. And I think
[00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:32.700]   you'll agree with this point. But generally speaking, there
[00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:35.940]   seems to be a very heavy lack of governance in investing given
[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:39.620]   the amount of capital and the velocity of capital in Silicon
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:42.340]   Valley, particularly in private markets of late. And a lot of
[00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:44.660]   the stuff that's been talked about, where last week, we
[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:47.220]   talked about super voting shares, and the founder does
[00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:49.100]   whatever they want. And there's no governance, and there's no
[00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:52.660]   board, and there's no oversight. And particularly with this FTX
[00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:55.940]   situation, where clearly there wasn't a board that was, you
[00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:58.100]   know, getting the necessary information that had the
[00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:01.380]   necessary influence that had the necessary controls, the meta
[00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:05.460]   conversation, but all of these threads tie together the concept
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:07.980]   that maybe there's not a lot of governance and not a lot of
[00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:10.580]   diligence going on. And the amount of money that's flowed
[00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:13.540]   into Silicon Valley has allowed a lot of this Lucy, I'll say
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:17.020]   either. I agree with you. Let's thank Brian Armstrong for
[00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:20.180]   joining us. And it was very busy day. And what a great, candid,
[00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:20.860]   insightful.
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:25.140]   Thank you. And it and insightful finish with us.
[00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:28.620]   I just want to say the second uncomfortable thing out loud,
[00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:32.140]   which is there was a lot of venture firms in Silicon Valley
[00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:35.300]   in this period of both not doing any work or diligence who
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:40.140]   also took the extra step and actually created classes and
[00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:45.300]   would teach teams how to create these tokens. Okay, and those
[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:48.620]   artifacts, those video links and artifacts are sometimes on their
[00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:50.900]   website, they're still on YouTube, they're inside of
[00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:53.780]   Twitter. And what these folks would do, and we talked about
[00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:57.900]   this, the game that they played, was they would get a team, they
[00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:01.900]   would create a token, they would also buy equity at some crazy
[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:07.740]   valuation, the equity was locked up, but the tokens were not. And
[00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:10.220]   then they would put them on an exchange and sell them to
[00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:12.780]   unsuspecting people, and they would be able to dump these
[00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:18.740]   tokens. And if you look inside of that trend, what you're going
[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:22.300]   to see, and Brian just mentioned this, those were the sale of
[00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:25.700]   securities, except it was done in a completely unregulated way.
[00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:29.380]   So if the SEC is really and the DOJ is really going to take this
[00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:34.540]   FTT token issue seriously, and what happened to FT x, they're
[00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:38.100]   going to start to look at a bunch of other tokens, and token
[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:40.980]   sales, and you're going to end up looking at some very well
[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:42.700]   known venture firms inside of Silicon Valley.
[00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:46.140]   This is going to be super gnarly. And we talked about it
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:49.060]   before on this pod, there are people who knew better. So you
[00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:51.540]   get a bunch of kids who are living in the Bahamas in a house
[00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:55.620]   and they're, you know, winging this thing, that's one level of
[00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:58.460]   responsibility, and they'll go to jail. But when we talk about
[00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:00.380]   venture capitals, capital allocators have been at it for
[00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:03.500]   decades, to Schmott's point, and they're teaching people how to
[00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:07.860]   do this, and they're hiring attorneys and creating offshore
[00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:12.020]   patent Panama, you know, BVI, whatever places to put these
[00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:15.180]   coins, and then teaching people how to do it and then flipping
[00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:18.900]   them potentially, this is we're just peeling back the onion on
[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:21.140]   this, I have a feeling that this is going to be the turning
[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:21.860]   point. And all that
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:25.060]   token, guys, let's be honest, is not the only token that has
[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:28.860]   been engineered by Silicon Valley venture firms. And it is
[00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:31.780]   also not the only token that's gone to zero that was engineered
[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:33.140]   by Silicon Valley venture firms.
[00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:37.740]   Well, I mean, who knows engineered by but yeah, Jason to
[00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:42.940]   at the very least, Jason, Jason, there's videos today on some of
[00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:46.300]   the most well known venture firm sites on how to do this.
[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:51.380]   Oh, wow, I'm gonna have to see those. Yeah. So they're basically
[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:54.380]   your point, Chamath is they're instructing people on how to do
[00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:58.620]   this. And that is a lot of the deal. It's what it's what it's
[00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:00.020]   what they did.
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:03.860]   Can I ask you guys a point of view on just one big macro
[00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:06.620]   philosophical question? I'm obviously not big in the crypto
[00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:10.300]   world and haven't been but so much of the positioning has been
[00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:13.060]   that these networks get decentralized through the
[00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:16.660]   cryptographic verification systems that obviously enable,
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:19.940]   you know, them to operate effectively and truthfully and
[00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:22.540]   correctly and without centralized control or
[00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:26.300]   manipulation. But ultimately, while these networks themselves
[00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:30.660]   may be decentralized, the user's point of access often ends up
[00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:34.460]   being centralized as a point on the network. And it is that
[00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:37.580]   point on the network that accrues the same level of
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:41.620]   influence, power, control and value as what we saw in the
[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:46.100]   prior centralized network model. You know, we had biology on last
[00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:49.220]   year. And you know, I tried to get to this point within we had
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:52.180]   to cut the thing cut the conversation short, but I've
[00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:54.700]   still not heard from anyone. And I've spoken with Brian separately
[00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:58.620]   about this point. And the concept I use is like, look,
[00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:00.700]   media, if you put all the YouTube videos on a
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:03.260]   decentralized network, and anyone can access them, and
[00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:05.820]   they're distributed everywhere, you still need to have a really
[00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:08.660]   good application. And whoever makes the best application is
[00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:11.660]   going to get all the usage. And then all the users will use that
[00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:14.860]   application. And that becomes effectively the point of control
[00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:18.140]   and influence and value once again. And so it seems to me
[00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:22.220]   like in this case, the exchange was being used as a centralized
[00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:24.980]   wallet, certainly you can do that, you know, exchange through
[00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:27.900]   the exchange. But But mechanistically, these guys were
[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:33.820]   storing their coins, their cryptocurrency inside of FT x's
[00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:39.140]   wallets, and had control over their assets. And so the network
[00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:42.660]   centralized. And so does the decentralized model? It's a
[00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:44.500]   question I'd love to just ask you guys in your point of view
[00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:47.700]   on does this decentralized model actually ever manifest
[00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:49.620]   where everyone has their own wallet? And I know there's all
[00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:52.380]   these new protocols and these distributed wallets and defy
[00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:56.100]   things, but I don't know enough. Yeah, I don't know.
[00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:57.380]   Better, but
[00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:00.860]   this points out to me just you basically recreate an exchange
[00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:03.020]   without a regulator. And of course, someone ripped you off
[00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:05.060]   and blew up like I mean, how's it any different than what we
[00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:08.380]   had in version 1.0? And is there really a model where
[00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:11.060]   decentralized works are ultimately because of the
[00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:12.900]   network effects and the and the economy?
[00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:15.740]   Answer? Yeah, we got the question.
[00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:20.340]   No, I mean, I haven't I have I don't know the answer to free
[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:22.700]   bird question because I don't I don't know this space well
[00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:28.780]   enough. I mean, you know, I, my, my biggest purchase ever was
[00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:34.860]   Bitcoin in 2011. You know, I've bought a bunch of these tokens
[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:38.180]   that have massively depreciated in value. I think lots of
[00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:42.820]   investors have, you know, I kind of fell into it as well. Like I
[00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:44.540]   thought, wow, this is incredible. I get to buy these
[00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:46.860]   tokens, they do all of this cool stuff, they represent all this
[00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:50.500]   value. And my experience has been the opposite of that I've
[00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:54.580]   lost a lot of money in these things. And so you know, I
[00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:57.980]   really hope that regulators not just obviously, I hope that
[00:57:57.980 --> 00:58:01.860]   regulators do their do the best they can to get investors money
[00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:07.260]   back in FTX. But I really also hope they figure out all these
[00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:10.020]   other tokens as well, because you can just rank them in terms
[00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:14.260]   of market cap, start at the top and work your way down. And you
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:16.820]   will see that these were unregulated securities, Jason
[00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:21.220]   that were manufactured and sold by our brethren.
[00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:25.900]   People who understand the law around accredited investors and
[00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:30.460]   this stuff very well. Yeah, they understand it implicitly.
[00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:34.740]   Yeah. Do you guys think crypto investing is dead? Or what do
[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:37.820]   you think? How do you think people think about that risk
[00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:39.020]   profile now inside of
[00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:42.100]   I think that investing in the tokens is going to end investing
[00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:44.860]   in the corporation is going to begin and any of the tokens are
[00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:47.140]   going to be super regulated building on what you said
[00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:50.900]   Chamath about the ultimate bet. Is it possible that Alameda the
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:54.860]   trading hedge fund was looking at the FTX data which they had
[00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:57.380]   insights into? And essentially, that's the same as seeing the
[00:58:57.380 --> 00:59:00.340]   whole cards and the ultimate bet. And so they're making their
[00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:02.780]   trades based on what they see the consumers are making their
[00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:05.340]   trades, front running their trades or otherwise,
[00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:07.700]   that's not illegal. You know, Citadel does this in the
[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:10.420]   regulated market. That's what payment for order flow is. It's
[00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:15.180]   right. It's the ability to front run retail volume. And so you
[00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:20.420]   know, in dark pools, that is legal by the law in the United
[00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:23.380]   States. And that's what allows Citadel and, you know, I think
[00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:28.100]   Jane Street and Susquehanna, you know, all these folks basically
[00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:31.060]   run these dark pool exchanges for regulated securities, like
[00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:35.500]   options and bonds and, and stocks. And they get this order
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:38.260]   flow and they front run it by a millisecond and they just take
[00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:42.460]   small big, but they can't print the FTT tokens and otherwise
[00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:45.860]   manipulate the market to the level that I think SPL could I
[00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:49.060]   just think that there's there's there's these really strict
[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:53.220]   walls and segregation. As you heard Brian talk about when you
[00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:55.740]   have those businesses in these regulated markets. The problem
[00:59:55.740 --> 01:00:00.220]   here is that this is totally wild west unregulated, wild,
[01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:02.460]   wild west. So who knows what's going on really?
[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:06.500]   And we're pushing the business sacks off of the shores of the
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.980]   United States, as he said, 95% of this is happening offshore.
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:12.180]   What do you think should happen regulatory wise sacks in terms
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:16.060]   of America and competitiveness? Or do we not to be need to be
[01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:17.140]   competitive in this?
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:20.140]   No, I think we should be I mean, what if what if crypto is and
[01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:22.660]   defy is the future of finance? I mean, it's an important
[01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:26.700]   technology that I think we should enable through some sort
[01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:29.300]   of constructive regulatory framework. I think the
[01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:32.380]   I think the regulators should listen to Brian and help come
[01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:36.180]   with a appropriate framework. But to be clear, look, what Sam
[01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:39.740]   did is way worse than people going on an exchange and
[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:43.180]   speculating. I mean, look, I think that people who speculated
[01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:47.220]   in the buying and selling these tokens, there, they were using
[01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:50.820]   it like a casino, okay, like, that's different than a customer
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:54.900]   putting their money on FTX and having their money gets stolen.
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:58.100]   That's a big difference. So I think there's levels here. Now,
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:00.620]   Jamal, to your point about who's minting these tokens, you're
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:03.740]   right, maybe that's like another category. But I do think that
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:08.820]   the reason why this is on a different level is because it
[01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:10.260]   wasn't Sam's money to give away.
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:14.780]   There is such an easy solution to a whole lot of data. I'm just
[01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:18.340]   traded. I agree with you on that point. But I think don't under
[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:22.380]   play when there's an organized process to create an illegal
[01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:28.620]   security with special rules for them. That allows the liquidity
[01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:31.500]   for one class of asset and not liquidity for
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.700]   you're right. So that's a separate bucket. I don't think
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:37.140]   it's the same as what Sam did. And I don't think I agree. I
[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:37.820]   agree. No, I'm saying
[01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:41.660]   that's something that needs to be looked at. And we need a
[01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:43.380]   constructive regulatory framework for that.
[01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:47.660]   There is such a simple silver bullet for all of this, which is
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:52.020]   these things need to be there needs to be proper governance,
[01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:55.180]   people have to have skin in the game insurance, people signing
[01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:58.460]   off on the taxes boards, not onshore here in the United
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:02.020]   States. And then we need to have and I'll keep saying this, a way
[01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:05.620]   for Americans to become sophisticated investors, only 6%
[01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:08.340]   of this country fall into the qualified purchaser and
[01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:11.220]   accredited if you want to trade in these things, or you want to
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:14.860]   trade in NF T's or private companies, we should have a
[01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:18.420]   driver's license like test a firearm test and I are on the
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:21.620]   same sophisticated test and the problem into it with an
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:22.380]   education.
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:25.700]   The problem is when you have guys like this, it sets that
[01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:29.740]   desire back by a decade, if not more. Okay, because it sucks. I
[01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:33.700]   agree. Because every single frustrating every single person
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:38.380]   inside of Washington right now, who's anywhere near this from a
[01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:41.340]   regulatory perspective or a policy perspective is meeting on
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:44.740]   Monday morning. Yeah, the meeting topic is how do we
[01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:48.380]   defend the mom and pop folks that lost money here? Yes, the
[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:51.660]   only thing. So we took this out of you know, because I remember
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:54.780]   I remember I texted into the group chat. Hey, guys, what what
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:58.220]   what do we think the legal ramifications are that drive
[01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:00.820]   prosecution, and one of our friends said legal
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:03.900]   ramifications. These are political ramifications. Yeah,
[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:06.580]   which means that this is going to go to the utmost level and
[01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:09.180]   it's going to have the most scrutiny. And they're going to
[01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:12.460]   act really quickly. It is going to drop a hammer instead of
[01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:15.020]   having a path to accreditation. I agree with you, they're going
[01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:17.420]   to drop the hammer, because their constituents, some
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:19.540]   grandma and grandpa or some people put their college
[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:22.660]   education to some lost everything. We just need a test.
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:25.020]   Let people prove they're sophisticated and let them
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:27.900]   participate. Well, first and only if they get a license,
[01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:31.100]   haven't you been a proponent for letting people invest in
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:34.500]   startups that are just moms and pops and democratizing access?
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:37.780]   I'm only allowed to do that with accredited investors. I would
[01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:40.100]   like there to be a test and I actually teach a course Angel
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:43.380]   University six times a year for charity. I do it for charity.
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:46.940]   It's a four hour course where you learn about diversification
[01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:49.980]   you learn about the asset class you learn about 70 80% go to
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:52.380]   zero we teach you about the power law. I try to teach
[01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:54.900]   people about this stuff so that they can participate
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:57.140]   intelligently it would it would be the equivalent freeberg and
[01:03:57.140 --> 01:03:59.380]   thank you for asking the question. The it would be
[01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:02.020]   equivalent if we had a poker test and to play in the World
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:05.060]   Series of poker, you had to go to a five hour seminar, and you
[01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:07.540]   had to take a practical test and you had to say, you know, a
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:10.580]   flush beats a straight and you had to just prove that you had
[01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:12.980]   some level of knowledge of how to play the game. It's such an
[01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:16.980]   obvious path to removing these problems while staying
[01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:19.700]   competitive as a country. And instead we're letting people do
[01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:23.260]   this offshore like CZ with no rules, or whatever rules he
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:27.260]   chooses. It's just infuriating. It's so stupid. Our politicians
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:29.140]   in Washington are so dumb.
[01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:31.740]   Can I just say something? I think the challenge is there's
[01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:35.020]   always a spectrum of understanding. And you'll always
[01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:37.660]   end up seeing the people on the wrong end of the spectrum
[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:40.100]   getting taken advantage of there's this notion of adverse
[01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:45.100]   selection. distributions are not equal. People will end up, you
[01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:49.060]   know, kind of opting in to spend money on things or making
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:50.860]   investments that they think are good investments, but they're
[01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:53.300]   actually getting taken advantage of, because they're not savvy
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:56.180]   enough, or they miss an important angle or important
[01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:58.820]   perspective about the person or the thing that they're giving
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:01.220]   their money to. And there will always be some number of those.
[01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:04.020]   And the way that regulation has worked historically, is not by
[01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:06.620]   first saying, Hey, let's figure out the right way to create a
[01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:09.500]   framework for operating. It's that some sort of people got
[01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:11.980]   advantaged. That story then becomes the regulatory
[01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:15.140]   framework. And that story has repeated itself for 500 years
[01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:16.300]   across capital markets.
[01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:18.340]   We're talking about a multi layered thing here. We want to
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:22.020]   see crypto have a framework, we want it to blossom here in the
[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:25.340]   United States. And then there's multiple level of people who are
[01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:29.300]   causing chaos in this ecosystem in this very promising
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:32.460]   technology with their goddamn grifts, whether it's VCs,
[01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:36.020]   grifting, or SPF, or incompetence, we just need to
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:38.700]   clean this framework up if people sometimes people I
[01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:41.460]   understand in DC listen to this podcast, if they're listening,
[01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:44.620]   it's essential that America be competitive here, it's essential
[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:47.580]   that everybody participate in risk capital and get educated.
[01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:50.820]   Let's clean it up and make a framework that allows all
[01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:54.420]   Americans to participate and educates them and then stops
[01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:57.060]   these grifters from doing stupid things. If people were
[01:05:57.060 --> 01:06:00.620]   educated. That's the first step. And it's the best about the
[01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:04.140]   economy. Sure, you want to talk about Facebook with 11,000. You
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:07.420]   want to talk about the market popping at the beginning of
[01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:11.060]   October? Yeah, I think what we basically said, kind of
[01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:14.140]   generally speaking is markets up, right markets went from
[01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:17.100]   nibbling to being constructively positive and basically being
[01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:22.060]   positioned long. Here's this really interesting setup. We
[01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:25.900]   have a bunch of very positive news that I think we all have to
[01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:30.540]   process. First positive news was that inflation ticked down. Now
[01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:32.620]   here's what I'll tell you, there's a caveat here, I talked
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:36.460]   to a bunch of pretty smart sharps on Wall Street. And, oh,
[01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:39.260]   two things. Number one is they all gave credit to David Sachs
[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:42.500]   and they said Sachs is totally right, double dip recession is
[01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:46.580]   coming. But then they said tell Sachs that we think that these
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:49.220]   are the sharps, we think that there's a double hump in
[01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:53.060]   inflation coming, which means it's coming down to come back
[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:56.500]   up. And there's a bunch of reporting vagaries that may
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:59.460]   cause that so keep that in the back of your mind but positive
[01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:05.980]   news. Number one is inflation ticking down. Number two, Jason
[01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:10.900]   we talked about this, a federal judge basically stayed Biden's
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:15.620]   attempt at giving student loan relief. Now, that would have
[01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:19.620]   been a $500 billion transfer payment from the government into
[01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:24.260]   the hands of individuals. It is deflationary to not put give
[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:26.660]   that money to people it's effectively taking stimulus away
[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:30.540]   from folks. Number three, it looks like we're headed towards
[01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:34.820]   a split government, which means that we are not probably going
[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:39.060]   to see any more stimulus over the next two years. Number four,
[01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:43.420]   Ukraine wins and occurs on. I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
[01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:48.380]   Number five, the United States announced yesterday through the
[01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:51.500]   Wall Street Journal, that they had essentially said no to
[01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:55.220]   Ukraine's request for advanced drones. And they said to Ukraine
[01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:59.300]   essentially, you need to go and negotiate an endgame here. And
[01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:04.060]   number six, China has started to relax his COVID policies and G
[01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:07.900]   is pivoting to economy first. So if you took all the weight take
[01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:10.940]   seven, don't forget seven, Facebook, which would not take
[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:15.100]   the medicine, they refuse Brad Gerson's letter, cut 11,000
[01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:18.500]   people 48 hours ago, I don't think Facebook matters that
[01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:21.860]   much, to be honest. Well, but it matters that big tech is and
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:24.780]   they're taking matters. But it doesn't matter to the economy to
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:26.980]   be complete. I think it does, if people are gonna start cutting
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:27.900]   jobs, but okay, keep going.
[01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:31.220]   My point is, these seven things are macro level things that
[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:34.620]   affect everybody. Yep. And I think if you take them together,
[01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:37.580]   what it says is that, wow, there's there's the potential
[01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:40.140]   for a lot of great positive developments over the next six
[01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:42.900]   or nine months. And I don't think that that was adequately
[01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:45.740]   priced in the market. But here's the problem. And this is what
[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:49.220]   why we've been rallying. The problem is that most of this
[01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:54.820]   rallying has been because of a bunch of short covering by folks
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:58.700]   that who were pretty pessimistic and negative after the last few
[01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:02.540]   inflation prints. So this is not really net new buying that we
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:06.820]   saw over the last couple days. So you take it all together. I'm
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:09.380]   like, it's still going to probably trend up a little bit.
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:11.980]   But then again, you know, we talked about this, Jason, when
[01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:15.900]   the VIX gets into the low 20s, or the high teens, that's
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:18.340]   probably the short term top and then it turns around. And
[01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:23.860]   unfortunately, we're here. The low 20s, high teens. So that's
[01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:25.260]   kind of my thought on things right now.
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:27.020]   Okay, freeberg, any thoughts on the inflation print?
[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:30.500]   Yeah, so I think there's two things, one of which I'll give
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:35.700]   credit to a guy named Carl. Chu. I hope I pronounced Carl's name
[01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:37.500]   right. He's from William Blair, he puts out these excellent
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:40.300]   research reports. And we used one of his graphics a few weeks
[01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:43.420]   ago. So I put it up here. And basically, he showed that with
[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:46.500]   the the NASDAQ move that we saw this week. So you can see this
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:50.100]   here, he basically tracked the move in the 10 year Treasury
[01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:55.060]   against the one day move in the NASDAQ. And he said that it
[01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:58.220]   really indicates a unique sentiment shift, whereas in
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:01.500]   other times, you've seen big moves in the NASDAQ that weren't
[01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:05.180]   really seeing significant moves in the Treasury rate at the
[01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:08.060]   same on the same trading day. And that this is such an
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:12.260]   outlier what happened this week. The only other time that we've
[01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:15.060]   seen anything like it was when the Bank of England issue
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:17.900]   happened back at the end of September, in the last, you
[01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:21.060]   know, 20 times that we've seen this big of a move in the NASDAQ
[01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:25.300]   in a single day. And so we saw 31 basis point move in 10 year
[01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:27.780]   Treasuries in a single day at the same time that we saw what a
[01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:31.180]   seven point move in the NASDAQ. So he said, because you don't
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:33.260]   normally see the bond market and the equity market trade in this
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:37.260]   way together, it really speaks to a big shift in sentiment. Now,
[01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:40.860]   at the same time, what is that shift in sentiment, that there
[01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:44.260]   is going to be less of a driver for the Fed to raise interest
[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:47.140]   rates at this point, because it seems like the inflation print
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:50.700]   indicates that inflation is coming under control faster than
[01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:53.820]   what folks had otherwise anticipated. And so there may
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:56.700]   not be as many rate hikes as quickly as folks were
[01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:59.980]   anticipating, which will, you know, benefit, benefit equities
[01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:02.380]   and the bond market traded that that with that perspective as
[01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:06.220]   well. Now, the counter narrative, which I just put a
[01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:09.260]   tweet by a guy who I've never heard of before. But someone
[01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:11.820]   shared this with me, his name is Gordon Johnson. And he said,
[01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:17.060]   the CPI surprise may actually be due to a technical print that
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:19.660]   within the CPI, one of the biggest indicators is health
[01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:24.420]   insurance cost. And, you know, it, the health insurance cost
[01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:31.220]   plunged by 4% October to September, but healthcare costs
[01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:33.660]   didn't actually magically collapse, there was just an
[01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:35.820]   accounting difference in how they're shifting how they're
[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:38.740]   accounting for healthcare costs that took place during the
[01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:42.660]   month. And if you did not, if you assume that that was flat,
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:47.020]   month over month, you would end up actually with a 6.7% year
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:49.740]   over year print, which was higher than expected. So there
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:52.500]   is a counter narrative going on in the market. I don't know how
[01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:56.140]   significant this guy is, or how much of a voice he has. But I
[01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:58.100]   don't know if we're out of the woods yet by some folks are
[01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:00.540]   saying that the market is saying, we're feeling a lot
[01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:03.420]   better. But there are still analysts that are indicating
[01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:06.780]   that maybe there is still risk to be had ahead of us.
[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:11.260]   I think the sharps tend to be on that second, second perspective.
[01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.300]   And by the way, I'll say this week, I heard five and a half
[01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:16.500]   points, even after that print. So is where we're gonna get to
[01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:19.980]   I think consensus we have here is is that we're in the endgame
[01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:22.780]   now maybe what two quarters, three quarters, four quarters of
[01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:26.620]   choppiness. Chamath, what would your gut tell you if you I've
[01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:29.980]   been telling all of our startups that you need to plan to have
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:35.740]   money through the first quarter of 2025? You must Yeah, okay,
[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:40.380]   absolutely must. And the way that I have cash, okay, the way
[01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:43.740]   that I framed that out to them is nine. Yeah, eight or nine
[01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:49.900]   quarters of cash. Ideally nine. And the reason is that we have
[01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:53.380]   all of this positive news in the offing. But But the but the
[01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:57.420]   problem is, again, there is still a lot of risk to the
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:00.780]   downside, we haven't seen David second, you know, dip in the
[01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:03.580]   recession, right. So that double dip is going to be expensive.
[01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:07.580]   And again, the sharps think that inflation will come back at
[01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:11.820]   some point in the next six months, that will keep the feds
[01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:15.260]   foot on the gas. Maybe it's two or three more 50 basis point
[01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:18.060]   hikes. The point is, Jason, you could be at five and a half.
[01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:20.860]   Again, we said this last week, we're going to get to a point
[01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:24.220]   that's probably higher than what people expect. That's probably
[01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:27.420]   around five and a half. And we'll stay there longer than
[01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:31.660]   people want. That's probably through the middle part of 24.
[01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:35.420]   And if you don't prepare for that worst case scenario, you're
[01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:38.060]   doing yourself a disservice. I think the market can start to
[01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:41.500]   rebound in the second half of 24. But if you're a company, you
[01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:46.460]   need to balance and plan for the first quarter of 25. Because,
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:49.580]   you know, again, most venture investors are going to want to
[01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:52.220]   see six months of data on the ground that things are better
[01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:56.700]   before their sentiment changes. Yeah. And we're just starting
[01:13:56.700 --> 01:14:00.780]   to see the drawdowns. We're just starting to see the impacts in
[01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:04.460]   people's portfolios that will drive behavior change. I mean,
[01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:08.620]   this SPF thing is the tip of the iceberg in terms of the money
[01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:12.540]   at risk. You know, I went in, by the way, I did it in analysis.
[01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:15.340]   I shared it in the group chat. Hopefully, we can show this up.
[01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:19.100]   Brad has a little chart. Nick, maybe you can throw up the the
[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:22.460]   the historic drawdowns. So, for people that care about early
[01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:31.340]   stage technology, since 2018 through 2021, and including an
[01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:36.060]   estimate for 2022, we have injected 1 trillion dollars
[01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:42.620]   into venture capital. And if you look at historically how
[01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:46.140]   money has been lost in periods like this, and you layer that
[01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:50.140]   into 2018 to now, what it basically tells you is about
[01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:56.540]   500 billion dollars of that trillion from 18, 19, 20, 21,
[01:14:56.540 --> 01:15:00.140]   and 22 is going to be destroyed. We haven't even
[01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:03.740]   started to see that yet, right? And then if you factor in
[01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:06.620]   another 100 billion or so from older vintages, we're talking
[01:15:06.620 --> 01:15:12.700]   about a 600 or 700 billion dollar destruction of paid in
[01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:17.020]   capital. So there's still for all the good news, there's still
[01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:19.740]   a bunch of these unfortunate pieces of bad news that have to
[01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:22.540]   work its way through the system. Yeah. And for people
[01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:25.260]   who are looking at the chart right now, and you can see the
[01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:27.980]   charts on Spotify, or if you search for all in on YouTube,
[01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:31.100]   we have a video version there. You just take a look at 1997,
[01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:34.140]   the peak TVPI was, you know, seven and a half x seven and a
[01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:37.260]   half times, you know, cash on cash money. And what actually
[01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:40.380]   got realized was five x, right? So what paper said and what got
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:44.780]   distributed were two different things. Anecdotally, what I'm
[01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:47.900]   seeing in the startup world, Chamath is people are taking the
[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:50.380]   medicine and a lot of people are shutting their companies
[01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:53.580]   down. They're giving up on raising money, and then asking
[01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:57.180]   me which portfolio company can I get a job at because I on my
[01:15:57.180 --> 01:16:01.100]   personal balance sheet have been you know, taking a 5k draw a
[01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:04.780]   month and I have two kids I need a job, can you get me a job at
[01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:09.740]   Amazon or another portfolio company. And a lot of acquirers
[01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:12.380]   have started to happen. And so what's happening is the
[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:15.820]   consolidation of talent, people who would be a great number
[01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:18.540]   three or four person, but maybe they weren't suited to be the
[01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:22.220]   number one person are now consolidating into startups.
[01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:25.900]   With these layoffs at meta and other corporations, we're
[01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:28.940]   starting to see very talented people who had peak comp of
[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:32.620]   300 700 k a year are going to go to startups or smaller
[01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:36.540]   companies. And that is also positive, more consolidation of
[01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:39.180]   talent, stronger companies. Did you guys hear the story
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:43.020]   yesterday that Nick, if you could just be about the name
[01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:46.780]   told about his friend, his friend basically makes $140,000
[01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:50.700]   working for a tech startup, and then also makes $280,000
[01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:54.060]   working for meta. And so and he's been working at both of
[01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:56.780]   those companies virtually for the last two years, the guy
[01:16:56.780 --> 01:17:00.380]   makes 400 $450,000 a year and nobody knows and he says he
[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:05.260]   works about 2022 hours a week on both combined. So the 80
[01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:08.540]   hours and remember when we started in startups in the night
[01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:12.860]   late 90s and into the turn of the century. The number of
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:15.900]   hours that was expected at a startup was what sacks when you
[01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:18.860]   were at 60 hours a week, I would say 6060 day I was
[01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:21.980]   expecting baseline. Yeah, 60 baseline. Yeah. baseline 10
[01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:24.060]   hours a day plus coming on the weekend for a couple hours.
[01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:29.100]   Yes. Yeah, for sure. Easily. He probably more early days of
[01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:31.820]   Facebook, our executive management meetings wouldn't
[01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:37.420]   start till 9pm. Yeah, it's this is I think, Elon's gonna be a
[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:40.380]   trailblazer in a lot of ways on this Twitter thing. You know,
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:43.500]   first he did the big headcount reduction, but then he also just
[01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:46.460]   this past week, everyone needs to come to the office. And if
[01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:48.220]   you don't come to the office, you don't have to come to the
[01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:49.900]   office, you have a good excuse. If you're an exceptional
[01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:52.300]   performer, and you've got a good reason, they don't have to
[01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:56.300]   but the baseline is everyone comes to the office. By the way,
[01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:58.700]   just to put this point into focus, Nick, can you just throw
[01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:00.780]   up this chart for these guys to see because I think it's just
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:04.140]   ridiculous. So this is basically what we're dealing
[01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:06.780]   with, which is like if you look at and these are just a couple
[01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:11.180]   of examples, but this is meta Amazon snowflake data dog
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:15.260]   versus Gilead, Raytheon and Exxon. What is the point of
[01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:19.020]   this? The point of this is just to show you that we have had a
[01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:23.420]   massive rotation away from our industry is the point, right?
[01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:27.100]   Where normally, the things that we would work on were just so
[01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:29.660]   well received by so many different kinds of investors
[01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:33.180]   that unfortunately just isn't the case anymore. And I think
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:35.660]   it just goes to show you that the reason why this is
[01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:39.580]   happening is because people are hedging their bets about how
[01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:43.580]   long the economic pain lasts. That's why you know, they'd
[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:46.940]   rather be long healthcare stocks, you know, industrial
[01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:50.220]   defense companies and oil companies, because at the end
[01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:54.540]   of the day, they're banking on oil and war and sickness, you
[01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:59.580]   know, versus social media and e commerce and software. And if
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:02.060]   we look at this chart, just no matter how good by the way, so
[01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:04.620]   this is not an indictment on these companies go watch the
[01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:06.700]   prediction episode from last year. I think that was a
[01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:09.100]   prediction episode. Yeah, we you and I nailed it on crypto.
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:11.740]   We both said crypto is going to crater these four horsemen here
[01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:17.180]   data dog meta Amazon snowflake down 23 to 27%. And then the
[01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:22.380]   Gilead Raytheon Exxon cohort 8 to 28% up. I think Chamath what
[01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:26.300]   this says also is, we don't think your management style and
[01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:29.580]   how you're running these businesses is appropriate for
[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:33.500]   this moment in time, please consider some austerity
[01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:36.780]   measures and some thoughtfulness in how you treat
[01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:42.060]   shareholders. Well, I mean, it's just watching the number,
[01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:45.900]   you know how people are running companies. I think we took it
[01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:48.620]   too far in Silicon Valley, we took it too far, whether it's
[01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:52.300]   a cow, I know that I know it's sort of a pet issue of ours,
[01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:55.660]   because we have to deal with some incredible hubris and
[01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:58.300]   arrogance sometimes on the boards of these companies,
[01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:01.180]   because folks don't want to listen to reasonable advice,
[01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:05.020]   and we come off as wet blankets. But that chart, to be
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:08.460]   honest, is is because of what we explained last week, which
[01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:13.260]   is the when rates go up, the value of a dollar that you
[01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:16.620]   earned today is just meaningly meaningfully more worthwhile
[01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:19.660]   than a dollar that you may earn even two or three years in the
[01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:22.940]   future. That's why that chart looks the way that it does. And
[01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:25.900]   if you believe that David's forecast of a double dip
[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:29.980]   recession is accurate, which again, most of the sharps do.
[01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:33.580]   And then you also layer in this idea that inflation could come
[01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:37.180]   back, you have to be really defensively positioned, you
[01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:39.980]   know, you can't take a lot of risk, which is why startups
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:45.580]   have to expect that if that's the dynamic, and $600 billion
[01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:49.500]   is going to get destroyed in venture capital portfolios, how
[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:52.940]   open our VC is going to be for business, they're probably not
[01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:56.700]   going to be that open. And so you have to plan, I think, for
[01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:58.860]   the middle for the early part of 25.
[01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:03.980]   If Amazon, and how do you get incremental dollars in these
[01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:07.740]   tech companies, Amazon does a riff, some austerity measures,
[01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:10.460]   they raise prices a little bit, if they can, you know, maybe you
[01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:13.180]   see more incremental dollars coming today. And maybe that
[01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:17.020]   incentivizes people look what happened. We were at $89 for
[01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:20.060]   Facebook shares last week, tomorrow, when he made the riff
[01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:23.180]   107, he went up like 15 $20. What does that tell you?
[01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:27.420]   I mean, I think it tells you that a lot of people were short
[01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:29.900]   going into that, and they were probably cut off side a little
[01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:34.140]   bit by the magnitude of it. I think that that's good. The, the
[01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:37.100]   issue that a lot of these companies have, even in the face
[01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:41.340]   of riffs is that you have to reset expectations now on
[01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:44.620]   earnings. And if you do that, the problem is that when you
[01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:48.060]   flow that through to what people think the SMP will look like in
[01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:52.860]   a year, there's some real issues. So this is not free, you
[01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:56.620]   know, it's really hard treading. And I just I would I would just
[01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:59.820]   encourage people, it feels wonderful to have a few days of
[01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:02.140]   like, it's like a respite in the middle of a huge storm, right?
[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:05.100]   It feels like we've been getting whipsawed back and forth, and
[01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:08.780]   it's nice. I came out, and the wind came out. I would just
[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:11.900]   really encourage people in this moment to reset your energy,
[01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:15.100]   which I think is good. But you got to go back into that office,
[01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:18.620]   and you got to find the money and the wherewithal, I think to
[01:22:18.620 --> 01:22:23.020]   last through 24. If possible, it's grind time, Facebook, by
[01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:27.820]   the way, 27 months, 27, at least two years, two years. 24
[01:22:27.820 --> 01:22:31.980]   months is the new Yeah, now quarters is the new six quarters.
[01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:34.700]   And by the way, you know, the thing that employees need to do
[01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:37.580]   now in this moment is to hold the management teams of your
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:40.460]   companies accountable, because in those q&a is, hopefully,
[01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:43.500]   you're not just glad handing talking about bullshit, you
[01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.660]   actually go and ask the question, how much money do we
[01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:48.220]   have? What decisions are you going to make to get this
[01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:52.380]   company to be, you know, in a position to survive? That is
[01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:55.660]   really what's at stake here for the venture capital industry is
[01:22:55.660 --> 01:22:59.580]   just survival of as many of these companies as possible
[01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:02.540]   through these next two years, the conversation has to shift
[01:23:02.540 --> 01:23:07.580]   from like culture and features to like the bottom line, and
[01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:10.620]   grinding it out and just proving it to Wall Street and to the
[01:23:10.620 --> 01:23:13.100]   investment community that your business is worthy of
[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:15.500]   investment. As you're saying the dollars today matter. All
[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:18.540]   right. It's been a crazy week. Thank you to David Friedberg
[01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:21.420]   for showing up. Unfortunately, no time for science corner
[01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:24.700]   apologies to the Friedberg stands who are many and we'll
[01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:28.300]   see you in the YouTube comments for the dictator himself to my
[01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:31.740]   poly hop at a with just a wonderful sweater going into
[01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:34.380]   the strong November strong showing for November with that
[01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:36.700]   purple sweater. I don't know if it's mauve or purple, whatever
[01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:39.580]   you got going there looks wonderful. Thank you for team
[01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:45.180]   Moncler. sassel himself. David Sachs people don't understand
[01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:47.900]   what you're saying when you say that Jason. Oh, they know
[01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:50.140]   you're an asshole. They they're no, that's what they think
[01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:52.300]   you're saying. They don't know. They don't know that we're
[01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:56.540]   adding the sass to it. Yes. So David also is a great executive
[01:23:56.540 --> 01:23:59.100]   in software as a service in addition to being an asshole.
[01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:01.820]   So you put the two together and you get sassel. No, I'm just
[01:24:01.820 --> 01:24:03.740]   joking. David's a wonderful person. People are really
[01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:07.260]   excited that you and I are friends again. It's an amazing
[01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:11.260]   moment. That was your chance to make a joke. So actually missed
[01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:13.900]   it. Throw it up there for you. I threw up the softball for you
[01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:16.620]   and say you're not we're not friends. Alright, we'll see you
[01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:22.540]   all next time. Bye bye. We'll let your winners ride. Rain Man
[01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:25.260]   David Sachs.
[01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:29.120]   And it said we open source it to the fans and they've just
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:34.560]   gone crazy with it. Love you. Queen of Kinwan.
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:38.760]   What your winners ride.
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:43.640]   Besties are gone. That's my dog taking a notice in your
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:46.120]   driveway.
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:50.600]   Oh man. My avatar will meet me at. We should all just get a
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:53.080]   room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:55.560]   useless. It's like this like sexual tension that they just
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:58.600]   need to release somehow.
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:06.200]   What your beat. We need to get merch.
