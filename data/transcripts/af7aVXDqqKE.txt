[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:13.600]   the Book of the Acts of the Apostles, in chapter 8, reading verses 4, 5, and 12. We are still
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.840]   considering, as most of you will realize, this account which we are given in this eighth
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.600]   chapter of this Book of the Acts of the Apostles of the spread of the Christian gospel, which
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.600]   so far had been confined to the city of Jerusalem. But here, in fulfillment of our Lord's own
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.200]   prophecy, it begins to spread. And spreads first, as he said it would, to Samaria. It
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.080]   had already spread round about Jerusalem a bit in Judea, but now it goes down to Samaria.
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.480]   And later, of course, it spread to other parts of the world also.
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.480]   Now, I'm calling your attention to this because, of course, it is a fact of history. And whatever
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.600]   view you may take of history, you must know and you must realize that the history of the
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.880]   world cannot be understood truly without taking into consideration the story of the Christian
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.160]   Church. I've reminded you of the evidence for that. Take our world as it is tonight.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.760]   One of the most powerful nations in the world is the United States of America. That came
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.040]   into being because of Christianity. Whatever you may think of the United States now, there
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.240]   would never have been such a nation were it not for the Pilgrim Fathers who first went
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.240]   there because of their belief in this gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.560]   Well, now, this is therefore something which is of very great importance. But at the same
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:52.000]   time, this passage shows us what exactly the Christian message is. I say the Church spread.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.400]   What is the Church? Well, the Church is a gathering of people who believe the message
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:03.360]   of the Christian gospel. So, what is most important for us is to realize what this Christian
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.880]   gospel, this Christian message, really is. And that's what we are told here. You see,
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.360]   a great persecution arose in the city of Jerusalem. The Jews hated this gospel. They'd already
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.320]   hated Jesus Christ. That's why they put him to death. But they hated his followers. And
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.520]   now they began to attack them and persecute them. One of the leaders in this was a man
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.440]   called Saul of Tarsus. And we are told that he made havoc of the Church, entering into
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.640]   every house and healing men and women, committed them to prison. And it was as a result of
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.520]   that that people were scattered abroad. And we are told that wherever they went, they
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.720]   preached the word. And this man, Philip, who was a deacon in the Church of Jerusalem, he
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.040]   went down to Samaria. And we are told that he preached Christ to them. He preached the
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:00.560]   things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ. Now, that is Christianity,
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.960]   because as the result of his efforts, we are told that the people with one accord gave
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.560]   heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.160]   For unclean spirits, crying without voice, came out of many that were possessed with
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.080]   them. And many taken with palsies and that were lame were healed. And there was great
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.960]   joy in that city. They became Christians. They joined the Christian Church. And they
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.040]   did so as the result, as you were told there, of believing this message.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.800]   Now then, this is the thing, therefore, that I want to hold before you. I'm doing it.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.080]   My subsidiary reason for doing it is this. There is such confusion about this at the
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.400]   present time. A world such as ours tonight, which is in pain and trouble and sorrow, looks
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:58.640]   to the Christian Church. What does he find? Is the message clear? Is it plain? Is it obvious
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:05.200]   to everybody what the Christian message really is? Alas, that is not the case. And therefore,
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.920]   I'm directing your attention back to the origins. This idea that the Christian message
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.760]   should be different today from what it was at the beginning is just nonsense, of course.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.400]   If this is what it claims to be, the word of God and the message of God who doesn't
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:28.280]   change, the changes that take place in the world are irrelevant. It's the same message.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.080]   And it always has been the same message which has led to the same results throughout the
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.800]   running century. That is why I say it is so important that we should consider what this
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:44.160]   is. What is it? What is this message? Well, it's the word. It's a given message. It's
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:51.800]   a distinct message. It's a discrete message. It's not vague and nebulous and uncertain.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.360]   These people didn't go everywhere joining in some search for truth. No, no, they preached
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.600]   the word. They said what they knew. They reported certain things. So did Philip. He preached
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.880]   Christ. And we've seen that this is the essence of the Christian message. It is all about
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.200]   this person, Jesus of Nazareth. And the message that Philip preached was that this is the
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.160]   Son of God. That he is a man, but not only a man, he's the Son of God. And he's come
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.640]   into the world in order to save it. And he explained to them how he'd done so, by dying
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.600]   on a cross. It wasn't an accidental death. He did it deliberately. He'd come to die.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:39.280]   He set his face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem. He took upon him our sins and our guilt. He
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.960]   bore our punishment. That's how he saves. He died that we might be forgiven. He arose
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:52.280]   again in order to justify us before God and to present us to him and to intercede on our
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:58.400]   behalf in his eternal presence. That was a part of the message. But we saw also last
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.320]   Sunday night that the message went further. Because if this message is only a message
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:12.560]   of forgiveness of sins, it still leaves me as I am. Leaves me with the same nature that's
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.320]   already gotten into trouble. Leaves me in the same world with all its temptations and
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:23.440]   evils and wrongs. And if it merely gives me forgiveness but leaves me to myself like that,
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:29.680]   well then it's a very incomplete salvation. But thank God it doesn't stop at that. The
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.120]   message that Philip and these other people preached was a message that has a doctrine
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:41.840]   which is called the new birth, regeneration. That God operates in the souls of men, changing
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.560]   them, giving them a new start, giving them a new heart, a new outlook, a new nature,
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:53.520]   new desires. If any men be in Christ he's a new creature. All things have passed away.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:59.880]   Behold all things have become new. This is a part of the message. Very well, that's
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:05.360]   the point at which we've arrived. And I put it like this. The Apostle John says in his
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:11.360]   first epistle chapter 3 verse 8, that the Son of God was manifest, that the Son of God
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:18.920]   came into this world for this grand object, that he might destroy the works of the devil,
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:25.680]   that he might undo all the harm that the devil has done in this world. Now we've been considering
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:31.920]   already you see how he does so, partly, in this personal sense which we've been looking
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:39.440]   at. Now I want to emphasize this. The gospel is primarily personal. It's got to be. The
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:48.200]   first thing it does is to put us right individually with God and enable us to live in this world.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:54.760]   It is primarily personal. But what I want to emphasize tonight is that it is not only
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:08:01.640]   personal. Now there are many people who taunt this evangelical presentation of the gospel
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.680]   for that reason, that they say it's always personal. You people in a world like this
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.880]   are worried about your own little selves, your selfish self-centered, your small-minded,
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:17.520]   as long as you are all right they say. Well our answer to them is this, that until individuals
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.400]   are put right there's not much hope for your world, for the world consists of individuals
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:28.240]   after all. You see there's no such thing as humanity in a sense. It is human beings that
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:34.640]   constitute humanity. And you can't put this country right. You must start with individuals.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.760]   The best periods in the history of this country have been the periods when you've had the
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:44.760]   largest number of Christian people in the nation. And it is still the only hope, as
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:51.280]   I'm going to try to show you. But I say in addition to that, the gospel is not only personal.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:57.160]   There is another aspect to it. There is another element in it. And it's to this that I want
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:04.200]   to call your attention particularly this evening. Now this aspect of the matter is most important
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:10.520]   at the present time. It's always important of course, but I feel it's unusually important
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:18.080]   at this present time for this reason. That owing to some of these modern discoveries,
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:24.000]   one of the most urgent problems before us all is the future of this world. We are thinking
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.240]   of two world wars today. The first world war, well that was bad enough. But the second was
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:37.240]   worse. And if there'll be a third, it'll be worse still. You see the first world war
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.880]   produced the aeroplane and the tank. And that made it much more horrible than it had ever
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:48.040]   been before. Well we know that the last war took it much further than that. What of the
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:53.800]   next? You see we're living in a time when the whole question of the future existence
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:10:00.560]   of this world is very much in the balance. Day by day almost we are hearing about these
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:06.880]   things. These new developments of these bombs and rockets and so on. So that the question
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:12.320]   is a very urgent one at the present time. Is there any future for the world at all?
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:17.760]   This is the most urgent question facing mankind. Is there any future to history? Or are we
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:24.760]   at the end of history? Never has this problem perhaps been quite so urgent and so acute
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:31.720]   as it is just at this present time. That's why I call your attention to all this on this
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:38.720]   particular Sunday. It's observed as Remembrance Sunday. And people have been thinking of wars
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:45.940]   and I trust thinking of the world as it is now and the world as it is going to be. This
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:52.940]   whole question of life in this world and men and existence. Now then, this message, this
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:11:00.680]   Christian gospel has got a great deal to say about this. It is personal but not only personal.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:07.160]   And I want to show you tonight that this gospel really is the only message which tells us
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:12.280]   anything at all that's worth listening to about the future of this world. I want to
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:19.280]   try to show you that. Now come back to my fundamental proposition. 1 John 3 8. The Lord
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:27.800]   Jesus Christ the Son of God came into this world in order to destroy the works of the
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:32.560]   devil. And I want to show you that the works of the devil don't stop at what he makes
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:39.560]   us do as individuals. He has affected the whole world, the whole of mankind, and indeed
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   the whole universe. And I want to show you how the Son of God is on a program which is
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.400]   going to undo completely all the works of the devil. Now let me put it to you like this.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:06.760]   Here we are meeting in this world as we know it to be tonight. My first proposition is
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:13.760]   that the Christian message alone, exclusively alone, gives us any hope with regard to life
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:24.120]   and with regard to this world. Now I've got to start with this. You see we are living
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.840]   in an age when people think it's clever to deny the Christian message and to dismiss
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:34.560]   it as being almost insulting to the modern man. I reply by saying that this gives the
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:41.560]   only hope for life and for this world. It is exclusively the only thing that can help
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:50.040]   us. Let me show you what I mean. The world apart from this is entirely without hope.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:57.400]   The Apostle Paul in writing to the Ephesians, he reminds them of their condition before
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:02.560]   they became Christian. And this is how he puts it. "Wherefore remember that you being
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:08.040]   in time past Gentiles in the flesh who were called uncircumcision by that which is called
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:12.960]   the circumcision in the flesh made by hens, that at that time before they became Christians
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:19.960]   you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:27.080]   the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world." And that is the
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:35.360]   position of the world this evening. It is entirely without hope. But wait a minute,
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:41.640]   let me prove this in detail. It's got to be done. People scoff at this Christian message.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.560]   The majority would think that we are fools in being here and doing what we are doing
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.960]   at this moment. What are they turning to? Well you know, you've been reading about
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:54.560]   it haven't you? A number of them are turning to what they call humanism. There are not
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:00.800]   many I agree. I saw them boasting in the newspaper a fortnight ago that they'd had a meeting
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.720]   here in London just over a fortnight ago. I think it was a fortnight yesterday. And
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:11.240]   they were boasting in the paper that as a result of their having their four best speakers
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:16.520]   in the country addressing a meeting in Holborn amongst them Professor A.J. Eyre, they'd
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:22.320]   had an audience of 800 people. They're not doing too well are they? However, I'm concerned
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:27.600]   rather with what they have to offer to people. I'm not surprised that they don't get more
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:34.120]   than that in spite of all their intellectualism. For what has humanism to offer to mankind
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:41.120]   this evening? That's the question. Forget all its negative criticisms of the Christian
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:46.320]   faith for which there is a complete answer, but let's ask them a question. What have
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:53.320]   they got to offer? What have they got to give us? And the answer is nothing. For this reason
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:15:00.480]   they say, this is humanism, that there is nothing beyond men. There is nothing outside
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:07.480]   men. Men is the biggest being in the universe they say. And there is nothing outside the
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:14.640]   mind and the thought and the scope of men. Nothing at all. They rule out God, they rule
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:20.640]   out the supernatural completely. Nothing is true except that which men can understand
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:27.120]   and comprehend. Men is the measure of everything. Very well, go to them and ask them what is
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:32.240]   their remedy for the world as it is this evening? What is their remedy for this world torn by
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.840]   two world wars piling up its arm? What have they got to offer? They've got nothing to
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:43.760]   offer except to appeal to men and women to think and to be reasonable and to behave in
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:50.760]   a rational manner. Well now, I could even examine that as to what they mean by rationality.
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:56.840]   For many of them believe that a man decides his own morals and his own way of behaving.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.520]   And if he chooses to leave his wife and children and go and commit adultery with another woman,
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:06.520]   there's nothing wrong in it as long as he wants to do it and feels it's right for him.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:11.480]   And you see, they are surprised that people fight, though they do things like that themselves
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.920]   as individuals. You see, you've got to start with the individual, my friend. It's a very
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:20.680]   easy thing to denounce war or what other people are doing in different parts of the world.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:27.520]   It's a very much more difficult thing to live a decent and a clean and a pure life yourself.
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:33.880]   So it all ends in talk. They've nothing to give us. It's the same with philosophy. Do
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:40.880]   you know when this gospel first was preached? When the Son of God came into this world,
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:47.880]   nearly two thousand years ago, it was a world which knew a great deal about philosophy.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:53.560]   The Greeks, the great Greek philosophers, had all taught before our Lord ever came into
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:17:00.560]   this world. But you see, it couldn't help people. It hadn't solved the problem. The
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:05.080]   statistics of those days, and remember they had statistics then, the statistics of those
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:12.080]   days showed that the percentage of suicides amongst philosophers was the highest of all.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:19.120]   The percentage. That's the bankruptcy. They didn't understand. But what have they got
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:23.640]   to offer at its best? Well, you remember, this book of Acts tells us they were divided
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:29.000]   into Stoics and Epicureans. They were able people, I don't want to detract from their
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.920]   ability and their cleverness. But what have they got to offer? What have the Stoics got
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.880]   to offer to people in a world like this? It was only this. They said, you know, all you
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:43.880]   can do is to cleanse your teeth, rest back your shoulders, be a man, stand up to it.
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:49.400]   Philosophy of courage, the philosophy of grit. That's still what the philosophers have got
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:55.360]   to offer us today. They don't pretend that the world is going to be better, these Stoics.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:18:00.560]   They say the only thing to do is to just decide to go through with it and not to whimper and
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:05.680]   cry and run away. Be a man. We had it, of course, during the war at Moseum. London can
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:11.360]   take it. Britain can take it. That's Stoicism. But there's no comfort there. There's no
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:16.520]   hope there. You just put up with it. You resign yourself to your fate and you make the best
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:22.000]   of a bad job. I agree, it's better than cowardice, but it doesn't give you any hope. It's exactly
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   the same with Epicureanism. Live for the moment. Enjoy yourself as best you can. Gather your
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:35.800]   rosebuds while you may, and so you leave it. There it is, and your modern philosophies
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:40.880]   have not added a single thing to that. They're all variants of these ancient teachings which
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:46.680]   were already proved to be bankrupt before the Son of God ever came into this world.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:53.680]   Politics. Is politics going to put the world right? Well, I needn't stay with that this
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:58.760]   evening. You know, I'm old enough to remember when people used to think that politics could
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:04.760]   do everything. I'm old enough to remember the days when these politicians whose biographies
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:10.520]   are now being written were rarely worshipped. People rarely thought they could put the world
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:15.760]   right. I knew men and women who turned their backs on Christianity and the Church, that
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:21.840]   politicians were going to put the world right. As I say, there's no need to answer that tonight.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.920]   It may be one of the great problems in this country, that we have so lost faith in politicians
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:32.960]   that that's become a menace in itself. However, I needn't waste your time. What about Christian
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:39.960]   pacifism? Equally useless, equally hopeless. Why not? Why is it? Because it's not Christian
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:46.800]   to start with. Some people think that that is Christianity. A message that we must put
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:51.240]   an end to war. And if we can only persuade people to do this, then we will put an end
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:56.040]   to war. We must do this, and this is the one message that is needed. But you know, that's
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:03.040]   nothing but humanism, using Christian terms. It's not Christianity at all. Our Lord never
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:10.600]   taught that he was going to banish war. He said the exact opposite. Isn't it amazing
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:15.480]   that people can read the New Testament and still represent him as a pacifist, and say
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:20.760]   that the Christian message is a message to abolish war. It was the Lord himself who said
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:27.760]   that right until the end there shall be wars and rumors of wars. That evil men would wax
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:35.520]   worse and worse. What a true prophet he was. He said that, remember, nearly two thousand
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:41.120]   years ago. He said that it was a world of troubles, a world of sorrow, a world of sin,
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:46.840]   a world of shame. He never said that he was going to deliver the world and make it a better
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:53.840]   place in that sense. Never. He said the exact opposite. Indeed, he said, quite plainly,
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:21:00.760]   that a time would come just before he would return again. When people would ask the question,
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:07.760]   when the Son of Man is come, shall he find the faith in the earth? This is what he said.
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:15.160]   As it was in the days of Noah, the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking,
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:20.640]   marrying and giving in marriage, and knew not until the flood came, even so shall it
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:27.640]   be in the days of the Son of Man. He said exactly the same at Sodom and Gomorrah. They
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:32.640]   were thoughtless and heedless. Life had never been so wonderful. You know, they were having
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:38.720]   a very good time in the cities of the plain. It was a sort of modern London, modern New
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:44.800]   York, modern Paris. There's nothing new in all this. They were experts. Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:50.320]   They knew how to do it. These clever fellows have nothing to teach them. They were experts
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:55.280]   in it all. The perversions, all that the modern man seems to be craving for, and he wants
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:02.280]   to make legal. They knew how to do it. And they knew not until destruction began to fall
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:11.760]   upon them. And when they awoke, it was too late. Well, now, my friends, this, you see,
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.440]   is the position. These are the things to which the world is pinning its faith tonight, and
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:22.760]   there's no hope there. It's all disproved by history. The state of the world disproves
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:29.760]   it tonight. All history demonstrates this. And if all history in the past has demonstrated
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:36.400]   this, what of the present hour? As I told you just now, the crisis is more acute than
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:43.400]   it has ever been. A book has come out quite recently called The Myth of the Machine. It's
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.880]   by Professor Lewis Mumford, a man who studied this problem all his life. He's not a Christian,
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:54.920]   he's a humanist really. But you see, he's terrified of the machine, and what the machine
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:23:00.040]   is going to do to men. There is no doubt men have become the victim of his own inventions.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:04.240]   Our knowledge and our ability in a scientific sense has grown and grown in a phenomenal
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.400]   manner. But the whole problem of the world at the moment is this, that there has not
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:13.600]   been a commensurate growth in morality, in understanding, in knowing how to use and to
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:19.440]   harness these marvelous discoveries for beneficent purposes. And this is the whole problem of
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:26.440]   the world. Is man going to destroy himself with his own machines? And the world has got
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:34.080]   no hope to offer whatsoever. It is completely bankrupt. It's staggering in the midst of
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:41.000]   the problem. And there is no one who can give us a message of hope. I say there is only
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.360]   one message of hope in the world tonight. It is the message that Philip preached when
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:53.040]   he went down to that city of Samaria. It is the message that was gossiped by these ordinary
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:24:00.040]   people that were scattered abroad from Jerusalem as the result of the persecution. What is
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:07.160]   it? How does this Christian message deal with the world as it is tonight? Well, the first
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:14.160]   answer I give is this. This holds out hope, and it is the only thing that holds out hope,
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:21.720]   because it is the only teaching that explains the state of the world and the state of man
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:29.000]   in it. Now, to me this is elementary. If you cannot
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.880]   diagnose the condition, how can you treat it? If the world is all wrong in its explanation
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:41.000]   of the cause of our troubles, how can it possibly put them right? That's the whole trouble.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.600]   You see, they're tinkering away at symptoms, fiddling away with particular problems when
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:52.880]   the whole thing is wrong. That's the tragedy of the world. But let me show you a little
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:59.880]   in detail what I mean. I say that this message alone has an explanation of our troubles and
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:06.240]   the cause of our ills. What is it? Now, here it tells. This is the message of the Bible.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:13.240]   It's as plain as anything can be. The world is as it is tonight, because it is being controlled
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   by the powers of evil. That's the explanation. I have referred to this several Sunday nights,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:31.280]   more in detail, and more in the personal aspect. I want you to look at it more in general this
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:38.280]   evening. The world is as it is tonight, because there is an evil power in control of it. I
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:48.080]   know this sounds fatuous and utterly ridiculous to the modern men. That doesn't surprise
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:53.880]   me. Look at his behavior. He can't think straight. That's his whole trouble. And he's blind,
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:58.880]   at the most important point of all, in the spiritual sense. But this is the great message
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:03.880]   of the Bible, that this world is controlled by evil powers and forces.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:10.880]   Oh, let me quote it again, the apostle Paul in Ephesians 6. "We wrestle not against
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:18.280]   flesh and blood." Man is not the problem. What then? Oh, against principalities, against
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:25.200]   powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:32.200]   in high or in heavenly places. There is a power that Paul calls the God of this world,
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:40.760]   the Prince of the power of the air, the Spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:48.400]   And do you know you cannot explain human history without that? It is impossible. According
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:54.240]   to this teaching here, this is what happened. God made a world and he made it perfect, made
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:58.240]   men perfect, put him in it. Why have things gone wrong? Why is the world as it is? It
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:05.080]   is entirely due to the fact that a bright angelic being created by God rose in jealousy
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:10.280]   against God and rebelled against him and persuaded others to follow him, and he fell. That's
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:17.280]   the devil. And he came into this perfect world that God had made and he tempted men and succeeded
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:25.320]   in persuading them to disobey God and to rebel against him. And the result of that was that
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:31.200]   men fell. He not only fell into sin, but he fell from God. He fell from the position in
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:37.760]   which God had placed him. He became a fallen creature. Now this is the most serious thing
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:44.760]   of all. For instance, take this question of wars. Here we are, thinking of two world wars.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:51.200]   Why are there wars? Why is there such a thing as fighting and warfare? Well let the Apostle
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:58.200]   James answer the question. From whence come wars and fighting among you? Here's the question.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:05.200]   Oh, you see, there's no difficulty about that. Wars come because a Mussolini arose, because
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:13.840]   a Hitler arose, or because a Kaiser had arisen in the First World War. That's why wars come.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:19.360]   And we explain the whole thing. Of course, there are these clever people who say it's
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:24.920]   politics, politicians. But then I ask my question, why did Hitler behave as he did? Why did the
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:30.040]   Kaiser? Why do the politicians behave as you say they do? Why should they? They're men
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:35.080]   and women like you are. Why should they all be bad and you and I so good? Why can we avoid
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:39.440]   all responsibility by saying it's just these other people all along? And they're the leading
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:44.280]   people in all the nations. It's governments that, you know, start wars and fight them.
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:48.360]   Are they fools? Are they the worst people in the nation? Well if so, why did you elect
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:52.880]   them? You see, it all comes back to you and to me, doesn't it? And the Bible says so.
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:58.160]   Whence come wars and fighting among you? Here's the answer. Come they not hence even of your
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:04.280]   lusts that war in you are members? You lust and have not, you kill and desire to have
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:09.200]   and cannot obtain. You fight and war and you have not because you ask not. You ask and
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:15.000]   receive not because you ask amiss that you may consume it upon your lusts. You adulterers
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   and adulteresses know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity against God. Whosoever
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:29.200]   therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God. What's all that mean? It
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:36.600]   means this. Nations are just the individual writ large. What does the individual do? What's
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:47.720]   the outlook of the individual? The outlook of the individual is this, isn't it? I first,
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:53.560]   always. It's what I want that matters. And if another man has got what I want, I must
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:30:00.560]   have it. My desires, my lusts, my passions. Isn't that how the world is living at the
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:06.960]   present time? Now that's what individuals are doing. And that's what countries are
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:12.560]   doing. The country is just the individual writ large. So it's no use you were detaching
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:17.840]   yourself from society and saying the politicians or the country is doing this or that. It's
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:22.480]   the very thing you are doing in private. They're only doing on a big scale what you are doing
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:29.480]   in your own little sphere. Lust, greed, passion, desire, sin, evil, anger, hatred, malice,
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:39.160]   spite, ambition, all the things I was dealing with last Sunday night which are in men as
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:44.760]   the result of the fall, as the result of sin. This is it. Man individually is formed and
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:50.680]   governed by lust and desire and all these things. So are nations. Hence your wars, hence
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:56.920]   your fights, hence your jealousies, hence capital and labor, hence the rivalries between
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:03.120]   unions, hence the fact that men in the unions don't trust their leaders. Nobody trusts anybody
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:07.240]   because they say he's out for himself, he's been bought and the other man's ready to be
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:13.320]   bought himself. This is the trouble with the whole of society and with the whole world.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:18.240]   And you're alone, you're told that. You're not told it anywhere else. It's the only adequate
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:24.600]   explanation. Man as the result of sin and the fall is under the dominion of sin and
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:31.600]   of Satan. And it is a dominion. Not only is this true, according to this teaching the
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:42.880]   whole universe has suffered as the result of men's sin. Now this is a thing we don't remember
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:49.400]   as we should. But the teaching of the Bible is to this effect. That God not only made
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:56.400]   men perfect, but he made him the Lord of creation. He set him over the whole of creation. And
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:03.400]   it tells us this further, that when men sinned, not only was he punished, the whole of creation
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:09.760]   was punished. Now you'll find all that in the third chapter of the book of Genesis.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:16.760]   God cursed the ground. And men who have lived happily, easily, just picking fruit and eating
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:23.760]   it now has to work and to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow. And thorns and briars
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:30.320]   come in. Do you know, something has come in even into brute nature. Animals were not meant
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:35.960]   to fight and to devour one another. This was not natural. This is unnatural. The whole
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:42.600]   universe, the whole of creation has been cursed as a part of man's punishment. And you can't
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:48.440]   understand your world and your universe apart from this. Now this is the cause of the explanation
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:55.000]   of all our problems. And therefore you see, it follows of necessity how utterly useless
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.720]   it is to appeal to men to put things right. Man you know is governed by something much
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:06.400]   bigger and deeper than his mind and his intellect. He's governed by his lusts. He's governed
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:12.400]   by his desires and by his passions. Able men, knowledgeable men, well-trained, cultured
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:19.000]   men are no more immune to the lusts of the flesh than is the most ignorant fellow. Your
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   duke and your laborer are drunk together. There is no difference. So you see it is utterly
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:34.760]   useless and vain to appeal to men to put his world right. It's the one thing he can't
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:39.560]   do. He would if he could. He's trying to do it. He has been trying. That's the whole
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:45.640]   story of civilization. But he cannot do it. The powers that are within him are greater
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:52.640]   than himself. Evil forces, drives, passions, lusts and the devils and the devil over it
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:59.280]   all under the dominion of sin and of Satan. And man cannot liberate himself. He's tried
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:06.280]   in vain throughout the running centuries. And to ask him to do so is to display a noturable
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:11.160]   ignorance of history and the true nature of man. To expect him to do so is still greater
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:18.160]   folly. The whole history proves that he cannot do it and he never will do it. But thank God
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:28.520]   I'm here to preach the message of God, the Word. Preach Christ to them. Thank God for
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:36.640]   this blessed name. Preach Christ to them. Preach the kingdom of God and the things concerning
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:45.120]   Jesus Christ. He's the only hope for the world, the only one who holds out any hope for us
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:52.840]   on this Remembrance Day evening. But it's most important that we should understand how
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:59.840]   he does it. Let me show you. He does not do it by his teaching alone. That's the fallacy,
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:11.080]   that's the error. Many people think, "Oh yes, you're right, Jesus Christ does it and he
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:17.120]   does it by his teaching. And he teaches that as his teaching is applied gradually by men,
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:22.760]   the world will gradually become a better and a better place. Until eventually men will
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:27.560]   turn their swords into plowshares and the wars will be banished and the world will be
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:32.880]   perfect. The teaching of Jesus is going to act as a leaven, it's going to change the
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:39.880]   whole world and we're going to solve all our problems. That is not the truth. That, you
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:47.120]   see, is nothing but to turn the gospel of Jesus Christ into a political or a social
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:53.960]   program which you and I have got to put into practice. And as I've already shown you, it
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:36:00.440]   is the one thing that we cannot do. There is no greater denial, I want to say it again
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:06.440]   on this Remembrance Day, there is no greater denial of the Christian gospel than what calls
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:13.440]   itself Christian pacifism. It's neither Christian nor truth. It is a delusion. It is unutterable
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:20.600]   folly. It is the one thing men cannot do. If he could, Christ would never have come
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:27.600]   into the world. He came into the world because man cannot, because man is incapable, because
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:35.000]   man is lost, because man is completely helpless. He would never have come into the world but
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:41.400]   for that. If exhortation and teaching and examples could have saved the world, the law
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:46.200]   given through Moses would have done it. It couldn't do it, and it was known when it
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:50.920]   was given that it couldn't. What the law could not do, in that it was weak through
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:56.960]   the flesh. There is the answer. Very well. How does our Lord give us hope? I say not
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:03.960]   only by his teaching. What then? Oh, by what he has done. By what he's still doing. By
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:11.120]   what he's still doing, and still more, by what he is yet going to do. What do I mean?
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:18.200]   Well let me give it to you in summary form. He's the only hope for the world tonight.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:23.200]   Why? Well, listen. Look what he did while he was here on earth. Do you know what he
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:30.200]   did? He conquered evil. He conquered the devil. Look at all your great men in the Old Testament,
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:36.120]   your patriots, your great saints. Every one of them sinned. Every one of them was defeated
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:41.640]   by the devil. Every single one of them. The devil is the god of this world. He gets everybody
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:48.640]   down and we all become the slaves of the devil by nature. The world has only seen one person
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:55.800]   that could meet the devil and conquer him. Jesus Christ. Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:03.800]   God. He was tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin. The devil couldn't
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:08.720]   get him down. He defeated him. He repulsed him. Read the account of his temptation. He's
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:13.640]   already conquered our greatest enemy, our arch enemy. But you notice he also did something
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:19.280]   else while he was here. There were poor people, as we read here, there were in Samaria, who
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:26.280]   were devil possessed. You know, devils can possess people. They can take hold of people
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:32.720]   and take hold of the personality without the people realizing it. And there were many
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:37.560]   cases of this when our Lord was in this world. He could drive out devils. He was the master
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:42.480]   of devils. And they trembled when they knew he was coming. "Who are you?" they said.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:47.120]   "You are Jesus of Nazareth. Have you come to send us to hell before the time that devils
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:52.200]   recognized him when men couldn't? They knew him. They knew he was their master. He has
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:58.000]   absolute authority over them. He cast out devils. He healed diseases." That was in the
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   days of his flesh. But you know, my friends, this is a message for remembrance Sunday.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:15.720]   He's not only conquered the devil and all his emissaries and agents and forces, he's
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:22.720]   conquered the devil's final weapon, what's that? Death. Death in the grave. And he conquered
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:30.760]   them by dying on the cross. The devil was very pleased with himself when he got men
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:36.880]   and women to condemn Jesus Christ to death and to nail him on the tree. He thought his
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:41.920]   arch enemy was finished. "Here he is," he says, "dying on a cross. We've got him. We've
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:48.040]   finished him. He even couldn't stand against us." And there was triumph in hell when Jesus
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:53.840]   Christ was dying on the cross. But they made the biggest mistake of their lives. Listen
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:58.640]   to Paul saying what happened on the cross. "Blooding out the handwriting of ordinances
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:03.080]   that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way, nailing it
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:10.080]   to his cross. And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them open to
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:18.080]   him, triumphing over them in it." They thought that was the end. It wasn't. He died. They
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:24.240]   took down the body and they buried it in a grave. But it wasn't the end of the story.
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:29.240]   He burst us under the bands of death. He arose triumphant over the grave. Death couldn't
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:35.240]   hold him. He's the Son of God. He has all power. Death, grave, hell, nothing. He burst
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:41.360]   it all. He rose triumphant. The resurrection is the pronouncement and proclamation of the
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:48.360]   final defeat of the devil and all his forces. The last enemy has been conquered, my dear
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:52.480]   friends. Your humanist can't tell you anything about death. He doesn't know. He's got to
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.920]   die himself. He doesn't know what's going to happen. He thinks it's the end. It isn't
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:01.400]   the end. Nobody can see through death. Here is one who can only see through it. He's passed
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:08.400]   through it. "Oh death, where is thy sting? Oh grave, where is thy victory? The sting
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:15.600]   of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be unto God who giveth
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:22.280]   us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ." My dear friends, he's done this. It's an
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:27.800]   accomplished fact. It's taking place. Where is he now? Oh, he's seated at the right hand
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:34.800]   of God in the glory of everlasting hope for the world. This is the only hope for the world.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:41.360]   There's no other. You see men, statesmen, philosophers, everybody fumbling, baffled,
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:46.400]   bewildered, nothing to say to us, no hope to give us. Do you want to know the only hope
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:53.400]   tonight? Here it is. "Jesus came and spake unto them." This is after his resurrection.
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:42:03.360]   "Jesus came and spake unto them saying, 'All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.'"
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:13.680]   And that is the truth. That is his position. God raised him from the dead, says Paul, to
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:20.680]   the Ephesians and set him high in the heavenly places, far above all authority and dominion
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:28.800]   and might and power and every name that is named, not only in this world but also in
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:35.800]   that which is to come, and hath put all things under his feet. Here it is. Your great world
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:45.520]   and your bombs and your governments and your rockets, it's all under his feet. All power,
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:52.480]   all authority is given unto him in heaven and in earth. Having finished his work here
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:57.480]   on earth, he ascended into heaven and he sat on the right hand of the majesty on high.
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:03.600]   All power is in his hands. The universe is his. History is in his hands. What's he doing?
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:10.600]   He is waiting, sitting, until his enemies shall be made his footstool. He's acting.
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:19.080]   He's acting through a meeting like this, you know. He's calling people out of the world
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:25.080]   and from the dominion of sin and of Satan, calling us out, setting us apart in his kingdom.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:30.760]   He's preparing for something which is coming. He's been doing this for nearly two thousand
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:35.240]   years. That's why the gospel is preached. That's why I'm called to preach, to warn you of these
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:40.040]   things, to tell you about him, how you can be delivered here and now from the thralldom
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:45.640]   of this world and its final hopelessness and uselessness. You can be delivered out of it
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:50.360]   now. What for? Well, this brings me to the next thing. That's what he's doing now. But
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:57.360]   oh, what is he going to do? He's going to come again. This is the blessed hope. You
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:07.040]   know, were it not for this, I would have no hope whatsoever. But here is the hope. All
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:11.680]   authority is in his hands. The world is his. I don't understand why he permits things to
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:16.880]   happen, but he does. This is part of his way, perhaps, of convincing us of our sin, seeing
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:21.280]   what we make of life when he leaves us to ourselves. It's his love, perhaps, to allow
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:26.400]   us to suffer hell in order that we may awaken to the folly of what we are doing and turn back to
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:34.400]   him. I don't know. It's possible. The goodness of God leadeth us to repentance. But what I know
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:41.400]   is this, that he's going to come back into this world and he will judge all his enemies.
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:49.280]   He will destroy all evil. He will destroy the devil and all his forces. He's already
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:55.560]   defeated them. He will destroy them finally and all who belong to them. Let there be no
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:45:00.520]   mistake about this. Whosoever follows the devil and the way of the world and rejects
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:07.520]   Christ and his message will go to eternal perdition. But then he will purge evil and
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:17.720]   all the effects of evil entirely out of the entire universe. He talked himself about a
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:25.440]   great regeneration that is going to take place in the whole universe when he, the son of
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:32.440]   men, will return into this world. And he's going to do this, my dear friends. This is
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:37.560]   the great message of the whole of the Bible and it's all summed up as it were in the last
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:42.880]   book, the book of Revelation. Listen to it. This is the kind of proclamation which it
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:48.040]   makes. Here's a prophecy of what's going to happen. "And the four and twenty elders which
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:53.960]   sat before God in their seats fell on their faces and worshipped God saying, 'We give
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:59.920]   thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art and was and are to come, because thou hast
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:06.080]   taken to thee thy great power and hast reigned.' And the nations were angry." Of course they
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:10.720]   are. We are seeing it now. "And thy wrath is come and the time of the dead that they
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:15.280]   should be judged and that thou shouldest give reward. And to thy servants the prophets and
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:21.360]   to the saints and them that fear thy name, small and great, and shouldest destroy them
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:28.040]   which would destroy the earth. And the temple of God was opened in heaven and they were
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:33.560]   seen in his temple the ark of his testament. And there were lightnings and vices and thunderings
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:38.840]   and an earthquake and great hail." My dear friends, there is going to be a new heavens
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:45.320]   and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. This is the only hope. Not as a result of
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:50.440]   political action, not as the result of good resolutions on the part of men or of parliaments
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:56.160]   or of nations. No, no. The coming again of the Son of God. It's the only hope. And he's
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:00.520]   coming and he's going to destroy all his enemies and all who belong to them. And he's
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:04.320]   going to make a new heaven and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. And all who
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:10.680]   believe in him, well, they'll be in it. We will be changed. Our very bodies will be glorified.
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:15.880]   We'll be like him and we'll be reigning with him and judging with him. And all the wonderful
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:23.800]   and the blessed results of all this. Let me read you again some of these marvelous descriptions
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:30.640]   which tell us of what we can be looking forward to tonight. "Therefore are they before the
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:36.840]   throne of God, men and women like ourselves. Therefore are they before the throne of God
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:42.600]   and serve him day and night in his temple. And he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:49.640]   among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the sun lighten
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:54.880]   them nor any heat. For the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:48:01.920]   shall lead them into living fountains of waters. And God shall wipe away all tears from their
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:06.800]   eyes. No more remembrance of this. No more weeping, no more sighing, no more sorrow.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:16.560]   It'll all have gone, finished, once and forever." And you know the whole of creation is going
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:23.440]   to benefit from it. The whole of creation. Do you remember that glorious prophecy of
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:30.600]   the prophet Isaiah? This is what's going to happen as certainly as we are here this evening.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:36.040]   The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid and
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:40.640]   the calf and the young lion and the fatling together and a little child shall lead them.
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:44.600]   And the cow and the bear shall feed. Their young ones shall lie down together and the
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:49.960]   lion shall eat straw like the ox. And the sucking child shall play in the hole of the
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:55.320]   asp. And the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice's den. They shall not hurt
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:49:02.720]   nor destroy in all my holy mountain. For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:12.000]   Lord as the waters cover the sea. Oh blessed glorious day. It's coming. The whole of creation
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.680]   says Paul at the present time is groaning and traveling in pain together until now.
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:22.040]   But you know the very creature of the creation is also going to be delivered from the bondage
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:29.600]   of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. This is what is coming.
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:35.560]   And what I read to you at the beginning out of that 21st and 22nd chapters of the book
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:40.280]   of Revelation. Behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he shall dwell with them and
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:45.280]   they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:49.920]   wipe away all tears from their eyes. There shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:58.400]   crying. There shall be no more any pain for the former things are passed away, gone forever.
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:07.840]   The devil defeated consigned to eternal perdition and the whole universe, not only men who believe
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:18.160]   in him, but the whole cosmos restored, perfected, regenerated, glorified. And there we shall
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:25.120]   be forever and forever with him, the blessed and the glorious God. My friends, this is
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:30.440]   the only hope and it is a certain hope. How do I know it's certain? How do I know that
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:35.560]   this isn't all some kind of fairy tale, some marvelous fantasy? Do you know how I
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:41.080]   know it? I know it like this. This is a realistic message. It tells you the plain and varnished
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:45.600]   truth about yourself and about your world and also about God and his purpose and his
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:54.000]   plan. This is truth. The certainty of the future is based upon what has already happened.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.760]   What has happened? Well, look at this book, Fulfilled Prophecy. God sent a way back at
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:02.760]   the beginning. He sent a deliverer centuries past. People said, "Where's the promise
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:08.040]   of his coming?" But again, read your prophecies concerning the babe of Bethlehem, how correct
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:12.400]   they are in details, eight centuries before it happened. Fulfilled Prophecy. That's
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:17.240]   why I say it's certain. Look at him when he came into this world. Look at his mastery
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:22.400]   over evil, mastery over the devils. Look at his conquest of death and resurrection. These
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:28.000]   are facts. Till he preached the fact of the resurrection, Jesus and the resurrection.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.080]   It wasn't a theory. He said, "We are witnesses of these things." They'd seen him alive.
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:39.000]   They'd seen him dead. They'd seen him buried. They'd seen him risen. These are facts.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:44.280]   And the whole subsequent history of the church and her story, which is only explicable in
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:49.360]   terms of the power of the risen Christ. There wouldn't be such a thing as the church tonight
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:53.920]   were it not that he has kept her going. People like you and myself would have wrecked the
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:52:00.920]   church centuries ago. He keeps it going. He sends revivals and renews his people. Why?
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:09.560]   Well, because he's unchangeable. Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever. My
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:14.440]   friend, the thing is certain. I want to leave you with a question. What does all this mean
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:19.920]   to you? How do you react to all this? Do you believe all this? Are you tempted to say,
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:23.360]   "But you are as pessimistic as everybody else. I thought I'd get a message tonight
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:26.840]   that would put me right and put everything right in the world." Did you? Well, then
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:31.640]   you've misunderstood the gospel. There is no such message. Nobody else has got it. I
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:36.640]   haven't got it. I tell you that you're in a world of sin and shame, a world of sorrow,
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:42.800]   a world of lust and passion and evil, and it'll remain like this until he comes again.
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:48.200]   But believe on him now. You can be delivered from it. You can be delivered from its power.
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:53.400]   You can get out from the dominion of sin and Satan. You can be set free, even while you're
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:53:01.000]   here, but beyond it. When he comes again, I've told you what you can look forward to.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:08.080]   I've told you of the glory that is coming. And if you don't believe it, you have nothing
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:11.680]   to look forward to but a perpetuation of what you've got now, only that it'll be ten
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:17.000]   times worse. And there'll be no relief, no intermission, no hope of its ever ending.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:24.840]   It'll be eternal destruction from the presence of the Lord. That's the message. If you believe
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:29.680]   in Jesus Christ and his great salvation, there is hope for you now, there is hope for you
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:39.680]   for all eternity. Hope in life, hope in death, hope forever and forever. Peace and joy now
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:51.240]   immediately and peace forever. Everlasting consolation and good hope. The only hope through
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:59.760]   Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Savior and the Lord of all who believe in him. Do you
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:09.640]   believe in him? The only hope for you individually, the only hope for the cosmos. The Son of God
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:16.440]   the Savior of the world. Amen.
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:20.520]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
