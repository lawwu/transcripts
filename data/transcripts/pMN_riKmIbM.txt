[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040]   You have to ask yourself like a really hard question,
[00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.680]   which is, is this truly where I want to be?
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.260]   Meaning, are you in the right place,
[00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.200]   but have the wrong role or set of responsibilities?
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.520]   And if the answer is yes, like I love the idea
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.560]   and prospect of this career/organization that I'm at,
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.020]   I'm just not where I wanna be career-wise,
[00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.360]   or I'm not where I wanna be in a certain position
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.240]   that I'd actually like to eventually have.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.560]   And if that's the question, like have you asked for that?
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.440]   Have you given yourself enough time?
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.400]   Have you had those honest, really transparent conversations
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.640]   with whoever your boss is and said,
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.160]   hey, this is where I'm looking to be.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.660]   What do you think my prospect is here over the long-term?
[00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.520]   What can I do to achieve or hit certain milestones
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.720]   that would make me eligible for this increase in role
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.280]   or responsibility here inside of this organization?
