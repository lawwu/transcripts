[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.460]   We come this evening to a consideration of the last verse, namely the 25th verse in the
[00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.040]   7th chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.960]   I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.840]   So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.840]   sin.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.160]   I say we come to this because we have been attempting to deal with the previous verses
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:38.200]   in this most extraordinary, remarkable, and in many respects complex statement.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:46.600]   And we failed to deal with this particular verse in detail last Friday evening.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.600]   Now we nevertheless need not spend much time with this particular verse.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.680]   You notice that it's divided into two sections.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.760]   The first section, I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.680]   Now that I have been describing, as you will remember, as a kind of ejaculation.
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:16.080]   The apostle suddenly is carried away by what Charles Hodge describes so rightly as a strong
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.160]   and sudden emotion of gratitude.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.440]   And as is his custom, he expresses it.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.400]   We've had many occasions to observe and to emphasize the fact that the great apostle
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.960]   was not over punctilious in the matter of style.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.320]   He was a man who was free and who enjoyed the freedom of the spirit.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.660]   Not a mere writer, not a mere literary man, not concerned primarily to produce a masterpiece
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.660]   of literature.
[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.800]   He was much more concerned about what he said than the way in which he said it.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.360]   We can be quite sure of that, that the apostle never cultivated art for art's sake, never
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.160]   attempted eloquence for the sake of eloquence.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:04.280]   And he proves that by these anacaluthas, so-called, these interruptions.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.360]   And he does it also very frequently by bursting forth into praise or into thanksgiving.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.920]   He finds it difficult always, one gathers, to mention the name of our Lord without uttering
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.520]   some kind of apostrophe.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.000]   He interrupts what he's saying for the moment, but he's just carried away by the strength
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.240]   and the depth of his deep emotions.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.480]   And here it seems to me there can be no question at all as to the fact that that is what he
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.480]   is doing.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.840]   He interrupts what he's saying, and of course the interruption came in this way.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.640]   This is the kind of thing he had been saying.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.800]   I delight in the law of God after the inward men, but I see another law in my members,
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.880]   warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.160]   is in my members.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.740]   O wretched men that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.180]   And he couldn't restrain himself.
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.560]   I thank God, he says, he knows, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:17.600]   It is then, I say, a kind of sudden outburst, an ejaculation, not an essential part of what
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.840]   he's arguing and what he's saying.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.880]   Indeed, I think we can prove that quite simply by looking now immediately at the rest of
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.720]   the verse where he goes on to say so then.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.400]   With the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.400]   How does this prove it?
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.200]   Well, it proves it in this way, that if the expression I thank God through Jesus Christ
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.240]   our Lord is an essential part of the statement and the argument, it works out like this,
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.840]   that he is saying, I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.840]   For what?
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.520]   Well, for the fact that I myself with my mind serve the law of God, but with the flesh the
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.480]   law of sin.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.640]   Now that is something surely that the apostle could never say.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.700]   Charles Hodge, of course, is so absolutely right at this point.
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.480]   He says that that would be a most unnatural combination of statements.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.640]   Yes, and that is a very striking understatement on the part of Charles Hodge.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.920]   It would not only be unnatural, an unnatural combination, it is an impossible combination
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.960]   it seems to me.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.320]   Because if you take them as being directly connected like this, well, you pass from this
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:41.740]   thanksgiving to God in the name of Jesus Christ for the fact that you are in this condition
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.000]   that he proceeds to describe.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.040]   Surely the thing is something which is quite impossible.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.000]   The only commentator as far as I am aware who attempts to say that that is the order,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.320]   I am truly sorry to have to say, is Robert Haldane.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.280]   He is quite consistent with himself right through.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.040]   As I have suggested all along, he really went wrong in the second verse of chapter 6, and
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.440]   therefore he has got to be consistent ever since.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:16.600]   He interprets "who shall deliver me" in verse 24 as referring entirely to the future.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.360]   So what he says, the apostle is saying here at the beginning of verse 25 is this, "I
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.920]   thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord that I shall be delivered."
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.720]   Not that I am no any deliverance now, but that when I come to die, he really does say
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.840]   that "I shall be delivered."
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.320]   Not in this world, but in the next.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.140]   So you see, he therefore maintains some kind of connection.
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.640]   But it does seem to me that this is indeed quite an impossible interpretation of these
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.640]   statements.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.640]   Very well.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:58.680]   The "so then" in the second statement is nothing but a summing up of what the apostle
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.640]   had previously been saying.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:07.520]   And it is a very perfect summing up of what he has been saying in a sense from verse 14
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.520]   onwards.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.960]   He is back again, making another statement about this duality.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.400]   This is then, he says, what it amounts to.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:25.080]   That with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.840]   It's the old duality that he's already been telling us about.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.200]   There is only one difficulty.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.360]   It's not a vital one.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.040]   It's more or less a mechanical one in the matter of interpretation here.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:47.000]   With regard to this "I myself," he undoubtedly is referring to himself, the person.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.200]   But this is the problem.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:55.960]   Does the "I myself" govern both the statements, or the two parts of the one general statement?
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.760]   In other words, he is saying this.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:03.480]   So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh I myself serve
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.800]   the law of sin.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:13.080]   And it seems to me that in the light of verse 23 we really must say that.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.460]   It isn't one of those vital points, but it is a point of which we've got to look at.
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.000]   We can't decide it for certain.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.480]   Nobody can be sure of this.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:28.600]   You may say, if you prefer it, that he's identifying himself as he wants to do with the mind.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.540]   He says that's the real "I" now.
[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.500]   That is the possible interpretation.
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:38.560]   But he's saying, "I myself, my real desire and will is to identify myself with the mind,
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.560]   but I find this other law in my members.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:50.420]   And so, I've got to admit it, that I serve the law of sin also."
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.560]   In other words, he is not disclaiming responsibility, as we saw before.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.580]   It is an unchristian thing to do that.
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.640]   It is he who sins, and not only his flesh.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:04.640]   He has told us, I know, in these curious statements, "It is not I, but sin that dwelleth in me."
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.120]   Well, then we've seen the explanation of that.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.140]   He as a person is responsible for everything he does.
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:19.640]   But he is aware of these two "me's" within him that we saw in verse 18.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.520]   Very well, though.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.600]   Notice that the word he uses is the word "serve."
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:32.560]   And that word means "slave," to be a slave to, or a slave of.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.560]   We saw that word, you remember, repeatedly in chapter 6.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.640]   For instance, take verse 16.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:46.720]   "Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants," now that
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:52.680]   means slave every time, "his slaves ye are to whom ye obey, whether of sin and to death,
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.680]   or of obedience and to righteousness.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.880]   God be thanked ye were the slaves of sin."
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.680]   And here he uses the same word.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:08.920]   So he is saying, with the mind, "I myself am a slave to, or slave it to the law of God.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:17.360]   But with the flesh I slave the law, I'm a slave to the law of sin."
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:23.200]   He cannot say, therefore, that he is only the slave of the law of God.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:29.400]   Because he finds also that he is a slave of the law of sin because of his flesh.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.440]   That is his old trouble.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.320]   That's the thing that he's been telling us so frequently.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:41.280]   Now, a question, of course, arises here at once, which we shall have to consider when
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.880]   we come to our summing up.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:51.600]   Whether it is possible for the fully regenerate men to make this statement in the light of
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:57.920]   what he has said in chapter 6, in verse 17, where he said this, "But God be thanked that
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:05.160]   you were the slaves of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine to which
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.160]   you were delivered."
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:12.120]   Now, there he is suggesting so strongly that they are no longer slaves of sin.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.120]   They finished with it.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:18.600]   Indeed, he goes on in the next verse to say, "Being then made free from sin, you became
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.040]   the slaves of righteousness."
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:26.200]   No longer the slaves of sin, but now the slaves of righteousness.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:31.760]   However, we shall come to consider that in a moment in greater detail.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:38.980]   Well, now then, that brings us to the end of our detailed, verse by verse, consideration
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:46.760]   of this most interesting, this well-known and difficult passage, which starts at verse
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:52.800]   14 and runs on like this to the end of this chapter.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.460]   Now then, let us have a look at this.
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:11:02.400]   First of all, let us try to have clear in our mind what the apostle is saying.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.560]   I mean by that, leaving out the details.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:12.520]   What is the big statement he is making about this man, whoever or whatever the man is,
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.160]   from verse 14 to the end of the chapter?
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.840]   Well, we've seen very clearly, I think, the following.
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.800]   He is a man who is conscious of a duality within himself.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.160]   There's no question about that.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.880]   He says it many times.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:34.600]   He is a man who has come to see that the law of God is spiritual, that it is good.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.560]   Indeed, he delights in it.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:44.360]   But, and here is the problem, he cannot keep it.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:48.040]   He cannot keep it positively, he cannot keep it negatively.
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.760]   He wants to do the things that it commands, but he finds he cannot.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:56.000]   He doesn't want to do the things that it prohibits, but he finds he does them.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.320]   Now then, there is no question about these statements, is there?
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.440]   He sees clearly the character of the law, but he cannot keep it.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.440]   Why not?
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:10.840]   Well, he says he cannot keep it because the law of sin which is in his members is too
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.200]   strong for him.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.400]   That's the big statement.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.680]   Now he has stated that quite clearly in three verses that enter it.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.600]   It's in verse 17.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:26.480]   It is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.840]   This power of sin within him is stronger than himself, so much so that he can make that
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.340]   kind of statement.
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.480]   It is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.800]   In verse 20 again.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.480]   Now if I do that, I would not.
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:43.120]   It is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.040]   Sin is too strong for him.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.040]   It beats him.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.240]   But of course it is still more explicit in verse 23.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:58.560]   I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:03.040]   to the law of sin which is in my members.
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:10.680]   He himself is being brought into captivity to the law of sin which is in his members.
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:16.560]   Now these statements have only one meaning, and that is that the law of sin that is in
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.680]   his members, this indwelling sin, is too strong for him, it's too much for him.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:26.200]   It brings him into a state of captivity.
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.640]   And of course the final proof of that is the cry in verse 24.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.680]   It is as bad as that.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:42.000]   He is a wretched man, and he cries out saying, "Who shall deliver me from the body of this
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   death?"
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.360]   And finally, you see, he sums it up in this last phrase in verse 25.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.880]   Here then is what it amounts to.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.360]   So then, this is it.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:14:04.240]   With the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.880]   And therefore there is only one conclusion that he can come to about himself.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:15.120]   It is the conclusion that he made at the beginning of the whole section, which is this, "I am
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:20.560]   carnal, sold under sin."
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:25.800]   In other words, the business of verses 5 to 25 is to expound that statement.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:30.720]   As so often with this apostle and with many other, another New Testament and even Old
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:37.100]   Testament writers, he starts with his conclusion and then proves it and demonstrates it.
[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.600]   So he had told us the whole thing at the beginning.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.840]   I am carnal, sold under sin.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:50.000]   That's the only conclusion at which this man can arrive about himself.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:57.320]   Not only is there this duality within him, but he is made captive to the law of sin which
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.800]   is in his members.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.240]   It is stronger than he is.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.680]   It is defeating him.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:09.920]   And he cries out, "O wretched men that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.920]   this death?"
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:22.520]   Now then, there is the essential statement which is made in this most fascinating paragraph.
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:30.920]   Are we now in a position to decide and to arrive at a verdict as to who exactly the
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.400]   apostle is describing?
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:38.720]   Well, I think one thing we can say without any difficulty or any hesitation—we have
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:45.960]   said it so often in working through the individual verses—this cannot possibly be the unregenerate
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.720]   man.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.080]   His positive statements about his delighting in the law, the loving of the law, seeing
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:57.240]   the spiritual character of the law, make it impossible.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:01.640]   You cannot reconcile it if that is the case with what he has already told us in verses
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:06.600]   7 to 13, where he tells us that he didn't understand the law.
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.600]   That was his trouble.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.320]   He was alive apart from the law at once.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.800]   He thought all was well because he hadn't seen it when the commandment came.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:18.960]   Ah yes, well now, the man he is talking about here is a man to whom the commandment has
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.960]   come.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:25.200]   That is why he sees it spiritual and good, and that is why he delights in it.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.320]   Not only that, but we have seen also that the unregenerate man is incapable of recognizing
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:38.440]   this duality and of conceiving of himself in this spiritual, psychological manner which
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:42.160]   we have seen to be characteristic of this particular section.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:48.280]   Very well, I think we need spend no more time in considering the case that the apostle here
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:52.920]   is describing an unregenerate man.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:57.480]   So we are left with this question, the next question that comes before us.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:03.520]   Is this then a description of the fully regenerate man?
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:08.240]   Is it true to say that the apostle Paul here was writing about himself, and writing about
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:13.400]   himself as he was at the time when he wrote the epistle to the Romans?
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.600]   You remember their argument about the present tense.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:20.400]   Now then, this is the next position that we have got to consider.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:28.640]   Is this a description of the regenerate man at his best in this life and in this world?
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:34.920]   Is it right to say that the regenerate man is always like this, and that he never rises
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.920]   beyond this?
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:42.400]   That it is indeed the apostle Paul writing about himself at the height of his experience
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.840]   as an apostle of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:51.840]   Now then, what is the next step?
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:57.760]   Well, there is a very good rule when you are dealing with a difficult passage of scripture
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:06.280]   such as this, which one should never fail to put into operation.
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.760]   And the rule is this.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:16.640]   Don't be too anxious to arrive at a decision merely on the evidence that is before you.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:20.800]   If ever you have a difficult passage of scripture, then the first thing you should ask yourself
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.800]   is this.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:27.000]   Are there similar passages somewhere else in the scripture?
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.400]   Can I, I wonder, find any light on this problem that is confronting me by referring to other
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.920]   parts of the scripture?
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.680]   Other parts of scripture written by this same apostle?
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.640]   Other parts of scripture written by other scriptural writers?
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.920]   There is no better rule than that, comparing scripture with scripture.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:50.240]   And when you have got a difficult passage, this should be an absolute rule, without any
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.720]   variations or exceptions whatsoever.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:59.560]   Most heresies in the history of the church have come into being because people have founded
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:05.120]   a whole doctrine on one verse or one section, and have forgotten to consult other sections
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.880]   of scripture which deal with the same pipe.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.240]   Very well then, let us observe the rule ourselves.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:15.720]   So our next step is this.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:22.520]   There are certain passages of scripture which it is argued say exactly the same thing as
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.600]   the apostle is saying here.
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:30.520]   Now then, if that is so, it is a very important argument.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:36.740]   Because those who are not prepared to say that the apostle is here describing himself,
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:42.080]   say that this is a unique statement, without any parallel anywhere in the scripture.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:45.200]   Now then, that is the immediate issue before us.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:50.480]   Well now, let's look at some of these passages to which reference is made.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.560]   And I suggest you can divide them into two groups.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.920]   The first is this.
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:04.880]   There are passages which seem to be describing the same kind of struggle which is described
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.360]   by the apostle in the Seventh of Romans.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.360]   What are they?
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:12.040]   Well, I read one of them to you at the beginning, the one which is found in the epistle to the
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:18.280]   Galatians in chapter 5, a most important statement.
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:22.400]   Now especially attention is drawn to verse 17.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.320]   Let me read it to you.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:32.520]   For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:39.440]   are contrary the one to the other, so that he cannot do the things that he would.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:44.960]   Now let's admit at once that a reading at first frightened on the surface and in a cursory
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:49.760]   manner, one is tempted to say, well of course there is the very thing that the apostle has
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.160]   been saying in Romans 7.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.480]   Here are these two sides.
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.600]   Flesh lusting against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; they are contrary
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:03.800]   to the one to the other, as the law of the mind and the law in the members are contrary
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.080]   the one to the other, and what is the result?
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:10.200]   That you cannot do the things that you would.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.960]   At first sight it seems to be an exact parallel.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:20.720]   But the moment you look at it again, and especially the moment you read the context, I think you
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:26.220]   will find that the two statements are indeed almost entirely different.
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.600]   In what way?
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:36.240]   You notice that the apostle introduces the statement in Galatians 5.17 by the statement
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.240]   in Galatians 5.16.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:50.000]   This I say then, "Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the deeds or the lusts
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.840]   of the flesh."
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:58.560]   And I really feel there is no need to go any further.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:02.840]   Here is the apostle laying down a fundamental statement.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:09.720]   If you walk in the Spirit, and I am commending you to do it, you walk in the Spirit, he says,
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:16.680]   and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:23.600]   What he said in Romans 7 is that in spite of every resolution to keep the law of God,
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:28.640]   he becomes captive to the law of sin which is in his members.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:34.000]   But not only that, you notice that there is a new factor in this passage in Galatians
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.360]   which is not present at all in Romans 7.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.360]   What is that?
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.880]   The mention of the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.640]   The Holy Spirit is not mentioned in Romans 7.
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:47.800]   The whole point of this passage in Galatians 5 is to mention him.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:56.920]   This I say then, "Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the law or the lusts
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:57.920]   of the flesh."
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:04.600]   Very well then, we see two different points here.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:09.960]   That the apostle's object in Galatians 5 is to show the way of victory.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:17.080]   Not only to show it, but to guarantee it because of this other factor, the Holy Spirit who
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.720]   is within them, who is not mentioned in Romans 7.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.800]   But there is a third point of difference.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:30.640]   Go on to verse 18, which at first seems an extraordinary statement.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:41.880]   But, he says, "If you be led of the Spirit, you are not under the law."
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:50.040]   Now that you see is an exact repetition of what the apostle says in Romans 6.14, which
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:56.960]   I have been emphasizing all along is in a sense the key to the whole of Romans 7.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:01.560]   Romans 7 is in a sense an exposition of Romans 6.14.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:05.720]   "Sin shall not have dominion over you."
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.720]   Why?
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.720]   Because you are not under the law, but under grace.
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:12.880]   He's saying it in a different way here in Galatians 5.18.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.720]   "But if you be led with the Spirit, you are not under law."
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.600]   And don't think of yourselves like that.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.800]   That's not your position.
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:28.480]   So there again, as in verse 16, he is showing not only the possibility of victory, but the
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:33.800]   certainty of victory to those who realize this truth about themselves.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:37.920]   And then to add still further, there is the statement in verse 24.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:49.160]   "And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts."
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:52.880]   There's not a word about that in Romans 7.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.880]   Not a word.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:57.720]   But here he says that it is something that is true of all Christians.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:03.640]   They who are Christ's have done this, it's happened.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:10.360]   They have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:15.320]   The whole trouble, I suggest, with a man in Romans 7 is that he can't do that.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:21.040]   Hence his problem, that the flesh is too much for him, and he is being made captive all
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:28.280]   along in general to the law of sin which is in his members.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:35.240]   Very well then, I think we are entitled to draw this conclusion.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:43.000]   That Galatians 5, far from saying the same thing as Romans 7, is not only saying the
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.200]   exact opposite, but was designed to say the exact opposite.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:56.240]   Romans 7 is here to show us the state of failure of this man, who is trying, as it were, to
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:00.240]   sanctify himself by the law.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:06.000]   The whole point of Galatians 5 is to show us positively the success and the victory
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   that attend the man who is sanctifying himself and dealing with the problem within himself
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.900]   by the Spirit.
[00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:20.960]   He is a man who is able to crucify the flesh with the affections and lusts.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.760]   There is not a word about that in Romans 7.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:27.440]   Very well, there is our first statement.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:32.720]   Then we look at another statement, which is found in the first epistle to the Corinthians
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.800]   verse 9 and chapter 27.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:41.600]   Here the apostle says this, let me read verse 26 as well.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:47.840]   "I therefore," he says, "so run," he is describing men striving for mastery in a race.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:59.120]   "I therefore so run," he says, "not as uncertainty, so fight I, not as one that beateth the air,
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:06.520]   but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection, lest that by any means, when I
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:11.800]   have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway."
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:19.080]   Now then, this is quoted because people feel that again he is describing this same conflict
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:24.640]   within himself as he describes in Romans 7.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:29.240]   Now there is no question that the apostle was referring to himself and to his present
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:35.000]   experience when he wrote 1 Corinthians 9, 27.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.220]   But really, can anybody argue for a moment that this is a parallel with Romans 7?
[00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:50.200]   What he says in Romans 7 is this, "I delight in the law of God after the inward men, but
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:57.280]   I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.760]   to the law of sin which is in my members."
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:08.000]   But in 1 Corinthians 9, 27 he says, "I keep under my body."
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.240]   I am not only able to keep it under, I do keep it under.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.200]   I beat it black and blue, that's what he's saying.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.240]   I pummel it.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.240]   I punch it.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:22.680]   I keep it under and bring it into subjection.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:29.240]   Can't you see it's the exact opposite again of Romans 7?
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:35.560]   Because he does say, and we all want to say, that the man who is regenerate is not yet
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.520]   perfect and he does have a war to fight.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:43.120]   The mere fact that he says that he's got a war to fight doesn't mean that he is defeated.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.880]   But in Romans 7 he is defeated.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:49.040]   Here in 1 Corinthians 9, 27 he says, "There is a battle.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.040]   There is this tendency.
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.040]   Sin is there.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.000]   It's always ready to take an opportunity."
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.320]   But I'm putting these words into the mouth of the apostle because this is really what
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.320]   he's saying.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:03.360]   But he seems to say, as I have already stated in the sixth chapter of my epistle to the
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:08.640]   Romans in verse 12, "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body."
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.640]   You're in a position not to let it.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.560]   You're in a position to keep it under.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:13.560]   Keep it under.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:16.400]   I myself do keep it under.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.960]   I keep it in order.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:22.640]   I am running this race and I'm not going to be robbed of my prize.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:29.520]   I keep under my body and I bring it into subjection.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:33.880]   The man in Romans 7 would have given the whole world if only he could have said that.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.120]   But he couldn't say it.
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.560]   That was his whole trouble.
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.840]   That he was being brought into subjection by what?
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:46.040]   Well, by this law of sin that's in his members, in his body.
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.040]   In his members.
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:50.680]   It's the exact opposite, you see.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:55.500]   There is one other passage that is sometimes quoted and I refer to it, although I want
[00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.120]   to show you that rarely I don't think it applies at all.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:03.880]   It's the passage, of course, at the end of the epistle to the Ephesians in chapter 6
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:10.800]   where he says, in verse 12, "We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.920]   against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.920]   wickedness in high places."
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.200]   And you see, they jump at the word "wrestle."
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:23.080]   It sounds as if it's near Romans 7, the fight going on.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:26.440]   But there are two answers to this.
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:31.280]   In this passage in Ephesians 6, he is not talking about the struggle with that which
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.280]   is in the flesh.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:33.880]   He even says so.
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:36.880]   We wrestle not against flesh and blood.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.440]   That's not the essence of the problem he's considering.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.180]   What he means is this.
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:45.580]   He says our essential problem, you know, in the last analysis is not sin within us.
[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:50.120]   It is these evil forces, the devil and his cohorts, that are outside us.
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:52.720]   There's the battle.
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:59.840]   But you notice that he says even with respect to that, he says this, "Finally, my brethren,
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:03.720]   be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might."
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.040]   You can be strong.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.040]   You can get a victory.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.840]   "Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.800]   Put on the whole armor of God."
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:11.800]   Why?
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:19.040]   "That you may be able to stand against the viles of the devil and defeat him."
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.520]   What would the man in Romans 7 give if he knew that and if he could say that?
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:23.920]   But he didn't know it.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.440]   That was his whole trouble.
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.960]   Now, it's no use quoting the struggle in Romans 6 because the whole point of that passage
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:37.320]   again is to show that it is possible for the regenerate man to be victorious and to stand,
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:41.000]   having done all things, to stand in the evil day.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.120]   He's a conqueror.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.120]   He is not defeated.
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.120]   Very well.
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:51.440]   Now, there are the passages that are so commonly quoted because they seem to suggest the same
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:55.900]   kind of struggle as is described in Romans 7.
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:32:01.600]   I trust that it's plain to all that the three passages are saying the exact opposite.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:08.900]   But there are other passages, and this is the second group.
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:15.540]   Now we're going to look at some interesting passages which seem to be similar to the statement
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:19.580]   in Romans 7 because they speak about mourning and about groaning.
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.060]   Ah, they say.
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:23.180]   Now then, here's the point.
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:28.500]   If you can find other statements in the scripture which show that the fully regenerate man groans
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:33.180]   and mourns, you've established that Romans 7 is about the fully regenerate men.
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:34.180]   Very well.
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:35.980]   Let's have another look at these passages.
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:37.300]   Where are they?
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:41.580]   Well, the first is in chapter 8 of this same epistle to the Romans.
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:43.180]   I've already read it to you.
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:46.300]   Let me read again the two crucial verses.
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:57.220]   Verse 23, "And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit."
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:59.340]   Here's the fully regenerate men.
[00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:08.300]   "Even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:11.540]   of our body."
[00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:16.740]   The second verse is verse 26, "Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities, for we
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:21.020]   know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itself maketh intercession
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:22.940]   for us with groanings."
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:26.180]   The groanings are not in the Spirit, they're in us, "which cannot be uttered."
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:30.620]   Isn't this the same?
[00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:38.740]   We ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:39.740]   our body.
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:44.780]   "O wretched men that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:47.980]   Absolute parallel, are they?
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:53.940]   To start with again, notice that in Romans 8.23 there is this vital addition, which you
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:34:02.100]   haven't got in Romans 7, "We who have the firstfruits of the Spirit."
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:11.460]   Not a word about that is to be found in Romans 7, but the argument doesn't depend upon that.
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:19.740]   The answer to this suggestion is simply this, that in this section in Romans 8, the apostle
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:27.620]   is not considering the struggle which a man has with sin within himself.
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:29.340]   What is he considering?
[00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:37.340]   He is considering and discussing the struggle with sin in the world, sin in circumstances,
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:43.100]   sin in trials and troubles and tribulations that come to us in this life and in this world.
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.100]   Let me prove it to you.
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:51.620]   Go back to verse 17, "If children then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ."
[00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:57.820]   Listen, "If so be that we suffer with him, suffer with Christ."
[00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:01.740]   Well, that cannot mean suffering because of sin in the body, because he never did suffer
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:02.740]   from that.
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:08.700]   But here he is dealing with suffering with him, that we may be also glorified together.
[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:10.460]   But we needn't wait at that.
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:11.700]   Listen to what he goes on to say.
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:18.820]   "For," he says, "I reckon that the sufferings of this present time, the sufferings in which
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:23.780]   we find ourselves in this world, are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall
[00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:25.180]   be revealed in us."
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:33.140]   And to make it doubly certain, he says this, "For the earnest expectation of the creature,
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:40.060]   brute animal creation, waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:45.860]   For the creature was made subject to vanity," he means now the animals and flowers and everything
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:47.860]   that is in brute creation.
[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:53.500]   "For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.900]   subjected the same in hope.
[00:35:55.900 --> 00:36:01.100]   Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption."
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.100]   What is that?
[00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:04.280]   Is that the fight with indwelling sin?
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:08.260]   Do the animals and the flowers have to fight a fight against indwelling sin?
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.980]   Well, of course they don't.
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:11.980]   What do they have to fight?
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:16.460]   All they have to fight is this, nature read in truth and claw.
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:22.060]   The kind of agony of the cosmos, the struggle in the whole of life that has come in because
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:25.180]   when man sinned, God cursed the ground.
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:28.500]   The whole of life has become difficult.
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:32.460]   There is this struggle in the whole of nature and of creation.
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:40.940]   We know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:47.420]   And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first roots of the Spirit, even we
[00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:52.500]   ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption to wit, the redemption of
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:53.500]   the body.
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:58.500]   In other words, though the Christian is redeemed and regenerate, he is living in a world of
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:36:59.500]   sin.
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:03.220]   It's a world of sorrow, it's a world of pain, it's a world of suffering, it's a world of
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:08.100]   evil, ugliness, foulness, subject to illnesses and diseases.
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.700]   That's what he's talking about here.
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:15.340]   He is not even considering the problem which is dealt with in Romans 7.
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.580]   But how frequently is this missed?
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:19.580]   Simply because he said, "Groaneth," you see.
[00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:22.700]   Ah, there's the wretched man again, not a bit of it.
[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.460]   He's not talking about the same thing at all.
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:27.620]   I have a final proof to which I will bring you in a moment.
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:32.460]   But wait a minute, let's be clear then that in Romans 8 he is dealing with an entirely
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:33.460]   different subject.
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:36.260]   All right, we're told, what about 2 Corinthians 5?
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:39.220]   Well, let's have a look at 2 Corinthians 5.
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:42.500]   Let me read it to you.
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.940]   Let me start at verse 2.
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:56.820]   "For in this, this tabernacle, we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house,
[00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:57.820]   which is from heaven.
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:01.100]   If so being that being clothed, we shall not be found naked."
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:02.300]   And back again.
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:09.380]   "For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened."
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:13.900]   Not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up
[00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:16.700]   of life, and so on.
[00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:20.820]   Now then, you see the argument is that here again is this wretched man of Romans 7.
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:25.260]   "We that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened.
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:26.260]   What's my burden?
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:31.940]   Oh, the load of sin, sin that is in my members, this thing that is leading me into captivity."
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:35.700]   Here is the fully regenerate man speaking, and it is the fully regenerate man.
[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:42.340]   Yes, but we are told here he is groaning because of this burden of sin, and longing for his
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:44.860]   glorification.
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:45.860]   What is the answer?
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:52.540]   Well, the answer is, of course, that here again the apostle is not speaking of the subject
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:57.020]   which he is dealing with in Romans 7, but is just putting once more what he puts in
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:00.300]   Romans 8, verse 18 forward.
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:02.820]   I can prove it, you needn't take my word for it.
[00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:07.300]   He begins the subject in the seventh verse of chapter 4 of 2 Corinthians.
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:12.500]   "We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:13.900]   God, not of us.
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:19.620]   We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed.
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:22.420]   We are perplexed, but not in despair.
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:27.820]   Persecuted" - he is talking about things outside himself, not inside himself - "persecuted,
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:33.180]   but not forsaken, cast down, but not destroyed, always bearing about in the body the dying
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:34.660]   of the Lord Jesus.
[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:38.880]   We which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake."
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.620]   This was the kind of life he was living.
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:44.740]   "Death worketh in us, but life in you.
[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:50.780]   All things are for your sakes, for which cause we faint not, but though our outward men perish,
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:54.060]   the inward men is renewed day by day."
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:59.540]   Our light affliction, these are the things outside us, which is "but for a moment worketh
[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:02.740]   for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory."
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:06.220]   And to prove that they are outside, he says, "while we look not at the things which are
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:10.100]   seen" - outside us - "but the things which are not seen."
[00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:15.060]   And then, first verse in chapter 5, "For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle
[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:22.100]   were dissolved, if they kill us, if they martyr us, we have a building of God, a house not
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:25.940]   made with hens, eternal in the heavens."
[00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:28.260]   It's not the same problem at all.
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:34.640]   He is dealing there with the trials and the tribulations, the persecutions and the sufferings
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:38.220]   of Christian people because they were Christian.
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:44.700]   It is not the same problem, the same question at all as is dealt with in Romans 7.
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:51.940]   But I want to give you my final proof for saying this.
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:57.180]   If you were going to look for the word "groaned" in the Scripture and say every time you find
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:02.580]   a Christian man groaning or being burdened, it's of necessity describing the struggle
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:08.820]   against sin within, well then you'll find yourself saying that our Lord himself had
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:12.220]   a struggle against sin within.
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.820]   Let me give you the evidence.
[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:21.820]   Isaiah reminds us in his 53rd chapter that when he comes, he will be a man of sorrows,
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:25.780]   acquainted with grief.
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.020]   And when he came, he was.
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:32.980]   For I read in Mark 9.19 that when he came down from the Mount of Transfiguration and
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:39.480]   saw these people, these disciples arguing with the man and his poor son who was having
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:44.820]   those terrible fits and the people all looking on, he looked at them and said, "Oh, faithless
[00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:47.900]   generation, how long shall I be with you?
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:51.340]   How long shall I suffer you?"
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:54.180]   But I've got even stronger evidence.
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:42:01.340]   Look at him there that day outside the sepulcher of his friend Lazarus in John chapter 11 and
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:06.580]   listen to what he says in verse 30, listen to what we read in verse 33.
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:15.820]   When Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews also weeping with her, he groaned in
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:19.180]   the Spirit and was troubled.
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:24.020]   He groaned in the Spirit and was troubled.
[00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:31.180]   Indeed I'm told in verse 25, Jesus wept.
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:32.380]   He was burdened.
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:36.660]   He groaned in the depth of his Spirit.
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:42.660]   He was troubled in his Spirit and he wept.
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:48.140]   Look at him a short time later in the Garden of Gethsemane and this is what I find, "And
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:53.740]   being in an agony, in an agony."
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:58.580]   And he proceeded to sweat drops of blood.
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:04.660]   Our Lord groaned in this world.
[00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:08.420]   In this tabernacle, says Paul, we do groan being burdened.
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:13.820]   Yes, and the Lord groaned in Spirit for the same reason.
[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:15.580]   Not because of sin in the members.
[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:21.380]   No, no, but because this is a world of sin, because of all that sin has done to this world.
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:23.420]   Why did he cry at the grave of Lazarus?
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:26.820]   Oh, it was his natural human sympathy, says somebody, nonsense.
[00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:28.740]   He knew he was going to raise him in a moment.
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:33.260]   No, no, he was face to face with this horrible thing, death, that had come into the world
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:38.500]   as the result of sin and was going to lead to his own death and separation from the Father.
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:40.900]   That's the meaning of Jesus wept.
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:45.460]   That's why he groaned and was troubled in Spirit, though he knew he was going to raise
[00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:47.700]   Lazarus.
[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:54.540]   He groaned because he was here looking at sin in the world, sin objectively.
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:44:00.740]   And that's exactly what Paul is doing in Romans 8, 18 and forward, and also in 2 Corinthians
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:02.420]   5, 1-5.
[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:08.300]   Indeed, the Apostle puts this quite explicitly in the epistle to the Colossians, chapter
[00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:14.060]   1, verse 24, where he says this, "Who, speaking about himself, now rejoice in my
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:20.940]   sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the affliction of Christ in my
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:27.540]   flesh, for his body's sake, which is the church."
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:30.460]   There is exactly the same thing.
[00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:37.500]   He is filling up that which remains of the affliction of Christ in his own flesh, in
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.060]   his own body.
[00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:44.300]   He has entered into such intimate communion with his Lord and Savior that he really is
[00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:50.580]   feeling something of what Christ suffered when he was in this evil world, the sight
[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:56.380]   of it all and the realization of it all that made him groan.
[00:44:56.380 --> 00:45:00.740]   In this tabernacle we do groan, being burdened.
[00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:05.500]   Though we are saved and rejoicing in it, it nevertheless is a veil of tears.
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:09.340]   It is a land of woe.
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:15.940]   That is what he says in Romans 8, and that is what he says in 2 Corinthians 5.
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:21.620]   So these statements, which because they have this idea of burden and trouble and tribulation
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:28.620]   and agony and groaning, which seem superficially to be saying what he says in Romans 7, I think
[00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:34.540]   we have seen clearly and conclusively, are not dealing with the subject at all that is
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:44.340]   dealt with in Romans 7 and therefore have no relevance whatsoever to this question of
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:52.780]   deciding as to who is the man described in Romans 7, 14 to 25.
[00:45:52.780 --> 00:46:04.900]   Nevertheless, our time is gone, and I do not ask you for your verdict.
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:11.380]   Neither do I propose, as is done sometimes at the present time, to lock you up until
[00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:15.060]   you arrive at your verdict.
[00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:20.260]   But I propose rather that you go on considering this matter.
[00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:24.220]   We have got the evidence before us.
[00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:28.700]   We have looked at the passages which are said to be similar.
[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:35.900]   God willing, next Friday night we shall go on to see and to show that if the passage
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:42.940]   is interpreted like this about a fully regenerate man, that it is then incompatible with the
[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:49.500]   teaching, the plain teaching of the apostle elsewhere with regard to the regenerate man.
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:56.420]   And after that we shall show that it is incompatible with teaching elsewhere in the scripture concerning
[00:46:56.420 --> 00:47:01.180]   the fully regenerate man.
[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:04.900]   And having in that way dealt with that aspect of the matter, we shall still be left with
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:09.060]   this question.
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:15.300]   Is it then the description of an immature Christian, the Christian who has not yet gone
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:18.540]   on to receive the second blessing?
[00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:22.100]   That is a very much simpler question and it won't take us long.
[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:28.860]   So I trust that next Friday night, God willing, we shall be able to complete our consideration
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:30.580]   of this great section.
[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:31.580]   Let us pray.
[00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:44.260]   O Lord, our God, we come again into thy presence to thank thee and to bless and praise thy
[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:47.700]   name for thy word.
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:57.580]   We see, O Lord, more and more clearly how if we had not this word in its fullness we
[00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:00.860]   would so easily go astray.
[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:06.660]   We humbly thank thee therefore for ever having called thy servants, for having given them
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:13.860]   the revelation of the truth and the controlling power of thy Spirit as they wrote it.
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:17.540]   We thank thee likewise for the gift of the Spirit to us.
[00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:20.460]   O Lord, receive our praise.
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:25.780]   Bless us, we pray thee, as we meditate upon these things.
[00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:29.980]   Take us all and lead us upon our several ways.
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:38.060]   Grant us grace that wherever we are and whatever our circumstances, we may ever be able to
[00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:44.780]   be living witnesses to thee and to the power and the glory of thy grace.
[00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:50.740]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:56.820]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now throughout the remainder
[00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:05.460]   of this hour's short, uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage and until we shall be safely
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:06.460]   in glory.
[00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:07.460]   Amen.
[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:08.460]   Amen.
