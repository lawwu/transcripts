[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   I'll tell you what I do want to talk about today though.
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.280]   This was a cool idea, something I had heard something about, but a listener sent me a
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.440]   longer article about it.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:19.540]   It's an idea from antiquity that I think actually captures a lot of the ideas we've been talking
[00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.000]   about on this show about slow productivity.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.160]   So I'm going to load up an article on the screen here that I'm going to be talking about
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.160]   today.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.600]   So let me do a little bit of a share here.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:38.100]   So for those who are listening, you can see the article on your screen if you go to youtube.com/calnewportmedia.
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.200]   This is episode 260.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.960]   You can also find this episode 260 at thedeeplife.com.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.440]   So I've loaded up this article on the screen from Big Think.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.420]   Here is the headline, "Fastina Lente, a Roman Emperor's Guide to Getting Stuff Done."
[00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.400]   So start from the top of this article, then we're going to get into it.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.920]   So that Roman emperor in question here is Octavian Caesar Augustus.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.600]   And this opens by saying, "Like all historical legacies, the one of Octavian Caesar Augustus
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.160]   is open to interpretation."
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.160]   Right?
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.140]   So he steered Rome through tumultuous times and ushered in a centuries-long period of
[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.560]   order and stability known as Pax Romana.
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.060]   On the other hand, he delivered the killing blow to the Roman Republic and established
[00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.280]   a position so powerful that it gave subsequent emperors such as Caligula and Nero carte blanche
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.320]   to indulge their whims.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.600]   So you know, you got the good and you got the bad.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.000]   But here's the key point here.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.200]   Whatever your take on Caesar Augustus, you've got to give him this, "The man knew how to
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.520]   get things done."
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.880]   The article mentions a lot of things that Caesar Augustus did as emperor, a lot of projects
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.600]   to improve Rome after its many wars, his new tax and census systems.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.980]   He created police forces and fire brigades.
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.200]   He built roads, instituted a postal service.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.200]   All right?
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.840]   So this is a guy who was effective.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.680]   All right, so let's return to the article.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.760]   That's one heck of a curriculum vitae.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.400]   He managed all of this not only by being clever, ruthless, and politically savvy, but by following
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:21.240]   a modest yet powerful Roman principle, fastina lente, which is often translated, "Make haste
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.240]   slowly."
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.000]   All right.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.420]   So this is an idea that I've seen.
[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.380]   I looked into this idea when I was researching my book, "Slow Productivity."
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.380]   This is coming out in March.
[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.620]   And so I've gone down this rabbit hole before, but it was interesting to see this take on
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.620]   it.
[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:45.160]   This notion of fastina lente, "Make haste slowly," comes up all the time in antiquity.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.680]   So you see it, it wasn't just Caesar Augustus, but it actually comes up all the time.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.660]   So let me jump back to this article here for a second.
[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.860]   There's some graphics to share with you here.
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.820]   All right, so let's look at this.
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.500]   The history of this phrase.
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.140]   They say here, "The history of an august oxymoron."
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.940]   An ad here.
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:03.940]   All right.
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.940]   Did I say Roman principle?
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:05.940]   Well, not exactly.
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.540]   Like most things Roman, fastina lente is Greek in origin.
[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.140]   It's a caulk or loan translation of the phrase, which I'm not even gonna try to pronounce,
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.140]   but it's a Greek phrase.
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.260]   The Romans simply borrowed it, gave it a Latin polish, and then invoked the time-honored tradition
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.460]   of no backsies.
[00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:27.380]   But while Augustus didn't originate the principle, he did devote himself to it in a history,
[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.500]   in a biography of the first Roman emperor, the historian, Suetonius, described how Augustus
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.580]   changed the military following the final civil wars in the Republic.
[00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.900]   He notes how Augustus thought nothing more derogatory to the character of an accomplished
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.140]   general than precipitancy and rashness that caused such impulses.
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.460]   Augustus trained his generals to instead make haste slowly, and that the cautious captain
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.140]   is better than the gold.
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.300]   How serious was he about this?
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:04:00.540]   Augustus minted a Roman coin known as an aureus with his personal branding of fastina lente.
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.700]   On the side that didn't include his face, he imprinted the image of a crab hoisting
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.420]   a butterfly.
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.660]   The butterfly represented speed, the crab, caution, and deliberateness.
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.260]   Here's another graphic here.
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.340]   This is another fastina lente graphic.
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.860]   You see here a dolphin around an anchor.
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.900]   I have this on the screen now.
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:30.940]   This was Aldus Manutius, a Renaissance humanist who revolutionized the publishing industry,
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.900]   adopted fastina lente as his business ethos.
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.740]   So this was his publishing imprint.
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.780]   So in the Renaissance, they rediscovered this idea.
[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:46.460]   Cosimo de' Medici also illustrated this with a turtle sporting a sail on top of its shell.
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.460]   So there's, I'm seeing there's one more image in here.
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.700]   Anyways, there's a lot of images.
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.540]   What I'm trying to say is this idea of fastina lente showed up a lot.
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.500]   So we see it, the Greeks came up with it.
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.820]   The Romans were really into it.
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.220]   It was minted on coins.
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.300]   The Renaissance humanist rediscovered it.
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.460]   They used it.
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.140]   Medici had artwork commissioned around it.
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:12.660]   A famous publisher in the Renaissance period had it as the imprint, a dolphin on an anchor.
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.540]   If you look online, you can find all sorts of other artifacts from the ancient world
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:22.420]   and from the Renaissance period where we see exactly this phrase captured in imagery.
[00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.300]   So it was a very powerful, popular phrase.
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.580]   Now, the question is what is meant by this and why is it relevant to us today?
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:38.340]   Well, I think the literal translation, make haste slowly, is a little bit hard to follow.
[00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.780]   There's a, as noted in that article, a bit of an oxymoronic element to it.
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.860]   How can you be making haste if you're going slowly?
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.820]   Haste is fast.
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:48.820]   Slowly is slow.
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.540]   So I'm going to offer here, let's call it an interpretive translation.
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:59.060]   So it's not a literal translation of what do these words mean, but an interpretive translation,
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.900]   a way of rephrasing this phrase, which I think gets to the core of what the ancient world
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.420]   and the Renaissance scholars who studied it thought about it, what they thought it meant.
[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.420]   All right.
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:14.300]   So here's my interpretive translation of Festina Lente.
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:20.580]   Work slowly but relentlessly on what matters.
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.220]   Work slowly but relentlessly on what matters.
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:29.020]   So let's go through the three parts of that one by one, and I'll elaborate what I mean
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.020]   here.
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.720]   So slowly in this context means, of course, obviously don't go fast.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.980]   This is certainly what Caesar Augustus had in mind when he worried about his generals
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.300]   in the field being rash in their decision-making.
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.880]   When you're too rash in your decision-making, you act in the moment, you act on instinct.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.980]   This can create problems.
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.540]   And if we bring this forward to the modern context, we can imagine it saying, don't let
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:58.900]   busyness and frenetic activity distract you from what actually matters to keep you from
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.220]   your best work.
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.020]   It could be reassuring in the moment, like the general that wants to make a decision
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.780]   and send their archers over there.
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.860]   It can be reassuring in the moment to do things.
[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:14.340]   Let me do this and send this email and hire this consultant and publish this thing and
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.500]   start using this new tool.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:20.740]   You feel like the activity is action, and action is better than inaction.
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.660]   But Faustina Lente is saying, slow down.
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.660]   Don't act hastily.
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.380]   Now, the cost in the modern context is not you're going to lose the battle, but it might
[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.640]   be you're going to lose time, that you're going to get distracted, that your energy
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.300]   is going to be redirected from the types of activities that might have been most important
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.060]   for what it is you're trying to get done.
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.580]   We can think about this call to slowness also as a call to craft.
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:50.340]   Slow down, focus on what matters, work on your craft.
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.340]   That's what's going to matter.
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.340]   Okay.
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.340]   So that's the first part.
[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.340]   Work slowly but relentlessly on what matters.
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.340]   What do I mean by relentlessly in this interpretive translation?
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:04.220]   Well, this is where we get to my take on the haste piece from the original translation.
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.580]   Don't delay or procrastinate, don't overanalyze.
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:12.420]   So Augustus didn't want his generals, Caesar Augustus did not want his generals to act
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.140]   hastily, but he also wanted them to act.
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.900]   Make the right moves when they need to be done.
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.700]   Don't react in the moment to your instincts or your fear, but when you see this is the
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:29.020]   right move, all right, I slowed down, I'm looking at the battlefield, that's a faint,
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.020]   here's their weakness.
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.260]   Okay, we need to flank.
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:37.140]   Once you realize the right thing to do, because you slowed down, do it.
[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.180]   Don't overanalyze it, don't procrastinate on it.
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:42.020]   So this is where we get that oxymoronic tension.
[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.700]   Slow down, don't just be busy and frenetic, but be relentless on working on what you're
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.140]   working on.
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.900]   This is the next thing to do, do it, do it well.
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.740]   Take a beat, what's the best thing to do next?
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.980]   Do that and do that well.
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:09:00.860]   So it's the constant activity done intentionally with care aggregates to really big results.
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:05.860]   And I think that's the takeaway of the second piece for the modern context.
[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:09.460]   Working slowly but relentlessly builds up.
[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:15.340]   And if you do that long enough, you do end up with really interesting results.
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:20.580]   Even if in the moment it looks slow, if you don't stop, if you keep making progress, you
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:25.760]   keep putting out one podcast after another, very carefully trying to improve each episode
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.760]   from the last.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.100]   You keep putting down another page of the book you're working on, and maybe it takes
[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:34.280]   you longer than someone else, but you give enough time, you have a book that you're really
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.280]   proud of.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:41.320]   This work relentlessly, don't stop, keep making progress is the key counterbalance
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.860]   to the slow.
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.500]   And then I added the matters piece.
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:51.360]   So go back to my translation, work slowly but relentlessly on what matters.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.940]   So what I mean by what matters is, okay, making sure you're focused on the right things.
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.900]   So slow down, don't just be reactive.
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:04.020]   But when you do keep making progress, relentlessly, don't stop and make sure you're aimed in the
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.680]   right direction.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:11.340]   So the generals for Caesar Augustus hearing Faustina Alente, they know what they're trying
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.340]   to do.
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:16.260]   We're trying to take this high ground, we're trying to take this city back from the barbarian
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.420]   hordes.
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.780]   They know what matters and they don't lose sight of that.
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:20.860]   That's what we're trying to do.
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.600]   And then they slow down so they're not being too reactive.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.640]   And they make the relentless progress on the right decisions in the moment that push them
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.860]   in the long term towards what matters.
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.780]   So work slowly but relentlessly on what matters.
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.860]   That is an ancient piece of wisdom.
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:40.860]   As we saw, the Greeks talked about it, the Romans stole it from them, the Renaissance
[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:44.040]   humanists that rediscovered the Greeks and the Romans stole it from them.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:50.020]   So everyone who has encountered this idea has adopted it with enthusiasm, which from
[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:55.600]   a mimetic standpoint tells us there's probably something in this idea that fits well with
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.060]   human nature.
[00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.860]   And I think this is really exciting because once we see it elaborated in this way, this
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:06.360]   concept dovetails nicely with the philosophy of slow productivity that we talk about so
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.100]   often on this show and that I elaborate in the book I have coming out in March.
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:15.700]   Now it's not an exact match to slow productivity, but it's in the spirit of the slow productivity
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:16.940]   mindset.
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:21.160]   That spirit of slowing down, doing less, being more careful about your decisions, staying
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.320]   focused on the things that matters, but also keep making progress.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.260]   You keep moving down the path.
[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.180]   You keep making progress towards what matters.
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.220]   Trusting in the short term, you're just focused on making a good decision and building something
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.420]   a step you're proud of.
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.580]   And in the long term, you end up at a cool destination.
[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.700]   That's classic slow productivity.
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:43.660]   So I think this shows that there is no ideas, no ideas are new, right?
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:47.060]   So the reason why I think slow productivity resonates with me and is resonating with so
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:51.700]   many of you is because there's actually an ancient idea here that we're hitting upon.
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:57.100]   So fastina lente, make haste slowly, or to put it my way, work slowly.
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.980]   How do I say it?
[00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.500]   Work slowly, but relentlessly on what matters.
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.960]   A little bit less pissy, but I think that gets to the core of what all who have rediscovered
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.660]   this advice really liked.
[00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.140]   We should get a coin made, Jesse.
[00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.900]   Ryan Holiday has coins, you know.
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.300]   He has the memento mori, the stoic coins.
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:16.300]   I think we need our own-
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.580]   Yeah, a coin or a bookmark.
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:20.580]   That would be really nice.
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.580]   Because you read a lot of books.
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:25.860]   And do you think it would be a step too far in the narcissistic direction if I minted
[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:33.140]   gold coins where it was my face on one side and fastina lente on the other side?
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:37.820]   People could just look at ... And like a general, you know, like I would have a garland.
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.220]   They were garlands of plants.
[00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.060]   I don't know which one.
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:45.780]   Like in the Sopranos when he got that painting commissioned of him on the horse?
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.780]   Which I ... Exactly.
[00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:53.060]   And I think viewers, listeners don't know this, but there is a giant mural of me dressed
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:57.900]   like a Roman emperor on a horse inside the Deep Work HQ.
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.300]   And I'm just pointing forward and it says fastina lente.
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.180]   Maybe that would be a step too far.
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.780]   Anyways, that was cool though.
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:13.300]   Because the only sad thing is I came across like my fastina lente rabbit hole was after
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.180]   the manuscript for Slow Productivity was already done.
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.100]   So it's actually not in the book.
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:22.740]   So this is ... It's validation of the ideas in the book that came later.
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.880]   But it came too late to actually make it into the book itself.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.220]   So I don't know if that's sad or cool, but there we go.
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:29.680]   All right.
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:36.580]   So what I want to move on to is some questions that are going to be roughly associated with
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:41.860]   this Slow Productivity, Slowing Down, Working With What Matters theme of this episode.
[00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.320]   Before we do though, I want to talk briefly about one of the sponsors that makes this
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.980]   show possible.
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:51.740]   And that is our good friends at Hinson Shaving.
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.540]   So here's the thing about Hinson Shaving.
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:14:01.540]   They sell this beautiful precision milled razor that you can then use with standard,
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.780]   cheap, off the shelf safety razor blades.
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:09.500]   And this beautifully milled aluminum razor, what makes it so good, other than the fact
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.760]   it just looks good and it's heavy and it's well balanced, is that Hinson's business is
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.980]   precision manufacturing.
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:24.060]   Before they got into the razor game, they worked on aerospace design and parts manufacturing.
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:30.080]   So they have these aerospace grade CNC machines that can build really precise metal products.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:36.380]   That's what allows them to make a metal razor that extends just 0.0013 inches beyond the
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:41.680]   blade goes just 0.0013 inches beyond the housing of the razor itself.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:46.380]   That's what allows a 10 cent standard razor blade, when combined with their beautifully
[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:52.460]   milled razor, to give you a clean shave without the diving board effect that causes nicks
[00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.220]   and that causes clogs.
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:15:00.340]   I use the Hinson razor and I do because A, it's a beautiful tool and B, because over
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.980]   time it's cheaper.
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:06.900]   You pay more up front for this beautiful milled piece of metal, but then you're using 10 cent
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:12.820]   blades with it, which means it does not take long before your overall cost to use a Hinson
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:19.020]   razor is much cheaper than having to use a subscription service or buy the pharmacy plastic
[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.520]   packaged razors.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:26.560]   So you save money, you get a better shave, and it's a beautiful tool for those of us
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.160]   who really like technology done right.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.620]   So it's time to say no to subscriptions and yes to a razor that will last you a lifetime.
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:38.240]   Visit hinsonshaving.com/cal to pick the razor for you and use code CAL and you'll get two
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.040]   years worth of blades free with your razor.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.680]   Just make sure to add them to your cart and then when you type in that promo code CAL,
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.800]   the price of the blades will drop to zero.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:57.400]   That's 100 free blades when you head to h-e-n-s-o-n-s-h-a-v-i-n-g.com/cal.
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:04.360]   I also want to talk about our good friends at the oh so easy to pronounce Zocdoc.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:09.540]   Zocdoc is one of these apps that make so much sense it's hard to believe that it wasn't
[00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:10.540]   around before.
[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.160]   All right, so here's how it works.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.720]   Let's say you need a new doctor.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.840]   You know, like in my case, my old doctor left or you're looking for a new type of doctor
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.300]   you didn't have one before.
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:21.720]   How would you normally do this?
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.720]   I don't know.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.720]   No one knows.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.080]   You start asking friends, "Hey, what doctor do you use?"
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.920]   And then you call the doctor and if you live in a city like I do, they're like, "No, we
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.520]   don't have any availability.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.960]   If anything, we're mad at you for even asking."
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.040]   Of course we don't.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.180]   Or you find a doctor with availability but they don't take your insurance or they turn
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.720]   out to not be so good.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.800]   There's a painting of them on a horse like a Roman emperor in the waiting room and you
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.240]   didn't know about this.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.080]   This is where ZocDoc enters the scene.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:54.860]   It is an app that allows you to search for the type of doctor you're looking for that's
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:59.720]   in your area, that takes your insurance, that has available appointments, and you can read
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:04.960]   reviews right there to see, okay, do they have weird paintings in their hallway?
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:11.440]   It's what makes it easy to find a new healthcare provider.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.160]   So I think this is just a great idea.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.560]   I need some sort of doctor, I need a dentist, I need this specialist.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:23.960]   ZocDoc, search, looking for this area, availability, this insurance, boom, here's some options.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:24.960]   What's the reviews?
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:25.960]   Ooh, this one looks good.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:30.040]   Maybe I can even book it online using the app itself.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:34.960]   So there are thousands of top-rated doctors on ZocDoc and it will help you find them.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:39.200]   So it's a free app where you find these amazing actors and in most cases, doctors, not actors,
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:43.120]   and in most cases can book the appointments right there online.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:48.400]   Man, actors and opponents, that's a separate type of app right there, and act.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.920]   My God, Jesse, I said actors, opponents, and act, all of those, I mean, essentially what
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:59.360]   I think I really want to do here is fight a screen actor and somehow that's overtaking
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.760]   me as I think about ZocDoc.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:07.280]   Now forget all that, it's a free app where you can find amazing doctors and book appointments
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.280]   online.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.680]   We're talking about booking appointments with thousands of top-rated patient review doctors
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:16.040]   and specialists, filter for the ones, take your insurance, the ones that are located
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.040]   near you, they can treat almost any condition you're searching for.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.640]   It's just a smart way to find healthcare providers.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:31.520]   All right, so go to ZocDoc.com/deep and download the ZocDoc app for free.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.440]   Then you can find a book, a top-rated doctor today.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:40.280]   That's Z-O-C-D-O-C.com/deep, ZocDoc.com/deep.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.800]   You know why I'm thinking about actors, Jesse?
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:49.320]   It's because our listeners are aggressively shaming me about the fact that there is no
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:54.240]   large format movie theater near Hanover, New Hampshire, and they are aggressively shaming
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:19:01.560]   me, and I'm talking a dozen messages at least, that I am not driving 90 minutes to get to
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.120]   an IMAX screen to see Oppenheimer.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.480]   Really?
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.840]   And I wish I could.
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.360]   I wish I could.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:14.480]   But the issue is they got me booked pretty seriously up here, up in Hanover.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:18.040]   Dartmouth has me doing a lot of events in addition to my class, a lot of talks, a lot
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.040]   of classroom visits.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.400]   I'm all over the place.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.680]   So I can't just take a day off in the middle of the week, and now we have visitors up here,
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.840]   and I don't know that I'm going to make it to an IMAX while I'm still up here.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.700]   I am going to go see it in the next couple of days in 35mm.
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.740]   It leaves the local theater here in Hanover on Thursday.
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:34.740]   So I have to go find it.
[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:38.800]   I am going to go see it in 35mm, and then I'm just going to hope one of the specialty
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:44.200]   theaters in DC is doing an extended run or will bring it back and play it in large format.
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.060]   But man, they're really telling me...
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.060]   Let me tell you this.
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:52.580]   There's one listener who said they flew back from Bavaria to the States so they could see
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:56.260]   Oppenheimer in the IMAX.
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:57.260]   I haven't seen it yet.
[00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.860]   Oh man, they're going to be mad at you now, Jesse.
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:00.860]   If you don't see it in large format...
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:02.700]   Mad Dog has talked about it.
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:03.700]   Yeah.
[00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:08.980]   I hear it's really good, but I heard it's probably 25 minutes too long.
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:09.980]   Yeah.
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:19.580]   Well, I think there's a long 70mm sequence of just fire from the main explosion scene
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:24.740]   where they show the Trinity test, and they built a super high-speed IMAX camera so they
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.100]   could film real fire.
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:29.620]   Anyways, I'm excited about it, but that's why I have actors on my mind, because man,
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:33.100]   I've been oh so seriously shamed by our listeners.
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.620]   I do miss that about DC.
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.380]   I'm very much looking forward to getting back to movies.
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.740]   Nice movie theaters, big format, seeing really interesting movies.
[00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.220]   That's not what you do up in rural New Hampshire.
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:48.900]   So it's a nice break, but I am looking forward to getting back to seeing some serious movies.
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:49.900]   All right.
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.400]   We should get back to some questions is what we should do, because we have some interesting
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.900]   ones to get into today.
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:55.140]   Jesse, start us off.
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:56.580]   Who do we have here?
[00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:57.580]   Hi.
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.060]   First question is from Trent.
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:04.420]   I feel like my team is suffering from a fast productivity bias.
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:09.600]   We use Scrum, but our schedules are overloaded and too many items being prioritized haphazardly
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.860]   leading to me and my team feeling burned out.
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:17.460]   How can I help my team and client move towards slow productivity and avoid them feeling anxious
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.780]   about not delivering enough work?
[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:26.100]   Well, I think the good news here is that you do actually have in place a workflow management
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:30.540]   system that is very compatible with a more sustainable slow productivity.
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:39.080]   So for the unknowledgeable listener, the listener who doesn't know about Scrum, this is a methodology
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:44.260]   used commonly in software development for keeping track of and organizing work on software
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.260]   projects.
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:51.300]   And there's a bunch of key ideas to it, but essentially you work in short iterative sprints.
[00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:57.460]   So instead of trying to plan a very large software development project out from scratch,
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.820]   we'll do this and it'll take one week and this will take two weeks and you have a six-month
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:01.820]   plan.
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.220]   The Scrum mindset says, okay, what's the next thing we want to add?
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:05.220]   Let's just focus on that.
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.380]   This person's doing it.
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.940]   Spend two days, get it done.
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.260]   Let's test it and then see what should come next.
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.740]   So it's a more iterative way of building software.
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:20.620]   Now often the work being done in Scrum is itself tracked using a metaphor of cards pinned
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.540]   up on a board under columns.
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:27.460]   So this is a technique that comes from a related system called Kanban, not to confuse everyone,
[00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:32.820]   but Scrum often uses Kanban boards to keep track of the work.
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:37.040]   But the way to imagine this is you have a card, be it virtual or physical, for all the
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.300]   different features you might want to add to your software and they're in a sort of holding
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.300]   tank column.
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:45.660]   And then there's a column for, okay, this is being worked on and you move something over
[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:49.740]   there when one person is working on it and then that's what they focus on until they're
[00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:53.420]   done and then it gets moved to the testing column typically and into the this is done
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:54.420]   column.
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:55.420]   Okay.
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.340]   So this is the setup that Trent has.
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:01.060]   And he's saying the issue is we have this setup, but we're just moving too many things
[00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.580]   to the working on column.
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:07.540]   And we're going really fast to keep up with all these different things we want us to get
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:10.580]   done and we're working all the time and on multiple things at a time and we're burning
[00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:11.580]   out.
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.620]   So technically all they need to do is just slow down the pace.
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:14.900]   They have the structure there.
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:18.300]   They need to say, let's spend more time on each of these things.
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:22.140]   So when we move a card to the working on column, let's give that person more time to get it
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.100]   done and they have to reduce overlap.
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:29.360]   Let's not put four things in the working on column for the same person.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:33.120]   Let's put one thing at a time or two things at a time and let them finish that before
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.660]   the next thing comes.
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:38.860]   So there's a knob here you can turn to slow down the workload.
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:43.260]   Now the two questions are, is this going to make you worse?
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.140]   Is your team going to be less capable if you do this?
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:49.740]   And then the second question is, regardless of that, is your client going to accept it?
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:51.940]   And let's tackle those both separately.
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:53.260]   Is it going to make your team worse?
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:54.860]   Are you going to actually be slower?
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.860]   The answer there is almost certainly no.
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.660]   It's one of the key ideas in slow productivity.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.420]   The first principle is do fewer things.
[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:06.060]   And one of the key explanations for that is doing fewer things does not necessarily mean
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:10.640]   that you produce at a slower rate.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:17.460]   Anything that is on your plate in the moment to work on brings with it an overhead.
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.420]   Some of this overhead is just purely cognitive.
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:23.860]   I have to think about this and I'm working on this both consciously and unconsciously.
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:26.500]   And some of it is actual logistical or administrative.
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.420]   Once I'm working on something, I might have to talk to other people about it.
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.620]   I might have to have conversations about it.
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.100]   There's email or Slack messages going back and forth about it.
[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:39.180]   So there's actual literal overhead that takes up time.
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:43.960]   So when you put more things on your plate in a given period of time, you have more overhead.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:47.680]   When you have more overhead, it means you have less time to work on the work itself
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:52.720]   and you have less cognitive capacity capable to dedicate it to it when you actually do
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.720]   the work.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:54.720]   What does this mean?
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.580]   It takes longer to get those things done.
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:01.840]   So if you put three things on your plate on your Kanban board as part of your Scrum protocol,
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:07.200]   if you put three things on your plate instead of one, you're not working three times faster.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.340]   You're not getting three times as much done this week or this month because those three
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.340]   things are going to take longer to get done.
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.540]   And the quality will probably be lower as well.
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:18.780]   If you put those things one after another, the time required to execute them if they
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:22.860]   got your full focus would be less because there's less overhead getting in the way.
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:27.000]   So going one after another might end up taking less time than putting all three on your plate
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.480]   and trying to finish them.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:34.980]   So no, you're not going to be a worse producing team if you start to pull back a little bit
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:41.380]   on how many things you're moving from this collective coming up column into the individualized
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:42.660]   working on column.
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:44.540]   All right, so what about your clients?
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:45.900]   Well, here's the thing with your clients.
[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:46.900]   Two things can help.
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.980]   One, let them just see the results.
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.820]   Things are getting done.
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:56.300]   When they zoom out to the weeks or monthly scale, they say things are getting done.
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:57.340]   Features get added.
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.260]   We're happy with the work.
[00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:04.740]   So have some faith that because you aren't actually producing at a slower rate, your
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:05.740]   client will notice this.
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:11.340]   The second thing you can do is just have a good transparency, right with the client.
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:13.020]   All right, thank you.
[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:14.020]   Here's the feature.
[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:15.460]   It's on our list of things to work on.
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:20.100]   In fact, we'll give you some visibility into our Kanban, not the exact Kanban board, but
[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:24.020]   some sort of lower fidelity collection of it where you can see yes, this is exactly
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:25.380]   where this feature is.
[00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:26.420]   It's in our holding pin.
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.700]   Here's the ones we're working on now.
[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:28.740]   Okay, these are done.
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:29.860]   These are the next ones we're working on.
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:31.820]   Hey, you can see here on priority.
[00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:35.940]   This is probably four or five features back, but it's moving down the list.
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:43.660]   Clarity can give you all sorts of grace when it comes to client work.
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:44.780]   Being very clear to a client.
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:46.380]   They see what you're working on, how you're working on it.
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:47.780]   They see the speed with things are getting done.
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.060]   They see your system.
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:52.280]   That is going to get you a lot of grace from the client.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:56.220]   The thing that gets clients upset, the things that get clients demanding that you answer
[00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:59.260]   their emails at all time, the things that gets clients saying, "Just do this now.
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.440]   I don't want to wait," is not trusting you.
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.740]   Not trusting, "I don't know when this is going to get done or who's going to work on it."
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:10.300]   As long as the client feels like it's essentially up to them to badger an individual with email
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:14.260]   or Slack until they can get that person to do something, that it's on the client's plate,
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.260]   it's on their head.
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.980]   They have to keep track of it until it gets done.
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.820]   They have to keep bothering you until it does.
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:19.820]   Then you're not going to have any grace.
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.140]   They're going to say, "Just do it.
[00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.140]   I don't know.
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.140]   Work on it."
[00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:26.140]   When they see that transparency, it's in the system.
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:27.140]   Here it is.
[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:29.540]   I see it moving down the list of priorities.
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:33.400]   I see things are being executed well and fast.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.740]   Then they're going to give you a little bit more breathing room.
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:39.520]   I think you're half of the way there, Trent, because you have the system in place.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.940]   Now you just need to turn the knob down on workload, give a little more transparency
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:46.400]   to your client, and trust they'll see that the way you're doing this is actually producing
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.880]   results and I think you will be able to slow things down.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.880]   All right.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.320]   What do we got next, Jesse?
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.880]   >> All right.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.840]   Next question is from Ben.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.280]   One challenge I still have with time blocking is knowing how much time to allocate to a
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.520]   specific task or project.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:06.680]   For example, as a product manager, I can spend hours or days doing customer market discovery
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:11.400]   to decide if a new feature is worth pursuing or I can spend two hours and get a good enough
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.400]   answer.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:17.900]   Does it make sense to allocate time to a task or project based on your appetite versus how
[00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.800]   much you can afford to give it?
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:25.760]   >> How much you can afford to give it, I think, is the right starting place.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:30.520]   If you have an open-ended task or project that you need to work on, you say, I don't
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:34.880]   really know how long I'm supposed to spend on this because maybe there's not a clear
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:35.880]   done point.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:40.440]   Like the example given here Ben gave was researching and you can always keep researching.
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:45.400]   I think the right thing to do here is to fix a reasonable amount of time, block off that
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:51.800]   time when you work on it, use the scarcity of that time to push you to really focus.
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:56.520]   Okay, when I'm working on this, okay, I have two hours, I really want to get a lot done
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:57.520]   in those two hours.
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.320]   I want to be very careful about it.
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.360]   And then when you're done, you're done.
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:05.940]   And then here's the thing, let negative feedback change you.
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:10.400]   So if it turns out this is too short of time, it's not enough research, and in the end the
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:14.300]   report was not good, we didn't land the client, wait until you have that negative feedback.
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.780]   Let that negative feedback change what you do.
[00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:17.780]   Don't proactively guess.
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.520]   Let me do five hours, let me do six hours.
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.960]   Do what the time you hope from a scheduling perspective it might actually take.
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.400]   Two hours would be great.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:28.220]   That's reasonable given how many of these discovery reports I have to do.
[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:29.840]   And do your best to make that time work.
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.320]   And if you get negative feedback, then change something.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.100]   But even there, so even there, if you get the negative feedback of I didn't spend enough
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:41.640]   time on this, before you simply make your response be more time next time this comes
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.920]   up, focus first on process.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:48.600]   Well, what did I do during those two hours?
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.520]   I was just on the internet, I was just gathering stuff.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.280]   Maybe there's a better way to have done this.
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.240]   Okay, what would have been better?
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.560]   Oh, I see.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:00.480]   If I knew specifically working backwards from the report I was going to write, I could get
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:05.360]   the three big points I want to make, and then I could systematically search in this example
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.640]   for five sources for each of those points.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:11.200]   Because I want to quote three things and give a summary.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.560]   You start thinking through how could I have better organized my approach during the time
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:18.120]   I gave this to get the better result.
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.120]   Eight times out of 10, that's what you need.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:23.520]   And then the other two times out of 10, it might be some combination of I need a better
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.680]   process and I need more time.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:31.080]   But at least it's an evidence-based increase of the footprint of this task on your schedule.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:36.600]   Where this used to come up in my early work was actually helping students with how they
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.320]   studied for tests.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:45.080]   This was very common, where students would just say, I'm going to study open-ended.
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.640]   I have a test.
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:47.720]   It's a math test.
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:51.120]   I'm just going to study as much as I can because I don't want to feel guilty.
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.640]   I'll stay up all night.
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.280]   And then let's say they didn't get the result.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.480]   And sometimes their instinct would be maybe I just have to study more.
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.480]   And I would say, no, no, no.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.200]   We need to go back.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.880]   First of all, we need to restrict your study time.
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:02.880]   You should not be staying up all night.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.680]   And they get really worried about this.
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.520]   And maybe they try this and they get an even worse grade.
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.360]   And they say, OK, now let's go back and figure out how do we change this.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.880]   And almost always the answer was process.
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:18.120]   I used to call this back in the early days of my newsletter and blog the post-exam, post-mortem.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.240]   I would say, man, it's the important thing to do.
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.360]   If you worried, I studied for three hours and I got a bad grade.
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:27.820]   Before you just say, let me study all night again, do a post-exam, post-mortem.
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:32.480]   Look at the exam questions you got wrong and answer the question for yourself, what should
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.680]   I have done differently to get a better grade?
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:39.960]   Specifically, what activities during the hours I spent preparing were a waste of time?
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:43.200]   And what activities did I not do that would have really helped?
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:48.480]   And this is how you evolve over time if you're a student, much more time efficient and effective
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.560]   study habits.
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:54.360]   You realize, for example, reading over the notes was meaningless.
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.240]   I needed to be doing active recall.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.600]   The best way to do active recall is on index cards.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.320]   I should just build those index cards like right after every class.
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.680]   So I have my study index cards growing.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.700]   And here's exactly what I should be putting on them.
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:08.480]   You begin to innovate based on what's actually effective.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:12.380]   This same thing holds for other types of work as well.
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.380]   So take a guess.
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:14.380]   Here's a reasonable amount of time.
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:17.600]   If it doesn't get you the results you want, do a post-mortem.
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.320]   How could I have changed what I did in that time to have gotten more?
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:28.320]   Because I'm telling you, this evidence-based upgrade of process, eight times out of 10
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.320]   is going to solve your problem.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:32.720]   If anything, you might even be able to reduce, say, hey, if I do this right, two hours was
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.720]   too much.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.960]   An hour is fine if I really know what I'm supposed to do here.
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.600]   So that's what I would suggest.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.780]   Start optimistically.
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:41.780]   Start ambitiously.
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:46.320]   And then aggressively adjust and evolve what you do in that time to get better and better
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:47.320]   results.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:50.980]   I think you'll find this open-ended wandering of, I don't know, I spent all day working
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:54.000]   on something, that'll go away pretty quick.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.560]   All right.
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:58.600]   What do we have next?
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.100]   All right.
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:02.720]   Next question is from Nathan.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:08.080]   From Cal's image on Apple Podcasts and other podcast players, Cal's right adjustable headband
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.200]   is a little longer than the left.
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.200]   Please help.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.200]   Oh, yes.
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.200]   Okay.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.200]   Let's be honest.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:19.280]   This has nothing to do with slow productivity and Festina Linte, but it's an interesting
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.520]   question that I think we should...
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.520]   I want to address because there's an interesting answer to it.
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.800]   So I'm actually going to load up...
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.520]   Let's load this up on the screen here.
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.520]   Let's see.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.520]   All right.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:32.400]   I'm going to the deeplife.com.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.640]   That has a big picture of the album art.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.640]   All right.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:36.640]   Let's share this.
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.480]   I'm going to share this on the screen.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:44.680]   This is a bit of a tangent, everyone, but I think it's interesting.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:45.680]   Okay.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.680]   So let's get to the bottom of this.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.680]   I've heard about this before.
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.680]   All right.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.680]   Here's the album cover art.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:55.000]   For those who are watching on youtube.com or the deeplife.com, episode 260.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   Okay.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   Here's the album cover art.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.280]   So which ear is he saying is longer, Jesse?
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.280]   The right?
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.280]   The left.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:05.000]   Cal's right adjustable headband is a little longer than the left.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   Okay.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   Now, Jesse, do you remember the explanation for that?
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.800]   Because I remember this.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.800]   No.
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.120]   All right.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:15.200]   So my memory, and you can correct me if I'm wrong here, my memory is...
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.200]   Here's the issue.
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:22.920]   The image that they used, the photo they used to make this cover art had right over on the
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:26.080]   right side a microphone.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:29.240]   Because when I'm doing the podcast, I have a microphone over there, right?
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:32.080]   And we didn't want the microphone in this picture.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:38.640]   So my memory is that the team, our web team or design team that worked on this copied
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:42.520]   the left side and moved it over to the right side.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:47.320]   So I think like the headphone and part of my face on the right side, they copied from
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.920]   the left side that was not obstructed by the microphone.
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:53.320]   So they could have a picture of me without a microphone.
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:56.840]   Because typically I'd have a microphone right on my right side.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:01.480]   I think that is why the headphone look a little bit weird in the cover art is because they
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.560]   copied and pasted and just flipped over the left side to the right side.
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:08.240]   And in doing that, they didn't exactly line it up.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.560]   So yes, my headphones are...
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.360]   I never noticed it until now, actually.
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.360]   Yep.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:15.320]   I don't know why I remember that, but it's a little tidbit.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.600]   I mean, of course, the easier thing to do is just to take a photo without the microphone,
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.960]   which is what we do for our thumbnails now.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:25.280]   But I think at the time, they had the photo and they wanted to keep moving.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.400]   So there you go.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:30.880]   This is critical information for the masses, but I thought that'd be fun to do.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:31.880]   All right, let's keep rolling.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:32.880]   What do we have next?
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:33.880]   All right.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:36.680]   Next question is from Natalie.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.380]   My partner and I have very different understandings of time.
[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:44.520]   Something that could take me 10 minutes, for example, watering houseplants might take him
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:45.520]   an hour.
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:50.080]   Not because he's not capable of doing it faster, just because he moves slowly.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:53.040]   He often complains there's not enough time in the day.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:56.080]   Are there people in the world that really just operate on a different plane of time
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:00.240]   because of their mindset about responsibilities and adulting obligations?
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:07.800]   Well, I think there's two possible things going on here, and it's probably some combination
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.800]   of the two.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.300]   So first of all, I want to take this point.
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:17.760]   Is it possible that some people on certain type of work just are fundamentally slower?
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.480]   And this might be controversial, but I think the answer here is yes, and because I'm using
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.040]   myself as an example here.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:27.280]   There are certain things in my life I cannot do fast.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:31.600]   In particular, getting ready in the morning to go to work, or getting ready in the morning
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:36.720]   to go to an event, or to prepare for the podcast.
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:40.040]   I cannot do that fast, and I try.
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:46.640]   I mean, I have systems I've tried with timers and different steps, and I lay things out,
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.480]   and I don't know why.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:54.880]   I just can't get ready for anything in under 15 or 20 minutes.
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:55.880]   It just takes me forever.
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.520]   I don't know where these inefficiencies are coming out, and I've really tried to squeeze
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:03.720]   them out of my life, and I don't know why I can't do those logistical steps fast.
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.040]   It's not even hard logistical steps.
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:08.680]   It's not like I have to put on elaborate makeup or do a complicated hairdo.
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:10.600]   It just takes me a really long time.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:15.780]   My wife, by contrast, when it comes time to get ready for something, it's like Superman
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:16.780]   in the phone booth.
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:18.560]   She's like, "Hold on one second.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:22.320]   The door will kind of swing shut and then swing back open, and she's completely ready."
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:26.720]   I have no idea how she does that, and I've tried for years to be faster, and I don't
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:29.160]   know where these inefficiencies are coming from.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:32.400]   I just can't do that particular thing fast.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:37.500]   So there may be, in our response here, there may be something to this that some people
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:42.840]   for some types of things, it's just the inefficiencies aggregate, and they are just slower, and that's
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:48.020]   just who they are, and it's not due to lack of trying.
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:54.560]   On the other hand, we have this other potential issue which you hint at here, which is a mindset
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.000]   issue.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.980]   A mindset issue about this word, which I don't always love, but adulting.
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:07.220]   So this mindset issue of, "This is not the type of stuff I should have to do or the type
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:12.680]   of stuff I want to do," and almost like the toddler not wanting to put their shoes on
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:17.280]   and, "All right, I guess I'll water the plants."
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:22.720]   This mindset of someone is putting an obligation on your shoulder that you're like, "I shouldn't
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:26.800]   have to deal with this, and I'm for sure not going to give this any alacrity."
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:31.020]   That is also a common thing, especially with younger adults.
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:36.740]   So you're making this transition from a sort of less structured, less urgent student life
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:39.880]   to a professional life, where now we own a house and I have a job and I have to do these
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:40.880]   various things.
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:45.280]   Now, for most people, if you end up having kids, that pushes the adulting woes right
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:50.120]   out of you because it's, "No, you got to just do everything fast and it's hard and there
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:53.360]   is no, 'I don't want to change the diaper.'
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.640]   The kids scream, you're going to have to do it."
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:39:00.160]   But in that key adult period where you're no longer a college student, but you're not
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:05.160]   a middle-aged father of three, this type of mindset does happen.
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:11.800]   So there is a slowness that can come simply from not wanting or being fully on board with
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.560]   having to do the things you have to do.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:21.720]   If that's what's going on here, Natalie, with your partner, then here he probably just needs
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.000]   to grow the hell up.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.920]   This is a place where the answer is, "Hey, you are an adult.
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:32.480]   A hundred years ago when you were 18, you'd be running a household.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.480]   Get over it.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:34.480]   You have to do stuff.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:37.680]   Organize, get things done, be responsible.
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:41.640]   It's no one's fault that life has a lot of things you have to do.
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:46.080]   There's no one for you to complain to or gripe to that life requires you to fill out paperwork
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:50.760]   and pay bills and do your taxes and you actually have to water plants and you have to dust
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:52.640]   things because otherwise they get really dusty.
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.160]   Just, okay, get over it.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:58.560]   Look, you haven't been drafted to fight in a war and we're not losing 30% of our population
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:00.200]   to the plague, so things could be worse.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.200]   Grow the hell up."
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:05.040]   I think that's a perfectly sound reaction if that's what's going on.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.400]   I think it's some combination.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:10.360]   There might be very specific tasks that he is just slow at.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:16.520]   Again, I can attest from personal experience, some people just can't do fast.
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.440]   Again, it's time to get ready in our house.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:26.520]   Ten minutes later, I'm pondering the reality of the socks I'm holding where my wife has
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:30.320]   not only gotten ready but has gone to the event and come back already.
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:32.880]   I'm trying but I'm like, "Okay, brown.
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:33.880]   But what is brown?
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.320]   Is this a brown sock?
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.680]   Where do socks come from?"
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:41.160]   Meanwhile, she's finished building a deck.
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:44.080]   So there are some things that we just go slower on.
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:49.560]   But if you sense the mindset is, "I shouldn't have to do this work and that's why I'm being
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:51.800]   slow," you can tell him, Cal says, "Grow the hell up."
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.640]   Yeah, life is complicated.
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:54.640]   Now what?
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:41:01.640]   That needs to be the motto especially of people who are just entering adulthood.
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.640]   All right.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:04.040]   What do we got?
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.040]   Let's do another question.
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.040]   All right.
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:07.040]   What do we got next?
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.040]   All right.
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.360]   The next question is from Steve.
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.980]   "Hi, Cal.
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:19.520]   How has using the Remarkable 2 tablet changed or influenced how you use your working memory.txt
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.380]   file, if at all?
[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:25.260]   Has your working memory file habits usage evolved over time?"
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:30.500]   So again, this question is also not directly related to slowness or slow productivity,
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:34.220]   but we talked about my Remarkable tablet in a recent episode.
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.940]   So I figured this would be a good follow-up.
[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:37.940]   All right.
[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:42.020]   So what is Steve referencing when he says my working memory.txt file?
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:45.220]   This is a long-time habit I've talked about a bunch of times on the show where on the
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:50.060]   desktop of my computer, I keep a plain text file, no formatting.
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:52.680]   This is just straight up text edit on my Mac.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:55.820]   It's called working memory.txt.
[00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:59.060]   And I really do, when I'm on my computer, use it like an extension of my memory.
[00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:03.500]   I can type notes, ideas I'm trying to organize, keep track of things.
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:08.120]   It's taking my working memory and extending it.
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:11.860]   And so the question is, now that I have a Remarkable 2 tablet, do I use that for my
[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:15.720]   working memory instead of the text file on the computer?
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:19.740]   And Steve, here's what I found works best for me, at least in the last few weeks of
[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:21.180]   experimenting with this.
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:27.100]   When I'm doing work on my computer itself, I use the working memory.txt text file on
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.060]   my computer.
[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:33.220]   And the reason is I can type faster than I can write.
[00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:37.580]   So I really can capture so much information in this working memory.txt file.
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:41.100]   I mean, I'm looking at it right now on my screen.
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:44.740]   Earlier when I was prepping this podcast, for example, when I'm grabbing questions I
[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:48.780]   want to answer on the show, I just paste them into working memory.txt so that I have a place
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:49.780]   for them.
[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:53.680]   And then I delete some I don't like, and I copy them from working memory.txt eventually
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:54.820]   to my script.
[00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:57.980]   I have a list on here now called Major Admin.
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:01.140]   So I'm keeping track of a few major things I really want to get done in the week ahead.
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:04.660]   I'm kind of keeping track of this on here for now.
[00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:10.180]   I have some notes on, now that my new time block planner is back, I can do daily metric
[00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:11.860]   tracking again.
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:17.260]   So I've thrown some notes on here about the codes I'm using for the metrics that I've
[00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:19.540]   been tracking up here at Dartmouth this summer.
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:22.060]   So all of this is just on this file.
[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:25.940]   It grows and expands and contracts as I work on my computer throughout the day.
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:26.940]   It's just so fast.
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:28.380]   It can hold so much information.
[00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:30.300]   It's so easy to scroll through and see.
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:32.520]   I love it as a tool.
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:35.180]   And I still use that when I'm on my computer.
[00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:43.260]   However, one of the advantages of my Remarkable is when I'm away from my computer, I can use
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:46.400]   the Remarkable as my working memory file.
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:49.580]   What I actually use, if you're a Remarkable user, there's something called a quick sheet.
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:53.540]   So it's a notebook that's very easy to get to.
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:55.060]   So it's always there.
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:56.060]   It's called a quick sheet.
[00:43:56.060 --> 00:44:02.500]   I always just have a page in the quick sheets for my daily non-computer working memory.txt.
[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:07.260]   And this has been really helpful if I'm out walking or thinking.
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:08.500]   I can jot things down on there.
[00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:11.700]   It's been very helpful during class, during the lecture for the course I'm teaching up
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:14.260]   here to be able to take notes on things.
[00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:18.420]   Or if we're having a discussion, I can keep track of some points, remember to come back
[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:19.420]   to this.
[00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:23.180]   Or I can quickly sketch out the structure I want for the class that day.
[00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:27.240]   So there's been many occasions where I'm not at my computer where having a notebook to
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:31.020]   use as a substitute working memory.txt has been useful.
[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:34.180]   I wasn't really doing that as much before I got my Remarkable.
[00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:35.660]   But now the Remarkable is always with me.
[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:43.860]   So now I have a dual format working memory, we could call it discipline.
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:49.060]   Here for when I'm on the computer, the quick sheet on my Remarkable when I'm away from
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:50.060]   the computer.
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:55.500]   But the key thing here is having a place unstructured, easily accessible, where you can work through
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:00.040]   your thoughts, capture things, move things around is really critical.
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:01.600]   And it is really useful.
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:06.140]   And all you have to remember to integrate this into a reasonable organizational system
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:10.640]   is that when you do your daily shutdown, if you have like a time block planner, you'll
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:14.940]   have the shutdown complete checkbox to check every day.
[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:18.140]   One of the things you have to review is your working memory sources.
[00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:21.620]   And this means throughout the day, not only can you use this just to temporarily hold
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:25.420]   things you don't want to keep in your mind or temporarily organize information, you can
[00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:28.380]   take notes on things that you don't know what to do with in the moment.
[00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:32.220]   And it's just one of your David Allen inboxes that you look at at the end of the day.
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:35.260]   So you have this peace of mind throughout your day that as you capture things on there,
[00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:36.540]   it's not going to be forgotten.
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:39.740]   And you look over at the end of the day and say, okay, is any of this I need to move into
[00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:43.020]   one of my more permanent systems or put something on my calendar?
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:44.620]   Or in some cases, I'll just leave it on there.
[00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:46.220]   So yeah, I use this thing every day.
[00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:47.400]   And I need to see this tomorrow.
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.720]   So I'll just leave it on there.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:54.660]   As long as you add a review of your working memory, inboxes, be them on your computer,
[00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:58.500]   be them on a paper notebook, be them on something like a remarkable, as long as you add that
[00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:01.080]   review to your shutdown routine.
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:06.300]   This becomes a very powerful system for expanding your ability to remember and organize things.
[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:11.620]   I think it's a good question, because it gets to this sort of cybernetic complexity about
[00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:17.100]   what type of tools to use in what type of situations to extend your actual ability to
[00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:19.980]   organize things.
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:24.180]   What do you do on the weekends in terms of because you don't have a shutdown on the weekends,
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:25.180]   right?
[00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:27.580]   I don't have a shutdown on the weekends.
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:32.740]   The new so that the new time block planner, I redesigned the weekends into I call them
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:34.460]   the weekend pages.
[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:39.180]   And so now my new time block planner has, and I'll show this next week on the show when
[00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:42.660]   I bring one down to the studio.
[00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:48.220]   So Saturday and Sunday has a, like a column that you can use for both metric tracking
[00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:52.920]   if you want to track metrics on the weekend, and roughly structuring notes, right?
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:56.780]   So you know, my Sunday box for this weekend is where I had the reminder that you know,
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:59.740]   we were recording at 10am.
[00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:03.820]   Under that I have pretty extensive weekend capture.
[00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:07.980]   So you there's space for you to capture ideas and thoughts to come up during the weekend.
[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:12.020]   And then the idea is when you get to the next week, and you're making your weekly plan,
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:16.980]   and the weekly plan now faces the weekend pages, the captures right there.
[00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:20.360]   And you can see and process all those things when you set up the weekly plan.
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:25.460]   So I actually I rewrote or updated the introduction to the planner to talk about this new weekend
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:26.740]   pages discipline.
[00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:30.340]   But now it's great, you can have this rough plan for your weekend, you can do metric tracking
[00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:34.780]   if you want, and you can capture things that happen throughout the weekend in the planner
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:35.780]   on those pages.
[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:39.860]   And then when you build your weekly plan, so Monday morning, or whenever you do it,
[00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:42.340]   you see all the stuff you captured, and that's when you integrate it.
[00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:43.340]   Got it.
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:48.380]   Because it was a key thing for me is having a consistent place for capture.
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:49.980]   For the weekend, I felt it was better.
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:54.300]   What I was doing before with the old planners, I would often write these notes on the Monday
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:58.500]   page, so that when I got the Monday, I would see them, but I prefer them to be on their
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.980]   own weekend page, so that you know, this is where these thoughts came from.
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:05.900]   They came from the weekends, the Monday task list can be for Monday.
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:11.820]   So yeah, again, all this stuff you tweak.
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:13.180]   But this works well for me.
[00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:18.020]   Alright, so I wanted to end today, this segment, at least with a case study.
[00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:22.860]   So I always appreciate when when readers send in their own experiences with this advice.
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:25.060]   Alright, so this case study, and this is very relevant.
[00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:28.420]   I mean, I think this is very relevant to slow productivity.
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:32.980]   Because this is a case study, this is from Joni from Trinidad.
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:40.740]   And she's offering, she thinks, a perspective about slow productivity and motherhood that
[00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:43.300]   is not always emphasized.
[00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:49.540]   I think it's important to get different experiences in on these issues.
[00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:54.300]   So I want to read this case study that was sent to me from Joni from Trinidad.
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:57.620]   She says, "I'm a 37-year-old single mother and researcher in Trinidad.
[00:48:57.620 --> 00:49:04.780]   I was performing poorly as an undergraduate student until an unplanned pregnancy at age
[00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:06.300]   21.
[00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:10.740]   At this point, the time constraints of motherhood pushed me into what I now understand is self-enforced
[00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:12.100]   blocks of deep work.
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:19.060]   I went on to graduate with a 3.96 GPA, was valedictorian, and received a full postgraduate
[00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:25.540]   scholarship to do my PhD in the States, where I ended up having my second child and completed
[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:27.500]   my PhD at age 30.
[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:33.100]   I'm currently active in research and teaching in my country and applying to do a postdoc.
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:37.900]   I am disappointed at the lack of female perspectives about deep work.
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:42.100]   There are gender inequities in academia, not just between men and women, but in particular
[00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:45.180]   between mothers and non-mothers.
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:50.260]   I've also always been intrigued at the ways in which I am less productive when my children
[00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:51.580]   go to visit their father.
[00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:56.900]   In my experience, care work does not necessarily detract from deep work, but with the right
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:50:00.460]   approach enforces and enhances it.
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:04.660]   Care work provides a rich and insightful depth of perspective that adds to the quality of
[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:09.860]   deep work and a powerful impetus for an alternative identity outside of motherhood.
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:13.780]   I would argue that a life entrenched in deep work alone is one that is out of touch with
[00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:17.540]   humanity, reality, and meaningful research objectives.
[00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:22.700]   With the current anti-natalist trends, especially in academia, and the prevailing narrative
[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:26.380]   that motherhood leads to career suicide and an unfulfilled life, I think it is really
[00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:30.900]   important to present and discuss a more balanced perspective on deep work.
[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:33.780]   I love your work, Cal."
[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:35.500]   That kind of makes it seem like I wrote that.
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:38.700]   I love your work, Cal, not I love your work from Cal.
[00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:45.540]   I thought that was really interesting because there is, you know, I think this is a trend,
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:46.540]   right?
[00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:51.780]   There is often a trend of seeing various things like care work, be it with kids or be it,
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:59.020]   you know, sick relatives, maybe parents, aging parents at home, to always see that as antagonistic
[00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:04.140]   to the production of meaningful work or your ability to produce work.
[00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:08.540]   And so I think Joni gives an interesting alternative note, which said that's not true for everyone.
[00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:14.500]   In fact, for her and for others, you know, care work can actually help focus and enhance
[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:20.100]   and add more depth to your other work, and your other work can add more depth and meaning
[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:21.420]   to your identity with care work.
[00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:23.580]   And I think that's a really interesting perspective.
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:29.700]   We discussed that some in my interview with Yael from Brown.
[00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:33.980]   This was in the spring sometime, so I don't know how far back that was, but we talked
[00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:38.660]   about this where she went into, was it Yael Showborn?
[00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:40.780]   I don't know if I'm getting her last name right.
[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:42.980]   I'm trying to remember this right off the cuff.
[00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:47.940]   But you go find this interview back from a few months ago, and she got into this, I think,
[00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:53.580]   about because she studies the psychology of work, and in particular, its intersections
[00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:55.820]   with other identities like care work.
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:52:00.860]   And I think she had some good points about backing up what Joni said here, that it actually
[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:05.460]   can lead to a more sophisticated approach to your work.
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:08.820]   It can lead to a more sophisticated and durable self-identity.
[00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:13.220]   So I think it's a really cool thread to actually pull on there.
[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:16.620]   Different people have different experiences, but I think that's worth saying.
[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:19.620]   This is not a zero-sum time game.
[00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:26.940]   So it's not whoever has more time to dedicate to intellectual work will have a better result
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:28.220]   than those who have less.
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:29.980]   And that's the entire zero-sum game.
[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:34.500]   And so if someone has more time than me, especially for reasons I can't control, then all I should
[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:36.740]   have is upsetness or bitterness towards that person.
[00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:40.540]   I think Joni gives us interesting alternative perspectives here.
[00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:41.540]   It's complicated.
[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:44.340]   What produces really interesting work is not just time.
[00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:47.620]   It's not just complete lack of other commitments in your life.
[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:49.620]   So I thought that was a cool perspective.
[00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:52.340]   Also Trinidad.
[00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:57.820]   I really like seeing, Jesse, the different places where we have listeners write or call
[00:52:57.820 --> 00:52:58.820]   in from.
[00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:00.540]   I think we're getting pretty international.
[00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:04.500]   Trinidad, I don't know if we've had Trinidad before.
[00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:08.460]   We've been hearing more from various African countries that I don't think we had listeners
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:09.860]   before.
[00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:14.540]   Certainly India, there's a big listenership in India, a lot of different European places.
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:18.180]   Brazil, we have a good listener group I've learned in Brazil.
[00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:19.900]   So I do like the international.
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:20.980]   I think that's really interesting.
[00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:26.220]   And I love learning the different ways that different countries think about these concepts
[00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:28.700]   because it really can differ.
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:33.700]   Yeah, the audience is very, very diverse, like all sorts of countries.
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:37.180]   Okay, so what I want to do is we have a final segment.
[00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:43.540]   I want to get to the books I read in July as we do when we get to the new month.
[00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:46.300]   Before we do, though, let me just briefly mention another sponsor that helps make this
[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:47.820]   show possible.
[00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:51.340]   And that's our longtime sponsors at Blinkist.
[00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:57.760]   The Blinkist app enables you to understand the most important ideas from over 5,500 nonfiction
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:02.320]   books and podcasts in just 15 minutes.
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:07.780]   So when you use the Blinkist app, you can download to either read or listen to 15 minute
[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:10.520]   summaries of all of these nonfiction books and podcasts.
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:11.520]   They're called Blinks.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:16.140]   It takes about 15 minutes to digest.
[00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:17.360]   Jesse and I use Blinkist.
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:25.320]   The way we talk about it is a companion to anyone who wants to embrace the reading life.
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:30.000]   If you want to make reading an important part of your life, and we think you should, it's
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:35.080]   very hard to live a deep life without the source of ideas and introspection and knowledge
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:37.420]   you get from books.
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:39.400]   Use a tool like Blinkist to aid you.
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:45.040]   And the way that I use it and the way Jesse uses it is to triage potential books to read.
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:49.040]   If a book seems like it's something that might be worth covering, we will first listen to
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:51.360]   or read the Blink.
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:52.360]   Jesse tends to listen to them.
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:54.120]   I'll either, I mean, read them, I should say.
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:55.800]   I'll read the summary or listen to them.
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:56.800]   I'm happy to do both.
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:58.560]   And it usually gives you a really good sense.
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:01.360]   Should I buy and read this whole book or is it not what I thought it was?
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:04.440]   Or maybe it is what I thought it was, but this 15 minute summary, that's basically all
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:05.440]   I need to know from it.
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:09.200]   So it's a fantastic way to figure out what books to read and what books to not, and to
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:11.640]   still learn the key points from the books you don't read.
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:14.920]   You still have those at your fingerprints, at your fingertips.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:20.380]   You still have them to construct structures of knowledge inside your mind.
[00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:26.000]   So if you're a reader, you probably should use Blinkist.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:30.960]   They also have this cool other feature right now.
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:31.960]   What is it called here?
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:37.360]   Blinkist Connect that allows you to share your premium account so you can get two premium
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:38.680]   subscriptions for the price of one.
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:40.360]   That's a limited time feature, but I think it's really cool.
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:45.480]   It's a way to bring someone else into the Blinkist fold if you sign up and like it.
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:48.600]   So right now Blinkist has a special offer just for our audience.
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:54.000]   Go to Blinkist.com/deep to start your seven day free trial and get 25% off a Blinkist
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.600]   premium membership.
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:56:03.880]   That's Blinkist spelled B-L-I-N-K-I-S-T, Blinkist.com/deep to get 25% off on a seven day free trial.
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:06.720]   That's Blinkist.com/deep.
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:10.760]   And don't forget that right now for a limited time, you can use Blinkist Connect to share
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:12.520]   your premium account.
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:16.920]   You will get two premium subscriptions for the price of one.
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:25.240]   I also want to mention my longtime friend Adam Gilbert and his company, My Body Tutor.
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:29.960]   My Body Tutor is a 100% online coaching program that solves the biggest problem in health
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:34.400]   and fitness, which is lack of consistency.
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:40.980]   So the way it works, if you work with My Body Tutor is you are matched up with a coach online.
[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:44.880]   So one of the My Body Tutor coaches, they will work with you virtually to develop a
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:47.560]   fitness plan and a nutrition plan.
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:48.740]   How are you going to eat?
[00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:52.860]   What specific types of exercises, routines are we going to do to match your specific
[00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:54.880]   goals and your specific lifestyle?
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:56.300]   Then here's the key thing.
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:59.900]   Using the app, you check in every day.
[00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:01.320]   How did it go with the, you know, did I eat today?
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:03.680]   How did it go with the fitness routine?
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:05.840]   And you get feedback every day from your coach.
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:10.640]   So knowing that there is a real coach on the other side monitoring your progress pushes
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:11.960]   you to be consistent.
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:15.100]   It pushes you to actually do what you know you need to do.
[00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:19.480]   That's why My Body Tutor has been around for so long and is so successful.
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:23.000]   Now the secret sauce here is not just that you have the daily coaching, but because it's
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:29.040]   online, it's much more affordable than actually working in person with a trainer and a nutritionist
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:30.920]   and bringing them to your house.
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:35.000]   So if you want to get healthier, you want to get in better shape, you want to clean
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:40.800]   up your diet, and you're worried about consistency, the solution is simple.
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:44.160]   Use My Body Tutor.
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:49.280]   So if you're serious about this, Adam will give you $50 off your first month if you mention
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:50.760]   deep questions when you sign up.
[00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:55.320]   Just say, "This is why I signed up," is because of deep questions, they will give you $50
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:56.320]   off your first month.

[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:05.920]   you came because of deep questions.
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:10.580]   All right, let's move on now to our final segment.
[00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:18.840]   Today I wanted to review the books I read up here in New Hampshire in July of 2023.
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:25.040]   So the first book I read in July was Shadow Divers by Robert Kirsten.
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:28.640]   I had read this book before, back when it first came out.
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:33.920]   Whatever the context was, I was just looking for a fun, fast read that would be distracting.
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:35.960]   It's a fantastic nonfiction book.
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:40.320]   It's a classic of the narrative nonfiction genre.
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:46.000]   What it does is it follows a group of deep sea wreck divers from New Jersey.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.120]   These are people who dive very deep, close to 200 feet deep.
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:54.100]   It's very, very dangerous to try to look at or explore shipwrecks.
[00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:58.720]   They find a U-boat, a Nazi U-boat that no one knew about, sunk off the coast of New
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:58:59.920]   Jersey.
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:05.040]   The book is about their quest to figure out which U-boat is this.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:11.800]   They have to do these very dangerous dives, 200 feet down, going into the twisted corridors
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:13.400]   of this old submarine.
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:17.160]   It's one of these stories as a nonfiction writer you dream about coming across.
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:23.320]   I'm not going to spoil too much, but let me just say multiple people die and there's multiple
[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:30.040]   sort of hair-raising undersea disasters that people have to try to escape from.
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:32.960]   It reads like a Clive Kustler book, but it's all real.
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:38.600]   I'd read it before, but it had been a long time, and it was just as good as I remembered.
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:45.640]   The next book I read was Power in Progress, the new MIT Press book by Darren Osmoglu and
[00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:46.640]   Simon Johnson.
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:53.480]   What I've been trying to do up here is every morning I read a chapter from an academic
[00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:56.200]   press book, sort of like kind of an intellectual book.
[00:59:56.200 --> 01:00:01.640]   This is part of my Dartmouth disciplines up here, is I'm always working on just a straight-up
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:03.920]   academics writing about ideas book.
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:04.920]   This was the first one.
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:08.200]   I read this the week I was up here alone.
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:12.480]   I read it mainly the week I was up here alone in June, but I finished it in July, so I put
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.880]   it up there.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.000]   This was a really interesting book.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.280]   This is a philosophy of technology book.
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:20.440]   These are two MIT professors, Power in Progress.
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:25.920]   Essentially their core point, it's kind of a thick book, but essentially their core point
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:32.640]   is the impact of technologies, a lot of the impact of new technologies has to do with
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:39.200]   the choices we make socially and politically about how we are going to allow those tools
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:42.680]   to function and spread.
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:47.480]   There are alternative, we look at, hey, this tool came along and it had this economic impact.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:52.280]   There's often alternative ways that tool could have, its impacts could have unfolded if we
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:56.720]   made different choices about how we're going to allow this tool to be used or not used,
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:59.160]   how we're going to integrate it into our lives.
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:06.960]   So it's sort of an extension of the social construction of technology, direction of thought
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:09.800]   on philosophy of technology.
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.240]   Well argued, we could probably do a whole show on it.
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:18.160]   There's some points where I had some disagreement, some points I thought were super compelling.
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:22.200]   I think some of the historical examples maybe were very, very good, whereas some of the
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:26.640]   applications to very modern technologies, it's just hard when they're new, but felt
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:31.320]   like it didn't quite have its finger on the pulse or didn't quite feel accurate.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:37.000]   But overall, it's a very powerful theory.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.960]   These types of theories are well known in philosophy of technology, but this is very
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:46.640]   well articulated, very forcefully delivered and very relevant right now.
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:49.680]   I think this is what's happening right now with generative AI.
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:55.240]   There are a lot of people who are thinking, wait, we have some choice here about what
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.600]   we want this technology to do or not do.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:02.040]   We're not just passive, sitting back and this technology is going to do what it is going
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.280]   to do.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:08.360]   The Authors Guild, for example, has this big petition out right now, 8,000 authors, including
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.640]   many, many big names signed it.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:15.420]   It was an open letter to the artificial intelligence companies saying, essentially, don't use our
[01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:16.920]   books to train your models.
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:23.080]   It is not important for society or culture that we have generative AI models that can
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:26.020]   write books in the style of various existing authors.
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:28.560]   You don't have our permission to use your books to train your models.
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:34.920]   It's a very interesting application of the ideas from Power and Progress put into action.
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:36.840]   If you study technology, you've probably heard of this book.
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:39.800]   It's been splashy, but I really enjoyed it.
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:44.880]   Next book I read, this I read on the ... Essentially, two of these books are plane ride books.
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:48.400]   This I read largely flying back to DC from New Hampshire.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:52.960]   It was River of the Gods by Candice Millard.
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:58.160]   She also wrote, she's known for River of Doubt about Teddy Roosevelt's track, post-presidency
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:00.840]   track to South America that almost killed him.
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:07.520]   River of the Gods is about the quest to find, for the Europeans to find the source of the
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:08.520]   Nile.
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:10.920]   Basically, very well written.
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.720]   I love Candice's style.
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:14.360]   She's a very good writer.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:19.440]   She adds a narrative thread to these otherwise complicated research histories.
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:29.320]   Main takeaway you get from this, not a great job to be a 19th century explorer.
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:34.360]   This is what you come away from is, man, it was rough out there just condition wise and
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:36.440]   what they went through.
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:43.000]   The one character in this book, among other maladies to happen to him is getting a spear
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   stuck through his mouth.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.300]   I think it got stuck into the palate of his mouth.
[01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:48.300]   That's not great.
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:52.800]   There's another period where he just got swarmed by beetles, including one that went into his
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:55.440]   ear and he couldn't get it out.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.720]   He tried anything he could to get it out.
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:04.040]   It finally, it burst his eardrum and finally over weeks and weeks, it died in there.
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.960]   It got broken up by the earwax and pieces came out and he could never hear out of that
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:07.960]   ear again.
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:08.960]   It's not fun.
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.400]   Let's put it that way.
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:11.880]   It's not fun to be there.
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.720]   Did he find the source?
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:14.720]   This one, yeah.
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:15.720]   They did.
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:16.720]   They did finally find it.
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:17.720]   It was interesting.
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:18.720]   They knew so little.
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:23.540]   The Europeans knew so little about the interior of Africa until surprisingly late.
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:28.940]   This is in the mid 1800s that they're doing this exploration.
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:31.980]   The big lake there, which they named Lake Victoria, but now I think the name has gone
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:36.100]   back to the indigenous name, which I don't have on the tips of my fingers, is huge.
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:39.420]   It's like the second largest lake in the world or something like this.
[01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:42.100]   They had no idea it existed.
[01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:43.340]   What I learned, this is cool about it.
[01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:45.580]   I guess the Nile flows north to south.
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:48.460]   No, no, south to north.
[01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:55.340]   You would think why not just get to the Nile in Egypt, where it empties into the Mediterranean,
[01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:58.720]   and just take a boat up until you got to the source.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.580]   Why couldn't you just do that?
[01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:06.700]   The issue is there's this region of the Nile, if you follow it south into Africa, where
[01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:11.620]   it's this massive, essentially swampy marshland.
[01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:14.900]   It's not just a clear river all the way up to its source.
[01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:15.900]   That's where you get lost.
[01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:16.900]   There's this huge period.
[01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:17.900]   You just get lost.
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:22.140]   In fact, you can't even get boats through it because it's so choked with vegetation
[01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:23.140]   and this and that.
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:24.140]   It's huge.
[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:25.780]   You can't just take a boat easily.
[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:26.780]   People tried that.
[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:27.900]   You just get lost in this swamp.
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:29.180]   You can't even navigate with a boat.
[01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:30.180]   You had to come in.
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:37.820]   They came in over by the Arabian Peninsula in East Africa, by the Horn of Africa.
[01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:40.160]   I guess that's maybe Somalia now.
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:42.260]   They hiked in from the east.
[01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:44.320]   That's how they eventually found it.
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:48.340]   There's a cool Lincoln Childe book.
[01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:53.900]   Lincoln Childe's a thriller writer who sometimes writes with Douglas Preston, who's also a
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:58.160]   New Yorker writer and who wrote that, is the head of the Authors Guild, which wrote that
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:00.540]   letter we just talked about when we talked about Power and Progress.
[01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:03.340]   He's the source of the letter to the AI companies.
[01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:07.880]   Anyways, Lincoln Childe often writes thrillers with him, and Lincoln Childe also writes thrillers
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:09.380]   on his own.
[01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:14.580]   He has a thriller that takes place in that swamp part of the Nile.
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:21.780]   The premise is there's this tomb, this lost tomb of an Egyptian pharaoh that's under the
[01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:22.780]   waters of this swamp.
[01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:25.460]   It's like a classic Lincoln Childe techno thriller.
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:29.380]   I forgot the name of this particular book, but they bring in all this fancy equipment
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:33.540]   to the giant swamp land to find this thing.
[01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:37.380]   They build these caissons and bring the water out.
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:42.060]   They're trying to get access to this ancient buried tomb that's under these massive swamps.
[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:44.820]   It's a cool book, but not one I read.
[01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:47.700]   Why do they want to know the source of the Nile so much?
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:48.700]   I don't know.
[01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:49.700]   People like to know these things.
[01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:50.900]   It was just a question.
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:53.500]   It's like this huge open question, like, "What's the source of the Nile?"
[01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:55.140]   No one knew.
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:57.100]   People had asked this question since antiquity.
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:07:00.860]   Yeah, it's not that it was practical.
[01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:10.060]   It's not useful outside of just ... This was the heyday of the British explorer and the
[01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:11.740]   royal geographic ... I'm Googling it right now.
[01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:14.220]   There's a blue sign that says the source of the Nile.
[01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:16.780]   It's like a stop sign.
[01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:17.780]   Here it is.
[01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:18.780]   This is the source.
[01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:20.860]   Well, okay, so that's the other question.
[01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:26.640]   It's this big lake, but people then pushed it further to say, "Well, where are the headwaters
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:29.580]   that feed into this lake?"
[01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:33.320]   You can go beyond the lake and say, "Okay, here's the farthest source of water that pours
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:35.580]   into this giant lake."
[01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:37.580]   It's a cool ... There's these huge falls there.
[01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:39.460]   Yeah, I'm looking at the pictures.
[01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:40.460]   Lake Victoria.
[01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:42.100]   There's these huge falls.
[01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:48.220]   There's a riff in the earth, and the lake pours over it with these massive waterfalls,
[01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:49.220]   huge.
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:50.220]   It's really, really cool.
[01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:52.340]   I would love to see that at some point.
[01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:53.660]   That beetle thing sounds horrible.
[01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:56.860]   It was just horrible.
[01:07:56.860 --> 01:08:04.700]   The next book I read was called The Last Action Heroes by Nick the Selmier.
[01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:05.700]   I really like this book.
[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:06.740]   You know, Jesse knows this.
[01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:09.020]   I love books about the movie industry.
[01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:15.660]   This is a book about the heyday of the 1980s action movie stars, Stallone, Schwarzenegger,
[01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:19.300]   Seagal, Jean-Claude Van Damme.
[01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:23.340]   It tells their stories, and then the stories of what was happening in the movie industry.
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:25.900]   I just thought it was fascinating.
[01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:27.800]   If you like movie stuff, this is really fascinating.
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.260]   These guys were so larger than life.
[01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:33.860]   It was a very interesting, very episodic ... I listened to this on Audible, because these
[01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:37.580]   type of books are great for it, because each chapter is, "Okay, now we're going to Jean-Claude
[01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:38.580]   Van Damme.
[01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:40.860]   Now we're going to spend the chapter on Steven Seagal."
[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:41.860]   They're self-contained.
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:48.020]   Really interesting to hear about ... The thing I came away with this from is what ended this
[01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:51.140]   era was basically Jurassic Park.
[01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:55.020]   The reason why Jurassic Park ended this era, because the last action hero, this massive
[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:59.780]   Schwarzenegger movie that bombed, came out the same weekend as Jurassic Park.
[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:05.580]   The reason why that ended it was we're very used to spectacle right now in a post-Jurassic
[01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:09.740]   Park world that are delivered via special effects.
[01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:13.520]   But in a pre-Jurassic Park world, we're talking the '80s, special effects were ... The best
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:17.300]   things we could do is we could blow things up, but we didn't have computer effects.
[01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:24.820]   These super-muscled guys were, in some sense, the spectacle.
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:25.820]   Movies larger than life.
[01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:31.340]   Oh my God, Arnold Schwarzenegger or Salon as Rambo is so muscled and over the top that
[01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:32.900]   it was a spectacle.
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:37.460]   Nowadays, we get the spectacle by having really cool special effects done by computers.
[01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:41.140]   We can see the Transformers jumping over buildings and stuff like that.
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:43.620]   But when you couldn't do that, how do you make a movie larger than life?
[01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:46.420]   You put larger than life people into it and blew things up.
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:51.460]   It was like this was the special effects before there was really cool, spectacular special
[01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:52.680]   effects.
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:58.900]   It was these guys that were completely ... Either they were muscle-bound to a degree that was
[01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:01.940]   completely attention-catching because it was so novel.
[01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:02.940]   It's Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:04.080]   It's just novelly strong.
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:07.620]   Or they were doing crazy martial arts stuff.
[01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:11.860]   So like Jean-Claude Van Damme, Seagal doing the Judo.
[01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:16.340]   They're doing crazy throwing people and doing splits and kicks in the air and all these
[01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:18.460]   type of crazy stuff.
[01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:20.620]   It was spectacle.
[01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:25.460]   So we had to rely on larger than life humans doing larger than life things to get spectacle,
[01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:27.340]   blowing things up around them.
[01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:31.460]   Once Spielberg came along with Jurassic Park, we said, "Oh, we can make spectacle without
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:34.560]   having to just have a person be crazy to look at.
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.140]   We can now make a dinosaur.
[01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:37.480]   We can have robots."
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:42.860]   And that was the end of relying on larger than life people just on their own to make
[01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:43.860]   a movie worth watching.
[01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:45.100]   It just wasn't as interesting anymore.
[01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:48.940]   Yeah, Schwarzenegger's strong, but the T-Rex, I have to look, it's a T-Rex.
[01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:50.460]   That's more interesting.
[01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:52.620]   More interesting than Schwarzenegger's biceps.
[01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:53.620]   So I thought it was cool.
[01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:57.740]   If you like movies and you grew up in that era like Jesse and I did, you'll probably
[01:10:57.740 --> 01:10:58.740]   like that book.
[01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:00.620]   Were you big in those?
[01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:04.340]   I mean, I saw all that stuff growing up.
[01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:10.780]   I just saw the Arnold documentary on Netflix and watched through a lot of that stuff.
[01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:13.860]   I recommend the Arnold autobiography.
[01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:14.860]   I recommend that to everybody.
[01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:15.860]   I read that.
[01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:16.860]   Yeah.
[01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:17.860]   Isn't that good?
[01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:18.860]   Yeah.
[01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:19.860]   I was like, "Oh, I'm going to watch that stuff."
[01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:21.940]   Like when I was talking about working out and stuff.
[01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:22.940]   I thought it was better than...
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:23.940]   Your first half of the book.
[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:25.940]   Having read the book, I was somewhat disappointed in the documentary.
[01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:26.940]   The documentary was fine.
[01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:27.940]   Yeah, I knew all the stuff in the documentary.
[01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:29.620]   It was cool to see the things.
[01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:31.180]   I knew it already and it was a little bit less...
[01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:32.180]   It was more cursory.
[01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:33.180]   All right, final book I read.
[01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:34.180]   This was another plain book.
[01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:35.180]   So this was...
[01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:39.760]   I bought one book with one flight, the other book with the other.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:43.020]   It's The Island by Adrian McKinty.
[01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:47.020]   It was like a big splashy thriller from last year, I think.
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:49.020]   A lot of fun.
[01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:51.140]   One of these books is all third act.
[01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:58.960]   So it's set up in a thriller premise and then it's just 100% go until the book is over.
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:08.680]   So in this case, it's a family ends up stuck on this island in Australia with deliverance
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:12.220]   style Australian hillbillies.
[01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:16.940]   And they accidentally kill someone, run someone over with their car.
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:21.540]   Anyways, long story short, they realize they're going to kill them.
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:28.060]   And so it's this mom and her stepkids are trying to escape on this island, escape being
[01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:29.820]   killed by this whole family on this island.
[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:31.660]   And they're the only people on the island is this family.
[01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:32.660]   There's no way off.
[01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:34.660]   It's surrounded by shark infested waters.
[01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:36.820]   They set this up early on when they bring the boat over.
[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:41.580]   You can see the sharks just surrounding the boat, surrounded by shark infested waters,
[01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:45.940]   full of all these crazy Australian hillbillies with all these weapons and motorcycles and
[01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:49.380]   the sun is beating down on them and they're just trying to escape and survive.
[01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:50.380]   And that's it.
[01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:53.940]   And it just goes and it just goes and the stakes are high and they're doing terrible
[01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:55.220]   things to the people they capture.
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:56.220]   And that's the book.
[01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:59.620]   And it just goes, goes, goes, goes, goes until the end.
[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:00.940]   And then that's it.
[01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:04.300]   That's hard to pull off those full third, only third act type books.
[01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:06.740]   Like it's in the exciting climax the entire time.
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:07.740]   This one did it right.
[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:08.740]   And it got a lot of acclaim.
[01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:09.740]   Well, well done.
[01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:13.900]   I had a lot of fun with it.
[01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:15.900]   Don't read if you're squeamish, but it was cool.
[01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:16.900]   It was cool.
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:19.700]   I mean, I wonder if you could probably do a movie about it.
[01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:22.460]   It's hard to do these movies that are all third acts.
[01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:23.780]   Nolan did it with Dunkirk.
[01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:25.020]   Dunkirk is all third act.
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:31.340]   If you watch that movie, it's just whole thing is the kind of you're in the climax.
[01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:33.020]   Everything's happening for the whole movie.
[01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:34.020]   Hard to do this book.
[01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:35.020]   Does it?
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:36.020]   So anyways, I liked it.
[01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:37.020]   I think it's a good book.
[01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:38.020]   I think it's a good book.
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:39.020]   I think it's a good book.
