[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.720]   Pastor writes in to ask, "Have you personally conducted funerals for
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.360]   non-Christians? If not, would you? And if you did, what would be your thoughts in
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.080]   doing it, and how would that funeral be tailored differently from the funeral of
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.040]   a believer?" Pastor John? I have, but not many. I haven't done many funerals
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:32.680]   for unbelievers. When I came, I made the decision just because of priorities here,
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.360]   and I wouldn't encourage every pastor to make this decision, I didn't encourage
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.920]   the funeral homes in the area to look to me as a burying pastor. Because a lot of
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.160]   people, they come to funeral homes, they don't know anything about the church,
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.280]   and they don't know how to have a funeral, and they look to some person. Now
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.400]   others on our staff have done that explicitly. They're available, and so
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.800]   they go and they make it a ministry to unbelievers to do funerals. Now
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:12.400]   I've done some, and I would say that what I do is make sure the family
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.520]   knows I'm a Christian pastor. This funeral will be done. If you want me to
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.000]   do it, I'm going to speak from the Scriptures, I'm going to talk about the
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.840]   good news of Jesus Christ, and I'm going to speak as a Christian. So don't ask
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.040]   me to be generic, because that's not my job. I'm not a generic, professional
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.480]   burying parson. I'm a Christian herald of the good news, so if you want me to do
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:45.680]   that, I'll do it. And so my approach in the few that I've done has been, I don't
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.560]   talk about the person who's dead, I talk to the living. I talk about the gospel, I
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.280]   talk about God's sufficiency to help them in their crisis, because what
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.000]   they're experiencing right now is that they have just experienced a huge loss,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.960]   and God has something to say to them about their need. Now there have been
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.960]   some times where it is so, you know, the elephant in the room, you might say, is
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.040]   that these are believers who had an unbelieving brother, thinking of one in
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.480]   particular, where everybody in the room knew he was an unbeliever, and they're
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.440]   wondering, "What do I think? What am I going to say?" And there were only a
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.160]   handful of people there, and I gathered them around the coffin at the end, because
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.480]   it was so bitter cold outside, we weren't going to go to the graveside, and I said
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.520]   to them, I just looked them right in the eye, about 12 people gathered around the
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.680]   coffin, and these were older folks mainly, and he was a brother who was just
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.200]   militantly anti-christian, and I said, "Now we're all aware that Henry
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.920]   was not a believer, and we know there's no hope for unbelievers beyond the
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.600]   grave." And I let that sink in, and then I said two other things that I think are
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.200]   always fitting to say. We don't know, and I looked at his sister, I said, "We don't
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.640]   know how Henry dealt with the living God in the last minutes of his life, and
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.640]   therefore we don't pass final sentence at this moment on this man's soul. What
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.840]   we do know is the judge of all the earth will do right." Genesis 18, 25. And that's
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:38.520]   probably the truth that I would end on in almost any unbelieving
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:45.360]   funeral, where people are aware that this person may well be in hell today. We
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:52.920]   close by saying God will always do what is right, and we will approve what He
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.840]   does. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast.
