[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   - What should most people do
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.840]   if they are feeling frustrated with someone that they feel,
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.920]   for instance, 80% of your problems come from 20% of people.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.280]   In this case where I guess we're saying,
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.340]   like 90% of problems come from these 10% of people,
[00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.200]   but really it behooves us all to try and figure out
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.800]   how best to interact with others.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.520]   And so you've spelled out a number of ways
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.120]   that we can do that today.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.720]   If you were to highlight, I never want to pressure,
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.640]   but highlight one or two things to just keep in mind
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.180]   as one moves through the world,
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.280]   the web tool seems especially effective.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.920]   Is there anything else that you recommend
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.360]   that we just hold in mind as we navigate forward?
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.280]   'Cause it's quite a landscape out there.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.400]   - Yeah, several things,
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.720]   and I can be brief with each of them.
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.920]   First, there's what I call the four forget about it's.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.920]   Is forget about trying to give the person insight
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.400]   into how they're behaving.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.360]   That blows up the person.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.060]   Just like I said, don't blame them for you
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.160]   ending the relationship.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.240]   So just forget about giving them insight.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.120]   Instead, talk about what we can do now.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.260]   Talk about options.
[00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.760]   Talk about, don't go inward with them, go outward with them.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.160]   So when you go inward, you escalate their defensiveness.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.760]   So don't try to give them insight into themselves.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.880]   And a lot of people say, how can I make him see
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.720]   that what he's doing is so wrong?
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.520]   Or how can I make her understand
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.720]   that she's creating the problem we're trying to solve?
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.920]   Just forget about that.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.200]   Talk about, okay, here's what our options are.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.760]   Let's talk about what to do.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.480]   Second is, don't emphasize the past.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.180]   And people argue forever with high conflict people
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.680]   about the past, and you never resolve the past
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.800]   with a high conflict person.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.240]   And I'll tell you in a minute why that may be.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.040]   Focus on what to do now and the future.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.800]   Future focus, not past focus.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.040]   Maybe you need some information to understand a problem,
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.920]   but then emphasize the future.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.680]   The third is, don't focus on emotions.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.800]   And especially don't yell at them, don't burst into tears,
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.800]   don't tell them how frustrating they are, all of that.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.600]   And this is what I'm gonna tell you now is a theory
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.780]   that I hope someone figures out.
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.300]   And that is, people with personality disorders
[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.880]   and high conflict personalities don't seem to go through
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.360]   the five stages of the grieving and healing process.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.160]   Denial, anger, bargaining, depression,
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.360]   sadness, and acceptance.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.480]   They seem to get stuck at denial and anger.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.600]   So what happens is, they don't resolve things.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.040]   They don't, quotes, get over things.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.580]   They don't get over the divorce.
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.400]   They don't get over the job loss.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.120]   They don't get over having to sell their house
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.400]   'cause they couldn't pay the mortgage.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.280]   They don't experience the normal human healing
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.500]   and grieving process.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.000]   So they're stuck.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.040]   And so a lot of situations with them turn to anger.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.620]   They're angry, but they're not resolved.
[00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.700]   So high conflict people are constantly talking
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.200]   about the past and how aggrieved they are.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.040]   They shouldn't have done that to me.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.620]   I was right to have done this.
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.800]   And people start, when I say that,
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.360]   like students in my class, oh yeah, that's what I see.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.840]   They keep repeating themselves.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.040]   And they go to as many people as they can
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.520]   and tell the story.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.660]   I believe they're trying to grieve and heal,
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.800]   but they don't have the mechanism.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.560]   And I don't know exactly why.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.860]   So I'm hoping someday neuroscience will figure out
[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.140]   what connection is missing and can we give people that
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.860]   so that they can grieve and heal?
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.240]   Well, what that means is if you focus on emotions,
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.500]   you're focusing on an area that's unresolved
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.820]   and has a lot of hurt.
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.420]   And so if you say, well, how do you feel about that?
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.780]   They almost always say, I feel terrible.
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.820]   I suggest not saying, how you doing today?
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.120]   Because the answer I get is terrible.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.720]   You know what she did yesterday.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.080]   You know what he did last week.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.640]   So instead, do small talk.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.080]   Do it about anything except about how are you feeling today.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.480]   So don't ask how you're feeling.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.000]   Focus on thinking and doing.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.480]   And an example I teach lawyers and mediators
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.000]   is don't say, how do you feel about that proposal?
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.820]   Say, what do you think about that?
[00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.240]   Could you picture doing that?
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.560]   How could you do that?
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.640]   How could that work for you?
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.240]   Because if you focus, how do you feel?
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.080]   I feel insulted.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.080]   I feel abandoned.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.440]   And then they drown in that.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.120]   And next thing you know, you've lost them.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.240]   So avoid emotions.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.760]   Don't focus on emotions, but acknowledge emotions.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.660]   Say, I can see your frustration.
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.760]   Now here's how I can help you today.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.360]   The fourth is don't use names.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.960]   Don't label people.
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.520]   Don't say you're a high-conflict person.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.840]   And lawyers do that to motivate their clients.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.080]   That doesn't work.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.520]   Don't say you have a personality disorder.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.480]   You may be wrong, and that never motivates anybody.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.320]   So that's the fourth.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.240]   Forget about it.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.280]   So that's key stuff for people to avoid.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
