[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.880]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.760]   My name is Joshua Sheets and today is Monday, December 1, 2014.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.320]   Six days after it was promised, I finally bring you the show of...
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.480]   Excuse me. Bring you the show with the review of Tony Robbins' new book.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.600]   It's going to be packed. Stick with me.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:43.040]   ♪
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.160]   This show today is actually going to be the first book review that I have done
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.240]   on the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.840]   And there's a reason that I'll get to in just a moment why I haven't done them.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.160]   And let me tell you straight up off the top,
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.600]   this thing sank me to try to do a good review.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.800]   And I'm not sure that I have the right temperament and personality
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.920]   to do good book reviews for a show like this,
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.920]   because this thing was a beast to put together.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.000]   And as you'll hear when we get into the content,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.960]   it was probably unnecessarily too much of a beast.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.120]   There are a few ways that I could have handled this,
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.080]   but I'm doing it the way that I would be interested in listening to.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.320]   And it was a challenge to prepare this review.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.680]   I hope you guys like it.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.280]   Let me quick outline for you what you can expect in the show.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.120]   And then also, let me, then I'll give you a little bit of preamble
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.960]   about why this thing is six days late,
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.000]   because I think it's important, you know,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.080]   because I've learned something even going through that.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.120]   So this show, I got Tony's new book.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.960]   I didn't get an advanced copy or anything like that.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.120]   I wasn't not cool enough yet to get those.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.160]   So I just ordered it and I had pre-ordered it and it showed up at my door.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.320]   And so I went ahead and read it and it's a great book.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.760]   It really is. It's a great book.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.800]   And I prepared a review,
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.560]   but this review is probably going to be a little different
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.120]   than any other book review that you've often heard.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.040]   That I'm going to try to do in an audio format.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.520]   I'm going to try to use this book as an outline for teaching concepts,
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.760]   that some of the concepts that Tony teaches.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.160]   I'm going to do that without plagiarizing his content,
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.400]   but I am going to reference it and encourage you to read it.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.640]   And then I'm also going to critique the book
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.440]   and point out some of the flaws in the book,
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.400]   because there are some minor flaws and there are some major flaws.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.800]   I will make note of the timestamps for the different sections.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.120]   I expect today's show to be fairly long.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.600]   It could be two, three hours or more. I don't know.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.040]   You can obviously know at this point when you see how long it is on your recorder,
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.560]   or on your player.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.400]   But I expect it to be long and in-depth.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.160]   So feel free to use those timestamps if you want to click around.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.800]   And please divide this up into multiple listening sessions.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.840]   This is not, I'm not going to be repeating myself multiple times.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.400]   I'm going to be attacking the subject matter from a few different contexts
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:51.280]   and using each of my points and critiques as a way to teach you about a basic concept
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.560]   in financial planning.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.240]   I do need to first apologize to you.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.480]   I learned something this last week in preparing for this review.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.960]   Today is Monday as I record the show, December 1.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.240]   And my last show was last Monday, episode 108.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.600]   And I had planned to have this review finished by Tuesday
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.040]   and then ship it out the door and then Wednesday do for you a show on gratitude,
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.240]   essentially, in preparation for the American holiday of Thanksgiving.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.920]   And I didn't get it done.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.200]   And I also didn't do a very good job of communicating with you guys.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.920]   I didn't disappear.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.560]   I got a couple of emails and a voicemail saying, "Joshua, where are you?"
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.000]   And I apologize.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I should have done a better job communicating.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.880]   I had, just before I started recording the show,
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.720]   had a great email from a listener who shared with me his thoughts.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.480]   The listener said, "Don't leave us hanging like this."
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.520]   Because basically what came through is it's an abandonment of,
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.720]   it's essentially a violation of trust,
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.640]   of the trust that you put in me because I've committed
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.720]   and I've set a standard of doing a daily show.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.000]   And so I never even thought about it that way until I had heard from the listeners.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.120]   And I apologize to you guys.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.200]   I'm new to this whole podcast and online stuff.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.560]   And I never thought about it that way.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.960]   I just figured if I don't have something to,
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.120]   if I'm not ready to say something that's worth listening to,
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.160]   why would I put something out?
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.720]   But you're right.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.160]   Consistency is important.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.680]   And so I've learned my lesson.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.640]   This show, I've taken a lot of time preparing for it for multiple reasons.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.120]   Number one, I had to read the book and it's a 600 page book
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.120]   and it's heavy and it's thick and it's meaty.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.840]   And it's a great book, but it's heavy and it's thick and it's meaty.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.840]   Number two, as I started preparing a review,
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.520]   I needed to fact check a bunch of stuff.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.520]   And so that kind of took a lot of time.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.320]   And even in terms of just preparing for it,
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.000]   it just sucked up a lot of time.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.520]   And I wanted to do a good job with it,
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.400]   especially because I think it's a great book
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.480]   and I also have some serious concerns over it.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.760]   And poor little old me,
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.880]   who am I to go up against Tony Robbins?
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.760]   One of the great icons of, I guess,
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.640]   the self-help and self-improvement,
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.600]   life mastery, to use his branding, the life mastery movement.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.440]   So I wanted to do a good job with it.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.800]   On Tuesday, I had a busy day with a couple of interviews.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.800]   And what I should have done was gone ahead
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.080]   and played some interviews on Tuesday and interview on Wednesday
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.160]   just so their show would be out, as I'd said,
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.680]   instead of just simply not doing a show.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.560]   But I learned my lesson.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.680]   I apologize to you all.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.320]   So I will be much more conscious of that going forward.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.240]   So enough of the preamble.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.480]   I apologize about missing the days.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.080]   And then Thursday, we left.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.840]   My wife was a little bit sick, just a bunch of things,
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.920]   but I could have done a better job communicating.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.720]   So just busyness.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.560]   And then the holiday that we had here in the United States
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.240]   was out of town Thursday through Sunday.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.360]   But I'm back now.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.720]   Let's get to the meat of it.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.080]   So this show is a book review.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.480]   And I don't really like doing book reviews.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.840]   I think it's important to do them,
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.680]   especially for many people
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.880]   that can be a really good thing to do.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.560]   But I don't really like, personally,
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.400]   really want to do them on the show,
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.240]   at least not in audio format.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.520]   Because in a book review,
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.120]   often you're going to be necessarily critical.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.280]   And I don't really like to be critical.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.640]   More than anything, I like to just simply shut my mouth
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.680]   and learn what I don't know.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.760]   And I also, when doing a book review,
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.120]   I often feel unqualified to do reviews
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.360]   of being critical of other people's work.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.400]   I really feel what I think the author must feel
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.320]   when they pour their heart and their soul
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.600]   into a book for years, usually, to prepare a good book.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.480]   And then it's criticized.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.920]   And I imagine myself in that place.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.680]   And I think, what would I feel?
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.680]   And so I don't like to be very critical.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.480]   But this show is constructive criticism.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.760]   And I really admire Tony Robbins
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.800]   for taking on this challenge.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.360]   I think it's an awesome challenge that he's taken on
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.720]   and very, very needed.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.760]   In summary, this book really is a great book.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.280]   It's well worth the money.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.360]   It's extremely effective at doing a lot
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.040]   of what it's designed to do.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.760]   And it's probably going to be one of the best expenditures
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.760]   on a money book that you could make.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.760]   I'd encourage you, don't get it from the library.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.160]   Buy it.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.000]   I wore out four highlighters on the book.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.600]   And I filled all of the back pages
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.440]   where I take notes in books with notes.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.520]   So I ran out of room at the back.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.680]   And so if that's any kind of endorsement,
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.640]   it really is a great book.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.760]   Books are phenomenal when you start looking at them
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.760]   as far as the return on investment.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.600]   I've made a decision sometime back
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.960]   to not save money on books.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.000]   I've gone through a period of time
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.200]   where I used to buy a ton of books.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.480]   And then I bought way too many books.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.040]   And then I quit.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.880]   And I said, I'd get them all from the library.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.200]   And then finally, I realized, for me,
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.560]   I need to destroy a book with an ink, with highlighters,
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.480]   and with pens for me to learn from it.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.240]   And when you look at the amount of value
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.960]   that you can get from a book, it's phenomenal.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.320]   And this book, the primary reason that I bought the book
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.880]   was when I heard who Tony Robbins interviewed
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.480]   for the book, I pulled out Amazon,
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.160]   and I pre-ordered it immediately.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.040]   Because evidently, according to his notes,
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.040]   he interviewed almost 50 people or something around 50 people,
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.680]   many of them incredibly successful billionaires,
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.000]   many of them involved in the investment markets.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.800]   And these are people that I don't, at the moment,
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.240]   have access to.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.400]   I would love to sit down and speak with all the people
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.520]   that he spoke to.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.280]   But I haven't developed the ability
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.720]   to get that access myself.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.400]   And I haven't made the time in order
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.200]   to build the platform like Tony Robbins has.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.600]   So I just figured, man, if I can listen to Tony
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.200]   or read Tony's interviews of that,
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.520]   even if they're just excerpts, that'd be phenomenal.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.200]   He puts excerpts of the interviews in the book.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.640]   But just the excerpts alone are worth the price of admission.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.320]   I'd pay thousands to get the full excerpts
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.520]   of his interviews.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.040]   I'm sure he has them in his notes.
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.920]   Man, I'd pay thousands to get a book with those done.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.640]   Because, I mean, and that would be a cheap price
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.840]   when you compare it to what--
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.760]   when you compare the value of what you can get from somebody
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.160]   just by reading something like an interview transcript.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.520]   I would love to do the research process for a book like this.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.960]   It's a great book.
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.320]   And what Tony Robbins tried to do,
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.920]   as far as when he set out,
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.800]   is he tried to create a book that would appeal to beginners
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.240]   and also to experts.
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.480]   And to the poor, just getting started.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.240]   And to the rich, you were already arrived, so to speak.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.400]   And so he set himself a tall benchmark.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.040]   Did he hit it?
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.880]   I'm not so sure.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.000]   I do think it's a great book,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.160]   but I don't see any way that he hit that.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.240]   But I think that there are ideas in it
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.600]   that can be pulled out of it
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.680]   and applied to just about any situation.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.040]   My primary motivation to reading the book
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.360]   was to gain access to the billionaire transcripts.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.040]   And also, I wanted to learn how to teach.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.440]   One of the things that I am focused a lot on
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.760]   is trying to learn how to be a better teacher,
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.640]   especially a better teacher of financial concepts,
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.240]   to you, the audience.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.720]   I'm really trying to build and practice
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.120]   the skills of being direct, succinct,
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.600]   using appropriate metaphors and analogies,
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.360]   but not using hyperbole.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.920]   And so I wanted to see how Tony Robbins did it,
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.200]   because he's widely renowned as being a phenomenal teacher.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.840]   I've never met him.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.800]   I would love to meet him.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.240]   I'd love to interview him for this show,
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.400]   which, by the way, if any of you know how to get in touch with
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.440]   and do those author interview requests, things like that,
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.120]   I'd love to interview him on a show like this.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.880]   I live probably 15 minutes from his house in Palm Beach.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.360]   But I never met him, never been to any of his seminars.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.280]   Years ago, I listened to his--
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.560]   I bought his courses, a couple of his courses.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.080]   I bought his personal power course,
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.360]   his time management course,
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.000]   and his healthy body course, something like that.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.080]   And I really enjoyed them.
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.240]   I found probably the personal power course
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.880]   to be the most interesting and the most applicable.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.960]   The other two, I thought the ideas were interesting,
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.320]   but I wasn't able to apply them to my life very effectively.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.200]   They were long on kind of psychological tools,
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.240]   but they didn't seem to fit--
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.120]   the psychological tools didn't seem to fit my needs at the time.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.880]   So I still have them.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.760]   His time planning system, rapid time something or other,
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.600]   it was interesting, and I valued it.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.480]   But I didn't really--
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.360]   wasn't able to apply them.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.520]   But the personal power ideas were very interesting and very useful.
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.200]   Someday, I want to go to his seminars.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:51.760]   I really do.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.120]   I had a friend that went recently
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.880]   and really benefited from one of his seminars.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.320]   But just for me right now,
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.880]   I don't think I've extracted all the value from his CDs or his books yet.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:01.520]   In order for me--
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:06.720]   to be worth it for me to spend $500 or $15,000 on a seminar,
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.120]   I don't need--at this point, I don't need the emotional lift.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:14.080]   I don't think I need the emotional lift that a seminar provides.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.800]   I need to focus on just the application.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.480]   I'm pretty clear on applying the technique
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.320]   without needing to go to a seminar.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.840]   But books are a different animal.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.920]   A book in a seminar is very different.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.160]   In fact, he says that right in the preamble of his book
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:30.320]   as far as developing the book and trying to use it as a teaching method.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.960]   And I really love more than anything the purpose of the book.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.880]   He sets out and he basically says how he got around to writing it
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.280]   because it's been 20 years since he's written a book.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.800]   And so he laid out for himself--
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.880]   he talked about the history in the beginning
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.480]   about basically watched the financial crisis in 2008
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:56.160]   and saw basic criminal behavior, essentially,
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.960]   and then people walking away scot-free on Wall Street.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.720]   So he set out the purpose of this book.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.320]   And on page 30, he says,
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.520]   "This book is committed to one primary outcome--
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.480]   to set you up so you have an income for life
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:13.440]   without ever having to work again--real financial freedom.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.480]   And the good news is it can be achieved by anyone,
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.280]   even if you're starting out in debt, deep in the hole,
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.560]   no exaggeration, with a little bit of time, consistent focus,
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.400]   and the right strategies applied,
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.400]   you can get to financial security or even independence in a few years."
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.560]   So I thought, what a great purpose for a book.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.320]   That's exactly what my show is about.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.720]   And I really--man, if I had to create that for a purpose statement of my show,
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.280]   I'd be totally--that's exactly what this show is about.
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.680]   To me, I want to read a book like that.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.920]   And there are really some amazing things and concepts taught in this book.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.560]   But in some things, you're going to have to read through the lines.
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.520]   Read through the lines and look for the themes
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.600]   that are surrounding some of the words.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.960]   You got to ignore some of the words.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.800]   In many ways, the book is actually a study in contradictions.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.360]   As I was going through it, I was constantly making notes.
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.320]   This contradicts that.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.280]   This contradicts that.
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.080]   This contradicts that.
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.760]   I'm going to give you many of those examples.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.160]   It used to bother me in a finance book.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.440]   But as I've matured, it bothers me less.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.600]   It bothers me because I feel like an author
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.920]   should be able to remove some of those contradictions
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.600]   or should address them.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.720]   But I recognize now that finance, the field of finance,
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.320]   is inherently contradictory.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:30.000]   And I'll give you many specific examples of those contradictions
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.280]   so you can understand what I mean.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.600]   Because one of the challenges you have to learn, I think,
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.120]   to deal effectively in the world of finance,
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.560]   you have to learn how to hold seemingly contradictory ideas
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.760]   in your head at the same time.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.920]   That's tough because we're not taught to do that in our society.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.800]   We're mainly taught black and white, right and wrong.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.160]   This is right or this is wrong.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.360]   This investment strategy is right.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.400]   This one is wrong.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.400]   And it was frustrating for me until I finally recognized,
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.040]   you know what?
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.800]   I can hold these things at the same time in my head.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.240]   I also used to take books like this as gospel,
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.160]   essentially saying, this book is right.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.600]   It has the answers.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.160]   And now I just say, what can I learn from it?
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.880]   How can I fit this into my own mental models?
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.320]   And I do like to argue with books.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.240]   I like to argue with the author and see
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.680]   whether I can, in my head, defeat the author and say,
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.120]   OK, I know something different.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.800]   Or I can say, hey, this author defeated something
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.240]   that I was able to deal with.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.320]   And I don't know any other way to do that.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.000]   I think books are a good way to argue with people.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.720]   Arguing with people in verbal writing--
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.240]   or excuse me, verbal conversation,
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.000]   I think it's usually completely ineffective.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.800]   Because then you have to deal with a relationship dynamic
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.040]   and hurting the relationship, and you never win an argument.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.080]   But arguing with books, to me, that is a key thing.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.600]   Because that's how we change.
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.280]   The book is long.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.880]   It is 600 pages.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.960]   And in many ways, this gives me courage.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.920]   I've struggled with self-confidence
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.200]   as far as my long shows.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.960]   And some of them I really regret.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.840]   That was why I didn't record this show sooner.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.000]   As I said, I regret some of the shows that I published,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.320]   because I don't think they were packed with enough information
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.200]   in the past.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.400]   And I've learned from that.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.000]   And I am learning from that.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.160]   But then also, sometimes when I do a show
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.440]   and I feel like that was perfect,
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:11.200]   but it was three hours, then I look out in the marketplace
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.560]   and I say, well, no one else is doing that.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.600]   Is it too long?
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.160]   The average podcast is supposed to be 30 minutes long.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.600]   That's what everyone says it should be.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.600]   But if Tony Robbins can sell--
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.160]   he says his average seminar is 52 hours.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.640]   If he can sell 52-hour seminars and 600-page books on money,
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.000]   I figure I could do two-hour-long podcast episodes,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.760]   as long as they're packed with content
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.640]   and they're entertaining and they're riveting.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:39.680]   And the way he set out this book is really interesting to me.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.480]   He is a master teacher.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.000]   And he says specifically up front that his writing style
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.480]   is different than many other authors.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.240]   He specifically says, stick with me,
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.320]   because I'm teaching you in a certain way.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.240]   And he explains how to do that.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.840]   I don't know.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.360]   I assume it's effective, because there's
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.480]   millions of people that have done it.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:03.600]   It's not my favorite way of consuming content
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.040]   and consuming writing.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.880]   But I did find it to be a good book.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.160]   So maybe it was effective.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.040]   Time will tell, right?
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.080]   The general layout of the book is
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.600]   that it's organized around Tony's seven simple steps
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:16.240]   for success.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.440]   So he lays out these seven steps.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.720]   And this is the organizing principle.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.040]   And each of the seven steps has sub-steps and sub-chapters.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.600]   The chapters are numbered one through seven,
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.600]   and then 1.1, 1.2.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:34.560]   Step one is a focus and a desire to basically say,
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.400]   make the most important financial decision of your life,
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.400]   which is to be an investor and not just a consumer,
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.240]   and decide what percentage of your income
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.560]   to put away for the future.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.400]   Automate it, and then use some mental tricks
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:57.760]   to increase that amount of income
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:58.880]   that you're saving over time.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.720]   So he starts with a commitment to action,
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.880]   essentially saying the number one biggest decision
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.240]   in your life is, what percentage of my income will I save?
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.440]   Will I save 20%?
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.320]   Will I save 10%?
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.040]   Will I save 50%?
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.600]   That's step one.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.200]   And I really thought that was valuable.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.520]   He goes in detail into an idea
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.000]   showing some psychological research
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.560]   on the focus of save more in the future,
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.720]   where they've substantially increased
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.160]   the amount of money that people were saving
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.560]   if they committed to future increase of savings.
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:33.200]   I learned this years ago from Brian Tracy.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:37.680]   He had a financial audio course of some kind
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.520]   that I listened to, and he talked about,
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.760]   anytime you have an increase in income,
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.560]   save half and spend half.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.160]   So if you get a 6% raise,
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.120]   increase your savings by 3% of your salary
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.960]   and spend the 3% of your salary.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.920]   That way you can build some of that emotional gratification
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.800]   of the higher income and also higher savings.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:02.240]   So in my mind, that's a really great idea.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.240]   And I'm not gonna actually criticize these steps
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.840]   at the moment very much.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:06.960]   I'm just gonna lay them out for you.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.880]   Step two is become an insider
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.640]   and know the rules of the financial game
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.520]   before you get in.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.600]   And this section is organized around nine different myths
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.400]   that he talks about.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.280]   Myth one, he says,
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.480]   the myth is that it's possible to beat the market.
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.640]   And 96% of actively managed mutual funds
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.440]   fail to beat the market over any sustained period of time.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.440]   And essentially, myth one is very clear
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.280]   that passive index investing with Vanguard is the solution.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.360]   It's very strong on that.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.640]   Myth two is that the myth is that
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.080]   fees aren't super important.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.640]   And he shows how fees, the amount of money,
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.640]   the fees that you pay on investment strategy
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.080]   are incredibly important.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.240]   And they are incredibly important.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.160]   He illustrates that over time,
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:54.240]   small fees become massive as far as their impact
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.840]   to your actual return.
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.880]   Myth three says that essentially,
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.840]   the returns that we list in the mutual fund literature
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.720]   is what you get.
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:09.120]   And basically, this is a debate over dollar-weighted returns
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.960]   versus time-weighted returns.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.120]   I'm going to go into detail on this one
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.440]   when I start the critique in a moment.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:19.040]   But essentially, the idea is there's two different ways
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.240]   of measuring the rate of return that you receive
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.840]   on an investment portfolio.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.120]   A time-weighted return doesn't track a specific dollar
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.040]   that is in the portfolio.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.200]   It doesn't track your specific results as an investor.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.320]   It just simply removes the dollar-weighting of returns
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.080]   and says, "On January 1, the portfolio from January 1
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.640]   to December 31 performed according to such."
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.720]   Dollar-weighted returns, on the other hand,
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.440]   are basically tracking individual dollars
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.920]   through the portfolio instead of focusing on the time.
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.440]   And I'm going to go into that debate in detail
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.440]   because I think it's one of the big flaws of this book.
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:59.760]   Myth four is that I'm your broker and I'm here to help.
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.400]   And so essentially here, he's talking about
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.840]   the importance of a fiduciary standard for all advisors
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.440]   and for you to work with an advisor
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.680]   who's operating under a fiduciary standard.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.200]   This one also has a lot of flaws in it,
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.640]   which I'll point out in a moment.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.520]   Myth five is that your retirement is just a 401(k)
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.680]   and here he basically hammers all the problems
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.040]   with the 401(k) system with a major focus on expenses.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:25.680]   Myth six is that target date funds are perfect.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.280]   You just set them and forget them.
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.040]   This one's really unclear, in my opinion.
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:33.600]   But essentially, the myth is that people don't really
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.040]   understand the target date funds and also that the asset
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.240]   allocation that the target date funds are selecting
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.720]   is not necessarily right for you.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.080]   And I agree with both of those points.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.160]   People don't understand target date funds
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.120]   and there's no proof that that asset allocation is for you.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.920]   But it doesn't deserve inclusion here in the myth.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.600]   Myth seven is all about annuities.
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.040]   Essentially, the myth is that annuities are bad.
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.080]   And he says that not all annuities are bad,
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.600]   that there are some good ones.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:06.640]   Myth eight is you got to take huge risks to get big rewards.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.880]   And his point is that there are products,
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.040]   investment products, that give you great rewards
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.320]   without significant risks.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.440]   Specifically, he talks about buying structured notes,
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.120]   investing in market-linked CDs, and fixed indexed annuities.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.920]   And then myth nine, he talks about the lies
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.000]   we tell ourselves, which is basically
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.240]   that we have limiting beliefs about what's possible.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.480]   His next section is to make the game winnable.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.160]   This was my favorite section, actually,
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:36.880]   where he focuses heavily on calculating
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.680]   the actual price of your dreams.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.880]   And he illustrates that the numbers that you need
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.520]   are probably far less than you actually think.
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.560]   And I learned this was just doing financial planning,
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:53.040]   that a lot of times when people would talk about how much money
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.520]   they need and what they need to be financially independent,
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.960]   they're crazy high.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.280]   They don't need anywhere near as much money
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:03.280]   as they need to actually achieve their dreams.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.360]   And so they're either crazy high or crazy low,
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.800]   and a lot of error in between.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.040]   And I'm going to steal, actually,
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.200]   some of the concepts from this.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:15.760]   The biggest benefit that I see from this section
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.360]   that I'm going to steal going forward
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:21.840]   is he lays out five financial dreams for people to consider.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:25.360]   And he talks about different levels of financial success.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:31.920]   Because when talking about what is your dream,
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.600]   I want to have $10 million,
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.680]   well, what do you want the $10 million to do?
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.720]   And if you're starting with a net worth of negative $1 million
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.960]   or negative $200,000 or negative $20,000
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.760]   because you just got deeply in debt with student loans,
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.800]   then he talks about that.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:50.720]   And he says, you probably don't need that much,
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.680]   but let's break the goal down into lesser dreams.
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.960]   And so he lays out here five different stages
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.360]   on what you should pursue,
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.280]   which is financial security, financial vitality,
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.000]   financial independence, financial freedom,
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.200]   and then his final one, absolute financial freedom.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.040]   And I'm actually going to steal those five things,
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.640]   and I'll credit him whenever I can,
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.400]   but I'm hereby officially declaring
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.760]   I'm stealing his five steps.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.200]   But I'm going to add some other steps,
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.880]   which I'll go over in a moment
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.800]   when I get to specific ideas
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.080]   that I thought were really powerful.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.200]   Immediately following those five steps,
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.040]   he talks about ways to increase your speed
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.760]   with how quickly you can get those investment results
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.960]   or those financial results,
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.840]   which is to spend less, save more, earn more,
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.240]   cut fees and taxes, and get better returns.
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.240]   So I thought that was really, really, really neat.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.280]   The next section is all about
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.520]   making the most important investment decision of your life,
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.280]   which is your asset allocation.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.440]   And here he starts with focusing on
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:50.240]   how much of your money do you put into a security bucket
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:53.040]   instead of a risk or a growth bucket?
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.600]   And this is valuable and important.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.480]   It's also flawed
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.320]   because there's not enough framework around it
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.480]   to actually know, well, how would I decide?
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.800]   There's got to be some methodology for deciding,
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.640]   and that's not provided in the book.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.720]   Number five, create a lifetime income plan.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.640]   Here he goes through some different portfolios
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.960]   with a major focus on Ray Dalio,
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.160]   who is a hedge fund manager.
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.680]   His all seasons portfolio,
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.360]   which is a playoff of his all weather portfolio,
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.520]   which is the actual portfolio he manages,
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.880]   which we'll cover in detail,
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.400]   and also annuities.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.520]   Number six is to invest like the .001%,
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.080]   and here he goes through the interviews
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:32.560]   with those billionaires and hedge fund managers, et cetera,
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.400]   and investing titans.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.720]   And then seven is just do it, make it happen,
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.120]   and enjoy it and share it, which is about philanthropy.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.280]   So it's a really great book,
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.520]   and you can't fit everything into a book.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.160]   I get that.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:48.160]   But I'm going to use this to show and teach you
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.720]   about some of the major flaws that there are
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:54.240]   and some of the major lessons in the financial business.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.080]   And I'm going to start with things
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.840]   this book does really, really well.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.920]   And he does so much well in this book.
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.600]   First, he lays out very well the problems
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.160]   that are facing aspiring retirees.
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.640]   If you work with a financial planner,
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.400]   if your financial planner hasn't been talking
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.760]   about this with you, you need to bring this up with them.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:20.240]   But there are some serious challenges.
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.400]   Facing the retirement market, lifespans are increasing.
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:28.160]   Page 31 of the book, there's a 50% chance
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.640]   that among married couples, at least one spouse
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.640]   will live to the age of 92,
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:37.040]   and a 25% chance that one will live to 97.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.720]   So basically, one out of four,
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:44.320]   one out of four couples interpreting those statistics,
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.760]   once they reach a certain age,
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.000]   it should be what that statistic is based upon.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.080]   Once you reach about age 60 or 65,
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.400]   one out of four of couples,
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.320]   there's going to be a spouse that lives to the age of 97.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:59.680]   That's phenomenal when you look at
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.480]   how do I plan for a long-term retirement.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.600]   Simply put, there's a quote from John Chauvin,
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.560]   who is a Stanford University professor of economics, says,
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.600]   quote, "It is not realistic to finance a 30-year retirement
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.120]   with 30 years of work.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.440]   You can't expect to put 10% of your income aside
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.680]   and then finance a retirement that's just as long."
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.320]   And so this is a major deal.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.960]   He talks about the increasing volatility of markets,
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.640]   which lead to increasing fear,
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.760]   which lead, in my words,
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.720]   to increasing bad behavior investment.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.160]   Talks about decreasing government welfare benefits.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.400]   If you go back and you look in 1950,
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.080]   coming from page 34,
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.880]   in 1950, there were 16.5 workers
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.640]   paying into the social security system
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.640]   to support one person getting benefits.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.760]   Now it's 2.9 workers per recipient.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.240]   That's a tremendous change.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.480]   And also he talks about the fact that the wealthier you are,
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.080]   the less likely you are to retire.
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.240]   Here, he actually cited an interesting study.
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.040]   Well, he didn't cite it.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.400]   One of my complaints is that
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.240]   there's no bibliography in the book.
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.360]   In the section that would be a bibliography,
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.800]   he refers you to the website
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.320]   and there's no bibliography on the website,
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.440]   at least not that I can find.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.600]   And I did several types of searches
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.960]   to try to make sure that I found it.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.440]   So that's one of my complaints.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.960]   I had to find these things by hand.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.640]   But he references in the book,
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.600]   he says, quote from page 34,
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.360]   "Studies show that the more money you earn,
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.520]   the more likely you are to keep working.
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.520]   It used to be the goal was to get rich
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.360]   and retire by the age of 40.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.320]   Now the goal is to get rich and work until you're 90.
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.240]   Nearly half of all individuals
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:36.000]   who earn $750,000 per year or more
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.520]   say they will never retire,
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.400]   or if they do,
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.360]   the earliest they would consider it is age 70.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.400]   How about the Rolling Stones and Mick Jagger at age 71,
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.760]   still rocking the world?
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.960]   Or think of business moguls like Steve Wynn at 72,
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.240]   Warren Buffett at 84,
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.760]   Rupert Murdoch at 83,
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.600]   and Sumner Redstone at 91."
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:57.200]   So I went and found that study.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.880]   And what it actually comes from
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.840]   is a study by the Spectrum Group.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:02.640]   And it's entitled
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.200]   "The Financial Attitude of Wealthy Investors
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.960]   Based on Income Spectrum."
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.640]   Now I couldn't find the actual source,
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.600]   the actual study.
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.400]   They wanted, looked like about 3,500 bucks for it.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.880]   So I found a couple of articles that talked about it.
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.040]   And essentially it is that statistic
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.160]   that is simply saying
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.800]   that the richer people are much less likely,
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.320]   or excuse me, the higher income earners,
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.720]   not necessarily synonymous with richer people,
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:28.080]   are much less likely to want to retire early.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.760]   And there may be various reasons for that.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.000]   It may be that they enjoy what they do more.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.240]   It may be that they can't support the lifestyle
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.440]   and they haven't saved enough money
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:38.320]   to support a $600,000 a year lifestyle.
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.440]   There may be many reasons.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.840]   But that's been something that I've suspected,
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.760]   but I've never found any numerical evidence for that.
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.240]   And so I was thrilled to find that.
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.760]   He does a really great job in the book
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.840]   of talking about the importance of starting early.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.040]   And he begins the book with this.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:53.840]   It's on page 50.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.360]   He talks about tap the power,
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.760]   make the most important financial decision of your life,
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.680]   which is to start and to start early.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:03.680]   And he talks a lot about the benefit of compound interest.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.040]   And it's so, so key.
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:10.240]   He uses the example of two brothers,
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.200]   William and James, in his story,
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.720]   that William opens a retirement account at the age of 20
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.240]   and invests $4,000 for the next 20 years,
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.920]   from the age of 20 to 40.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.640]   And at 40, he quits funding the money,
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.680]   putting any more money in it,
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.240]   but leaves it alone and it grows at 10% per year.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:32.320]   His brother starts at 40 and puts in $4,000 a year
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.280]   with the same return and keeps going until he's 65.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.840]   But the difference is, in the end,
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.080]   the brother who started earlier,
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.560]   even though he'd only invested a total of $80,000,
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.200]   had two and a half million bucks.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.880]   But on the flip side, the brother who started later,
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:52.400]   he had invested a total of $100,000
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.000]   and he had less than $400,000.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.240]   $2 million gap because of that point of starting early.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:02.400]   And to me, this is one of the most important lessons to start
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.520]   by teaching somebody is the power of compound interest.
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:06.240]   So valuable.
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.360]   He talks a little bit about the importance
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:12.080]   of avoiding bankruptcy and wipeout.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.960]   And he does this in the context of talking about athletes.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.320]   He goes through the lesson that essentially,
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:20.480]   you can't earn your way to financial freedom.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:24.400]   You have to actually save and then put a plan in place
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.720]   for avoiding problems.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:30.320]   He goes through Kurt Schilling, a baseball pitcher,
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:34.160]   earned more than $100 million and then went bankrupt.
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.840]   He's $50 million in debt.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.600]   Kim Basinger, an actress, she earned more than $10 million
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.000]   a pic per picture and she ended up bankrupt.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.960]   Marvin Gaye, Willie Nelson, MC Hammer, Meat Loaf,
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:49.520]   made loads of money and all of them were nearly bankrupt
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.360]   or bankrupt, actually bankrupt.
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:56.960]   And so amazing to me because those examples just blow my mind
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.400]   every time you think about them,
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.000]   about how much money you can earn
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.160]   and then you can simply outspend it if you're not careful.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:11.840]   So very, very valuable, very, very valuable illustration.
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.920]   He talks really well about the value of why you invest
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.480]   and then essentially a mental framework
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:23.040]   that you're investing to build a money machine
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:23.920]   to fund your life.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.360]   One of my favorite quotes from the book comes from page 54.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.160]   Quote, "You're already a financial trader.
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:32.000]   You might not think of it in just this way,
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.680]   but if you work for a living,
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.480]   you're trading your time for money.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.520]   Frankly, it's just about the worst trade you can make.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:40.020]   Why?
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.400]   Well, you can always get more money,
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.560]   but you can't get more time."
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:49.680]   In my mind, this is one of the key things
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.600]   that differentiates different people
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.160]   and their success with becoming investors.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:58.160]   Those who become investors become investors
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:01.520]   because they see the value of becoming wealthy
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.200]   and living off of their portfolios,
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.800]   living off of their investments.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.320]   That's a major factor.
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.880]   If investing is viewed as deprivation,
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.320]   the idea is, "Well, I can't go out
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.080]   and buy this shiny new thing,
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.080]   that shiny new object syndrome,
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.800]   this shiny new thing that I need," whatever it is,
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.800]   whether it's at a new iPhone
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.160]   or right when it comes out at full retail price
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:25.520]   or whether it's a brand new mega yacht
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.520]   that just happens to be the latest, coolest thing
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.080]   because it has two helipads on the top instead of one,
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:35.760]   whatever that shiny new object is at your level
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:36.880]   at which you play the game,
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:40.960]   if you don't see investing as being superior,
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.920]   essentially investing is superior
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:46.960]   because it allows you to go on
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:50.240]   and have more in the future,
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.760]   you never invest successfully.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.360]   You just always view it as deprivation.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.840]   I think that's why people have trouble saving money.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.680]   If you have a reason to save money,
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.200]   a powerful, compelling reason to save money,
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.600]   a clear vision of what it's going to do for you
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.640]   and a belief that it's attainable,
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:10.880]   then I think it's fairly simple
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.520]   to save money at that point in time
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:14.800]   because it's compelling to you.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:18.560]   Near the end of the book, Robbins talks about timing,
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.200]   essentially that those who are skilled with investors,
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.760]   they're able to trade a little bit
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:26.320]   of current gratification and pleasure
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.120]   for that compelling vision
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.200]   of being able to have more in the future
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.600]   and to me, that is key.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.080]   He gives some amazing stories in this section
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.360]   which is just awesome.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.400]   I love these stories.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.560]   I've collected them just partly for myself
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.960]   but he talks about how if you start early enough
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.920]   and essentially these are the power of compound interest,
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.440]   if you start early enough
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.040]   and you set aside consistently
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.680]   and if you get decent returns on your money,
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:55.680]   you can build up an incredible asset base
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:59.680]   with a little bit of focus.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.520]   My favorite story because it's the most extreme
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.520]   was a man named Theodore Johnson
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:08.240]   who started with UPS in 1924.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:10.880]   Evidently, he worked hard,
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.000]   moved his way up in the company
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.960]   but he never made more than $14,000 a year
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:19.920]   but he set aside 20% of every paycheck he received
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:22.400]   and he saved every Christmas bonus
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.840]   and he put it into UPS stock,
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.520]   UPS for United Parcel Service.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.480]   The delivery company
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:29.280]   and he just always did it
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:32.720]   and over time with the growth of UPS stock,
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:37.200]   evidently his stock account had grown in value
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:42.720]   to over $70 million by the time he was 90 years old.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.400]   Now, at that point in time,
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.360]   it's a little late to enjoy it.
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.200]   I hope he enjoyed it
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.120]   but maybe for him,
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.680]   leaving $70 million behind to a worthy cause
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:57.040]   was his definition of enjoyment.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:01.360]   That wouldn't necessarily be my definition of enjoyment
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.840]   but I hope it worked for him and I hope so.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.760]   But what an amazing story
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.720]   and evidently it does say that at the end of his life,
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.640]   he donated over $36 million
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.320]   to different educational causes.
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:16.480]   He made $3.6 million in grants to two schools for the deaf
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.720]   because he'd been hard of hearing for many years.
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.040]   He set up a college scholarship fund for UPS
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.400]   for the children of employees.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:23.680]   How awesome.
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:26.640]   And maybe I'm sure he got far more enjoyment from that
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:27.840]   than from spending it.
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:31.360]   But you see in that story,
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.760]   the themes that are important in financial planning.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.320]   Am I saving some percentage of my income?
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:39.040]   He set aside 20% and every Christmas bonus.
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:41.040]   Am I investing it wisely?
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:44.880]   And then am I giving it enough time for it to compound over time?
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.320]   He gave a story of a lady named Osceola McCarty
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.240]   who washed and ironed clothes
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.680]   and never made much money at all.
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:57.360]   She washed and ironed clothes but she always saved.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:00.320]   And she donated at 87 years old,
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:05.200]   she donated $150,000 to the University of Southern Mississippi.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:09.440]   Now what's heartbreaking for a financial advisor
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:12.160]   is she donated $150,000
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:15.840]   because it seems that from the story that she never invested it.
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.400]   And you think, man, how much more if she had invested it?
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.480]   But how incredible for that lady
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.360]   who from Mississippi washing and ironing clothes
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.200]   to accumulate $150,000.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.400]   Amazing.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.800]   Talks about John Templeton
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:32.080]   who is one of my favorite investment managers.
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.440]   Just seems like an amazing guy.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:36.240]   And starting with nothing,
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:39.360]   he committed and saved 50% of his income from the beginning
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:42.640]   when he was a brand new stockbroker in New York City
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.360]   around the time of World War II.
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:45.920]   Amazing.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.680]   Interesting tidbit.
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.760]   A couple of interesting tidbits for you on John Templeton.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.520]   I'm fascinated by Templeton.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:55.200]   He did a couple of things.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:58.800]   First, he saw the opportunity and he saved 50% of what he earned.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.120]   So he had set aside a lot of money.
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.680]   And then in World War II,
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:06.240]   when he looks around and says,
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.480]   "Man, everything is going crazy,"
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.000]   he pulled together $10,000.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.280]   And some of it he borrowed, some of it he had.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.960]   But he pulled together $10,000
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.680]   and he bought 100 shares of every company
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:19.520]   that was trading under a dollar a share.
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.960]   Including those that were considered nearly bankrupt.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.920]   So all he did was just simply set this arbitrary price limit
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:30.560]   of this very low valuation and invested into it.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:33.360]   And then after the war, when the economy grew,
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:37.840]   it grew quickly to be a much larger portfolio.
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.880]   If memory is correct,
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:42.400]   I think only three of his stocks wound up going bankrupt.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.400]   All the rest of them made money and came back.
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:48.960]   I wish I had had, I think, back to 2008
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:51.040]   and unfortunately I was a dumb-dumb
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:53.280]   and I didn't have enough money pulled together.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.360]   And also I was in the process of starting a business.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.400]   Maybe I wasn't a dumb-dumb,
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:00.080]   but I wish I had been more diligent when I was younger
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:02.480]   to save more money, save more capital
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.960]   to put in at that point in time.
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:07.760]   And I hope that, you know, for you older people
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:08.880]   are not going to like this,
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.320]   but for me as a young guy,
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:14.880]   I hope desperately that we wind up in another situation like 2008.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.160]   I missed it.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.320]   And just because I didn't have the capital set aside,
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.280]   I was ready to invest.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.920]   And I was, I missed it.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.040]   But next time I'll be ready.
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:23.840]   Next time, next time.
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.280]   But the cool thing about Templeton,
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.200]   another interesting tidbit that I noticed in the book
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.040]   that you might be interested in also
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:31.120]   is that Templeton was originally American.
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.040]   But in the book it says he was a British citizen.
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:36.560]   You often hear him referred to as Sir John Templeton.
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.640]   And I wondered why he was a British citizen
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:41.440]   because it was clear he was from the United States of America.
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.960]   He was originally American.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.160]   Well, I went and researched it.
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.280]   And according to Wikipedia,
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:48.640]   he actually renounced his citizenship in 1964
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:52.400]   and became a naturalized British citizen living in the Bahamas.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.400]   And according to the Wikipedia entry,
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:57.120]   he saved about a hundred million bucks in taxes by doing that,
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.360]   which he was then able to move that money
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.880]   and devote it towards philanthropy.
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:04.400]   According to some articles that I read,
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:09.200]   this happened because there was a 1962 change in the tax code
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.760]   which regulated the tax deferral of income
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.840]   in a controlled foreign corporation.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:19.120]   It seems like he had originally set up his funds in Canada
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.240]   and he was a US citizen.
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.400]   But when they changed that tax code,
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.720]   then that really affected him.
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.280]   That law and the tax code, that really affected him.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.840]   So he renounced the city of citizenship.
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.440]   So I say good for him.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.160]   That's awesome.
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.400]   It's a subject I'm interested in,
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.040]   in this need to find people who have done it effectively
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:40.000]   and successfully over the years and saved a lot of money.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.560]   And when I look forward at some of the tax uncertainty
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:48.480]   and some of the capital controls that you sometimes wonder
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:52.960]   if the stage is being paved for them with changes,
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.280]   I'm not sold yet, but I look at it suspiciously.
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:00.400]   Researching expatriation and renunciation of citizenship
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.000]   is a part-time hobby of mine.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.160]   So neat little story on Templeton.
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:07.200]   But the point is Templeton saved 50% of his income
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:11.920]   and he turned it into a multi-billion dollar portfolio.
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:15.280]   A really amazing achievement.
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:19.360]   Robbins does a really amazing job of talking about
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.720]   some cool behavior tricks.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:25.520]   And I learned something new called the Save More Tomorrow idea.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:28.880]   And let me read you one paragraph here from page 67.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:35.120]   And paragraph says, "Bernard C. and Thaler first tested
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:38.160]   the Save More Tomorrow plan almost 20 years ago
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.760]   at a company in the Midwest,
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:42.080]   where the blue-collar workers said they couldn't afford
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:44.880]   to squeeze another dime out of their paychecks.
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.520]   But the researchers persuaded them to let their employer
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:50.240]   automatically divert 3% of their salaries
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.760]   into a retirement account,
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:55.920]   and then add 3% more every time they got a pay raise.
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.080]   The results were amazing.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.800]   After just five years and three pay raises,
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:04.000]   those employees who thought they couldn't afford to save
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.680]   were setting aside just under a whopping 14% of their paychecks.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.960]   And 65% of them were actually saving an average
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:15.440]   of 19% of their salaries."
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:18.320]   So the Save More Tomorrow idea was that,
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:19.680]   I didn't know it had been tested.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.120]   I had read some of the literature saying,
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:22.320]   "Hey, this is effective."
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.880]   But I didn't know it had been tested with results like that.
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:27.440]   But how neat that just basically the idea is,
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.800]   commit to saving more in the future.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.080]   Don't do anything today,
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.240]   but commit to saving more in the future.
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:35.040]   So as your income goes up, or even if it doesn't,
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.480]   you just say, "Well, I'm going to save a little bit,
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:38.080]   little by little by little."
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:39.520]   I've used this with clients.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.600]   And I would encourage you to consider it in your life.
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.840]   If you're not saving any money, say,
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:47.120]   "I'm going to save 1% and then increase it by 1% every month."
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:50.480]   Or start with something laughably low,
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.960]   maybe half a percent, go to half a percent every month.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.600]   What that'll happen is you can find those little tweaks
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:56.640]   and those little tricks.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.560]   And if you commit to yourself
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:01.040]   that I'm always going to save this amount of money,
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.040]   and then you do it, and then you work to figure it out,
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:07.120]   that slow, easy easing in can really lead
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:09.520]   to much stronger long-term results
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:13.280]   than many times saying, "I'm going to go from nothing to 30%."
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:15.520]   Now, I think both are doable.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.400]   Some people respond well to the go from nothing to 30%.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.680]   That's kind of my personality.
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.760]   I get a little frustrated if things are slow.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:26.480]   But many people have noticed it's effective if you do that.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.480]   Now, the trick is you've got to set up some kind of system
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.600]   for actually doing that.
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:33.280]   And I guess these systems are actually being tested
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.040]   with some of the 401(k) companies,
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.880]   which Robbins talks about later in the book,
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.400]   which I think is really neat.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:41.200]   I would love to have an option like that myself
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:42.800]   because you can just sign it up and do it.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:46.000]   And I think that should be really rolled out more and more.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.040]   Should be optional, but it should be rolled out more and more.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:53.520]   Robbins does a great job of also talking about the emotional needs
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:57.040]   and the connection with emotional needs versus financial issues.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:01.280]   Some people try to meet their emotional needs with money.
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.600]   And this is classic Tony Robbins.
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:06.720]   He talks about the first need that we have is a need for certainty.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.000]   A sense of certainty and for comfort.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.600]   But the second most important need we have
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.160]   is a need for uncertainty and variety.
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:20.640]   So, both of these things are necessary.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.080]   Too much certainty, you get bored.
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:25.280]   Too much uncertainty, you get stressed and you can't handle it.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:27.280]   Talks about the need for significance,
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:28.960]   the need for love and connection,
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:32.960]   the need for growth and the need for contribution.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:37.520]   And money is often tried to be applied to those certain emotional needs.
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:40.480]   The need for significance is probably the easiest one
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:44.880]   where people try to measure their significance by displaying their wealth.
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.640]   I've got the fanciest car.
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:47.680]   I've got the biggest house.
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:50.160]   I've got the nicest diamond ring.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:55.280]   Or on the flip side, you see people just try to display their significance
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:56.880]   by not displaying their wealth.
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:01.760]   I'm worth $10 million, but I drive a $2,000 car.
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.640]   And the key that I drew from this section was,
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.880]   if you can fix emotional problems,
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.600]   then a lot of times the financial problems are relatively simple.
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:11.520]   But if you can't fix the emotional problems,
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:15.040]   no matter how fancy your financial problem,
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:18.560]   excuse me, no matter how fancy your financial solution,
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:21.040]   it's not going to work.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.120]   And I've seen this happen with some of the financial plans
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:25.360]   that I've designed have fallen apart for clients.
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:28.480]   And it wasn't due to a mistake that I made in a technical sense.
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:31.520]   It was due to a mistake I made in not perceiving the emotional needs.
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:33.920]   So I'm glad he brought that in.
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:37.360]   Robbins does a great job of talking about topics comprehensively
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:41.920]   and then giving some practical advice and some useful tricks.
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:43.760]   I really appreciate it.
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:47.200]   In his section on how to speed up your financial results,
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.200]   he talks about some different strategies.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:51.040]   And I'm going to spend a little time here
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:53.040]   because this is really practical
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:56.720]   as far as things that you can do to speed up your strategies.
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:59.760]   Now, remember, put this in the context of the framework that I use
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.280]   and that I talk about constantly.
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:02.960]   I can focus on income.
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:06.080]   I can focus on expenses and the difference between those.
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:09.920]   And I can focus on investing the difference intelligently
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:13.360]   and getting higher rates of return on the difference.
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:16.800]   And again, I may have, I think I made that up in my mind,
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.240]   but I may have stolen it from somewhere.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:21.200]   But you see that same theme in his different strategies.
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:23.760]   Here he lists three strategies.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:26.560]   Strategy one is to save more and invest the difference.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:30.240]   And some practical things, he goes through a little idea
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.880]   on saving money on mortgage payments.
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.960]   The idea that do on your mortgage,
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:37.440]   if you're interested in paying off your mortgage more quickly,
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:39.680]   make pocket change pre-payments.
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.480]   The idea is instead of making big payments,
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:43.920]   just make little payments.
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:47.840]   And the key one is to pay your next month's principal payment.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:49.040]   And I love this idea.
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:51.440]   I actually did this idea on my mortgage.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:54.560]   I did this myself on my mortgage for the first,
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:58.880]   for the first, let's see, was it a year of living in this house.
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:02.080]   And every month I would run down the amortization schedule
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:05.760]   and I would try to pay my normal monthly payment
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:09.520]   and then at least the next month's principal payment.
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.600]   And then some months I would do several months.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.480]   But instead of sending $1,000, I would calculate,
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:18.560]   well, one month is $232, the next month is $247,
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.560]   and the next month is $280.
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:22.160]   And I would add those three things together
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:25.440]   and I would send a check for whatever that number was, $867,
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:28.240]   so that I could keep my amortization schedule
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.680]   nice and cute and clean.
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:32.240]   And I just thought it was a fun idea and I liked it.
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:36.400]   And I was trying to balance this idea of invest
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:39.040]   versus pay off the mortgage and the emotional need,
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:40.080]   especially for my family,
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.160]   of having the mortgage paid off and investing.
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:43.680]   So I was just saying, well, this is,
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.280]   I'm making progress in the right direction
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.720]   without committing to say,
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.240]   I'm gonna get this mortgage paid off
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.680]   and primarily doing investing.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.520]   When I decided to start the show, I stopped doing that.
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:53.600]   But I love that idea and I commend it to you.
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:55.440]   Run your amortization schedule,
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:56.320]   figure out where you are,
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:58.320]   and then just make a little extra payment.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:00.720]   And then try to make that also, is my idea,
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:03.440]   try to make it out of money that you would
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:06.960]   otherwise be spending on consumption.
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:09.200]   And maybe that'll give you a little psychological trick
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.320]   that'll help yourself.
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:13.280]   It goes to the practicality of getting rid of the BMW
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:14.960]   and getting a better car,
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.720]   going through all your expenses,
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:18.320]   looking at the latte factor,
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:20.720]   David Bach's idea from "The Automatic Millionaire."
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:26.320]   Look for that daily consumption
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.840]   that you're doing on an ongoing basis
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:30.720]   and figure out how to adjust that.
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:32.640]   One of the best solutions that I found
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.680]   that I also commend to you
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:38.880]   is a way of essentially applying the idea
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:41.760]   of the latte factor to higher consumption clients.
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.760]   And this is something I've really struggled with
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:45.120]   in my financial planning practice
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:47.040]   of how do I connect with my clients
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.840]   who are more lifestyle oriented
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:52.320]   and not so worried about saving little things.
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:53.760]   They like living a nice lifestyle.
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:54.880]   They like their fancy house.
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:56.080]   They like their fancy cars.
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.680]   They like their fancy clothes.
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:00.080]   They like eating out constantly.
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:03.440]   And so the ultra thrifty, ultra frugal people will say,
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:04.320]   "Well, I gotta get rid of that."
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.480]   How do I help them to still save money?
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:07.600]   So I love this trick.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.760]   Quote from page 255, one paragraph here.
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:12.640]   He says, "I'm not saying you have to give up bottled water
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:13.600]   or stop getting coffee,
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:15.520]   but the savings are there somewhere.
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:16.800]   Isn't it time to find them?
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:19.840]   Don't forget about our impulse purchases,
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:22.320]   you know, the ones that feel great in the moment,
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:25.760]   like the pricey work bag or the beautiful Hermes tie.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.560]   Lisa, a young mom from Nashville,
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.960]   has a taste for the finer things in life.
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:34.160]   She drives her husband batty with her impulse purchases.
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:35.920]   She'll come home with a great new dress
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:37.680]   or an amazing pair of boots
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:40.080]   and her husband will invariably ask,
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:41.280]   "Were they on sale?"
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.040]   Or, "Did you check online to see
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:44.640]   if you could get them cheaper?"
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:45.920]   After several spats,
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.560]   Lisa and her husband agreed on a new plan.
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:50.560]   When Lisa found herself unexpectedly
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:52.720]   at Saks Fifth Avenue or Jimmy Choo,
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:55.040]   she'd take a photo of her next must-have
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:56.640]   and send it to her husband.
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:59.600]   He had two weeks to find her a better price online.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.280]   Otherwise, she'd order her purchase
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:03.280]   over the phone at full retail.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:06.400]   But, as Lisa sheepishly admitted to me,
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:07.680]   over 80% of the time,
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:09.600]   he did find whatever she was looking for
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:13.520]   and often at 20 or 30% cheaper.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:16.560]   So I thought that was a really neat idea.
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:18.160]   And I'm gonna use that idea.
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:19.040]   I commend it to you.
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:21.360]   If you are in a marriage relationship
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:22.480]   where you struggle with,
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:25.040]   you know, "I have a spouse who's a compulsive spender.
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:26.160]   What do I do?"
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:28.800]   And you can combine it with this idea.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.840]   You can combine both finding better deals online,
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:32.560]   things like that,
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:34.800]   or you can also combine this
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:38.240]   with essentially putting a time limit on your desire
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.720]   to lower some of those impulse purchases.
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:42.960]   So that's an idea that I'm gonna share with clients
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:44.560]   in the future for those clients that,
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:46.160]   you know, stop drinking at Starbucks.
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:47.200]   This simply doesn't work for 'em
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.560]   'cause that can really matter.
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:52.320]   And again, the key about this,
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:53.600]   which I mentioned a few minutes ago,
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:54.560]   it's not about lifestyle.
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:55.280]   It's about timing.
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:57.040]   Quote from page 256,
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:58.720]   "Why not make simple changes today
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:01.200]   to ensure that you have more than enough down the road
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:04.640]   to continue to fund your lifestyle and your dreams?
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:06.720]   You can still enjoy life's finer pleasures,
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:08.480]   but you're in control now.
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:10.560]   You get to choose how to allocate your funds
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:12.720]   and where to put the biggest bang for your buck.
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:13.360]   That's the key."
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:16.800]   He does a great job continuing on this theme of strategies
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.680]   in earn more and invest the difference.
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:22.800]   So the first strategy to speed things up was save more
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:24.720]   and invest the difference by lowering expenses.
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:27.280]   Now you flip it over to the earn more
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:28.800]   and invest the difference.
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:33.040]   And I'm gonna read you a page and a half
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:37.200]   from page 260 where he talks about his story
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.240]   when he was a young man
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:41.520]   and he talks about going to a Jim Rohn seminar.
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.920]   And I'm gonna do this in my Jim Rohn voice
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:50.000]   because Jim Rohn was a master at conveying simple concepts.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.920]   But this page and a half excerpt here
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:57.200]   from page 260 is incredibly, incredibly valuable.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.040]   And for those of you who are Jim Rohn fans,
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:00.960]   I'm gonna try to do my Jim Rohn voice here.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.440]   Quote, "I became obsessed."
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:06.880]   This is Robin speaking about how when he looked around
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.080]   and saw some people struggling,
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:09.760]   "Why is my family struggling to stay ahead
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:10.880]   of the bill collector
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.640]   when other people are making loads of money?
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:13.680]   Other people are doing well.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.520]   What's going on?"
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:16.960]   "I became obsessed.
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.960]   How was it possible that someone could earn
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:21.280]   twice as much money in the same amount of time?
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:23.680]   Three times as much, 10 times as much.
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:25.040]   It seemed crazy.
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:27.360]   From my perspective, it was an unsolvable riddle.
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:30.880]   I was working as a janitor and I needed extra money.
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:35.200]   A man my parents knew and whom my father had called a loser
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:37.920]   had become quite successful in a short period of time,
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:39.920]   well, at least in financial terms.
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:42.880]   He was buying, fixing, and flipping real estate
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:44.240]   in Southern California,
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:45.680]   and he needed a kid on the weekend
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:46.880]   to help him move furniture.
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:49.360]   That chance encounter,
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:52.160]   that fateful weekend of working my tail off,
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:55.200]   led to an opening that would change my life forever.
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:57.600]   His name was Jim Hanna.
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:00.640]   He took notice of my hustle and drive.
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:03.040]   When I had a moment, I asked him,
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:04.880]   "How did you turn your life around?
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:07.440]   How did you become so successful?"
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.960]   Interrupt the story here.
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:09.600]   Pay attention.
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:11.840]   He took notice of my hustle and drive.
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:15.520]   I've gotten, I think, two jobs off of just simply my hustle and drive.
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:18.560]   I was with some friends at an event recently,
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:22.000]   and we were noticing just some people that were moving some things.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.320]   I was thinking, "I would never in my life"—
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:24.960]   I knew the person—
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:27.120]   "I would never in my life offer this person work
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:33.520]   because I cannot stand how they are approaching this moving opportunity."
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:36.560]   Teach your kids to move quickly and to hustle,
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:37.920]   and opportunities come.
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:40.320]   So, Robbins is asking this man named Jim,
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:41.680]   "How did you become so successful?"
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:45.920]   "I did it," Jim said, "by going to a seminar by a man named Jim Rohn."
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:48.480]   "What's a seminar?" I asked.
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:53.280]   "It's a place where a man takes 10 or 20 years of his life and all he's learned,
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:59.920]   and he condenses it into a few hours so that you can compress years of learning into days,"
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:00.560]   he answered.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:03.440]   "Wow, that sounded pretty awesome.
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:04.480]   How much does it cost?"
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:06.880]   "$35," he told me.
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:07.600]   "What?
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:11.600]   I was making $40 a week as a part-time janitor while going to high school."
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:13.600]   "Can you get me in?" I asked.
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:19.520]   "Sure," he said, "but I won't, because you wouldn't value it if you didn't pay for it."
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:22.160]   I stood there disheartened.
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:26.160]   "How could I ever afford $35 for three hours with this expert?"
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:32.400]   "Well, if you don't think you're worth the investment, don't make it," he finally shrugged.
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:36.560]   I struggled and struggled with that one, but ultimately decided to go for it.
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:40.320]   It turned out to be one of the most important investments of my life.
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:44.880]   I took a week's pay and went to a seminar where I met Jim Rohn,
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:47.600]   the man who became my life's first mentor.
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:52.720]   I sat in an Irvine, California hotel ballroom listening to Jim, riveted.
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:57.600]   This silver-haired man literally echoed the questions that had been burning in my mind.
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:02.640]   He, too, had grown up poor, wondering, even though his father was a good man,
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:07.920]   why his father struggled so hard only to suffer while others around him prospered.
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:12.800]   And then suddenly he answered the question I had been asking myself literally for years.
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:16.080]   "What's the secret to economic success?"
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:22.400]   "The key," he said, "is to understand how to become more valuable in the marketplace.
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:26.400]   To have more, you simply have to become more.
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:31.280]   Don't wish it were easier. Wish you were better.
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:34.960]   For things to change, you have to change.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.640]   For things to get better, you have to get better.
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:43.200]   We get paid for bringing value to the marketplace.
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:47.840]   It takes time, but we don't get paid for time. We get paid for value.
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:51.440]   America is unique. It's a ladder to climb.
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:54.560]   It starts down here at, what, about $2.30 an hour?
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:57.040]   This was many years before current minimum wage days.
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:00.000]   What was the top income last year?
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.560]   The guy who runs Disney, $52 million.
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:06.720]   Would a company pay somebody $52 million a year?
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:10.240]   The answer is, of course.
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:15.840]   If you help a company make a billion dollars, would they pay you $52 million?
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:21.360]   Of course. It's chicken feed. It's not that much money.
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:25.120]   Is it really possible to become that valuable?
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:28.480]   The answer is, of course.
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:31.920]   And then he let me in on the ultimate secret.
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:34.800]   How do you truly become more valuable?
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:40.320]   Learn to work harder on yourself than you do on your job.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:46.240]   So, can you personally become twice as valuable and make twice as much money in the same time?
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:52.400]   Is it possible to become 10 times as valuable and make 10 times as much money in the same time?
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:53.360]   Is that possible?
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:54.720]   Of course.
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:58.880]   And then he paused and looked directly in my eyes and said,
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:06.800]   "All you have to do to earn more money in the same amount of time is simply become more valuable."
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:08.560]   And there it was.
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:10.720]   There was my answer.
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:12.640]   Once I got that, it turned my life around.
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:19.440]   That clarity, that simplicity, the wisdom of those words, they hit me like a 100-pound brick.
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:24.960]   Those are the exact words I've heard Jim Rohn speak probably a hundred times.
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:27.360]   I've carried them in my heart every day since,
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.360]   including the day that I spoke at his funeral in 2009.
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:39.680]   That man, that seminar, that day, what Jim Rohn did was put me back in control of my own future.
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:47.280]   He made me stop focusing on what was outside of my control, my past, the poverty, other people's
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:53.120]   expectations, the state of the economy, and taught me to focus instead on what I could control.
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:56.160]   I could improve myself.
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:04.800]   I could find a way to serve, a way to do more, a way to become better, a way to add value to
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:10.320]   the marketplace. I became obsessed with finding ways to do more for others than anyone else was
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:16.800]   doing in less time. That began a never-ending process that continues to this day. At its most
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:22.080]   basic level, it provided a pathway to progress that continues to drive and lead every single
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:28.240]   decision I make and action I take. In the Bible, there is a simple tenet that says there's nothing
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:35.280]   wrong with wanting to be great. If you wish to become great, learn to become the servant of many.
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:40.960]   If you can find a way to serve many people, you can earn more. Find a way to serve millions of
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:47.360]   people, you can earn millions. It's the law of added value. And if the gospel of Warren Buffett
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:51.920]   is more your thing than biblical verse, the oracle of Omaha is famous for saying that the most
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:57.360]   powerful investment he ever made in his life and that anyone can make is an investment in himself.
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:01.760]   He talks about investing in personal development books, in educating himself,
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:07.040]   and how a Dale Carnegie course completely changed his life. Buffett once told me this story himself
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:11.760]   when we were on the Today Show together. I laughed and asked him to keep telling that story. "It's
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:18.480]   good for business," I said, grinning. I took Jim Rohn's message to heart and became obsessed.
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:23.840]   I would never stop growing, never stop giving, never stop trying to expand my influence or my
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:29.280]   capacity to give and do good. And as a result, over the years, I've become more valuable in
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:34.800]   the marketplace to the point that I'm extremely fortunate enough today that finances are no longer
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:41.280]   an issue in my life. I'm not unique. Anyone can do the same. If you let go of your stories about
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:46.160]   the past and break through your stories about the present and its limits, problems are always
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:56.880]   available. But so is opportunity. To me, that was more than a page and a half. Those two and a half
[00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:02.640]   pages are worth the price of admission. Just those two pages, in my mind, lay out the formula that
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:08.880]   somebody needs to go on to become wealthy. I know for me, ever since I heard Jim Rohn say that,
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:13.040]   I think he was the first, I've thought a lot about that. How do I become more valuable? How do I
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:18.160]   become more valuable? How do I become more valuable? How do I become more valuable? And in my
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:22.800]   mind, at least in the system that I live in, in the United States of America, that's the key. If I
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:28.880]   can become more valuable, I can earn more. So instead of saying, "How can I?" The only way to
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:32.160]   answer the question, "How can I earn more? How can I get paid more? How can I have more?" is,
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:36.560]   "I need to become more valuable. I need to grow and expand and learn and develop."
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:40.160]   Interestingly, he puts in a little box here updating those numbers.
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:46.160]   This is also, I want to read this to you from page 263. "What does the American income ladder
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:53.040]   look like today? My bet is Jim Rohn couldn't have imagined that in 2013, the low end of the ladder
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:59.680]   would be $7.25 an hour, $15,080 annually, and that the high end earner of the year would be
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:07.360]   Appaloosa Management founder and hedge fund leader, David Tepper, who earned $3.5 billion,
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:15.440]   with a B, billion, in personal income. How could any human being make even $1 billion a year,
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:22.640]   much less $3.5 billion? Why such an incredibly low income for some people and such a high income
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:28.000]   opportunity for others? The answer is the marketplace puts very little value on being
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:34.880]   a cashier at McDonald's, $7.77 an hour, because it requires a skill that can be learned in a few
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:40.560]   hours by almost anyone. However, successfully expanding people's financial returns in a
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:46.800]   significant way is a much more rare and valued set of skills. When most Americans are getting
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:52.480]   less than 33 basis points, a third of 1%, annually, as a return on their money from the bank,
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:58.480]   David Tepper delivered a 42% return for his investors in the same time. How valuable were
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:04.480]   his contributions to their economic lives? If he got them a 1% return, he would have been
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:15.280]   300% more valuable. A 42% return means he added 12,627% more economic value to their lives.
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:22.880]   That's the formula, right? That's what's so frustrating to me, why I hammer so much on the
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:30.960]   school thing, is because if you're making $7.77 an hour at McDonald's today, you're going to be
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:35.760]   replaced in under five years with a touchscreen, and you're going to go from $7.77 to nothing.
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:40.240]   If you're taking orders and if you're flipping burgers in the back of McDonald's, you're going
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:47.360]   to be replaced in under five years by a robot. The person out front pushes the touchscreen and says,
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:58.000]   "I want a Big Mac," and the machine's going to make it, and it's going to be perfect every time.
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:06.560]   Now, that machine may cost $100,000, $200,000, it doesn't matter. Compare that to $15,080 per year,
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:12.080]   plus cost of employment taxes, plus cost of insurance, plus the hassle of dealing with
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:18.160]   management, managing employees. That's going to be the change. In a world where we're already
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:26.880]   accustomed to going in and simply interacting with machines, where sometimes many of us prefer
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:31.040]   not doing our own self-checkouts, we don't have to talk to anybody, we're becoming sensitized
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:36.080]   to interacting with machines over time. What does the minimum wage earner do? We've crippled
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:42.080]   many of the people at minimum wage. We've crippled them with schooling.
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:53.840]   Rant over. The point is that that is the key. Earn more in yourself. Amazing, amazing.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:59.360]   Another key stat that I learned from this section was on the next page, page 264,
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:06.400]   and about the importance of that skill set, and especially as it relates to things like
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:12.080]   unemployment. Think about what a big difference some of your friends, maybe some of you listening,
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:18.640]   who've been unemployed for a year, two years, three years, and 2008. What a massive setback
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:23.840]   that was to your financial plans, or is to your financial plans. I told the story on shows past
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:30.640]   about my client who had gotten laid off from a job and just took two years of unemployment,
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:37.280]   and then wound up not being able to find a job, and was stuck not being able to find a job,
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:45.280]   and wound up pulling tons of money out of their 401k. Now consider this paragraph from page 264.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:53.120]   During the Great Recession, 8.8 million jobs were lost. In 2008, 2.3 million jobs were lost in that
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:05:00.240]   year alone. Unemployment peaked at 10%, but remember that 10% unemployment rate is an average.
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:07.760]   Some portions of the population had unemployment levels over 25%, but for those making $100,000
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:16.160]   per year or more, what would you guess was their unemployment rate? The answer, close to 1%.
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:21.600]   The lesson, if you truly develop skills that are needed in the current marketplace,
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:26.880]   if you constantly improve and become more valuable, someone will employ you, or you'll
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:33.120]   employ yourself regardless of the economy. If you employ yourself, your raise becomes effective
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:41.120]   when you are. Isn't that stunning? 1% unemployment for those making a nexus of $100,000 a year,
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:46.640]   average of 10%, as much as 25% in some sectors. We're living in a time of this incredible
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:53.120]   reshuffling and transformation of our economy, and it's going to have massive impact.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:59.920]   Massive impact. Got to be aware of it. The key is self-development and getting the situation
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:05.120]   where we're earning in excess of $100,000 and learn the skills. Tells a story, Robbins does,
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:12.400]   that blew my mind about a Korean teacher who is earning $4 million a year as a teacher.
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:20.160]   It's a man named Kim Kihun, and he saw an opportunity doing online education.
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:28.240]   He was a teacher and he said, "I can do this better online." Today, it says on page 267,
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:32.880]   he works about 60 hours a week, but only three hours are for giving lectures. The other 57 hours
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:36.800]   are spent researching, innovating, developing curriculum, and responding to students. He
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:45.360]   charges his students based upon an hourly fee for their instruction. Based upon this hourly fee for
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:53.040]   their instruction, he wound up earning $4 million last year. Students log on for $4 an hour to
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:07:00.000]   watch his classes. Isn't that stunning? Here's a teacher, $4 an hour for each student, but he's so
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:07.440]   effective at teaching that he earned more than $4 million. Amazing. He tells a story on the next
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:12.000]   page, 268, about a lady named Daniela who was working in a marketing department doing art
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.480]   design. She's working in a company. She was doing other people's jobs. They were being lazy.
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:20.720]   Basically, she went to her CEO and said, "Listen, I'm doing the work of four people.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:26.160]   I know what I'm talking about. I've gone to courses. I've learned. I've taught myself about
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:30.240]   visual arts, marketing, and social media. I'm not going to throw any of the other employees under
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:35.040]   the bus, but I can save you 50% of your marketing costs right now and eliminate three people by
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:40.880]   taking on their jobs myself, and I'll do a better job. Don't trust me. Let me prove it. Let me do
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:46.240]   their jobs for the next six months, and I'll do my assignments and theirs, and you can have two
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:53.360]   different examples to pick from, and you decide what's best." She did it. She proved herself,
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:08:03.520]   and she made a lot more money over time. Isn't that cool? Isn't that a strategy that many of
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:07.200]   you could do if you're working in a company? Pick up the responsibility. I remember Brian
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:12.720]   Tracy always taught in his courses, he would always teach, "Ask for more responsibility.
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:17.280]   Ask for more responsibility. Do the responsibility well. Discharge it and ask for more responsibility.
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:22.080]   Ask for more responsibility." It's a useful thing that can be applied if you're trying to figure
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:27.520]   out, "How do I earn more?" Look at it from that perspective. Tell us a story about GoPro. I didn't
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:32.320]   know the story of GoPro. It's fascinating to me. Evidently, it was started by a man named Nick
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:37.520]   Woodman, who was a surfer, and he just started toying around with making waterproof cameras.
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:43.600]   Today, GoPro, I mean, the guy's worth over a billion bucks because he found this niche in
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:49.920]   digital cameras and created the GoPros, and they have executed on the idea phenomenally well,
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:56.640]   but an amazing financial success story. He also tells the story that I thought was fascinating
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:01.680]   about a lady named Sarah Blakely, who is the world's youngest female self-made billionaire,
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:07.760]   and she invented Spanx, control-top pantyhose. One of the things that I thought was interesting,
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:12.960]   he profiled in the book on page 271, that he says here, "Sarah shared with me that one of
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:18.000]   the most important secrets to her success was that from an early age, her father actually
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:24.080]   encouraged her to fail, but he defined failure not as failure to achieve a result, but failure
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:30.160]   to try. Around the dinner table, he would ask if she had failed today, and he was truly excited if
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:36.400]   she had because he knew that meant she was on the path to success. 'Tony, it just took away my fear
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:43.200]   of trying,' she told me. Down and out in a dead-end office product sales job, Blakely infested all the
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:49.200]   money she had in the world, $5,000, and set out to create body wear that would work for her. 'I
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:54.800]   must have heard no a thousand times,' she said, but she didn't listen. In addition to the $5,000
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:10:01.120]   she invested, she saved $3,000, which she didn't have, on legal fees by writing her own patent
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:05.920]   from a textbook. And Spanx went on, 'Today it's worth over a billion dollars,'" and they have over
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:12.800]   200 products, including, I guess they're developing a product for men. That's my weak point. I wonder
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:17.120]   if I'll have to check out the Spanx and suck my tummy in with control top pantyhose for men.
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:24.400]   Just kidding, sort of. So, amazing. I noticed that because, as you know, I think a lot about
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:28.960]   education, and I think a lot about the incentive system for failure. And what I don't like is that
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:33.840]   every great inventor, every great entrepreneur talks that I've read, many great inventors,
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:38.880]   entrepreneurs talk about the value of failure, but we've set up an incentive system for children
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:43.920]   that incentivizes them not to fail and penalizes them for failure. Now, there's a difference
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:48.480]   between defining failure as getting a C. If you're capable of getting a C and you get a C,
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:53.520]   that's a success. But I think a lot about how can we clarify the incentive system for children
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:11:00.960]   to incentivize them to try, to try new things. And you don't get incentivized to try and measure the
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:06.400]   way that the current schooling system works. Strategy three that Robbins talks about is a way
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:12.560]   to speed things up, which is reduce fees and taxes and invest the difference. And so, this ultimately
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:18.080]   is all part of my number two thing, cut expenses. Anytime you can lower fees and lower taxes,
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:24.720]   you're cutting expenses, and that's going to improve your situation. And tax efficiency is
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:29.680]   one of the, in Robbins' book here, it's one of the most direct ways to shorten the time it takes to
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:36.240]   get from where you are now to where you want to be financially. He talks a little bit about his
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:40.240]   personal tax story. He says that if you're in a high income or in a high income state, such as
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:46.320]   California, where he used to live, your total tax bill is 62% by the time you bring in all of the
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:51.760]   taxes for income, investment taxes, payroll taxes, the new Obamacare taxes, and social security.
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:56.400]   He does a good job of going into the long-term capital gains rates versus the short-term capital
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:02.560]   gains rates, just a really effective job of talking about how the major, major impact that
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:09.760]   reducing taxes and fees can have on how quickly you can achieve your financial results. I'll
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:14.000]   mention this later when I talk about lifestyle, but one of the things that Robbins did was he
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:20.720]   moved from California to Florida recently and saved a massive amount on taxes just by eliminating the
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:27.760]   California state income tax. I'm going to give you details on that when we get to the, in a moment,
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:31.760]   or it's not going to be in a moment, but later when I talk about his emphasis on lifestyle.
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:40.240]   He's so, so valuable. Let's do it now. One of the things that just, to me, I really love that he
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:47.600]   talks about lifestyle first. I really think that in many ways, lifestyle should be the first place
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:53.360]   to start. He mentions it towards the end of his book, but I think you should start by designing
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:59.200]   the ideal lifestyle. That means many things. It means living in an ideal scenario and an ideal
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:02.080]   place. If you want to live in the mountains, go live in the mountains. Don't wait for retirement.
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:06.160]   If you want to live in the warmth, come live in Florida. We've got plenty of jobs down here.
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:10.800]   Build the lifestyle for yourself first because ultimately money is only good to fund lifestyle.
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:16.160]   So if you can create lifestyle without having money to fund it from investments, just go do
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:22.000]   that first. But then also build the lifestyle in a way that's going to be effective. And so with
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:28.480]   that tax efficiency, he talks on page 287 of his book, he goes through the details of how he was
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:32.480]   born and raised a Californian and had lived there for years, even though he traveled most of the
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:38.560]   time. But California in 2012 raised taxes on the highest income earners by more than 30%
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:47.760]   to a top rate of 13.3%. And so his effective tax rate had shot up to 62 cents for every $100
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:57.920]   that he earned. He was left with $38 after taxes. And worst of all, they made that tax retroactive.
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:03.920]   So after they passed it, after they passed the bill, they made it go back all the way up to that
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:08.880]   same year or to the prior year. I'm not sure which it was. So they changed the rules after the fact.
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:13.280]   And so for him, finally, it convinced him to do something else. So he went on a massive search
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:18.640]   all around the country to find different options. And he came to Florida, right where I live,
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:22.720]   right to Palm Beach. And I used to walk across Palm Beach Island every day to, you know, not
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:26.560]   every day, but to go to the beach when I was in college. He came to Florida and said, "Oh, okay,
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:32.560]   I only know Florida, alligators and old people." But what he found was Palm Beach. And so from page
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:37.360]   289, after looking at 88 properties in three states in just three weeks, I told you I'm a
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:43.920]   massive action guy, we found the only brand new home on the water in Palm Beach. Two acres, nearly
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:48.640]   200 feet of ocean frontage on one side and the Atlantic intercoastal waterway on the other,
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:53.920]   with a 50 foot boat dock. I feel like I'm back in my home in Fiji. It's extraordinary.
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:57.680]   My wife has everything she wants close by, world-class restaurants, et cetera, et cetera,
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:02.880]   et cetera. Of course, the price tag was way higher than I ever wanted or imagined paying for a home.
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:11.840]   But Florida has no state income tax. We went from 13.3% state income tax in California to nothing,
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:18.480]   nada, zip. So here's the kicker. With the state taxes we're saving every year,
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:27.840]   we are literally paying off our entire new home in six years. Did you catch that? We're paying
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:33.680]   for our entire home out of the tax savings we now get as residents of the sunshine state
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:37.920]   instead of the golden state. Kind of makes you think we should have done it sooner, huh?
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:43.360]   Better late than never. And he goes on and says we massively improved our quality of life
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:49.120]   with that change as well. And one of the coolest resources that I'll commend to you is a website I
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:54.080]   had never heard of. And I love the theme of the website. It's called howmoneywalks.com.
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:59.040]   I love this theme and I'd never heard of this site. So I'm really glad I found it.
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:05.680]   howmoneywalks.com is a site that is using the IRS data that the IRS tracks as far as where people
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:15.920]   move from and move to. And it talks about basically where people are moving from and to,
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:20.560]   and where the money is flowing out of and where the money is flowing into.
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:25.760]   And the most interesting thing is you can go in and you can identify your specific situation.
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:31.600]   Sorry about that. My dog barked. You can identify your specific situation and you can say, "Hey,
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:39.280]   if I made this move from here to there, what will that do for me?" I just think this is the coolest
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:44.400]   thing. And the best thing about it, he's got an app. So look it up in the app store that you can
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:49.040]   use. And evidently he's written a book as well. But he's got an option where you can put in,
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:53.760]   "If I move from here to there, how much money would it save me?" So I made up a number and I
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:17:00.320]   said, "Okay, let's say I move from Chicago, Illinois to Florida." And I pretended I said a 29
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:06.480]   year old person married, filing jointly with two dependents making $100,000 a year.
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:15.360]   If you moved from Chicago, Illinois to Florida, you would save $4,590 per year. If that $4,590
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:20.240]   is then invested each year at 6% interest until you retire at the age of 67, you would have an
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:28.720]   additional $623,800 net worth. Isn't that incredible? This has got to be one of the best
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:33.440]   tools ever for showing you, "Hey, here can I save?" And I hear from many of you who say,
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:39.040]   "I actually went and did my cashflow statement based upon how you told me to do it. And so when
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:46.560]   I did it, I found out that I was spending all this money on taxes." Yes, you can do it. Now,
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:51.120]   do I expect everyone to move? No, of course not. But if you have a company that you can move,
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:56.160]   if you have an ability to earn income from other places, if you have a job that you can clearly
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:00.160]   move from and easily move from, this should definitely be on the consideration. And the
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:04.560]   good thing is that everybody wins. Number one, you win by doing something that's in your best
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:11.360]   interest. Number two is that by voting with your feet and moving, the place where you go gets
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:15.200]   better as long as you're a productive person, and you probably are, otherwise you wouldn't be
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:19.840]   moving. And then by voting with your feet and getting out of there, the other place wakes up
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:24.480]   and says, "Hey, I need to change something. This is competition." Doesn't usually exist in government
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:29.040]   circles, but in this situation, it might exist in some. So the Detroit government, after everyone
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:33.040]   left and everyone goes bankrupt, has had to restructure things. So that's good. Clear out
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:38.320]   a bunch of debt, go bankrupt, reset everything. Now new people come in, new innovation comes in,
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:43.520]   people move there for different reasons. Just apply that on a macro scale. So there's really
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:49.120]   one of the few ways that reform can happen in this country is by moving. So I thought that was just
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:56.400]   an awesome scenario. I think Tony does a good job of treating financial advisors fairly. And this is
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:02.240]   always an interesting conundrum. Oftentimes when I come to books like this, I have this internal
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:08.080]   bias because I come from the financial industry. And just like I feel so bad for people who are car
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:13.600]   dealers that you get so hammered on for, "Wow, you're a used car salesman," you kind of build up
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:18.880]   this defense mode. And I have family members who are car dealers, and I'm in the financial world.
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:23.920]   No attorneys in my family, though. But you get used to this defense mode. So I find that constantly
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:27.920]   affects me, even though I don't identify with much of the financial industry and how it works.
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:33.920]   Oftentimes when the financial industry is being criticized, I often get really upset about that.
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:38.400]   Not upset, but I have to deal with it. I have a bias that I have to deal with.
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:44.880]   And so he's clear about this. I think he treats advisors fairly. On page 86, we read,
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:50.400]   "Now let me be clear. This book is not another Bash Wall Street book. Many of the large financial
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:54.720]   institutions have pioneered some extraordinary products that we will explore and advocate
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:59.200]   throughout this book. And the vast majority of people in the financial services industry care
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:03.600]   intensely for their clients. And more often than not, they're doing what they believe to be the
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:09.280]   best thing. Unfortunately, many don't also understand how the house reaps profits, whether
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:13.600]   the client wins or not. They're doing the best they can for their clients with the knowledge,
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:18.480]   training, and the tools, products, they have been provided. But the system isn't set up for
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:23.280]   your broker to have endless options and complete autonomy in finding what's best for you. And this
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:27.200]   could prove costly." I think that's accurate. I really do. I think that's accurate.
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:35.040]   So he clearly, throughout the book, illustrates the need for financial advisors in a number of
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:39.920]   different ways, ways that I've talked about and also just directly simply saying it.
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:43.520]   One of the things that I've grew to love as a financial advisor is the primary
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:48.480]   basis upon which I would bring on board an investment client was on the basis of what
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:53.040]   Nick Murray calls the behavioral investment counseling option. I believe one of the most
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:59.280]   valuable services that an advisor can provide for their client is helping the client to optimize
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:06.080]   and optimize their general behavior through good financial planning and then also to mitigate their
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:13.120]   destructive behavior of dealing with certain market gyrations, essentially. On page 96,
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:20.880]   you see this where he quotes the Dalbar returns comparing the returns of the average mutual fund
[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:28.240]   versus the average investment fund. So over a 20-year period, December 31, 1993 through December
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:35.680]   31, 2013, the S&P 500 returned an average annual return of 9.28%. But the average mutual fund
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:41.360]   investor made just over 2.54%, according to Dalbar, one of the leading industry research firms.
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:45.760]   So this is a major, major problem that I think financial advisors can help with.
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:49.840]   He also does a good job of talking about the importance of asset allocation,
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:54.160]   which in my mind is one of the key scenarios that a good financial advisor should be working
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:59.200]   with people is helping them to figure out and identify their asset allocation and just the
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:06.640]   necessity of doing that carefully with asset allocation. It's a big, big deal.
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:13.600]   And so if you can combine asset allocation, which he makes the point in the book that is free return
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:21.120]   with behavioral investment counseling, to use Nick Murray's words, to me that is tremendous.
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:26.800]   And this page 336 here, he talks about the value of advice. "Some people just won't listen to
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:31.600]   advice. They have to learn the hard way, if at all. But to avoid those kinds of painful lessons
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:36.160]   and to help you decide which options are right for you, I have to remind you that a conflict-free,
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:41.120]   independent investment manager can be the right choice. Notice how professional athletes, men and
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:46.160]   women at the top of their sport always have coaches to keep them at peak performance. Why is that?
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:50.000]   Because a coach will notice when their game is off and can help them make small adjustments that
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:55.120]   can result in huge payoffs. The same thing applies to your finances. Great fiduciary
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:59.200]   advisors will keep you on course when you're starting to act like a teenager and chasing
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:03.680]   returns. They can talk you off the ledge when you're about to make a fateful investment decision."
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:11.280]   So really, really powerful. On the next page, he talks about a quote from the leader of J.P. Morgan,
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:18.560]   one of the financial divisions at J.P. Morgan, a lady named Mary Callahan Erdos, or Erdos,
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:24.400]   I'm not sure. And so in building out an asset allocation, he identifies, in my mind,
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:27.680]   the power of a financial advisor. Let me read to you these four paragraphs.
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:34.080]   "When I interviewed J.P. Morgan's Mary Callahan Erdos, I asked her, 'What criteria would you use
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:40.400]   in building an asset allocation? And if you have to build one for your kids, what would that look
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:45.520]   like?' 'I have three daughters,' she told me. 'They're three different ages. They have three
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:49.200]   different skill sets, and those are going to change over time, and I'm not going to know what
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:54.160]   they are. One might spend more money than another. One may want to work in an environment where she
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:59.360]   can earn a lot of money. Another may be more philanthropic in nature. One may have something
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:03.920]   that happens in her life, a health issue. One may get married. One may not. One may have children.
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:09.520]   One may not. Every single permutation will vary over time, which is why even if I started all
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:14.000]   of them the first day they were born and set out an asset allocation, it would have to change.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:18.400]   And that has to change based on their risk profile, because over time you can't have
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:24.320]   someone in a perfect asset allocation unless it's perfect for them. And if at the end of the day,
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:28.880]   someone comes to me and says, 'All I want is treasury bills to sleep well at night,'
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:34.480]   that may be the best answer for them." I said to her, "Because it's about meeting their emotional
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:39.440]   needs, right? It's not about the money in the end." "Exactly, Tony," she said, "because if I
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:44.160]   cause more stress by taking half their portfolio and putting it in a stock market, but that leads
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:49.360]   to a deterioration of the happiness in their lives, why am I doing that?" "What is the purpose
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:53.760]   of investing?" I asked. "Isn't it about making sure that we have that economic freedom for
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:58.880]   ourselves and for our families?" "That's right. To be able to do the things you want to do," she
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:04.000]   said, "but not at the expense of the stress, the strains, and the discomfort that goes along with
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.520]   a bad market environment." "So what's the lesson here from one of the best financial minds in the
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:14.160]   world? What's more important, even the building wealth is doing it in a way that will give you
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:20.240]   peace of mind." In my mind, that's one of the key values of a financial advisor. So I think he's
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:26.000]   very, very fair in dealing about that. He also clearly in the book, another major benefit of the
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.640]   book, he does a great job of clearly discussing the need for setting the price on the dreams,
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:36.800]   on your dreams. And in my mind, this book is worth it for this chapter alone,
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:43.280]   because this is what people don't do, and I'd encourage you to do it. And as he says,
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:49.520]   you may find that the price tag is less than you ever imagined. Let me read you one example here,
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:56.880]   to kick this one off, from page 203. He says, "I usually kick off my financial seminars with
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:03.120]   a question, 'What's the price of your dreams?' Then I invite people to stand up and tell me
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:08.160]   what it's going to take for them to be financially secure, independent, or free.
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:16.640]   Most don't have a clue." So he goes on to ask, and I ask you now as Robbins asks in the book,
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:21.440]   "What's the price of your dreams? Do you know the price, the actual price tag?"
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:28.320]   This one really made me think, because I realized that I need to update my price tags on my dreams.
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:33.840]   I have a list, and they have price tags, but I realized I need to update them. And
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:40.080]   what most people do is they write down a number of some kind, and then he talks about,
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:43.840]   they write down a number, and it's a big number, and it's kind of scary,
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:48.960]   they don't know what to do with it. They don't know what it means. On the next page, he says,
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:53.920]   "Recently at one of my high-end programs, a young man in the back of the room stood up to name the
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:27:00.320]   price of his dreams. He threw back his shoulders and announced, 'A billion dollars.'" There were
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:04.800]   a lot of oohs and ahs from the crowd. This person was in his 20s, one of the younger participants
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:09.840]   at the conference, and he probably hadn't earned his first million yet. So I asked him to consider
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:16.960]   what that number really meant. Robbins goes on and talks about how what was driving him was
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:22.800]   significance, the idea of having a billion dollars, that if he had a billion dollars,
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:28.960]   if he was a billionaire, then he would matter, he would be significant. People would recognize that.
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:35.920]   But as far as how to actually work with him, Robbins went on and talked to him and said,
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:41.360]   "Well, what kind of lifestyle would you live?" The man says, "I'd like to have a Gulfstream jet,
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:50.960]   a jet that I can really fly around the world in." Let me just read this. It says on page 206,
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:54.560]   "I started by asking my young friend what his lifestyle would be like if he had a billion
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:59.040]   dollars. He thought for a moment, then he said, 'I'd have my own Gulfstream.'" "Your own jet,"
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:04.160]   I said, "where will you fly to?" He said, "Well, I live in New York. I'd probably fly down to the
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:08.800]   Bahamas and I'd probably fly to LA for some meetings." I had him write down how many times
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:13.840]   he'd fly in a year and he figured it was probably a maximum of 12 flights. And how much would a jet
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:20.400]   cost him? We looked it up and a long distance Gulfstream G650 would cost him about $65 million.
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:25.600]   A slightly used Gulfstream IV would only set him back about $10 million,
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:31.520]   not including fuel, maintenance, and crew. Then we looked up the costs of chartering a
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:36.320]   private jet instead of owning one. A mid-sized jet was all he really needed for himself and
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:42.160]   three family members to fly and that's around $2,500 an hour. He would be flying for maybe 100
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:50.400]   hours a year for a grand total of $250,000 per year or around $5,000 per hour or $500,000 per
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:55.360]   year if he wanted to fly by a Gulfstream on every flight. Still far less than the annual price of
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:29:00.800]   maintenance on many jets and at a cost that would be less than 1% of the cost of buying that Gulfstream.
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:06.960]   Even from the stage I could see his eyes lighting up and his mind working. He goes on and says,
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:12.160]   "What else would you buy? Buy an island." Robbins tells the story of buying his own island and
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:16.880]   worked through the list and looked up the cost and figured out he could buy an island or he could just
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:24.720]   rent Richard Branson's Necker Island for $350,000 for a week. That comes with a staff of 50 people
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:29.280]   to take care of everything and host all of his friends there. If he did that every year for a
[01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:35.520]   decade, it would only cost $3.5 million versus $30 to $40 million needed to buy an island with
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:41.120]   no work to maintain the property. We worked through his list, I'm on 2H208, and guess how much it would
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:46.880]   cost to have the lifestyle he wants to have for the rest of his life. When we added up the real cost
[01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:54.320]   of even his wildest dreams, not just his needs, it came to a grand total of not $1 billion, not
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:30:04.960]   $500 million, not $100 million, not $50 million, but $10 million to have everything he dreamed of
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:10.800]   having in his lifestyle and never have to work for pay for it. His dreams were gigantic.
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:19.840]   The difference between $10 million and $1 billion is astronomical. These numbers exist in different
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:25.040]   universes. He goes on and talks about really big numbers. Pay attention to these two paragraphs,
[01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:31.840]   trying to compare the definition and the difference between millionaires and billionaires.
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:37.760]   My first question is, how long ago was 1 million seconds ago? Take a moment,
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:45.520]   even if you don't know, what do you guess? The answer is 12 days ago. How close were you?
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:51.760]   Don't feel bad. Most people have no clue. If you got it, congratulations. Now we're going to up the
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:57.680]   ante. Since you now have a perspective of what a million is, a million seconds being 12 days ago,
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:04.080]   how long ago was a billion seconds ago? Stay with me. Come on, make a guess. Commit to a number.
[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:12.560]   The answer is 32 years ago. How close were you? For most people, they're pretty far off.
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:21.520]   That's the difference between being a millionaire and a billionaire. 12 days or 32 years.
[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:28.560]   Do you see what I mean by saying they live in different universes? You can never say millionaires
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:34.160]   and billionaires in the same breath and be talking about the same thing. Just to complete the
[01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:40.720]   thought, when you hear the US government has $17 trillion in debt, how much is a trillion? Well,
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:46.640]   if a billion seconds was 32 years ago, how long ago was a trillion seconds?
[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:55.200]   The answer, nearly 32,000 years ago. Big difference, huh?
[01:31:55.200 --> 01:32:01.600]   When you hear people talk about national debt figures and things like that,
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:07.920]   keep that in mind. Trillions are big numbers. Difference between a million, which you might have,
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:13.600]   and a billion, which you might have, and a trillion, which you don't have,
[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:21.840]   is a big number. The point is by actually defining a price tag for goals, you can achieve them
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:26.960]   because they're not so scary. I found this time after time myself in doing retirement planning.
[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:29.600]   People say in retirement planning, "What are you going to do in retirement?" "I'm going to travel."
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:35.040]   Define travel. How many months a year are you going to be gone? "Well, not a month,
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:38.160]   just two weeks, three weeks. I want to take a three-week trip to Europe."
[01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:41.280]   "Okay, you want to do that every six months?" "Well, no, just once."
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:49.040]   So your price tag is 5,000 bucks maybe, the high end. You could spend thousands, but I don't know.
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:52.240]   I could go to Europe for 1,000 bucks for three weeks,
[01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:57.360]   all included. So you've got to figure out what's your price tag.
[01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:02.640]   What I love in this section, I mentioned it earlier, is his five steps. Let me go through
[01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:09.120]   them and I'm actually going to add my own. Let me start with his. He gives five dreams,
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:15.120]   basically, in five different numbers. I think these things are useful to give to people.
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:19.680]   Look at the power of certain financial models. Look at Dave Ramsey's seven steps,
[01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:24.800]   seven baby steps. Look at how powerful that is to give people a clear organizing framework.
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:28.480]   Look at how powerful having a goal given to you can be.
[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:34.400]   Well, what I like about Robin's approach here is he gives these five dreams and he
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:38.320]   asks you to give price tags to them. So let me go through his first and then I'm going to add
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:42.960]   what I'm thinking about developing going forward. Number one, he says dream one is financial
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:49.920]   security. What does security mean? He says it's these five things. Your home mortgage,
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:53.520]   for as long as you live, paid forever. You never have to work again to pay for your home.
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:57.920]   Number two, your utilities for the home, paid forever. You never have to work to pay for your
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:02.560]   phone bill or to keep the lights on. Three, all the food for your family, paid forever. Four,
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:07.600]   your basic transportation needs. Five, your basic insurance costs, all of them paid for
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:12.560]   without you ever working another day in your life. And so for him, he goes and leads you through
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:17.600]   defining those things. You write down your mortgage payment, you write down your food
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:22.320]   costs, your utility costs, your transportation, your insurance costs, and figure out what that
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:28.400]   average is. In the US, that average is about $34,668 a year according to Bogle.
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:34.560]   And so then flip out of that and just say, "Well, how much money would I need in a portfolio to fund
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:42.480]   that for the rest of my life?" And if we use, let's just use for sake of scenario, 25 times
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:51.680]   annual expenses, if that basic level for you at $34,650 times 25, that's $866,700 of savings. Now,
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:57.360]   that's a lot of money, but it's not as much money as millions of dollars, and that's basic
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:02.160]   financial security. And he goes on and gives a couple of stories about how to create that number.
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:08.080]   His dream number two is financial vitality is what he calls it. And he says it's a mile marker
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:14.400]   on the path to financial independence and freedom. And so he says, he figures out, he calculates it
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:19.520]   as all of those basic costs plus half of your current monthly clothing costs, half of your
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:24.160]   current monthly dining and entertainment costs, half of your current small indulgences or little
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:29.040]   indulgence or little luxury costs, and figure out what that additional level of income is.
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:36.800]   Then dream three is financial independence. And so financial independence for him is the way he
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:45.200]   mentions that number is he goes with all of those other expenses plus whatever goals and ideas as
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:53.600]   far as the big money that you would want to spend on really your dreams or at least the dreams
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:56.800]   related to your current lifestyle. Basically, he says, "What's your current lifestyle? Let's fund
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:00.800]   that," with the assumption that most people are spending more than the basic expenses. So financial
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:06.800]   independence is funding current lifestyle. Step four is financial freedom. And so financial freedom
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:11.520]   means you're independent, you have everything you have today plus two or three significant luxuries
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:17.200]   that you want in the future. So this might be things like a vacation condo. In the example here,
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:23.360]   he talks about a person that he was advising that wanted to give $100,000 a year to their church
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:29.680]   and also have a condo in Steamboat Springs. And so figuring out that number for financial freedom.
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:35.680]   And then his fifth dream is absolute financial freedom. And he talks about what is the absolute,
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:40.880]   all of the dreams that you possibly have, no matter what. You can own, you can rent the jet,
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:44.960]   so you can have the jet lifestyle without having to own it. You can own part of the sports team.
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:52.400]   What are all of your dreams and figuring out the total number and targeting that number. And so in
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:59.680]   the example, he got somebody that wound up, the person wound up needing $673,000 a year.
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:04.720]   And you can figure that out with payment. So here's where I'm going to expand on this concept.
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:09.440]   I love this idea of the five models. And Robbins in the book here says, "At most, pick three,
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:12.000]   pick three numbers. How are you going to keep five numbers in your head?"
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:19.360]   What I don't like about this is that he starts with financial security. And financial security
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:29.200]   to him, that first number, that first goal is the idea of having all the money and investments to
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:34.240]   pay for your basic living expenses, housing, utilities, food, transportation, and insurance.
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:40.880]   But that's still a big number. That's $600,000, $700,000, $800,000. My thought is, I wonder if
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:45.920]   we could develop this with some additional numbers. So the first thing I thought was,
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:52.960]   step one could be financial solvency. So applying the idea of the power of setting out clear steps,
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:56.720]   I've wondered if we could develop a model that would say, "Step one is financial solvency. And
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:02.560]   I define this as current on all of your bills." If you look at Dave Ramsey's seven baby steps
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:07.360]   system, he said, "The first thing is get current on your bills. Then step one is save a thousand
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:12.800]   bucks, I think." So step one is financial solvency. And I would say, "Get current on all of
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:17.600]   your bills." Maybe you could add in a preset, a pre-step. I mean, you could get ridiculous with
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:24.160]   this. But the idea is if you're counseling a 16-year-old young man or woman that is trying
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:29.520]   to say, "What are my goals?" Well, maybe that would be a goal. Maybe step two could be financial
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:34.720]   stability. So you're current on all of your bills, plus you have an emergency fund of a certain size,
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:39.680]   six months of expenses, something like that. Maybe the next step would be debt freedom or
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:45.280]   consumer debt freedom. We've paid off all consumer debt to give a nod toward the power of paying off
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:50.400]   consumer debt and then build up into partial financial security. This is just my ideas I'm
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:54.320]   trying to figure out. If you have any ideas on that subject of how you would name that,
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:58.960]   I'd love to hear them. Comment on today's show and let me know. If not, what I would encourage
[01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:04.720]   you is set out your own set of goals. So for example, on my personal financial plan,
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:11.840]   my goal ultimately is to be able to provide for the lifestyle of my family at a comfortable level
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:19.600]   without needing to work, with being able to pay that off of investments. I think that as far as
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:24.160]   for us, what a comfortable level would be something like, I don't know, somewhere on the
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:29.760]   order of like six grand a month. I'm a pretty simple guy. I can fund most of my luxuries on
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:36.560]   $6,000 a month. So that means when I actually run the math for me, that means about 1.8 million
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:40.960]   bucks. Now at the moment, we spend somewhere between three to four on a monthly basis,
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:46.080]   depending on what we're doing. So that's also part of my scenario is, let's just say $36,000
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:54.800]   times 25, that's about $900,000. So there are some luxuries that I think we would enjoy spending at
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:59.440]   the higher level that we don't currently do. I can imagine a few things that would be fun to do.
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:04.080]   So that's why for me, that $6,000 number is pretty luxurious. I don't want to move. I don't want to
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:08.560]   live in a house on the water. I don't want to drive a new car, but I would like to buy an RV.
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:12.880]   So some things like that, that's where that difference is. So for me, the kind of a baseline
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:19.040]   is the $900,000 number. But on my financial plan personally, one of my earlier goals is to get this
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:25.520]   show to a point where it can actually fund my basic lifestyle and then my ideal lifestyle,
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:30.560]   with the idea being that I'll fund the basic lifestyle at $3,000 a month off the show.
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:35.920]   I'll grow it up to be $6,000. I'll save 50%. Anywhere beyond the three, basically three
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:42.640]   to $4,000 a month that we spend, everything beyond that is going to savings. And then all
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:46.240]   of that money that's going to savings is going to build the portfolio. And then once I hit
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:51.840]   the $3,000 number in passive income at that point in time, then ideally we'll start to increase our
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:58.480]   lifestyle after we've started with that financial, well, Robbins calls it financial security. I call
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:02.880]   it financial independence. So make up these ideas for yourself. I thought this was really powerful
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:08.880]   and I loved his five models. I thought it was a super useful idea. And I can see how I can
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:14.560]   expand on this and expand on this for yourself. Everyone's ideas are going to be different.
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:20.800]   But in my mind, the key is make the celebrations come more quickly, but make them in the direction
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:26.000]   that you want to go. If you set off with absolute financial freedom, which is what many people do,
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.960]   if you're not already part of the way there, does that really meaningful? Start with financial
[01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:36.160]   solvency. And I think if we add a couple of steps, then maybe we can help someone
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:41.200]   cross the gap and know that we're going to absolute financial freedom, but work on financial
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:46.080]   solvency first. So I share those ideas with you. I hope they're useful to you.
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:51.920]   One of the other things that I really thought was excellent about this book and really interesting
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:59.440]   was the portfolios. And in the book, Robbins talks a lot about different portfolios,
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:05.200]   and there are three that stand out. Within the context of the asset allocation discussion,
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:08.800]   he's constantly talking with different people and saying, "Well, how would you allocate your money?"
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:13.040]   And remember, most of the people he's talking with, or at least many of these billionaires,
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:17.840]   are billionaire hedge fund managers. None of them are mutual fund managers. They're all hedge fund
[01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:22.000]   managers, which by the way, is its own show in and of itself as far as what's happening in the
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:31.200]   mutual fund market. But the first one that appears is on page 327. This is David Swenson's portfolio.
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:37.440]   David Swenson runs the Yale Endowment. And so he's running a $24 billion portfolio
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:45.120]   for the Yale Endowment. And evidently, he's done an excellent job with that portfolio.
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:49.680]   Kind of bugs me a little bit, by the way, just as an aside, bugs me a little bit some of the
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:54.080]   attention some of these portfolio managers get when there are, you know,
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:43:00.800]   they're insurance companies that are managing $150 billion portfolios with incredible finesse
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:07.200]   and they don't seem to get much press. But the Yale guy does. Now he's had good returns.
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:11.680]   But the point is, this is the guy that we're supposed to look for and say, "How would we
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:18.080]   allocate the money?" So he talks about, this is the portfolio selection that he recommends.
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:25.600]   20% in domestic stock, 20% in international stock, 10% in emerging markets, 20% in real estate,
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:32.480]   real estate investment trusts, and 15% in long-term U.S. treasuries, and 15% in TIPS,
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:36.560]   treasury inflation protected securities. When you run the numbers on it, it comes out to be 50%
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:42.400]   in stock, 20% in real estate REITs, and 30% in bonds. And this is an interesting portfolio
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:48.800]   because it's fairly straightforward, 50/50, 50% in equities, which is very interesting.
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:55.120]   And then the bond portfolio is interesting to me because he splits it between long-term
[01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:59.680]   treasuries and TIPS, so treasury inflation protected securities. Without going into the
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:05.840]   details, essentially what he's trying to do here is he's splitting his bond portfolio out
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:16.640]   to try to make the connection between success in inflation or in deflation.
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:24.240]   In inflation, in an inflationary environment, the TIPS protect your portfolio. In a deflationary
[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:29.040]   environment, your treasuries protect your portfolio. So I thought that was interesting.
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:32.560]   50% stocks, 20% real estate, 30% bonds, essentially.
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:40.080]   Robbins kind of glosses over that in favor, focusing primarily on something he calls the
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:45.360]   all-seasons portfolio, which is an offshoot of his interview with Ray Dalio. And he's got a very
[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:52.000]   interesting story behind this. Ray Dalio running a very successful, well-known fund called the
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:55.760]   All-Weather Portfolio, which has had some really impressive performance over time.
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:45:00.960]   And within the context of the discussion, he goes through and talks about how he was able to get
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:09.040]   Dalio to lay out for him the allocation that he recommends. And I was not familiar previously
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:14.480]   with the All-Weather Portfolio. Portfolio management is not my bailiwick. So this is not
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:21.680]   something that I was really familiar with. But it was interesting to read about. And I do spend a
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:25.680]   little bit of time focusing on the fundamentals. And for those of you who I've done a show on the
[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:30.080]   past on the permanent portfolio, which is an interesting strategy, I was struck by how similar
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:37.120]   this is to the permanent portfolio approach with a slight tweak. What Dalio explains is that what
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:44.080]   makes his All-Weather Portfolio different than many others is that instead of basing his asset
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:53.600]   allocation decision on the different asset class on a set percentage, such as what Swenson said,
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:46:02.400]   where I put 50% in stocks, 20% in real estate, and 30% in bonds, Dalio says, "I'm developing my
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:11.120]   percentages based upon the volatility of returns." So as an example, if you were running a portfolio
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:18.560]   that was 50% stock and 50% bonds, even though that is "balanced" from the perspective of 50/50
[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:24.800]   with regard to the percentages, it's not balanced based upon the amount of risk, based upon the
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:30.400]   volatility of the portfolio. And so what he does is he calculates the volatility of the stock
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:38.800]   portfolio, and he uses that to address what percentage should be allocated. So I'll go
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:43.280]   through his allocations in just a moment, but the other thing that struck me about his approach that
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:51.680]   Robbins relates Dalio's lesson in the book is that he's very much focused on the idea of the four
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:55.840]   different economic environments, which is what I originally learned when studying the permanent
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:47:02.320]   portfolio. And so in summary, on page 386 of the book, Robbins lays this out for you. He says
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:07.440]   that there are only four things that move the price of assets. Number one, inflation.
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:17.760]   Number two, deflation. Number three, rising economic growth. And four, declining economic growth.
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:24.240]   So if you plot those things on a matrix, you can have your four different options. Either we're
[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:30.080]   going to have an inflationary growth environment, or we're going to have an inflationary declining
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:35.280]   environment, declining economic growth environment, or deflationary growth, or deflationary
[01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:41.680]   decline. So very interestingly, Ray's just simply saying, "I don't know what's going to happen."
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:45.680]   There's all kinds of story in the book, but Ray says, "I don't know what's going to happen,
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:49.920]   but I do know we're going to be in one of those scenarios." He also makes the interesting point
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:55.760]   that the key is not what's actually happening, but the key is whether or not it's expected.
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:01.840]   So with investing, you often hear that, "Well, they had higher than expected earnings, so
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:05.440]   therefore that moved their stock price. We had lower than expected earnings, so therefore that
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:14.160]   moved their stock price." And in general, this is a scenario that the idea that the forecasters and
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:18.800]   the analysts in the world of investing have already priced into their model whatever they
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:24.720]   think their forecasts are. So the price that they're willing to pay or not pay for an asset
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:32.720]   is based upon their expectations. And so that price is going to change when either expectations
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:40.480]   are not met or not met, either positively or negatively. So Dalio makes that point as well,
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:45.200]   which is very interesting. Now in these four environments, we could have higher than expected.
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:51.200]   The expectation is the key. So we're either going to have higher than expected inflation
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:56.640]   and rising prices, or we're going to have lower than expected inflation or deflation. We're going
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:00.640]   to have higher than expected economic growth, and we're going to have lower than expected economic
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:07.440]   growth. So Dalio builds the portfolio for that. And I'm often wondering when I try to wrap my
[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:14.640]   head around investment topics, what works well in what scenario? On page 388, Robbins has a very
[01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:24.160]   useful chart. And the chart has four quadrants, and on the top is growth and inflation. So on the
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:31.200]   left two quadrants, we're dealing with are we in a period of higher than expected economic growth
[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:36.240]   or in a period of lower than expected economic growth? And then are we in a period of higher
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:43.600]   than expected inflation or are we in a period of lower than expected inflation? And he links the
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:49.200]   asset classes to these, which I always find very interesting. So in a period of higher than
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:56.480]   expected economic growth, that we did expect stocks, corporate bonds, and commodities and gold
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:50:01.840]   to do well. In a period of lower than expected economic growth, we would expect treasury bonds,
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:07.920]   inflation-linked bonds, or TIPS to do well. In a period of higher than expected inflation,
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:13.760]   we would expect commodities and gold to do well, inflation-linked bonds, TIPS to do well. And in
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:18.080]   a period of lower than expected inflation, we would expect treasury bonds and stocks to do well.
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:24.560]   So that's what he sticks in there. Then Dalio goes in and talks about how allocating risk. So
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:32.000]   he wants 25% of his risk in each of those quadrants, not necessarily just to match a 25%
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:42.240]   asset allocation based upon percentage. He wants 25% of the risk. So on that basis, Robbins in the
[01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:48.720]   narrative gets him to give the actual percentages. And so here's what they are. Robbins makes clear
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:55.360]   in the book, and Dalio makes clear, this is not specifically his all-weather portfolio, because
[01:50:55.360 --> 01:51:03.760]   in his all-weather portfolio, he is using some fairly sophisticated portfolio management
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:11.920]   techniques. But this is pretty close, according to Robbins' book here. So his asset allocation,
[01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:21.920]   he puts 30% in stocks, 40% in long-term US bonds, 15% in intermediate US bonds,
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:31.840]   7.5% in gold, and 7.5% in commodities. It's very interesting. So I really enjoyed reading about
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:36.080]   that. And I learned something I'd never learned before. I'd never thought about the model of the
[01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:41.520]   idea of allocating risk. And so I'm going to have to give that some thought, because it does make a
[01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:46.320]   lot of sense to me. I think it's very interesting. The other port—and I commend it to you. Again,
[01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:52.480]   the book is well worth the price, so buy it and read it. That section alone is fascinating.
[01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:56.160]   Where else? I mean, I'm not going to get—well, I guess I'd be a little short-sighted of me. At
[01:51:56.160 --> 01:52:00.240]   the moment, I don't think it's likely that next week I'm going to sit down with Ray Dalio and
[01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:05.920]   have the necessary clout to get him to talk to me about all those details that he may have talked
[01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:11.680]   with Robbins about. Now, the other portfolio that was interesting was Mark Faber. He talks
[01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:17.360]   about his portfolio. And what struck me about Mark Faber—Mark Faber was a billionaire Swiss investor—
[01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:23.600]   is that Faber had focused—he's well-known for being a contrarian doom-and-gloom guy,
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:30.560]   which is—he's great. It was my favorite interview in the book with the profiles of the billionaires
[01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:35.680]   that he talked about. He was my favorite. But he talked about that his portfolio—he used to focus
[01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:42.400]   it on 25% stocks, 25% gold, 25% cash and bonds, and 25% real estate. So I thought it was really
[01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:46.400]   interesting. Those of you who love the Porvino portfolio concept, you all will like these
[01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:55.440]   models. I was struck by how similar they all tend to be. A couple other major lessons I learned from
[01:52:55.440 --> 01:53:01.040]   the book. I learned that the average American evidently spends $1,000 a year on the lottery.
[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:05.520]   I couldn't believe that one. I searched and searched and searched to try to find
[01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:13.840]   the actual citation for that. But in the book, Robbins cited a professor, but he didn't cite
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:19.200]   an actual study, and there's no bibliography. So I searched and searched to find that one.
[01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:23.200]   All of the numbers I found online about how much the average American spends are far lower than
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:28.240]   that, but maybe there was new research that the professor knew. I don't know. I learned—Robbins
[01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:34.960]   makes a big point about the greatest investors in the world finding an asymmetric risk-return
[01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:40.240]   ratio. I'm going to talk a little bit about this again. But the best way to find an asymmetric
[01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:45.360]   risk-return ratio is in the world of investment management. I'm going to save this. I'm going to
[01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:49.600]   mention this when I get to talking through the investment manager. It's very fascinating to me.
[01:53:49.600 --> 01:53:57.440]   One of the most compelling things I learned was about the power of a disempowering story.
[01:53:58.240 --> 01:54:05.200]   Pages 190, 191, Robbins talks about the stories that we tell ourselves and the impact that that
[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:11.840]   has on our physical experience. He talks about various people, including Richard Branson,
[01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:18.720]   that had dyslexia, but they view dyslexia not as something that is an obstacle that
[01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:25.360]   is going to keep them from achieving something, but rather as an obstacle that they're going to
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:31.520]   have to work harder to overcome. He cites some interesting research from a health psychologist
[01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:38.400]   at Stanford University named Kelly McGonigal, who talked about the dangers of stress for a long time.
[01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:46.240]   Then she wondered one day if it wasn't stress itself that was causing the problems, but rather
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:53.920]   how people viewed stress. A quote on page 191 says from her, "I'm converting a stimulus, stress,
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:58.880]   that could be strengthening people into a source of disease." So, it's actually the impact of the
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:04.640]   stress, not to the actual stress. According to her research, it evidently is the research is now
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:09.200]   showing that when you change your mind about stress, you can actually change your body's
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:17.440]   reaction to it. The quote from page 191, "In an eight-year study, adults who experienced a 'lot
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:23.440]   of stress' and who believed stress was harmful to their health had a 43% increase in their risk of
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:28.640]   dying. However, people who experienced an equal amount of stress but did not view stress as
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:34.480]   harmful were no more likely to die." McGonigal says that the physical signs of stress, a pounding
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:39.600]   heart, faster breathing, breaking out in a sweat, aren't necessarily physical evidence of anxiety
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:44.080]   or signs that we aren't coping well with pressure. Instead, we can interpret them as
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:48.480]   indications that our body is energized and preparing us to meet the next challenge.
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:55.040]   So, the idea is it's not the stress itself that actually matters, but it's the story that you
[01:55:55.040 --> 01:56:01.280]   attach to stress. This made a big difference for me because I think a lot about how to interpret
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:09.520]   events. I was raised with the privilege of basically confronting minor adversity from time
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:14.240]   to time and the opportunity to learn to control my attitude around something, and that's made a
[01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:19.360]   major difference in who I am. At a time of adversity, a miserable experience, so to speak,
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:23.840]   you go camping and it rains all weekend. This is not something to be cried about. This is something
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:29.200]   to be laughed at. The story that I tell about a rainy weekend camping trip, I say, "Well, wow,
[01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:32.640]   we're going to have a fun story later and we can make a good experience of it." That's made a big
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:38.800]   difference in my life as far as my ability to interpret experiences into a more positive
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:47.120]   framing. With Robin's book here, I think about this with regard to financial stress. Some people
[01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:51.680]   seem to fall apart under financial stress and some people seem to say, "Whatever, no big deal."
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:57.120]   Work stress, investment stress, certain things. I want to research this more and try to figure
[01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:04.480]   this out because it aligns with an agenda I'd like to see, which is basically the idea of
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:08.960]   empowering ourselves to take control of our circumstances. I'm interested to research that
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:14.160]   a little bit more, but I really felt that was a valuable learning. I learned how to buy a tax
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:20.640]   deductible vacation property. I commend this to you. I thought it was a great idea.
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:28.160]   Robbins talks a little bit about his personal experience with buying a property in Fiji.
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:35.600]   He talks about this in two places. Page 207, he writes this paragraph in the context of encouraging
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:42.640]   the young man who had said, "I need a billion dollars to accomplish my dreams." He writes this,
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:48.400]   "I own a small island paradise in the country of Fiji. It was a wild dream I had early in my life
[01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:53.840]   to find an escape someday where I could take my family and friends and live. In my early 20s,
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:58.800]   I traveled to islands all over the world searching for my Shangri-La. When I arrived in Fiji,
[01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:04.400]   I found it, a place with not only magnificent beauty, but beautiful souls as well. I couldn't
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:09.920]   afford it at the time, but I bought a piece of a little backpacker resort with 125 acres on the
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:15.040]   island. I really didn't have the money, and it probably wasn't the best investment at first,
[01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:19.200]   but it was part of what I call my dream bucket, something you'll learn about later in the book.
[01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:23.760]   Still, I made it happen, and I'm proud to say that over the years, I've purchased and converted it
[01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:30.000]   into a protected ecological preserve with over 500 acres of land and nearly three miles of ocean
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:36.000]   frontage. I've turned Namale Resort and Spa into the number one resort in Fiji for the last decade,
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:39.440]   and it's consistently rated among the top 10 resorts in the South Pacific.
[01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:44.800]   But how often do I visit this paradise? With my crazy schedule, maybe four to six weeks a year.
[01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:50.320]   So my dream has come true. Everybody else has a great time there. So I thought this was cool.
[01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:56.400]   If you want a tax-deductible vacation home, do it Tony Robbins way. Buy a resort, turn it into a
[01:58:56.400 --> 01:59:00.880]   business that makes you money, and there's not a chance in the world he pays when he's there. He
[01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:05.760]   gets to enjoy it and write all of the expenses associated with it off. Now, maybe his accountant
[01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:09.600]   does pay something. I don't know that, but I just thought it was really interesting.
[01:59:09.600 --> 01:59:16.080]   And he talks about, on page 341, he talks about talking about the resort in Fiji.
[01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:20.400]   Now, over the years, Namale Resort and Spa has become a pretty sizable asset because I built it
[01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:26.000]   up and turned it into one of the top destinations in the South Pacific. I share this with you because
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:30.000]   I have thought about this from my personal perspective, and I think this is a strategy
[01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:36.240]   that we could apply to our lives with smaller dollar figures. Remember earlier I also talked
[01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:40.800]   about Richard Branson. In that same section on islands, Robbins says, "Why don't you just go
[01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:45.280]   rent Richard Branson's Necker Island? It's only $350,000 a week. No big deal, and it comes with
[01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:49.520]   the staff of 50 people to take care of you." And I thought, "Interesting." I didn't know you could
[01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:53.280]   rent Necker Island. I don't know. Maybe it's foolish of me. I just hadn't thought about it.
[01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:59.280]   But that's definitely the way to do it. Many people do this already. You buy a cabin and
[01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:06.080]   you put it on the rent a cabin site, and you stay there when you want to. But I just commend you
[02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:10.640]   that you can do this at any scale, at the small scale and at the larger scale. And I think it's
[02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:15.600]   much smarter. I've had so many people sit in my office and say, "Joshua, I want to buy a second
[02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:19.840]   house or a vacation home." And I just often wonder, "Why would you want that? Why would you
[02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:24.160]   want the hassle?" And if you do want it, go for it, but maybe consider at least making a little
[02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:29.680]   bit of money on it. So to me, that makes a big, big difference. I have two favorite quotes that
[02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:37.120]   came out of the book that really made it, for me, were impactful. First quote comes from page 246,
[02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:43.360]   and it says this, "Most people overestimate what they can do in a year, and they massively
[02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:51.200]   underestimate what they can accomplish in a decade or two." The fact is you are not a manager
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:57.040]   of circumstance. You're the architect of your life's experience. Just because something isn't
[02:00:57.040 --> 02:01:02.320]   in the foreground or isn't within striking distance, don't underestimate the power of the
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:09.600]   right actions taken relentlessly. That quote about overestimating what they can do in a year,
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:13.520]   that totally applies to me. Every year I set out much bigger goals than I ever accomplished.
[02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:17.280]   But then I think I also probably do underestimate what I can accomplish in a decade or two. That
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:20.880]   really made me pay attention. I'm going to continue to think about that. Another quote
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:28.880]   from page 41 is a quote that says, "Complexity is the enemy of execution." This is something else
[02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:34.560]   that I struggle with because he's talking about why we should make investment choices simple.
[02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:43.440]   He shares the idea that in different countries, the percentage of people that donate their organs
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:49.120]   varies greatly. In Germany, there's a one in eight chance you'll donate your organs. About 12% of the
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:55.760]   population does. But in Austria, 99% of people donate their organs. In Sweden, 89% donate. But
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:02:00.880]   in Denmark, the rate is only 4%. So what's the difference? He goes on and shows that the
[02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:07.920]   difference is the way they ask the question. In Denmark, there's a small box that says,
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:12.080]   "Check here if you want to participate in the organ donor program." In other countries like
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:16.640]   Sweden, the form says, "Check here if you don't want to participate in the organ donor program."
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:23.840]   Nobody likes to check boxes. In that context, he talks about complexity as the enemy of execution.
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:27.600]   I've often struggled with this as far as how to connect with people because I'm a very complex
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:34.160]   person in the sense of I often go to elaborate, complex solutions instead of simple ones.
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:41.440]   That's why, as you see when I dig into my critiques of this book, I get pretty complex.
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:46.640]   I think this is oftentimes a problem for me. I'm going to write that one down. Remember,
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:51.280]   complexity is the enemy of execution. Ultimately, execution is what matters.
[02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:56.640]   I had to learn that with financial planning. Very simple. Help your clients take action.
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:02.480]   Make a simple step and lay it there and make it happen. So I share that with you.
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:11.920]   Now, let's get into some flaws of the book. I'm sharing these with you not with the purpose of
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:17.520]   being mean to Tony Robbins, but with the purpose of trying to give you some information
[02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:24.720]   and also arm you with some critical thinking skills and show you how in many financial books,
[02:03:24.720 --> 02:03:30.320]   there are a lot of things that if you're not aware of them, they might just bumble past you.
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:35.920]   So let's throw out a few minor ones real quick. I already mentioned I can't find the bibliography.
[02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:39.840]   This is a big deal because he cites a lot of stuff, but none of it is actually cited.
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:45.600]   He talks a lot about, "Okay, this study shows this." And I had to do some digging to show some
[02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:50.320]   studies because the first thing I do when someone cites a study is I let me go read it because it
[02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:55.920]   makes a big difference as far as how somebody... It makes a big difference when you actually see
[02:03:55.920 --> 02:04:00.240]   the study and see the question that was listened to, which you'll get to in a moment. I'll show
[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:05.120]   you one of those. And so go read the study. Don't trust when people cite something. Go read it.
[02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:09.040]   And if you can't... A couple of these I couldn't find. I just had to read some articles. At least
[02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:15.600]   find several articles to corroborate yourself, but go read the actual study and then you'll find out,
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:19.680]   "Well, wait a second. This is not what this says at all." I assume this is just a clerical error.
[02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:23.920]   In the book, he says it would be found on the website. Well, I've searched the website every
[02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:27.760]   which way I can think of. I cannot find a bibliography, so I assume it'll show up at
[02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:33.760]   some point. But it's a big problem. You've got to cite your stuff, and so that's one issue.
[02:04:33.760 --> 02:04:39.520]   I have an issue with his use of the word "risk." This bothers me throughout, and you see this in
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:46.480]   almost in many investment books. They talk about risk, and they constantly refer to different
[02:04:46.480 --> 02:04:52.800]   types of risk, but call them all risk. And so there are so many different kinds of risk. You've
[02:04:52.800 --> 02:04:57.760]   got on the one hand, you've got market risk, which is the risk of the value of your investments going
[02:04:57.760 --> 02:05:02.160]   up and down based upon the gyrations of the market. And on the other hand, you've got currency risk,
[02:05:02.160 --> 02:05:06.880]   which is the value of your investments going up and down based upon the fluctuations of the
[02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:16.080]   currency. Those are two very different things. You cannot eliminate risk. All you can do is plan
[02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:24.400]   for different risks. So the problem is that by only using this word "risk," which I get is the
[02:05:24.400 --> 02:05:30.240]   most commonly used word. By only using the word "risk," we really wind up doing a disservice.
[02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:35.920]   I try to use volatility when I'm talking about market risk. The idea that the value of the
[02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:39.840]   investments will go up and down on any given day, ran completely randomly. I use volatility
[02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:48.080]   for that, and there are many reasons for that, but it bugs me. Because a lot of times, he is
[02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:54.480]   presenting specific solutions for risk that only solve one kind of risk and open you up to
[02:05:54.480 --> 02:06:00.320]   completely different kinds of risk. He talks about saving percentages, but he doesn't give any
[02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:05.680]   guidelines for how to figure out that percentage. He has an app, which I'll get to in detail in a
[02:06:05.680 --> 02:06:11.920]   few minutes, but that's a kind of a bug. In talking about things, he makes a big deal about the mutual
[02:06:11.920 --> 02:06:17.440]   ownership structure of Vanguard, but he doesn't once mention the mutual ownership structure of
[02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:22.400]   different insurance companies. To me, this seems like a big deal, because Bogle modeled his fund
[02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:28.160]   company, to the best of my knowledge, on mutually owned insurance companies where there are no
[02:06:28.160 --> 02:06:34.960]   stockholders. That was what he modeled it on. The key is that there are still plenty of great
[02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:40.080]   opportunities in the mutual insurance company space for life insurance and annuities that he
[02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:46.400]   talks about, but he didn't really mention that small detail. One of the most frustrating things
[02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:52.160]   that I'm tired of reading in financial books is the stupid rule number one with investing.
[02:06:52.160 --> 02:06:57.760]   I'm guilty of it myself. I have said this, "Rule number one of investing, don't lose money."
[02:06:57.760 --> 02:07:04.160]   This is the most frustrating advice in the history of... This is the most frustrating advice,
[02:07:04.160 --> 02:07:12.080]   period. Listen to this paragraph from page 44055. He's using this to introduce the masters. This is
[02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:19.280]   chapter 6.0, "Meet the Masters." It says, "All of these financial legends share these four common
[02:07:19.280 --> 02:07:27.520]   obsessions." The first obsession is one, don't lose. "All of these masters, while driven to
[02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:33.600]   deliver extraordinary returns, are even more obsessed with making sure they don't lose money.
[02:07:33.600 --> 02:07:38.160]   Even the world's greatest hedge fund managers, who you'd think would be comfortable taking huge
[02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:44.160]   risks, are actually laser-focused on protecting their downside. From Ray Dalio to Kyle Bass to
[02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:48.720]   Paul Tudor Jones, if you don't lose, you live to fight another day. As Paul Tudor Jones said,
[02:07:48.720 --> 02:07:53.840]   "I care deeply about making money. I want to know I'm not losing it. The most important thing for me
[02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:58.880]   is that defense is 10 times more important than offense. You have to be very focused on the
[02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:04.480]   downside at all times." This statement comes from a guy who's made money for his clients for 28
[02:08:04.480 --> 02:08:10.880]   consecutive years. It's so simple, but I can't emphasize it enough. Why? If you lose 50%,
[02:08:10.880 --> 02:08:17.040]   it takes 100% to get back to where you started. That takes something you can never get back, time.
[02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:28.080]   Warren Buffett's Rule #1 of Investing, "Don't lose money." Rule #2, if you forget Rule #1,
[02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:33.040]   if you lose money, go back and see Rule #1 or whatever it is. That's so frustrating because
[02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:37.200]   you don't know whether you're going to lose money. All you can do is take a calculated bet.
[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:41.680]   Sometimes you'll be right and sometimes you'll be wrong. Do great investors lose money? Absolutely
[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:47.120]   they do. Not a single one of these, and I find that it's not losing money. Now, this paragraph
[02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:55.120]   is the most fair treatment because it talks about protect your downside. I don't have any credentials
[02:08:55.120 --> 02:09:01.200]   whatsoever to talk about what the actual advice that they're giving is and go over it and say how
[02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:07.280]   my idea is better. In my mind, it's useless to say, "Don't lose money." The key is,
[02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:11.440]   how can you make sure that if you do lose money, you're limiting your downside? Because then that
[02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:16.480]   transitions you from a perspective of, "I can't lose money," to a perspective of, "If I do lose
[02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:22.000]   money, how can I protect my downside?" That's actually useful. It also bugs me when people
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:27.360]   talk about this mathematical idea that if you lose 50%, it takes 100% to get back to where you
[02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:33.840]   started. This is absolutely true, but it's absolutely not. There's a whole chart in the
[02:09:33.840 --> 02:09:39.120]   book on this on page 401 with a whole chart of if you lose this percent, how much do you have to
[02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:44.400]   gain in order to break even? If you lose 20% of your portfolio, you have to gain 25% to break
[02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:50.960]   even. If you lose 50%, you have to gain 100% to break even. If you lose 90%, you have to gain 900%
[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:56.160]   to break even. Now, this is mathematically true if you're looking at a period of time.
[02:09:56.160 --> 02:10:01.920]   The problem is that in the real world, is this really how people think? Usually, this one is
[02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:06.800]   trotted out and it's an important mathematical concept, but it's trotted out to say, "You can't
[02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:13.200]   lose money." The question would be, "Do you lose money and you don't have any loss that's ever
[02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:20.400]   going to come back, or do you have a temporary decrease in price while the value of the underlying
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:27.840]   asset has not changed?" Think about this with your house. If I'm wrong, tell me I'm wrong and
[02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:31.520]   prove it to me, but this is just how I thought through this one because I used to be really
[02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:35.120]   flummoxed by it and say, "How does this work?" Think about your house. Let's say your house is
[02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:44.720]   worth $100,000 in 2008, then the house goes down in value by 40%. Now, does there need to be a 67%
[02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:50.080]   increase in the value of the house in order for you to break even? Yes, mathematically, there does
[02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:55.280]   if you're measuring things on a year-over-year basis. If on January 1, 2009, your house is down
[02:10:55.280 --> 02:11:02.560]   by 40%, now to gain back the same value, it's got to go up by 67% on the flip side by January 1,
[02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:11.920]   2010. But that doesn't necessarily mean that it's just this impossibly difficult task.
[02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:19.520]   If your house was already undervalued based upon a larger macroeconomic trend of things going on
[02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:25.600]   in your city and you had gotten it for a good price, the key thing is what did you pay for
[02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:32.320]   and what are the underlying trends? Focus on that. Is the value of the house there and your
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:37.440]   dealing with a temporary fluctuation in price? Because the problem is if you're always thinking
[02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:43.040]   about what's the fluctuation in price and I have to gain 67% back to make up my 40% loss, I don't
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:47.760]   think that serves very well. I think it's better to think of what's the current price and then how
[02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:52.880]   do I limit my risk? Every one of these great investors has lost money. Warren Buffett lost
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:59.680]   a ton of money. What was it? Back in the late '90s when his stock portfolio started just plummeting
[02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:08.160]   as his investment style went out of favor. He lost money. He was worth less money on paper.
[02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:14.080]   Now, did that affect what he actually did? No. Best of all, he didn't do a thing differently
[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:20.480]   because it was only affecting the price. One of the concerns I have with this book is that a lot
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:27.840]   of times the logic seems incomplete to me. Advice is given based upon a system of logic that is not
[02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:32.720]   actually taking into account all of the risks. Now, recognize again, you can't take it... These
[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:37.280]   are, by the way, these are the minor flaws. You can't take into account all of the risk, but
[02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:45.520]   you can leave people with a false sense of security sometimes. So, in the context on page 149,
[02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:52.640]   in the context of money myth number five, which money myth number five is entitled
[02:12:56.880 --> 02:13:04.880]   "Your Retirement is Just a 401k Away," which is essentially blasting away the idea that the 401k
[02:13:04.880 --> 02:13:10.800]   is a great plan that just is working awesome for everybody. Also, now he talks about unconventional
[02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:17.200]   wisdom of spending. So, on page 149, he says, "If you haven't noticed, our government has a
[02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:22.000]   spending problem. Like an out-of-control teenager with a platinum Amex, Uncle Sam has racked up over
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:28.800]   $17.3 trillion in debt and close to $100 trillion in unfunded, not paid for yet, liabilities with
[02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:33.120]   Social Security and Medicare." I think that number is $220 trillion based upon Lawrence
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:38.240]   Kotlikoff's numbers, but we'll go with $100 trillion. "So, do you think taxes will be higher
[02:13:38.240 --> 02:13:42.000]   or lower in the future? Did you know that following the Great Depression, the highest
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:47.840]   income tax bracket was over 90%? The truth is you can tax every wealthy individual and corporation
[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:53.120]   at 100% of its income and profits and still fall way short of the government's promises." And by
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:58.240]   the way, he has a great video on that, which is really, really great. I will post it in the show
[02:13:58.240 --> 02:14:04.960]   notes. "Conventional logic, as most CPAs will attest, is to maximize your 401k or IRA contributions
[02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:09.840]   for tax purposes because each dollar is deductible, which simply means that you don't have to pay tax
[02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:15.120]   on that dollar today, but will defer the tax to a later date. But here's the problem. Nobody knows
[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:20.240]   what tax rates are going to be in the future, and therefore you have no idea how much of your money
[02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:25.280]   will be left over to actually spend." Next page, he goes on and says, "If we pay taxes now,
[02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:32.560]   then whatever the harvest time is in the future, we'll be able to spend that tax-free." So, he's
[02:14:32.560 --> 02:14:38.160]   talking about this in the context of, "Okay, you need to go with an IRA because taxes are going to
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:45.040]   go up." The problem is the same risk exists that is going to make taxes go up, the same risk exists
[02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:51.840]   with IRAs. On page 154, he says, "Should I convert my traditional IRA to a Roth IRA?"
[02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:57.600]   And says, "Some people cringe at the idea of paying tax today because they view it as their
[02:14:57.600 --> 02:15:02.960]   money. It's not. It's the government's. By paying the tax today, you are giving Uncle Sam his money
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:07.760]   back earlier, and by doing so, you're protecting yourself and your nest egg from taxes being higher
[02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:12.400]   in the future. If you don't think taxes will be higher, you shouldn't convert. You have to decide,
[02:15:12.400 --> 02:15:16.960]   but all the evidence points to the hard fact that Washington will need more tax revenue,
[02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:20.480]   and the biggest well to dip into is the trillions in retirement accounts."
[02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:26.720]   The reason I read that is because specifically what he's trying to address is tax risk,
[02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:34.480]   and I'm not convinced that his solution makes a big difference. Now, I would probably, if I,
[02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:41.760]   I would probably, I do think that the Roth accounts are a more valuable tool, and I think
[02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:49.520]   it would be more difficult for the rules to change on Roth accounts versus generalized accounts,
[02:15:49.520 --> 02:15:55.600]   but the tax risk still exists with Roth accounts. And maybe this is just me, maybe I'm being too
[02:15:55.600 --> 02:15:59.920]   nitpicky, but I really would love it if people would talk about that. Later in the book, and
[02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:03.440]   the reason why I'm focusing on this, usually if it were just here, I wouldn't bring it up,
[02:16:03.440 --> 02:16:07.680]   but later in the book, he has two specific sections on life insurance, cash value life
[02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:14.080]   insurance being as an investment product, and annuity products, specifically fixed index annuities,
[02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:19.360]   and he makes a big deal out of the fact that the inside buildup of cash value and life insurance
[02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:24.240]   is protected from tax. He also makes a big deal about the taxation of annuities.
[02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:34.000]   Those products face exactly the same problem of taxation changes. These are all, so he's
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:38.720]   keyed in, the same problem he's keyed in on with 401ks exists with those things. I'll use life
[02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:43.600]   insurance as an example. At the moment, as you have cash values that grow and accumulate inside
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:48.480]   of a life, inside of a cash value life insurance policy, so this would be a whole life policy,
[02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:55.920]   a universal life insurance policy, or variations thereof, that growth of those cash values is not
[02:16:55.920 --> 02:17:00.800]   currently subject to income tax as long as it stays inside of the life insurance policy.
[02:17:01.920 --> 02:17:07.920]   When you take it out, if you don't take it out in the form of a loan, once you take out more than
[02:17:07.920 --> 02:17:11.360]   your basis, more than the money you've put into it, it will be taxed. If you take it out in the
[02:17:11.360 --> 02:17:16.800]   form of a loan, it's not taxed currently. The problem is this is a tax expenditure,
[02:17:16.800 --> 02:17:19.680]   what the government calls a tax expenditure, and there are lists of these things.
[02:17:19.680 --> 02:17:25.200]   When I was in the life insurance business, every year, I would go to a company conference and
[02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:29.280]   hear what the lobbyists are doing. You go to the industry conferences, and there's a whole team of
[02:17:29.280 --> 02:17:36.080]   lobbyists. Their job is to make sure that the expenditures, the so-called tax expenditure,
[02:17:36.080 --> 02:17:42.640]   for the buildup of cash value for life insurance policies stays exempt from the law. This is a big
[02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:47.840]   deal to insurance companies because it's a major advantage that they have. But it's not just that.
[02:17:47.840 --> 02:17:53.760]   There are many so-called tax expenditures. Quick political rant. Does it drive you a little nuts
[02:17:53.760 --> 02:17:57.680]   when they say, "Okay, we're going to give you a so-called tax break, so we're going to call that
[02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:01.840]   a tax expenditure, that we're spending the tax money"? The language is all twisted. Anyway.
[02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:06.400]   What's the biggest one? Exclusion of employer contributions for medical insurance, premiums,
[02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:11.520]   and medical care. Net exclusion of pension contributions and earnings. The deductibility
[02:18:11.520 --> 02:18:16.320]   of mortgage interest on owner-occupied homes is a tax exclusion. Accelerated depreciation of
[02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:22.160]   machinery and equipment is a tax expenditure. There are others as well. Deductibility of
[02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:27.280]   charitable contributions. Capital gains exclusions on home sales. All of these things are tax
[02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:32.720]   expenditures and all of them can change. I might be making a bit of a mountain out of a molehill
[02:18:32.720 --> 02:18:37.200]   here, but my point is that if you're concerned about tax risk, I'm not sure that moving the
[02:18:37.200 --> 02:18:44.080]   money from a traditional 401(k) to a Roth 401(k) fixes that. It still doesn't solve the tax risk.
[02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:49.200]   The logic here is that you're trying to say, "How do we protect from tax risk?" I'm saying
[02:18:49.200 --> 02:18:54.160]   it doesn't really protect all that much. Maybe a little bit, but not all that much.
[02:18:55.200 --> 02:19:00.800]   I was encouraged that Robbins would think outside the box. In Myth 7, he talks about annuities.
[02:19:00.800 --> 02:19:06.800]   I always thought annuities just were terrible, but now I understand that they're not.
[02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:12.480]   The problem is that he quickly draws polarizing benefits and he goes and he lambasts variable
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:17.840]   annuities. Now, I would help him with the vast majority of variable annuity products that I've
[02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:24.000]   reviewed as far as their internal fees, but I wouldn't help him on this comprehensive statement.
[02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:31.440]   That's an issue for me. There's a lot of internal conflict in the book between these scenarios,
[02:19:31.440 --> 02:19:36.080]   depending on where he talks about expenses and says, "We've got to tear these apart," and where
[02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:39.920]   he says, "These are just some expenses and they're not that big a deal." I'm going to boogie past,
[02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:45.280]   actually. I feel like this is dragging with my minor flaws. Let me get to the major flaws.
[02:19:45.280 --> 02:19:48.560]   One of my major concerns is that there is some financial
[02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:53.840]   sleight of hand that I don't think you'd see if you weren't paying attention.
[02:19:54.560 --> 02:20:00.320]   I don't like how—I am guilty of this. I have done this. It's all a matter of framing,
[02:20:00.320 --> 02:20:04.880]   where you're trying to frame certain things and try to make comparisons. When you make
[02:20:04.880 --> 02:20:12.160]   an invalid comparison, I think it destroys your argument. Let me give you one of the ones that I
[02:20:12.160 --> 02:20:18.720]   think is completely egregious. Page 421, he is talking about how to create a certain amount of
[02:20:18.720 --> 02:20:24.000]   income. This section is entitled, and he's comparing using an annuity strategy versus
[02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:30.480]   other investment options. The title of this section is called 2,750% More Income. He gives
[02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:36.240]   three bullet points. He's talking about a client who has a certain amount of money, has $500,000.
[02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:42.160]   He has three options to create income. Number one, he could go to a bank and a CD would pay him
[02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:49.120]   0.23%, or 23 basis points per year. This arrangement would give him $95.80 per month
[02:20:49.120 --> 02:20:57.120]   and a fully taxable income for a $500,000 deposit. That's a whopping $1,149 a year before taxes.
[02:20:57.120 --> 02:21:02.160]   Don't spend it all in one place. Number two, bonds would pay him closer to 3% a year,
[02:21:02.160 --> 02:21:07.840]   or about $15,000 a year before taxes. But the risk that option would entail would be if interest
[02:21:07.840 --> 02:21:13.120]   rates rise. This would cause the value of his bonds, his principal, to shrink. Number three,
[02:21:13.120 --> 02:21:18.560]   Josh, which is Tony Robbins' son, showed him that a $500,000 deposit into an immediate lifetime
[02:21:18.560 --> 02:21:28.560]   income annuity as of today would pay him $2,725 per month, or $32,700 per year, guaranteed for life.
[02:21:29.680 --> 02:21:38.480]   That's a 2,750% increase over CDs and a 118% increase over bonds without their risk.
[02:21:38.480 --> 02:21:44.640]   Now, do you see the flaws in this comparison? The biggest one is that you have a complete
[02:21:44.640 --> 02:21:49.440]   apples and oranges comparison. The annuity gets rid of the $500,000 of principal,
[02:21:49.440 --> 02:21:56.320]   and the CD and the bonds do not. For examples one and two, he's living off of the income
[02:21:56.320 --> 02:22:02.160]   without invading principal. And with option three, the reason why the difference is there
[02:22:02.160 --> 02:22:11.360]   is because he's spending the $500,000 principal. That's it. Now, should he spend the principal?
[02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:17.200]   He may or he may not, but you cannot use those things. That's utterly dishonest. It's either
[02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:24.000]   dishonest or a total mistake. But that's a completely invalid comparison. What I would
[02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:28.800]   say is, well, he could do nothing. He could take the $500,000, he could decide he's going to spend
[02:22:28.800 --> 02:22:34.960]   it over 20 years, and he could take $25,000 off every single year. That's what he's done
[02:22:34.960 --> 02:22:43.440]   with the annuity. To me, that's unconscionable. That should not exist. That is not a valid
[02:22:43.440 --> 02:22:49.840]   comparison, especially when being used to sell an annuity. I think annuities can be really useful,
[02:22:50.560 --> 02:22:56.880]   but that is not a valid comparison. So that one probably bothered me more than most of the other
[02:22:56.880 --> 02:23:00.400]   ones. The other things about that that bothers me, check out these little things. Number one,
[02:23:00.400 --> 02:23:07.280]   those aren't his only options. He could buy an index fund from Jack Bogle. He could put together
[02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:13.120]   a portfolio based upon Dalio's all-seasons portfolio that Robbins goes through. Now, I get
[02:23:13.120 --> 02:23:18.320]   that he spent a whole book. He can't list all of these examples, but that is not a valid comparison
[02:23:18.320 --> 02:23:26.240]   whatsoever to compare only getting 23 basis points of interest on a CD versus buying an immediate
[02:23:26.240 --> 02:23:32.480]   income annuity. He may only be getting, I don't know, 300 basis points on the annuity. Who knows?
[02:23:32.480 --> 02:23:38.800]   We can't know without knowing his age. Okay, 65. So I could figure that out, but I didn't do it in
[02:23:38.800 --> 02:23:45.120]   preparation for the show. So point being, not a valid comparison. The other issue is as far as
[02:23:45.120 --> 02:23:50.640]   taxes. So Robbins makes some serious mistakes in here in taxes. So in that first part, this
[02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:58.320]   arrangement would give him $95.80 per month in fully taxable income for a $500,000 deposit.
[02:23:58.320 --> 02:24:04.960]   Then in the next part about the annuity, there's a footnote that says about the taxable amount of
[02:24:04.960 --> 02:24:09.920]   the annuity. "The effective tax on income from immediate annuities is dependent on what the IRS
[02:24:09.920 --> 02:24:14.480]   calls the exclusion ratio. A portion of your income payments are deemed a return of your
[02:24:14.480 --> 02:24:21.120]   principal and thus excluded from tax. The taxation from an annuity and a CD are identical. All of the
[02:24:21.120 --> 02:24:26.800]   income from the annuity is taxable income to him, and all of the basis is not taxable income." And
[02:24:26.800 --> 02:24:31.920]   it's the same thing with the CD. It's just that with the CD, the only thing that he's being
[02:24:31.920 --> 02:24:37.680]   reported because he's not invading principal with the CD is the interest income. So by talking about
[02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:42.640]   the fully taxable income, it's talking as though there's some difference. There is no difference.
[02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:46.320]   They're taxed exactly the same just with annuities we call them exclusion ratios.
[02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:55.120]   This taxation issue is throughout the whole... it's everywhere. Page 427, one more very cool
[02:24:55.120 --> 02:25:00.400]   thing. "The IRS looks very favorably on these deferred income annuities, so you don't have to
[02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:04.880]   pay tax on the entire income payment because a good chunk of the payment is considered a return
[02:25:04.880 --> 02:25:11.040]   of your original deposit." So A, it's nothing special about these deferred income annuities.
[02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:16.240]   That's all annuities. They're all taxed identically. You have what's called an exclusion ratio,
[02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:20.560]   which is the basis that you have in the contract, the amount that you put in,
[02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:25.760]   is returned to you with no tax. And then the growth on it is returned to you as tax.
[02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:31.600]   It's the same. And the thing is, the tax principle is the same as every investment.
[02:25:31.600 --> 02:25:39.520]   If you buy an investment house for $200,000 and you sell it for $225,000, guess what? A portion
[02:25:39.520 --> 02:25:45.760]   of that is returned to you without tax because it's deemed to be a return of your original deposit.
[02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:51.840]   That's the tax principle. So there's tax issues all throughout it. I also don't like how Robbins
[02:25:51.840 --> 02:25:59.040]   frames fees and things differently depending on the context. On page 439, when answering some
[02:25:59.040 --> 02:26:05.120]   frequently asked questions on annuity fees, after an entire chapter up front tearing apart actively
[02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:10.960]   managed mutual funds for their "egregious" fees, quote-unquote, he didn't use the word "egregious."
[02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:15.920]   It was characterized as being egregious. He says, "However, if you select the guaranteed
[02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:21.920]   lifetime income, the annual fee for this ranges between 0.75% and 1.25% annually,
[02:26:21.920 --> 02:26:27.520]   depending on each company's individual offerings." Now, I recognize this is at the end of an FAQ
[02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:33.760]   section, but this is the whole issue that many of us have with fixed index annuities is the fees.
[02:26:33.760 --> 02:26:38.400]   And so he spends the whole first part of the book tearing apart fees and then just tax it in,
[02:26:38.400 --> 02:26:47.520]   "Oh, it's no big deal, just 0.75% to 1.25%. That one really bugs me. But I could forgive that if
[02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:55.360]   it weren't other ones. Here's the big one that in my mind I think is really, really bad. Page 445
[02:26:55.360 --> 02:27:01.360]   is talking about tax-free compounding. And this one is coming in the context not of an annuity
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:05.520]   discussion, but actually in the context of life insurance. And I was glad to see this in here
[02:27:05.520 --> 02:27:09.920]   because life insurance often gets short shrift in financial planning discussions because people
[02:27:09.920 --> 02:27:16.160]   don't understand it, they don't get it, it just gets, it's not often accurately presented. But
[02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:20.640]   here's the section here, and let me read this to you. "Tax-free compounding, illustrating the
[02:27:20.640 --> 02:27:26.320]   benefits of life insurance. Compounded over time, the advantage of private placement life insurance
[02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:31.040]   is astounding. Let's look at an example of how the identical investment compares when wrapped
[02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:36.000]   inside of private placement life insurance versus taking the standard approach of paying tax each
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:42.720]   year. Let's take a healthy male, age 45, and assume he makes four annual deposits of $250,000
[02:27:42.720 --> 02:27:50.480]   for a total contribution of $1 million over four years. If he makes a 10% return and has to pay
[02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:57.040]   tax each and every year, after 40 years his total account balance will be $7 million." Not bad,
[02:27:57.040 --> 02:28:02.400]   right? "But if he wraps the investment within private placement life insurance and pays a
[02:28:02.400 --> 02:28:08.960]   relatively small amount for the cost of insurance, his ending balance or cash value is just over
[02:28:08.960 --> 02:28:16.400]   $30 million. Same investment strategy, but he is left with more than four times or 400% as much
[02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:23.920]   money for him and his family simply by using the tax code to his advantage." Please note that there
[02:28:23.920 --> 02:28:26.560]   are very strict rules around the investment management, it's supposed to be done by a third
[02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:31.280]   party investment professional, not the policy owner. By the way, this same powerful advantage
[02:28:31.280 --> 02:28:37.760]   applies even to smaller investment amounts. This is compounding without taxes. But then I wanted
[02:28:37.760 --> 02:28:40.880]   to know, what about when I want to access my money? So it goes into how to take money out of
[02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:45.840]   a life insurance policy. So I don't know about you, but that math just strikes me as a little
[02:28:45.840 --> 02:28:50.320]   bit strange. So we're going to deal with a 10% return and we're going to talk about the difference
[02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:57.120]   between $7 million and $30 million. So I went and calculated the returns. And let me first,
[02:28:57.120 --> 02:29:02.320]   I want to teach you how to do this, because this is important. Don't let people throw numbers at
[02:29:02.320 --> 02:29:06.240]   you without the ability to sit down and run your calculator and figure this out. So what I wanted
[02:29:06.240 --> 02:29:11.040]   to do is figure out the rate of return. This is a more complicated rate of return to figure out
[02:29:11.040 --> 02:29:16.800]   because of the little twist that the healthy male age 45, assuming he makes four annual deposits
[02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:22.960]   of $250,000 for a total contribution of $1 million over four years. By the way, the reason there has
[02:29:22.960 --> 02:29:27.840]   to be four instead of he can just simply say he invests a million dollars is because you need to
[02:29:27.840 --> 02:29:35.120]   get the life insurance policy to not be a modified endowment contract, which is its own complicated
[02:29:35.120 --> 02:29:39.440]   set of rules. But that's why this is written that way and why he didn't just say we need to put in
[02:29:39.440 --> 02:29:43.440]   a million dollars and run the math on that. But if he had said put in a million dollars,
[02:29:43.440 --> 02:29:48.320]   that would be simple. So the first thing you can do is run the numbers on this to say, okay,
[02:29:48.320 --> 02:29:54.800]   I've got a million dollars and I make a 10% return for 40 years and figure out how we get to the $7
[02:29:54.800 --> 02:30:00.000]   million number. So keep this very simple and don't do it technically correct. Do it the simple way
[02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:04.160]   that you should be able to do. If you've listened to any, if you know how to run it, this is the
[02:30:04.160 --> 02:30:12.400]   basics of a time value calculation of money. Very simple. So clear your calculator, put in 40 as the
[02:30:12.400 --> 02:30:17.280]   end, put in $1 million, change the sign to a negative. So you're going to put a negative $1
[02:30:17.280 --> 02:30:24.480]   million for your present value, put in zero for your payments, and then put in $7 million, keep
[02:30:24.480 --> 02:30:30.720]   it as positive now as future value and solve for the interest. So if you solve for the interest
[02:30:30.720 --> 02:30:38.000]   and you do that simple calculation, you will get 4.98% interest. So that gives you, now this isn't
[02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:44.800]   exactly what the calculation said, but it'll give you 4.98%. Then if you want to compare that to the
[02:30:44.800 --> 02:30:51.360]   $30 million, put in the $30 million number and put that in as your future value and then solve again
[02:30:51.360 --> 02:30:57.040]   for the interest. So now with your ending value being $30 million, the same time period, what is
[02:30:57.040 --> 02:31:04.080]   your investment rate of return? And the answer is 8.875%. So that should make your eyebrows raise.
[02:31:04.640 --> 02:31:10.960]   The difference between 4.95% and 8.875%, that's a big deal. That's all you need to know to know
[02:31:10.960 --> 02:31:14.560]   you've got a major problem with this math. And I'll explain the problem in just a second.
[02:31:14.560 --> 02:31:19.840]   But what you can actually do is, let me teach you how to do this accurately. Instead of using the
[02:31:19.840 --> 02:31:28.880]   NIPV payment and future value function, you're going to use the cash flow function. And so I use
[02:31:28.880 --> 02:31:35.520]   an HP 12C. What you're going to punch in with the cash flow function is you're going to punch in
[02:31:35.520 --> 02:31:46.320]   this four-year scenario. This is too complicated for me to teach it this way. I'll skip the
[02:31:46.320 --> 02:31:52.000]   keystrokes except to say you're going to use the little CFO and the little CFJ function.
[02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:57.280]   And then you're going to use the internal rate of return calculation function. So what you do is
[02:31:57.280 --> 02:32:03.120]   you put in zero for your starting cash flow of zero. Then you put in the four years of payments
[02:32:03.120 --> 02:32:10.960]   of $250,000 as a cash flow into the portfolio. Then put in 40 years of no cash flows into the
[02:32:10.960 --> 02:32:17.600]   portfolio. And then put in the ending cash flow out of the portfolio. And then solve for your
[02:32:17.600 --> 02:32:22.160]   internal rate of return. If you'll do that, what you find is that the internal rate of return on
[02:32:22.160 --> 02:32:28.960]   the $7 million number is 4.68%. And the internal rate of return on the $30 million number is 8.32%.
[02:32:28.960 --> 02:32:36.640]   That's a big difference. Who in their right mind pays that amount in tax on an investment
[02:32:36.640 --> 02:32:42.560]   portfolio? And so my issue with this is having sold life insurance and understanding life
[02:32:42.560 --> 02:32:46.960]   insurance and seeing the value of life insurance, the thing that drives me nuts is when people
[02:32:46.960 --> 02:32:52.480]   oversell life insurance. That is not the scenario that you can face. Man, if you're paying that kind
[02:32:52.480 --> 02:32:58.800]   of tax, especially after three whole chapters on the tax efficiency of index funds and the tax
[02:32:58.800 --> 02:33:04.720]   efficiency of long-term capital gains taxes, for crying out loud, go find a new financial planner.
[02:33:04.720 --> 02:33:09.760]   No one is paying that much tax on investments. Maybe they're paying that much tax on income,
[02:33:09.760 --> 02:33:16.080]   but not on investments. So that kind of basically almost a doubling from 4.68% to 8.32%,
[02:33:16.640 --> 02:33:22.880]   almost double. You're saying you're paying a 50% tax rate on investments when your dividends and
[02:33:22.880 --> 02:33:28.960]   capital gains rate taxes are 15% and 20%. It's just not a valid comparison in any way. But that's
[02:33:28.960 --> 02:33:32.640]   being used to make the point to say you should be doing everything within the context of life
[02:33:32.640 --> 02:33:38.880]   insurance. Life insurance has its place. That's not an accurate assessment. Had a managing director
[02:33:38.880 --> 02:33:44.880]   that used to say to me, "It's good enough without overselling it. Don't oversell it." So that's a
[02:33:44.880 --> 02:33:52.560]   problem. That's a real problem for me. And the average person is not going to see that. And so
[02:33:52.560 --> 02:33:58.640]   you're misinforming people. And I think we've got to be careful with that. And especially it's up to
[02:33:58.640 --> 02:34:06.480]   us in the financial planning community to do... It's up to us to accurately discuss this stuff.
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:14.160]   It really is. The tax treatment in this book was really a weak point. Page 244, last example here,
[02:34:14.160 --> 02:34:20.000]   is talking about a lady he knows named Angela who is having income and is saying
[02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:25.520]   she has an income amount. The amount she accumulates because she's going to use
[02:34:25.520 --> 02:34:32.800]   an investment account that using real estate and investing in senior housing that's paying a 7%
[02:34:32.800 --> 02:34:37.040]   income and dividend payment. The amount she accumulates will generate $16,000 of income,
[02:34:37.040 --> 02:34:42.000]   assuming a 7% income payment. And she won't have to tap into her principal unless she wants to.
[02:34:42.560 --> 02:34:46.800]   One last huge benefit, Angela doesn't have to pay income tax on the entire income payment due
[02:34:46.800 --> 02:34:52.800]   to the tax deductions for depreciation. So this is just an example. And this one, again, if it
[02:34:52.800 --> 02:34:57.440]   weren't for that one that I just went over, I would probably skip criticizing the tax stuff.
[02:34:57.440 --> 02:35:04.480]   But this is a big deal on real estate. When you depreciate the property, you will pay the tax
[02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:16.000]   when you sell, unless you roll the property over into another property using a like-kind exchange
[02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:22.880]   and avoid it through another mechanism such as a step-up and basis of death. And that's a deal for
[02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:28.640]   another show. But the point is, real estate doesn't magically give you tax-free money.
[02:35:28.640 --> 02:35:33.200]   You have a loss called depreciation on the value of your property that you do. Now,
[02:35:33.200 --> 02:35:37.440]   real estate does, is beneficial. Again, I would skip that one if it weren't for the other stuff.
[02:35:37.440 --> 02:35:47.680]   So that's a major issue I have. My bet is that Robinson is using examples. But he's a smart guy.
[02:35:47.680 --> 02:35:52.960]   Is that sleight of hand or is that, I don't know. I wrote several times in the margin,
[02:35:52.960 --> 02:35:58.400]   that's a little bit loose with the numbers. Another concern I have is that in the language
[02:35:58.400 --> 02:36:02.000]   that he says in the book, and you'll often see this, and this is what we do in the investment
[02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:09.520]   business, is you talk about, we change language when it's convenient for the point that we're
[02:36:09.520 --> 02:36:13.840]   making. I'm guilty of this. I do this myself. But the problem is in a book, we shouldn't be
[02:36:13.840 --> 02:36:21.200]   doing this when we're teaching people about this. Example here, page 435 in the context of annuities.
[02:36:21.200 --> 02:36:26.080]   Listen to this language. We're getting the upside without the downside because it's all about fixed
[02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:31.120]   index annuities. Well, the insurance, how do we, so the upside without the downside. You participate
[02:36:31.120 --> 02:36:36.960]   in 100% of the stock market index growth. That's right. 100% of the upside with no downside,
[02:36:36.960 --> 02:36:41.600]   no chance of loss, and no cap on your winnings. The insurance company simply shares in your
[02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:50.560]   profits by taking a small spread ranging between 1.25% to 1.75%. If the market is up 10% and it
[02:36:50.560 --> 02:36:57.040]   keeps 1.5%, you get 8.5% credited to your account value. Now, in fairness, I'm going to read the
[02:36:57.040 --> 02:37:01.680]   next sentence. Conversely, if the market is down on a given year, the insurance company does not
[02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:07.520]   keep anything and you don't lose a dime or pay any fees. You pay the spread only if you make money.
[02:37:07.520 --> 02:37:10.960]   That second part I read is important because that would be the point Robbins would make probably if
[02:37:10.960 --> 02:37:15.840]   I were questioning him directly. But here's the issue. If he hadn't started with a whole bunch of
[02:37:15.840 --> 02:37:21.440]   chapters on how active mutual fund management is a scourge of the earth, I would probably be more
[02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:26.640]   receptive. But when you just start with that and try to rip apart the investment industry,
[02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:32.240]   and then suss in, "Well, the company keeps a small spread on your money ranging between 1.25% to 1.75%,
[02:37:32.240 --> 02:37:39.120]   he devoted entire chapters to telling me how that was a massive spread, and it is. He's right,
[02:37:39.120 --> 02:37:45.680]   which is why I don't at the moment like this annuity product at all because of that small
[02:37:45.680 --> 02:37:50.800]   spread. I would rather put that small spread back in your pocket." Now, if the market is down,
[02:37:50.800 --> 02:37:55.200]   the rebuttal to that argument would be, "If the market is down on a given year,
[02:37:55.200 --> 02:37:59.040]   the insurance company doesn't keep anything, and you don't lose a dime or pay any fees,
[02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:03.040]   you pay the spread only if you make money." So the argument is that, well, you're actually getting a
[02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:08.320]   service. I think it's a bogus argument, but it does have its place in some scenarios.
[02:38:08.320 --> 02:38:15.600]   So I don't like how the language is changed to prove a point. Another example here, page 447,
[02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:21.520]   in the context of talking about life insurance, he starts by talking about private placement life
[02:38:21.520 --> 02:38:28.480]   insurance, which are policies that are sold to qualified investors who basically have some unique
[02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:33.680]   investment opportunities wrapped up in a life insurance wrapper. So on page 447,
[02:38:33.680 --> 02:38:41.280]   in order to access PPLI, you must be what's called an accredited investor, and the typical minimum
[02:38:41.280 --> 02:38:48.160]   annual deposits are $250,000 for a minimum of four years. True. However, there is a version
[02:38:49.040 --> 02:38:53.920]   of PPLI that is now available to non-accredited investors with as little as a few thousand to
[02:38:53.920 --> 02:39:00.560]   invest. Unless I don't have a clue what I'm talking about, there's no version of PPLI.
[02:39:00.560 --> 02:39:07.600]   It's just called life insurance. Private placement life insurance is a version of life insurance.
[02:39:07.600 --> 02:39:12.240]   There's no subversion of private placement life insurance that has now been magically
[02:39:12.240 --> 02:39:17.120]   made available to non-accredited investors. It's just life insurance. Call it what it is. Don't
[02:39:17.120 --> 02:39:21.840]   dance around it. It's a life insurance policy. It's a whole life insurance policy, but it's well
[02:39:21.840 --> 02:39:30.000]   designed. It has good fees. That's what makes it great and what makes it different. So to me,
[02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:34.880]   that's a big deal. And then other places in here, there's logical fallacies such as the argument
[02:39:34.880 --> 02:39:42.240]   from the extreme. On page 297, he's talking about diversification. And the two best examples of
[02:39:43.280 --> 02:39:53.360]   reasons to diversify, I'm going to skip that one. We're already two and a half hours and I have one
[02:39:53.360 --> 02:39:59.120]   I know is going to be long because I'm going to explain to you a lot of context on it. I wish also
[02:39:59.120 --> 02:40:04.160]   that authors when they're writing books would explain some of the history and evolution of the
[02:40:04.160 --> 02:40:12.800]   investment business. It's really a problem when people don't accurately explain the evolution
[02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:17.760]   and the growth of the investment business. In the beginning, he spends quite a few pages talking
[02:40:17.760 --> 02:40:24.160]   about investing and talking about active management and passive management and the growth of it over
[02:40:24.160 --> 02:40:33.840]   time. And the issue is that there's no even nod given to the historical context of how index funds
[02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:42.080]   and index fund strategies came around. Active funds make index funds possible. The fact that
[02:40:42.080 --> 02:40:47.520]   we have a generally efficient market and we have lots of investors chasing returns, that's what
[02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:51.280]   makes index funds possible. Now, I love index funds. I think they're an awesome investment.
[02:40:51.280 --> 02:41:00.160]   But at the time, mutual funds were an amazing innovation. And a lot of people, a lot of
[02:41:00.160 --> 02:41:06.640]   investors through mutual funds have become very wealthy by investing through mutual funds. And
[02:41:06.640 --> 02:41:12.080]   they serve, in my opinion, they serve the public incredibly well because they allow the public to
[02:41:12.080 --> 02:41:18.240]   get access to a low cost, fully diversified portfolio with a professional investment manager.
[02:41:18.240 --> 02:41:25.760]   That's the historical context. Now, in that historical context, out of that came the growth
[02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:35.520]   of the passive index fund idea. I mean, index funds didn't exist until Jack Bogle launched
[02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:42.240]   Vanguard in 1974. Mutual funds are governed and they existed before this, but they're governed
[02:41:42.240 --> 02:41:49.040]   by the Investment Company Act of 1934. So there's a major growth that happened over time of that
[02:41:49.040 --> 02:41:54.720]   history. And there's an ongoing struggle in the book is this struggle between active and passive
[02:41:54.720 --> 02:42:00.320]   investing. And it's a struggle in the book because it's a struggle in real life. But I'm not sure
[02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:05.120]   that it's dealt with very well in the book. I haven't found a book that I felt was dealt with
[02:42:05.120 --> 02:42:11.600]   it effectively. Usually it's very, the books are very polarized instead of including the advantages
[02:42:11.600 --> 02:42:19.600]   of both of them. So that's just one of the things I wish authors like him would do, would be to talk
[02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:23.600]   a little bit about the history and evolution of the investment business. Now, we live in a very
[02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:31.760]   different world in 2014 than we did in, you know, than existed in 1984. And the market has responded
[02:42:31.760 --> 02:42:36.880]   to that. Vanguard is doing amazingly well, has more market share than, I mean, it's just, it's
[02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:42.720]   incredible. So the market has responded to that. But I just wish some focus, some attention were
[02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:48.800]   given to the history a little bit. There's a lot of little statements tossed in through the book
[02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:54.400]   that have a lot of emotional appeal, but they don't have any grounding in fact, or if they do,
[02:42:54.400 --> 02:43:02.320]   they're not cited. And that bothers me because they're strong statements. And if they're not
[02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:08.960]   proven, then I need to know. Example from page 85, "Money Power Principle One, Don't get in the
[02:43:08.960 --> 02:43:14.800]   game unless you know the rules. Millions of investors worldwide are systematically marketed
[02:43:14.800 --> 02:43:21.840]   a set of myths, investment lies that guide their decision-making. This quote, conventional wisdom
[02:43:22.560 --> 02:43:29.360]   is often designed to keep you in the dark. When it comes to your money, what you don't know can
[02:43:29.360 --> 02:43:36.000]   and likely will hurt you. Ignorance is not bliss. Ignorance is pain. Ignorance is struggle.
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:39.360]   Ignorance is giving your fortune away to someone who hasn't earned it.
[02:43:39.360 --> 02:43:44.480]   If conventional wisdom is designed to keep me in the dark, I need to know about that."
[02:43:44.480 --> 02:43:52.160]   So, I assume what he's referring to here is to the nine myths, but I don't see any design in that,
[02:43:52.160 --> 02:43:57.200]   and that's just, that's troublesome to me because if that's the case, I want some, I need to know
[02:43:57.200 --> 02:44:02.400]   that because I'm talking to a lot of people on the show, so I need to be able to know that so I can
[02:44:02.400 --> 02:44:09.920]   warn you. There are others as well, but that's enough for now. One of the issues also that I
[02:44:09.920 --> 02:44:17.760]   have is oftentimes there are numbers in here that are misused or miscited, and the context of
[02:44:17.760 --> 02:44:26.960]   different numbers is, it bothers me. Page 94, he quotes, he says, "There are 7,707 different mutual
[02:44:26.960 --> 02:44:32.640]   funds in the United States, but only 4,900 individual stocks, all vying for a chance to
[02:44:32.640 --> 02:44:38.640]   help you beat the market." This is in the context of basically trying to say that 96% of active
[02:44:38.640 --> 02:44:44.560]   managers fail to beat the market, which I think is true. But the problem is that that's a little
[02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:50.000]   bit misleading. So I went to check those numbers, and I said, "Okay, there's 7,707 different mutual
[02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:54.160]   funds." So I went and looked up and tried to figure out, well, let's fact check this and see
[02:44:54.160 --> 02:44:58.800]   how many mutual funds there are. I had actually recently fact-checked this for another project,
[02:44:58.800 --> 02:45:04.160]   so I knew right where to go. And you can pull open, and I'll link to it in the show notes,
[02:45:04.160 --> 02:45:09.120]   the Investment Company Institute, which is one of the industry organizations for the investment
[02:45:09.120 --> 02:45:14.640]   world. So go to the Investment Company Institute fact book, and you can find the most recent one.
[02:45:14.640 --> 02:45:22.160]   The 2014 Investment Company Fact Book lists the number of investment companies by type.
[02:45:22.160 --> 02:45:30.880]   And so here in 2013, you can read that there were 8,000, so this is entitled, the chart is
[02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:35.120]   entitled, "Number of Investment Companies by Type." And this is actually an important distinction,
[02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:40.240]   which I'll get to in a minute. So first, Robin's statement is there are 7,707 different mutual
[02:45:40.240 --> 02:45:45.360]   funds in the United States, but only 4,900 individual stocks, all vying for a chance to
[02:45:45.360 --> 02:45:53.920]   help you beat the market. In 2013, there were 8,974 total open-end mutual funds. Open-end
[02:45:53.920 --> 02:45:57.520]   investment companies is technically what they would be called. We commonly refer to them as
[02:45:57.520 --> 02:46:03.600]   mutual funds, but they're open-ended investment companies. So I don't know where he got his 7,707
[02:46:03.600 --> 02:46:07.520]   number, because it doesn't line up with what I was able to find, and there's no bibliography,
[02:46:07.520 --> 02:46:12.640]   so I couldn't find that. But more importantly, there are more investment companies than that.
[02:46:12.640 --> 02:46:21.360]   There are 599 closed-end funds. There are 1,332 exchange-traded funds, and there were 5,552
[02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:30.000]   unit investment trusts for a total of 16,457 different investment companies. So that's one
[02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:35.360]   thing. But the other thing is the comparison to 4,900 individual stocks. Now, it is true,
[02:46:35.360 --> 02:46:41.440]   there are only about 5,000 individual stocks that are listed on the U.S. stock market. But what we
[02:46:41.440 --> 02:46:47.840]   don't know is how many of these funds are stock funds and how many are bond funds. And when you
[02:46:47.840 --> 02:46:54.640]   compare the size of the bond market to the size of the stock market, there is a massive, massive
[02:46:54.640 --> 02:47:02.560]   difference. Massive difference. There are 20 times more... Just stick with municipal bonds.
[02:47:02.560 --> 02:47:11.040]   There are 20 times as many municipal bond issuers as there are companies, stocks. There are about
[02:47:11.040 --> 02:47:16.080]   100,000 municipal bond issuers in the United States of America, and there are over 2 million
[02:47:16.080 --> 02:47:22.880]   different municipal bond securities. So you can see... Sorry about that, my dog again. You can
[02:47:22.880 --> 02:47:27.600]   see that in the context, when you actually compare it to $2 million, there's a big difference here.
[02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:34.560]   Excuse me, not $2 million. Two million bond individual municipal securities, that makes a
[02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:39.440]   big difference. Now, what's the actual number? I don't know. But I do know that I don't trust that
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:47.760]   comparison to try to set the idea that I don't trust that comparison. Is it wrong? It's not
[02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:52.880]   necessarily wrong. I don't like it. One of the ones that I also had an issue with that...
[02:47:52.880 --> 02:47:57.920]   And I just wish people would tighten up their books when they write about stuff like this. I
[02:47:57.920 --> 02:48:02.800]   know that they're writing for a lay audience, but anyway, this is my review of it. One of the
[02:48:02.800 --> 02:48:09.120]   things that I have an issue with is also some statements. So Robbins repeats this study
[02:48:09.120 --> 02:48:14.880]   throughout the book. He says, and I'll cite it from page 127, this paragraph here. The paragraph
[02:48:14.880 --> 02:48:20.720]   is entitled, "Not all advice is good advice." And we're about to go into this fiduciary versus
[02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:25.200]   suitability thing in a minute. "Aligning yourself with a fiduciary is, by all accounts, a great
[02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:29.680]   place to start. But this does not necessarily mean that the professional you select is going to
[02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:35.040]   provide good or even fairly priced advice. And like any industry, not all professionals have
[02:48:35.040 --> 02:48:40.640]   equal skill or experience. In fact, 46% of financial planners have no retirement plan."
[02:48:41.200 --> 02:48:47.200]   That's right. The cobbler's kid has no shoes. "Over 2,400 financial planners were surveyed
[02:48:47.200 --> 02:48:53.440]   anonymously in a 2013 study by the Financial Planning Association, and close to half don't
[02:48:53.440 --> 02:48:58.160]   practice what they preach." Heck, I can't believe they admitted it. "Truth is, we're living in
[02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:02.640]   uncharted territory with endless complexity, central banks printing money like crazy,
[02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:07.520]   and even some governments defaulting on their own debt. Only the elite advisors of the planning
[02:49:07.520 --> 02:49:12.480]   industry know how to navigate these waters." I don't disagree with them on the elite advisors
[02:49:12.480 --> 02:49:19.360]   part. But that's kind of a shocking statistic that 46% of financial planners have no retirement plan.
[02:49:19.360 --> 02:49:25.760]   Now, this one was actually fairly easy to find. Again, no bibliography, but this one was fairly
[02:49:25.760 --> 02:49:29.600]   easy to find. So I went and found it, and it was the Financial Planning Association. I will link
[02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:36.880]   it in the show notes. So I went and read the study on page seven. The question that was asked,
[02:49:36.880 --> 02:49:45.600]   "Question. Do you have a clear plan in place for your own retirement?" 54% of respondents said yes,
[02:49:45.600 --> 02:49:52.640]   and 46% of respondents said no. It goes on and says, "When do you plan to retire?"
[02:49:52.640 --> 02:50:00.720]   Now, here's the key distinction. This is being done in a practice study for financial planners
[02:50:00.720 --> 02:50:08.320]   and their businesses. This study is not, "Do you have a financial plan with savings
[02:50:08.320 --> 02:50:16.960]   and retirement accounts?" This study is not, "Do you have an IRA?" This study is a practice
[02:50:16.960 --> 02:50:23.120]   management study, and it is talking and trying to dig into what is the question of how are you going
[02:50:23.120 --> 02:50:27.680]   to retire out of your financial planning practice, which is a very difficult challenge for many
[02:50:27.680 --> 02:50:32.720]   financial planners. You've built this practice. Do you sell it? Do you find a successor? How do
[02:50:32.720 --> 02:50:38.960]   you value it? It's a big issue in our industry. So this statistic that he's citing, he's making
[02:50:38.960 --> 02:50:44.640]   it sound like the cobbler's kid has no shoes. The 46% of financial planners have no retirement plan.
[02:50:44.640 --> 02:50:49.920]   Guess what? I have a retirement plan, but if I were answering this survey, I would say,
[02:50:49.920 --> 02:50:55.440]   "No, I don't have a clear plan in place for my own retirement if I'm running a financial planning
[02:50:55.440 --> 02:51:03.520]   practice," because there are many things that can change. Those who are answering yes on this topic,
[02:51:03.520 --> 02:51:11.680]   it's talking about their business plan. So if I asked Tony Robbins and I said, "Do you have a
[02:51:11.680 --> 02:51:18.480]   clear plan in place for your retirement from the Tony Robbins companies?" That's a very different
[02:51:18.480 --> 02:51:22.640]   question if I ask him, "Do you have assets set aside and earmarked towards your retirement?" or
[02:51:22.640 --> 02:51:28.800]   "Do you know the retirement number?" Again, did he read the study? I don't know, but to me,
[02:51:28.800 --> 02:51:33.840]   it's fairly clear. This is in the context of the entire survey. You can read the whole thing for
[02:51:33.840 --> 02:51:38.240]   yourself. The entire thing is about business models. If I were answering that question,
[02:51:38.240 --> 02:51:49.120]   in my former practice, I would have answered no for various reasons. Again, this says 56%, 54%
[02:51:49.120 --> 02:51:54.640]   have a clear plan in place for their own retirement. That's a business transition plan.
[02:51:54.640 --> 02:52:00.320]   I think the fact that 54% of financial planners have a clear plan in place for their own retirement
[02:52:00.320 --> 02:52:04.960]   and their business transition, in my mind, that is an amazing number, knowing the complexities
[02:52:04.960 --> 02:52:14.080]   of the financial planning business and how to do it. It's a big example.
[02:52:15.360 --> 02:52:21.280]   Let's dig into myth number four. One of the things that concerns me is it doesn't seem in this book,
[02:52:21.280 --> 02:52:27.680]   it's a little bit sloppy. I was surprised by this because I don't think Tony Robbins is not a sloppy
[02:52:27.680 --> 02:52:31.440]   guy. It's just his fact checkers or whatever didn't... I would assume he would have the best
[02:52:31.440 --> 02:52:36.960]   people in the business fact checking this thing. I don't know, it surprises me. Myth number four
[02:52:36.960 --> 02:52:42.080]   here, it just illustrates that he doesn't really understand some of these issues or terms. Myth
[02:52:42.080 --> 02:52:47.520]   four is called, "I'm your broker and I'm here to help." He's talking about the difference between
[02:52:47.520 --> 02:52:52.400]   the fiduciary standard and the suitability standard. This is an interesting discussion
[02:52:52.400 --> 02:53:00.080]   and it's fairly complicated. I can't go into details. The show is already ridiculously long
[02:53:00.080 --> 02:53:03.520]   and I could do an hour show on the fiduciary standard versus the suitability standard.
[02:53:03.520 --> 02:53:11.200]   It is complicated. Robbins presents the simplified version. My issue with it is how he presents it,
[02:53:11.200 --> 02:53:15.200]   because he presents it without any logical arguments and his entire presentation
[02:53:15.200 --> 02:53:24.160]   is based upon lampooning the suitability standard as ridiculous. Now, for clarity,
[02:53:24.160 --> 02:53:32.800]   I am in favor of a fiduciary standard, pretty much. I've always conducted everything under
[02:53:32.800 --> 02:53:39.040]   a fiduciary standard and I think that anybody who's managing investments should be managing
[02:53:39.040 --> 02:53:46.000]   them under a fiduciary standard. Now, that's different than—that's why I said in the business,
[02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:49.600]   it's a bigger issue than that because sometimes you're managing investments and sometimes you're
[02:53:49.600 --> 02:53:55.760]   selling products and that's the problem. The issue is fairly complicated, but I am in favor
[02:53:55.760 --> 02:54:00.640]   of the fiduciary standard. I've taken fiduciary oaths at least three different versions, I think,
[02:54:00.640 --> 02:54:07.680]   that I can think of. Consider how he lampoons and this is where he argues from the perspective of
[02:54:07.680 --> 02:54:13.360]   the suitability standard. Page 125. Here's the truth. The financial services industry has many
[02:54:13.360 --> 02:54:17.600]   caring people of the highest integrity who truly want to do what's in the best interest of their
[02:54:17.600 --> 02:54:22.480]   clients. Unfortunately, many are operating in a closed circuit environment in which the tools
[02:54:22.480 --> 02:54:28.480]   at their disposal are pre-engineered to be in the best interest of the house. True. The system is
[02:54:28.480 --> 02:54:32.960]   designed to reward them for selling, not for providing conflict-free advice. Also true.
[02:54:33.680 --> 02:54:37.680]   And the product or fund they sell you doesn't necessarily have to be the best available
[02:54:37.680 --> 02:54:43.440]   or even in your best interest. True. By legal definition, all they have to do is provide you
[02:54:43.440 --> 02:54:49.520]   with a product that is suitable. True. What kind of standard is suitable? Do you want a suitable
[02:54:49.520 --> 02:54:54.240]   partner for life? "Honey, how was it for you tonight?" "Eh, the sex was suitable." Are you
[02:54:54.240 --> 02:54:59.200]   going to be promoted for doing suitable work? Do you fly the airline with a suitable safety record?
[02:54:59.200 --> 02:55:04.400]   Or better yet, let's go to lunch here. I hear the food is suitable. Yet according to David Karp,
[02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:07.840]   a registered investment advisor, the suitability standard essentially says,
[02:55:07.840 --> 02:55:13.040]   "It doesn't matter who benefits more, the client or advisor. As long as an investment is suitable,
[02:55:13.040 --> 02:55:16.800]   meets the general direction of your goals and objectives, at the time it was placed for the
[02:55:16.800 --> 02:55:22.960]   client, the advisor is held free of liability." The gold standard. To receive conflict-free advice,
[02:55:22.960 --> 02:55:27.840]   we must align ourselves with a fiduciary. A fiduciary is a legal standard adopted by a
[02:55:27.840 --> 02:55:32.720]   relatively small but growing segment of independent financial professionals who have abandoned their
[02:55:32.720 --> 02:55:37.360]   big-box firms, relinquished their broker status, and made the decision to become a registered
[02:55:37.360 --> 02:55:42.560]   investment advisor. These professionals get paid for financial advice and, by law,
[02:55:42.560 --> 02:55:46.960]   must remove any potential conflicts of interest or, at a minimum, disclose them,
[02:55:46.960 --> 02:55:53.360]   and put the client's needs above their own. Imagine having investment advice where you knew
[02:55:53.360 --> 02:55:57.840]   that the law protected you from your advisor steering you in a specific direction or to a
[02:55:57.840 --> 02:56:02.240]   specific fund to make more money off of you. And he goes on as to how to find one. If there's a
[02:56:02.240 --> 02:56:06.960]   single step you could take to solidify your position as an insider, it's to align yourself
[02:56:06.960 --> 02:56:11.840]   with a fiduciary, an independent registered investment advisor, RIA for short. Now,
[02:56:11.840 --> 02:56:19.840]   is that all true? Mostly. Most of the stuff is true. And I understand why he might not get these
[02:56:19.840 --> 02:56:24.080]   terms. It took me years to figure out the terms myself. But if you're writing a book on it,
[02:56:24.080 --> 02:56:30.640]   make sure you understand the terms. First of all, the independent registered investment advisor is
[02:56:30.640 --> 02:56:37.200]   the firm. And then there's going to be an investment advisor representative, IAR, for that
[02:56:37.200 --> 02:56:45.040]   registered investment advisor, RIA, the firm. As I have an RIA firm, it's in process. I haven't
[02:56:45.040 --> 02:56:50.080]   finalized the paperwork. I've filed it and then it got... Anyway. So been through this process,
[02:56:50.080 --> 02:56:52.880]   and I'm familiar with it. I've just got the whole thing on hold while I start this show.
[02:56:52.880 --> 02:56:58.960]   But I have an RIA firm and I'm a representative of that firm. I would hire then an independent
[02:56:58.960 --> 02:57:04.560]   advisor representative, IAR, to work for the firm. At Northwestern Mutual, before I left, I was
[02:57:04.560 --> 02:57:11.200]   an independent advisor representative of Northwestern Mutual Investment Services,
[02:57:11.200 --> 02:57:15.920]   which was a registered investment advisor. Excuse me. What was the name of the company
[02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:19.200]   that was the registered investment advisor firm? Anyway, we had a registered investment advisory
[02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:24.640]   firm. I lived and worked under a legal fiduciary standard for the clients for whom I was working
[02:57:24.640 --> 02:57:30.160]   in that capacity. That was not all clients. And the key is that it's very difficult to apply a
[02:57:30.160 --> 02:57:39.120]   fiduciary standard to life insurance and products that are affected with commissions. Now, the other
[02:57:39.120 --> 02:57:44.000]   challenge is that I always lived under a fiduciary standard, not because necessarily of the internal
[02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:49.200]   firm requirements, although that did exist, but it was more specific, but as a certified financial
[02:57:49.200 --> 02:57:53.600]   planner. A fiduciary standard is not only applied to registered investment advisors.
[02:57:53.600 --> 02:58:00.240]   All CFP certificates have taken a fiduciary oath to act in a fiduciary manner when they're involved
[02:58:00.240 --> 02:58:06.560]   in providing financial planning services. So as a CFP certificate, regardless of my capacity,
[02:58:06.560 --> 02:58:10.960]   I was always held to a fiduciary standard. And then if you're a member of other organizations,
[02:58:10.960 --> 02:58:14.800]   so if you're a member of NAPFA, National Association of Personal Financial Advisors,
[02:58:14.800 --> 02:58:21.120]   or the XY Planning Network guys I work with, all of the people involved there have taken a fiduciary
[02:58:21.120 --> 02:58:33.120]   oath. And worse, he mixes up the definitions of a fiduciary stand of duty and a suitability
[02:58:33.120 --> 02:58:43.840]   standard when using industry terms of fee-based, fee-only, and commission-based. And what's not sad,
[02:58:43.840 --> 02:58:47.200]   I mean, I don't want to be too strong with this, but what his fact checker should have gotten on
[02:58:47.200 --> 02:58:52.800]   page 132, he talks about how to find a fiduciary, and he says, you know, find a link to the National
[02:58:52.800 --> 02:58:58.240]   Association of Personal Financial Advisors, NAPFA. And then it says, directory of fee-based advisors.
[02:58:58.800 --> 02:59:04.640]   Every NAPFA member that reads this book will be cringing. NAPFA members are not fee-based.
[02:59:04.640 --> 02:59:12.160]   Fee-based means that the most of your income comes from investment fees, and you still accept some
[02:59:12.160 --> 02:59:19.440]   commission product work. NAPFA does not permit fee-based planners. They permit fee-only planners.
[02:59:19.440 --> 02:59:24.720]   And NAPFA, the entire organization, is fee-only. In fact, on the very same page, practically,
[02:59:24.720 --> 02:59:30.880]   it's at the top of the next one, number four, make sure the NAPFA, so he reposts NAPFA's guidelines
[02:59:30.880 --> 02:59:35.440]   for criteria to consider when selecting an advisor. Number four, make sure the registered
[02:59:35.440 --> 02:59:40.160]   investment advisor does not have an affiliation with a broker-dealer. This is sometimes the worst
[02:59:40.160 --> 02:59:47.040]   offense when a fiduciary also sells products and gets investment commissions as well. So just the
[02:59:47.040 --> 02:59:51.520]   fact that NAPFA is listed as a fee-based advisor, and that's what a fee-based advisor is, is number
[02:59:51.520 --> 02:59:57.280]   four. So it's really tough. Actually, I constantly find myself having to learn and say, "Okay, let me
[02:59:57.280 --> 03:00:03.360]   adjust this." But the point is that it's a little bit sloppy. But as bad as that is, it's really not
[03:00:03.360 --> 03:00:08.080]   the worst problem. Because later in the book, he's talking about a fiduciary, but then he recommends
[03:00:08.080 --> 03:00:14.240]   private placement life insurance. Your fiduciary cannot sell that to you. Excuse me, your RIA,
[03:00:14.240 --> 03:00:18.560]   your fee-only registered investment advisor, can't sell that to you because then they would be
[03:00:18.560 --> 03:00:24.640]   accepting commissions. And they would have to do it as a separate firm. It's this whole complicated,
[03:00:24.640 --> 03:00:31.760]   stupid world that we live in with the regulations. Can't buy is fixed index annuity. So the debate
[03:00:31.760 --> 03:00:38.000]   exists for a reason. It's intense for a reason in our industry. Personally, I'm unconvinced the
[03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:42.720]   suitability versus fiduciary standard is actually going to make any difference for clients. Again,
[03:00:42.720 --> 03:00:49.440]   I'm in favor of a fiduciary standard of care. But the current system as it is in a very tough spot.
[03:00:49.440 --> 03:00:54.080]   And I think a better difference would be distinguishing between financial advice and
[03:00:54.080 --> 03:01:00.000]   product sales. I think that would be key. And if you're involved in product sales, be involved in
[03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:04.000]   product sales. Don't be involved in financial advice. We'll see where things shake out. The
[03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:08.880]   SEC is studying it and we'll see where things shake out. But I don't think it matters because
[03:01:08.880 --> 03:01:13.840]   I know lots of good advisors who give objective advice in either scenario. I've lived in both
[03:01:13.840 --> 03:01:20.000]   worlds. I gave the same advice in both scenarios. And I know that there are lots of people who would,
[03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:28.240]   even in a fiduciary system, would be completely prone to self-dealing and working in their best
[03:01:28.240 --> 03:01:32.720]   interest instead of the client's. And can you blame them? Look at the world we live in. In a
[03:01:32.720 --> 03:01:36.800]   world where the president of the United States, from both parties, by the way, for many past
[03:01:37.440 --> 03:01:40.800]   administrations, the president of the United States lies repeatedly to people,
[03:01:40.800 --> 03:01:49.680]   including lying under oath. Example, Bill Clinton, lying under oath, lying consistently,
[03:01:49.680 --> 03:01:56.080]   George W. Bush and Barack Obama, lying consistently. Here's what I'm going to do.
[03:01:56.080 --> 03:02:02.880]   Don't do it. It's absurd. In the current administration, 2014, you have the attorney
[03:02:02.880 --> 03:02:06.560]   general, who's supposedly the person who's responsible for upholding the law, lying to
[03:02:06.560 --> 03:02:10.720]   Congress on multiple occasions. You have the head of the IRS, in my opinion, lying to the public
[03:02:10.720 --> 03:02:16.080]   about the, "Oh, we have the missing emails." You have the secretary of state and possible
[03:02:16.080 --> 03:02:20.960]   future presidential candidate lying about the Benghazi events. And was it a few weeks ago,
[03:02:20.960 --> 03:02:27.520]   Jonathan Gruber, the primary architect of Obamacare, openly admits that they purposely lied,
[03:02:27.520 --> 03:02:32.160]   concealed, evaded, manipulated, and twisted events to get their purpose and agenda for health care
[03:02:32.160 --> 03:02:36.880]   pushed forward. Do you expect me to believe that any of these people have any interest in the truth
[03:02:36.880 --> 03:02:42.880]   as some kind of object of standard? Give me a break. I don't trust any of them.
[03:02:42.880 --> 03:02:49.040]   So when that is the government that's in charge of the SEC, do you expect me to believe that's
[03:02:49.040 --> 03:02:55.440]   going to make a difference? In our current society, there's no moral foundation for holding
[03:02:55.440 --> 03:03:02.320]   your word by anybody for anything. And there are a few people that still exist in it. And yes,
[03:03:02.320 --> 03:03:06.240]   the legal system is there to hold people accountable. And does it do it? Yeah, sometimes.
[03:03:06.240 --> 03:03:13.280]   But there's no moral authority. No one has any moral authority from any enforcement division
[03:03:13.280 --> 03:03:19.760]   to talk about this. I don't trust any of them. And by the way, it's not an Obama thing. It's
[03:03:19.760 --> 03:03:23.040]   every single government administration we've had in my lifetime, and certainly a long time before
[03:03:23.040 --> 03:03:28.800]   my lifetime, has been the same. Best example, listen to how they campaign. Listen to how the
[03:03:28.800 --> 03:03:34.480]   news people report this. We expect so-and-so, now that they've won their primary election,
[03:03:34.480 --> 03:03:39.440]   to modify their position. Are you going to change your political stance now? It's all lies.
[03:03:39.440 --> 03:03:45.760]   So my point is that I don't think it's really going to matter. I think what matters is you've
[03:03:45.760 --> 03:03:51.040]   got to find somebody with character. And I have found people in the investment business in every
[03:03:51.040 --> 03:03:57.360]   model, with every product, that I said, "This person has character, and this person is genuine,
[03:03:57.360 --> 03:04:01.280]   and I would trust." And I've found people in every model that I wouldn't leave my wife in
[03:04:01.280 --> 03:04:08.480]   the same room with alone for five minutes. I wouldn't, for an instant. Another issue I have
[03:04:08.480 --> 03:04:12.400]   is with such a focus, especially making this one of the myths on the suitability standard versus
[03:04:12.400 --> 03:04:19.520]   the fiduciary standard, I think that raises an extra measure here with regard to what the value,
[03:04:19.520 --> 03:04:24.560]   what was Tony doing with his book? And halfway through this book,
[03:04:24.560 --> 03:04:29.280]   I started thinking to myself, "Man, he's mentioning a lot of companies
[03:04:29.280 --> 03:04:37.360]   really positively. This seems strange." And I got the feeling, I was like, "Is this a 600-page
[03:04:37.360 --> 03:04:43.680]   sales letter?" So I hadn't picked up on it until about halfway through. The first company that he
[03:04:43.680 --> 03:04:48.640]   really emphasizes is a company called Hightower, which is an RIA firm. He emphasizes it right here
[03:04:49.120 --> 03:04:54.720]   in the fiduciary chapter, which is a registered investment advisory firm. And he says, "I found
[03:04:54.720 --> 03:04:59.200]   out about this company, and I think his advisor is with Hightower." And he says, "Hightower is
[03:04:59.200 --> 03:05:03.680]   really great, and they've created this great product, and I don't have any connection with
[03:05:03.680 --> 03:05:12.960]   them at the moment. But we're in talks, and that may change in the future." So I thought, "Wow,
[03:05:12.960 --> 03:05:16.640]   this is really great. Good for him for highlighting it, and that would be great."
[03:05:16.640 --> 03:05:20.960]   Well, I go on, and what I found out is he goes on and mentions other companies. And I just got
[03:05:20.960 --> 03:05:26.480]   this strange feeling. So I went looking for disclosures, and I went to the appendices.
[03:05:26.480 --> 03:05:30.400]   And I finally figured out that several of the companies that are profiled in the book are
[03:05:30.400 --> 03:05:35.920]   actually partnerships with him. So you've got companies, America's Best, 401(k), he owns a
[03:05:35.920 --> 03:05:41.520]   stake in that, which is heavily recommended as a 401(k) provider. Advisors Excel, and then a
[03:05:41.520 --> 03:05:46.160]   subsidiary there, a joint venture product called Lifetime Income. So these are the firms that he's
[03:05:46.160 --> 03:05:52.560]   setting up a scenario with to sell annuity products and life insurance products and 401(k)
[03:05:52.560 --> 03:06:01.280]   products. And so he uses a lot of these companies in his examples. So you say, "Okay, well, that's
[03:06:01.280 --> 03:06:06.640]   fine. Nothing wrong with that." But then I thought, "Well, is he really giving a fiduciary
[03:06:06.640 --> 03:06:12.960]   standard here? Is he using this book as a... And by the way, using the book as a sales letter does
[03:06:12.960 --> 03:06:17.280]   not violate a fiduciary standard. But I just thought, is he practicing full and complete
[03:06:17.280 --> 03:06:23.920]   radical transparency?" Well, I don't know. I think he is because it's in the appendices. But
[03:06:23.920 --> 03:06:29.040]   it's constant throughout the book. So for example, page 170, talking about annuities, fixed index
[03:06:29.040 --> 03:06:33.280]   annuities, the solution. If you have an annuity, regardless of what type, it's always beneficial
[03:06:33.280 --> 03:06:37.120]   to get a review by an annuity specialist. You can reach out to an annuity specialist at
[03:06:37.120 --> 03:06:42.160]   lifetimeincome@lifetimeincome.com, and he or she will perform a complimentary review, which will
[03:06:42.160 --> 03:06:44.800]   help you discover the pros and cons of your annuity, determine the actual fees you're paying,
[03:06:44.800 --> 03:06:47.280]   assess whether or not the guarantees are the highest available, and decide whether to keep it
[03:06:47.280 --> 03:06:50.640]   or not, or get out of your current annuity and exchange it for a different type of annuity.
[03:06:50.640 --> 03:06:56.800]   So that's brilliant marketing. And this is what I'm going to focus on. I'll come back to the
[03:06:56.800 --> 03:07:01.600]   question of this is okay or not. This is utterly brilliant. This is amazingly brilliant what he's
[03:07:01.600 --> 03:07:06.240]   done. And I didn't pick up on it until about halfway out, halfway through. But let me share
[03:07:06.240 --> 03:07:11.280]   with you what he's done with this book. On the front page of the book, he says, "I've donated
[03:07:11.280 --> 03:07:19.840]   all of my profits to a charity that's feeding people." And so you buy the book, and the money
[03:07:19.840 --> 03:07:25.760]   from that is donated to the charity. And you read the book, and you benefit, and then you act on the
[03:07:25.760 --> 03:07:31.920]   advice in the book. And he's created this amazing win, win, win, win, win scenario, win for all
[03:07:31.920 --> 03:07:38.080]   involved. And I really am impressed by it. It's really impressive. He laid this thing out, and
[03:07:38.080 --> 03:07:44.560]   it's brilliant. He writes a book out of indignation over a financial collapse. He researches some
[03:07:44.560 --> 03:07:51.040]   really great companies that are providing solutions with his research team. He leverages the power of
[03:07:51.040 --> 03:07:57.440]   his personal brand to create, get access, and create an amazing, really a great book.
[03:07:57.440 --> 03:08:03.440]   Then he donates all the profits from the book to the food charity, giving himself a charitable
[03:08:03.440 --> 03:08:10.560]   deduction, while on the same hand using the book as an incredible 600-page sales letter
[03:08:10.560 --> 03:08:16.560]   for his seminars and for his other products, and most importantly for these companies.
[03:08:16.560 --> 03:08:21.520]   So he gains a massive increase in the value of the companies he's partnered with from people
[03:08:21.520 --> 03:08:25.680]   acting on behalf of the advice and serving millions of people. And the way he's done it in
[03:08:25.680 --> 03:08:30.720]   the book is amazing. So the book is a 600-page sales letter. It's a well-written one with tons
[03:08:30.720 --> 03:08:37.040]   of information. And he's got driving people to the website and to an application, a smartphone app,
[03:08:37.040 --> 03:08:43.760]   which is a really great lead generation tool. And he's driving people to his teams all the way
[03:08:43.760 --> 03:08:50.240]   through. Isn't that amazing? When I finally figured it out, and again, maybe I was dense,
[03:08:50.240 --> 03:08:54.000]   I went back and looked, and I did find that each time he introduced a company, he said,
[03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:59.120]   "I've now partnered with them." And by the way, I'll get to what I think in a second. He said,
[03:08:59.120 --> 03:09:02.880]   "I've now partnered with them." I had missed it the first time. Then I went back and I said,
[03:09:02.880 --> 03:09:07.600]   "This is amazing. Every single financial planner should be following this model,
[03:09:07.600 --> 03:09:13.440]   writing a 600-page sales letter and doing this." Frankly, I'm kind of jealous of him.
[03:09:13.440 --> 03:09:17.680]   He's essentially created what I'd love to create. He's got electronic tools to make it easy. He's
[03:09:17.680 --> 03:09:22.560]   got electronic capture. He's got all these tools with Hightower and America's Best and all these
[03:09:22.560 --> 03:09:29.680]   incredible flow of interest. He's created an amazing process disclosing all the problems.
[03:09:29.680 --> 03:09:36.800]   I think it's really amazing. I do not for an instant doubt Tony's heart, his passion,
[03:09:36.800 --> 03:09:43.840]   his genuineness, his honesty, his authenticity, his righteous indignation at the industry,
[03:09:43.840 --> 03:09:48.080]   and his desire to help people and to give back. I don't doubt it for an instant.
[03:09:49.360 --> 03:09:54.240]   I think he's done a great job at it. I just didn't figure it out until halfway through the book.
[03:09:54.240 --> 03:10:00.480]   I hope to copy him someday. I think it's amazing. But I'm not sure he could actually do this as a
[03:10:00.480 --> 03:10:05.200]   fee-only advisor. I'm not sure he could do it as a fiduciary fee-only advisor. It'd be a nightmare
[03:10:05.200 --> 03:10:10.720]   to work the paperwork work. So that's the conundrum constantly. The toughest question
[03:10:10.720 --> 03:10:16.960]   I get asked is, "How do I find a good financial advisor?" So admire that and learn from it,
[03:10:16.960 --> 03:10:21.360]   because he has done an amazing job. When I finally figured that out, it all clicked for me.
[03:10:21.360 --> 03:10:28.720]   That's the value in my mind of good sales. Good sales is giving people a ton of information
[03:10:28.720 --> 03:10:33.760]   and a ton of value. That's what I'm doing on the show, trying to give away a ton of information
[03:10:33.760 --> 03:10:38.560]   and a ton of value in exchange for selling my ancillary products as I develop them. That is
[03:10:38.560 --> 03:10:48.000]   what I'm doing. So I think it is awesome. Other concerns here. It seems like he doesn't
[03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:58.160]   clearly write about just some basics of some financial products. Another example that I
[03:10:58.160 --> 03:11:03.200]   pointed out, page 438, he's talking about annuities. It says, as a frequently asked
[03:11:03.200 --> 03:11:07.920]   question, about fixed index annuities. "What happens if I die early?" If you die before
[03:11:07.920 --> 03:11:13.280]   turning on your income stream, your entire account balance is left to your heirs. This is a huge
[03:11:13.280 --> 03:11:18.080]   benefit over a traditional income annuity. When you do decide to eventually turn on your lifetime
[03:11:18.080 --> 03:11:22.640]   income stream with a simple phone call, you do not forfeit your entire account to the insurance
[03:11:22.640 --> 03:11:26.320]   company. Your heirs would still get your account balance minus any income payments you would take
[03:11:26.320 --> 03:11:35.120]   into that point. It's completely flawed, because no annuity do you ever lose the value of until
[03:11:35.120 --> 03:11:40.720]   you annuitize it. And then when you annuitize it, based upon the payout options that you select at
[03:11:40.720 --> 03:11:45.120]   the time you turn on the annuity income stream, that's what determines what benefit your
[03:11:45.120 --> 03:11:49.600]   beneficiaries receive. And that's exactly the same with a fixed index annuity as it is with any
[03:11:49.600 --> 03:11:57.200]   other annuity product. So it's like this whole thing about a differentiation. There's no
[03:11:57.200 --> 03:12:04.080]   differentiation there. I get an issue that some of the arguments are not fairly or well or fairly
[03:12:04.080 --> 03:12:09.440]   presented. And probably the best example here, and I get that not everyone can present all sides of
[03:12:09.440 --> 03:12:14.720]   an argument. I probably drive people crazy with trying to give every side of an argument. But
[03:12:14.720 --> 03:12:20.000]   some of these shortfalls in the book are pretty serious. The best example here is myth number
[03:12:20.000 --> 03:12:24.560]   three, which is entitled "Our Returns, What You See Is What You Get." And in here, he makes a big
[03:12:24.560 --> 03:12:30.320]   deal out of time-weighted returns versus dollar-weighted returns. And so I'm going to read
[03:12:30.320 --> 03:12:36.800]   a couple of just excerpted quotes here from a few consecutive pages here. And these are just one or
[03:12:36.800 --> 03:12:42.000]   two sentence options here. "Today, the mutual fund industry has been able to use a tricky method to
[03:12:42.000 --> 03:12:48.080]   calculate and publish returns that are, as Jack Bogle says, not actually earned by the investors.
[03:12:48.080 --> 03:12:53.840]   Now that you're an insider, beware. Average returns have a built-in illusion,
[03:12:53.840 --> 03:12:59.680]   spinning a performance enhancement that doesn't exist. The math magicians on Wall Street have
[03:12:59.680 --> 03:13:04.560]   managed to calculate their returns to look even better. How so? In short, when the mutual fund
[03:13:04.560 --> 03:13:10.640]   advertises a specific return, it's not, as Jack Bogle says, the return you actually earn. Why?
[03:13:10.640 --> 03:13:15.040]   Because the returns you see in the brochure are known as time-weighted returns. Sounds complicated,
[03:13:15.040 --> 03:13:19.520]   but it's not. However, feel free to use that to look brilliant at your next cocktail party."
[03:13:19.520 --> 03:13:25.760]   Goes on and talks about real returns. "And you must also remember that the returns reported by
[03:13:25.760 --> 03:13:29.920]   mutual funds are based on a theoretical person who invested all of his money on day one.
[03:13:29.920 --> 03:13:34.560]   This just isn't true for most, so we can't delude ourselves into believing that the glossy brochure
[03:13:34.560 --> 03:13:38.400]   returns are the same as what we have actually received in our account." I don't get why he
[03:13:38.400 --> 03:13:43.200]   even included this, because to me this is a non-issue. I know Jack Bogle makes a big difference
[03:13:43.200 --> 03:13:48.000]   out of this, but I don't think he's making a... I don't think... I don't buy his argument. I really
[03:13:48.000 --> 03:13:51.360]   don't. I have a ton of respect for him, but I don't buy his argument on this one. "The difference
[03:13:51.360 --> 03:13:55.680]   between time-weighted returns and dollar-weighted returns. Time-weighted returns exist so that you
[03:13:55.680 --> 03:14:04.080]   can compare a portfolio manager's performance independent of what the flows in or out of his
[03:14:04.080 --> 03:14:09.280]   or her fund are. That's what they exist for. Dollar-weighted returns have to do with the
[03:14:09.280 --> 03:14:15.040]   dollars that are actually in the fund and tracking them through." Now, Robbins is right, and Bogle's
[03:14:15.040 --> 03:14:20.560]   right. You only get to spend dollar-weighted returns, your dollar-weighted returns. But the
[03:14:20.560 --> 03:14:27.760]   issue is that what's being talked about here is not essentially the issue of how do I...
[03:14:27.760 --> 03:14:36.480]   there's no lies being made here. And the biggest problem is there are essentially three different
[03:14:36.480 --> 03:14:40.640]   time-weighted versus dollar-weighted returns that we... excuse me, three different returns that we
[03:14:40.640 --> 03:14:46.480]   have to track. So the time-weighted return ignores asset inflows and outflows of the portfolio,
[03:14:46.480 --> 03:14:50.000]   but the dollar-weighted on their portfolio talks about the mutual fund investors. Well,
[03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:53.920]   think about how a mutual fund works. You have a portfolio manager that you hire
[03:14:53.920 --> 03:15:01.120]   to run an investment portfolio. And here's what would actually could happen if you were to compare
[03:15:01.120 --> 03:15:06.080]   the differential between these two numbers. Let's pretend that I start a mutual fund,
[03:15:06.080 --> 03:15:10.960]   and I'm going to start an open-end investment company. We're going to call it Sheetz Capital
[03:15:10.960 --> 03:15:17.280]   Management. And you think that I'm just brilliant, so you go ahead and invest with me right up front.
[03:15:17.280 --> 03:15:22.160]   And so I take and I invest your money. And this year, I do really... I invest the money,
[03:15:22.160 --> 03:15:26.960]   and I make you... I'm going to charge you a 1% management fee as far as a portfolio fee
[03:15:26.960 --> 03:15:31.360]   that goes to the investment advisor on the account, on the mutual fund account.
[03:15:31.360 --> 03:15:42.960]   And so I charge 1% fee. And this year, I make 15% returns. And so net of fees,
[03:15:42.960 --> 03:15:48.720]   you get 14% return on your money. And let's say that the market was flat this year. So all of a
[03:15:48.720 --> 03:15:56.960]   sudden, I'm getting all kinds of people really interested in my fund. And so I get $10 billion
[03:15:56.960 --> 03:16:02.240]   all of a sudden shows up in my fund. And the people say, "Hey, listen, we want you to invest
[03:16:02.240 --> 03:16:09.040]   our money." Well, now I'm sitting on $10 billion. And a month later, I'm still trying to figure out
[03:16:09.040 --> 03:16:13.920]   where do I invest this $10 billion? What's my next good idea? I can't pour it all into one thing.
[03:16:13.920 --> 03:16:22.400]   And so my fund is flat. The average person, the average dollar in the fund is flat. But your money
[03:16:22.400 --> 03:16:28.880]   is up, what did I say, 14%. Whatever the number was, I said. That's the difference between time
[03:16:28.880 --> 03:16:32.320]   weighted returns and dollar weighted returns. So a time weighted return formula would ignore
[03:16:32.320 --> 03:16:38.960]   the $10 billion of new cash flow into my fund. And it would just simply focus on the actual
[03:16:38.960 --> 03:16:44.960]   performance that I had returned. That's how numbers are reported. But worse, so Bogle,
[03:16:44.960 --> 03:16:50.320]   and I guess Robbins too, wants this to be reported for actually the cash flows in and out of the
[03:16:50.320 --> 03:16:54.640]   fund. But this is meaningless in the fund. And my issue with it, the portfolio manager can't
[03:16:54.640 --> 03:16:59.200]   control the cash flows in and out of the fund. And the portfolio manager would rather if they
[03:16:59.200 --> 03:17:03.280]   just all stayed in. And he would love it if the dollar weighted return and the time weighted
[03:17:03.280 --> 03:17:09.920]   return completely matched. But even still, that doesn't do you any good. Because just the dollar
[03:17:09.920 --> 03:17:14.880]   weighted return of the fund doesn't tell you what your actual rate of return is. So this is your
[03:17:14.880 --> 03:17:19.760]   advisor's job to calculate for you. I used to run this for all of my clients. Here's what your
[03:17:19.760 --> 03:17:25.600]   actual investment performance has been net of fees, the actual money that's actually growing.
[03:17:25.600 --> 03:17:34.160]   This is what your actual performance is. So it's a big deal. I don't get why he even included this
[03:17:34.160 --> 03:17:39.760]   whole section because it's not a... I mean, unless I'm ignorant on something, and if I am,
[03:17:39.760 --> 03:17:44.880]   you let me know. But I went back and in preparing for the show, I went and read Bogle's stuff on it.
[03:17:44.880 --> 03:17:50.800]   I read his speeches on it. I'm like, this doesn't make any sense of what he's saying. And it just
[03:17:50.800 --> 03:18:00.000]   seems like Vanguard has more persistency with their investors than many other fund companies.
[03:18:00.000 --> 03:18:05.600]   I think it just would help Vanguard. And that's why he says it. But I don't think it's an accurate
[03:18:05.600 --> 03:18:17.120]   argument. Anyway, let's wrap. Let's talk about active investing versus passive investing.
[03:18:17.840 --> 03:18:25.280]   Throughout the book, this is a constant tension. And if you're trying to gain from this book,
[03:18:25.280 --> 03:18:31.200]   what you should do with active versus passive, this is really, really tough to do. And
[03:18:31.200 --> 03:18:39.040]   I don't know how you could. And it's kind of troubling because I think it's going to leave
[03:18:39.040 --> 03:18:43.520]   people kind of saying, "Huh, what do I do?" In the beginning, he talks about no one can beat
[03:18:43.520 --> 03:18:52.480]   the market. But then he gives countless examples of people that do beat the market. He talks about
[03:18:52.480 --> 03:19:02.560]   in the beginning, a broad base of research discussing about mutual fund managers beating
[03:19:02.560 --> 03:19:11.200]   their market index. But then he doesn't clarify that that's different than you in your situation
[03:19:11.200 --> 03:19:16.320]   looking to beat your index. The index is utterly meaningless. That's useful as a point for
[03:19:16.320 --> 03:19:22.240]   comparison. But he gives example after example from his own life of essentially beating the market.
[03:19:22.240 --> 03:19:30.240]   On page 178, he talks about buying a market-linked CD where he was earning 20 times the rate of a
[03:19:30.240 --> 03:19:37.840]   traditional CD with the same FDIC protection, where his advisor had found him some nice
[03:19:37.840 --> 03:19:46.720]   market-linked CDs. On page 283, he talks about the fact that what you're looking for is an
[03:19:46.720 --> 03:19:59.920]   asymmetric risk and reward, which is what all great investors seek. It's elusive, but it's
[03:19:59.920 --> 03:20:03.680]   out there. And it's just one more way that you can speed up your approach to realizing
[03:20:03.680 --> 03:20:13.440]   your dreams. And he talks on page 313, he gives an example from, again, his own life,
[03:20:13.440 --> 03:20:22.800]   where he's individually underwriting a real estate investment opportunity. "My advisor and I found
[03:20:22.800 --> 03:20:26.800]   out that the real estate investment company was offering the first deed of trust on that house
[03:20:26.800 --> 03:20:32.080]   in Indian Wells as collateral on a $1 million loan, which would pay 10% interest for one year.
[03:20:33.040 --> 03:20:37.520]   It was willing to have one investor take this on, or as many as 25, each contributing $40,000.
[03:20:37.520 --> 03:20:43.280]   In the end, I had decided to invest in the full $1 million myself. You might say, 'Wow, that's a
[03:20:43.280 --> 03:20:48.160]   great deal. You got a $100,000 profit to tie up your money for just one year. But Tony, what's
[03:20:48.160 --> 03:20:53.520]   your risk?' That's exactly why we did a lot of research. The home, we learned, after two qualified
[03:20:53.520 --> 03:20:58.240]   appraisals, was worth $2 million in its current state." So he goes on and he talks about the deal.
[03:20:59.120 --> 03:21:03.840]   And basically what he did was value investing, saying there's a floor underneath it, it's a
[03:21:03.840 --> 03:21:11.760]   specific value, and here's why I chose this amount and chose this idea. So this is one of the
[03:21:11.760 --> 03:21:20.720]   toughest questions to talk through in a financial book, because the discussion is nuanced, as with
[03:21:20.720 --> 03:21:26.560]   everything. And I feel like I'm not communicating it very well here. It's late at night and I'm
[03:21:26.560 --> 03:21:30.080]   tired and I probably should have done this. Anyway, I couldn't go another day without getting this
[03:21:30.080 --> 03:21:37.040]   done. But there are a number of other examples. In the book, the only actual passive investor is
[03:21:37.040 --> 03:21:42.320]   Bogle. He's the only one of the people that he talks about that's a passive investor and indexer.
[03:21:42.320 --> 03:21:50.080]   Swenson isn't actually an indexer. Swenson is running a portfolio and he's got 1,500 guys
[03:21:50.080 --> 03:21:54.400]   working for him or something like that. But he recommends indexing, which I recommend too. And
[03:21:54.400 --> 03:21:59.760]   this is the problem, is that usually, if you're involved in the financial business, you basically
[03:21:59.760 --> 03:22:03.920]   just throw up your hands and say, "You should probably just index, because that's probably
[03:22:03.920 --> 03:22:10.000]   going to be your best scenario." And that saves some people from paying higher fees than necessary.
[03:22:10.000 --> 03:22:15.600]   And the ones who ignore the advice to index are probably the ones who should be the ones who are
[03:22:15.600 --> 03:22:25.840]   ignoring the advice to index. I thought that Mark Faber on page 525 made the best point about active
[03:22:25.840 --> 03:22:31.200]   versus passive. And he talked about the idea that somebody can be a great stock picker, but that
[03:22:31.200 --> 03:22:35.840]   doesn't necessarily make them a great mutual fund portfolio manager. And that's the issue. Just
[03:22:35.840 --> 03:22:40.880]   because a mutual fund manager can't "beat the market" doesn't mean that you can't beat the
[03:22:40.880 --> 03:22:45.440]   market. It's a big difference there. I've got a lot of reservations. I'm going to wrap this up
[03:22:45.440 --> 03:22:50.880]   a little quicker than I had planned. I hope this has been good. Again, this is why I don't do book
[03:22:50.880 --> 03:22:56.400]   reviews, especially on 600-page books. It's a good book. But I have serious reservations about
[03:22:56.400 --> 03:23:01.120]   his fixed index annuity strategies. I'm not going to go into the details right now. This is on my
[03:23:01.120 --> 03:23:06.320]   research list. I've generally been in disfavor of fixed index annuities, although I could see a few
[03:23:06.320 --> 03:23:12.160]   areas they worked in. But I've realized that there must be something I don't know. I've had some
[03:23:12.160 --> 03:23:17.520]   advisors that I respected talk about it. There might be something I don't know. So I need to
[03:23:17.520 --> 03:23:24.960]   go and research this again. I like annuities. I think annuities are very useful. I just don't
[03:23:24.960 --> 03:23:29.600]   like the fees on fixed index annuities. But maybe I could see a place for them in a safer dollars
[03:23:29.600 --> 03:23:36.560]   bucket. The life insurance section isn't precise or very accurate as far as the details. It is nice
[03:23:36.560 --> 03:23:41.200]   to hear about somebody writing about life insurance and writing about it. For example, he talks about
[03:23:41.200 --> 03:23:46.480]   the fact that life insurance cash values are predominantly held by large banks as part of
[03:23:46.480 --> 03:23:51.440]   their tier one capital reserves. It's nice to see that written by somebody who's not a life insurance
[03:23:51.440 --> 03:23:56.560]   salesman. I used to talk with that about my clients. But it's always a little bit suspect
[03:23:56.560 --> 03:24:02.480]   when it's coming from a life insurance salesperson. It kind of bugs me that he ignores some of the
[03:24:02.480 --> 03:24:08.480]   basic planning ideas, some of the basic defensive planning ideas. Again, you can't put everything
[03:24:08.480 --> 03:24:15.680]   into one book, but essentially, he talks about living trusts and kind of exotic financial
[03:24:15.680 --> 03:24:19.600]   instruments. But there's no mention of disability income insurance. There's no mention of health
[03:24:19.600 --> 03:24:23.360]   insurance. There's no mention of property and casualty insurance. No, you can't cover it all
[03:24:23.360 --> 03:24:32.560]   in one book. But in my mind, that's a big deal. So I finish up the show here. I'm just going to
[03:24:32.560 --> 03:24:37.760]   emphasize that one of the great values of books like this is you've got to read through the lines.
[03:24:37.760 --> 03:24:43.520]   I'm following the Tony Robbins—I'm trying to follow the Tony Robbins strategy. Page 187,
[03:24:43.520 --> 03:24:48.640]   Tony writes this, "I've always believed the best way to get a result, the fastest way,
[03:24:48.640 --> 03:24:53.200]   is to find someone who has already accomplished what you're after and model his or her behavior.
[03:24:53.840 --> 03:24:58.560]   If you know someone who used to be overweight but has kept himself fit and healthy for a decade,
[03:24:58.560 --> 03:25:03.440]   model that person. You have a friend who used to be miserable in her relationship and now is
[03:25:03.440 --> 03:25:08.640]   passionate and in love for 10 years going, model her. You meet someone who started with nothing
[03:25:08.640 --> 03:25:12.960]   and has developed wealth and sustained it through time. Learn from those strategies.
[03:25:12.960 --> 03:25:17.440]   These people aren't lucky. They're simply doing something different than you are in this area of
[03:25:17.440 --> 03:25:24.080]   life." When I looked at my notes here on the side, I wrote down, "Copy Tony Robbins' plan.
[03:25:24.080 --> 03:25:30.720]   Become a world-class expert. Become great at marketing and be well-marketed. Create a large
[03:25:30.720 --> 03:25:38.400]   company based upon your core skill. Cash out with an IPO and then work to reduce your risk. And then
[03:25:38.400 --> 03:25:42.960]   continue to provide an ongoing service and build your brand and partner in entrepreneurial activities
[03:25:42.960 --> 03:25:49.200]   as joint venture activities." That's what I wrote down next to it. That's the plan that Tony Robbins
[03:25:49.200 --> 03:25:54.560]   does. The financial stuff that he talks about in here is really important and it has its place.
[03:25:54.560 --> 03:26:01.280]   But keep it in context. Tony Robbins is not rich because he saved 15% of his income in a low-cost
[03:26:01.280 --> 03:26:08.240]   index fund. He's rich because he built a massive company and he sold it, cashed out through an IPO.
[03:26:08.240 --> 03:26:12.080]   He says in the book, "At one point in time, when the market was high, before it crashed,
[03:26:12.080 --> 03:26:15.520]   he was worth $400 million." I don't know if he's worth more or less than that. Now,
[03:26:15.520 --> 03:26:19.440]   it's none of my business. It doesn't even matter. But the point is that you don't get the $400
[03:26:19.440 --> 03:26:24.640]   million net worth by saving 15% of your $200,000 salary in an index fund. But you don't need to,
[03:26:24.640 --> 03:26:31.280]   which his point is valid. Other point, Tony was earning $10,000 a month at the age of 18.
[03:26:31.280 --> 03:26:35.840]   Somewhere in the book, he says he made a million bucks a year soon after that, but it's not clear
[03:26:35.840 --> 03:26:40.480]   to me soon after. And it seems like that point in his life was pretty unstable. I'd planned to go
[03:26:40.480 --> 03:26:45.600]   through each of the examples of the billionaires that he profiles. And it's really fascinating,
[03:26:45.600 --> 03:26:49.760]   the people that he profiles and their stories and the themes they could pick up.
[03:26:49.760 --> 03:26:54.800]   But one of the themes that you see is that every one of them applied asymmetric risk and reward
[03:26:54.800 --> 03:27:05.360]   into business. That's the horrible, tricky, cruel detail. An investment advisor makes money off of
[03:27:05.360 --> 03:27:16.400]   other people's money. So on page 107 of the book, Robin says, and when he's talking about the risk
[03:27:16.400 --> 03:27:22.400]   of investing, like, "How could you be a sucker and take this bet? You put up the capital, you took
[03:27:22.400 --> 03:27:26.800]   all the risk, and they made money no matter what happened." That's what every single one of the
[03:27:26.800 --> 03:27:32.640]   billionaires profiled in the book did. All of them. You put up the money, you put up the risk,
[03:27:32.640 --> 03:27:37.360]   and they made money no matter what happened. Now, they made a lot more money because they did well,
[03:27:37.360 --> 03:27:41.280]   and they were featured in the book because they did well. But that's what this constant
[03:27:41.280 --> 03:27:47.200]   tension is in the financial business. They got asymmetric risk based upon
[03:27:47.200 --> 03:27:52.160]   running their investment fund scenario. That's what I'm trying to do with the show,
[03:27:52.160 --> 03:27:57.680]   exercise asymmetric risk. There's a small risk of failure to me if this fails, and there's a big
[03:27:57.680 --> 03:28:02.800]   risk of potential upside. So consider in your life where you can find asymmetric risk.
[03:28:02.800 --> 03:28:06.880]   Tony closes the book with two valuable sections. He talks a big section about the future is brighter
[03:28:06.880 --> 03:28:10.240]   than you think. I had already written the script for the show I planned to release on the day
[03:28:10.240 --> 03:28:15.840]   before Thanksgiving, which was going to be basically why the future is really bright,
[03:28:15.840 --> 03:28:24.240]   why we have reasons for gratitude and optimism. And then he wrote this amazing section on some
[03:28:24.240 --> 03:28:28.880]   advancements in technology that I was kind of aware of, but he gave some specific examples which
[03:28:28.880 --> 03:28:37.280]   were really, really cool. And then he ends with a focus on philanthropy. And as I close,
[03:28:37.280 --> 03:28:44.560]   it's a great book. Buy the book, read it. And I wanted to go through some of those examples of
[03:28:44.560 --> 03:28:49.200]   issues I have with it to show how you do need to read stuff and you need to listen to stuff.
[03:28:49.200 --> 03:28:52.640]   Listen to what I say with your guard up, because when you're talking about money,
[03:28:52.640 --> 03:28:57.840]   there's a lot of bad information. And listen with your filtering mechanism on. Look for the
[03:28:57.840 --> 03:29:03.040]   logical fallacies, look for the issues, look for the contradictions. And you'll find a lot of them
[03:29:03.040 --> 03:29:08.720]   in this book, but it's still a really great book. I know a few better that are as comprehensive in
[03:29:08.720 --> 03:29:15.840]   scope. Frankly, in the same way that I should probably cut shows like this up into dozens of
[03:29:15.840 --> 03:29:22.880]   smaller shows, Tony should probably have cut his book up into individual books, but he can't do
[03:29:22.880 --> 03:29:28.080]   that. That's why he has 50-hour seminars. And I don't see any way that I could do and be happy
[03:29:28.080 --> 03:29:37.200]   with myself, cut this kind of stuff out and cut it into little sections. But the key is to take it
[03:29:37.200 --> 03:29:44.160]   all in and look for the connections, look for what you can learn. The lens that I found that so far
[03:29:44.160 --> 03:29:48.800]   has held up to everything is the lens in the context of individual personal financial planning.
[03:29:48.800 --> 03:29:55.680]   I can't solve all of these big picture macroeconomic issues, but I can solve in an
[03:29:55.680 --> 03:30:00.560]   individual's life the issues that that individual is concerned about. Personal financial planning
[03:30:00.560 --> 03:30:05.840]   is what gives you safety, margin, stability in your life so that you can weather through the
[03:30:05.840 --> 03:30:11.040]   time so you don't have to become a statistic of dollar-weighted returns versus time-weighted
[03:30:11.040 --> 03:30:18.640]   returns. The key is always an individual application. And as humans, we tend to look
[03:30:18.640 --> 03:30:23.200]   for black and white, right or wrong. And what we actually have to do is look at different sides of
[03:30:23.200 --> 03:30:28.880]   different discussions and then apply it in an individual situation. Another takeaway from the
[03:30:28.880 --> 03:30:33.840]   book, people are always attracted to the idea of a secret investment. Secret investment doesn't
[03:30:33.840 --> 03:30:38.960]   matter. Investing is a business and a service, and you can hire it done, you can do it yourself,
[03:30:38.960 --> 03:30:45.200]   and either is fine. The personal financial plan is what matters. One of the weaknesses of the book
[03:30:45.200 --> 03:30:49.520]   is that it only focuses on financial assets, and I remain convinced that one of the best ways to
[03:30:49.520 --> 03:30:56.880]   prepare for fluctuations in financial assets is to get out of financial assets with different ways.
[03:30:56.880 --> 03:31:01.760]   So if you're looking for a book to tell you the truth, I think you'll be disappointed.
[03:31:01.760 --> 03:31:05.680]   If you're looking for a really great survey of thoughts and ideas to kind of
[03:31:07.840 --> 03:31:13.680]   balance with and try to engage with, this is a great book. Look at your situation through
[03:31:13.680 --> 03:31:20.480]   a financial planning lens. And from an investment perspective, I read you with one quote from the
[03:31:20.480 --> 03:31:28.000]   section with John Templeton. This quote comes from page 543. And John Templeton said,
[03:31:28.000 --> 03:31:32.000]   Tony Robbins asks, "What do you think is the single biggest mistake investors make?
[03:31:33.120 --> 03:31:37.680]   The great majority of people do not build up any wealth because they do not practice the
[03:31:37.680 --> 03:31:43.120]   self-discipline of saving some of their income every month. But beyond that, once you've saved
[03:31:43.120 --> 03:31:48.880]   that money, then you have to invest it wisely in good bargains, and it's not easy. It's very rare
[03:31:48.880 --> 03:31:54.240]   for any one person, particularly any one person working in just their spare time, to select the
[03:31:54.240 --> 03:31:59.280]   right investments, any more than you would want to be your own medical doctor or your own lawyer.
[03:31:59.280 --> 03:32:03.120]   It's not wise to try to be your own investment manager. It's better to find the best
[03:32:03.120 --> 03:32:09.520]   professionals, the wisest security analysts to help you." Tony Robbins, "When I was talking to
[03:32:09.520 --> 03:32:13.760]   some of your associates down in the Bahamas, I was asking them, 'What does he invest in?'
[03:32:13.760 --> 03:32:17.360]   And they said, 'Anything. He'll buy a tree if he thinks he can get a good deal on it.'
[03:32:17.360 --> 03:32:22.800]   Then I said, 'How long will he hang on to it?' And they said, 'Forever, basically until it's
[03:32:22.800 --> 03:32:27.600]   worth more.' So John, how long do you hang on to an investment before you know to let it go?
[03:32:28.160 --> 03:32:32.880]   How do you know if you've made a mistake? How do you know when it's time to actually liquidate?"
[03:32:32.880 --> 03:32:38.240]   John Templeton, "That is one of the most important questions. Many people will say,
[03:32:38.240 --> 03:32:42.640]   'I know when to buy, but I don't know when to sell.' But over these 54 years that I've been
[03:32:42.640 --> 03:32:47.760]   helping investors, I think I've found the answer, and that is, you sell an asset only when you think
[03:32:47.760 --> 03:32:53.680]   you have found a different asset that's a 50% better bargain. You search all the time for a
[03:32:53.680 --> 03:32:59.120]   bargain, and then you look at what you now own. If there's something in your present list that is a
[03:32:59.120 --> 03:33:04.160]   50% less good bargain than the one you found, you sell the old one and you buy the new one.
[03:33:04.160 --> 03:33:09.920]   But even then, you're not right all the time." That's the lesson that can be applied from this
[03:33:09.920 --> 03:33:15.120]   book. At least one of many lessons that can be applied to this book. I don't have any interest
[03:33:15.120 --> 03:33:21.280]   in being a billionaire hedge fund manager, and if you do, go for it. We need some good ones.
[03:33:21.280 --> 03:33:26.480]   But I do think that that can be applied in all of our lives, and it can be applied on the scale of,
[03:33:26.480 --> 03:33:30.720]   "How do you know when to sell your grandma's bell collection that she left you
[03:33:30.720 --> 03:33:35.520]   as an investment?" or "How do you know when to sell the next billion dollar company?"
[03:33:35.520 --> 03:33:40.800]   It's a great book. I hope you check it out. Tony, thank you for writing the book. If you
[03:33:40.800 --> 03:33:49.200]   ever listen to this, I really enjoyed it. I hope you tighten it up in the next issue.
[03:33:49.200 --> 03:33:53.040]   But man, I tell you, I don't have the heart to think that I could write it. If I wrote one of
[03:33:53.040 --> 03:33:59.520]   these things, it would be 3,000 pages, and I could never finish it. I had to get this show done,
[03:33:59.520 --> 03:34:04.320]   because I kept going deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and thinking, "Well, I could research
[03:34:04.320 --> 03:34:07.760]   this and research that," and I just had to sit down and get it done. So as a recorder, it's late
[03:34:07.760 --> 03:34:13.920]   here, and I'm getting it out. I apologize to you guys for missing the shows. I didn't need to do
[03:34:13.920 --> 03:34:18.240]   that. I have interviews I could have released, but I just... Anyway, it didn't mean to break the
[03:34:18.240 --> 03:34:23.360]   trust. So check back tomorrow for another great show. I don't know what it'll be about. I hope
[03:34:23.360 --> 03:34:29.280]   you guys enjoy this. Check out the book. It's really good. I love it when guys like Tony Robbins
[03:34:29.280 --> 03:34:34.080]   take on projects like this, because they have a capacity that is phenomenal, that is so,
[03:34:34.080 --> 03:34:37.200]   so valuable. So that's it for today. Enjoy the rest of your day.
