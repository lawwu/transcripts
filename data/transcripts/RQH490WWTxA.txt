[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340]   Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast with John Pfeiffer.
[00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.440]   We begin the new week with a question from a young woman named Kate.
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.180]   Dear Pastor John, thank you so much for what your ministry has done
[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.840]   for my faith and relationship with God.
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.580]   I can't fully express how much your words have changed my walk with Christ forever.
[00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.520]   I was very encouraged by your words in episode 908 about fatherhood
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.520]   directed to the husband of a wife who wanted children.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.000]   In the episode, you said there are glories of motherhood, too,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.760]   but that is for another time.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.940]   I would like to hear about this glory and any other encouragement you would have
[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.540]   for me. I have never taken it lightly to have children.
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.780]   It seems overwhelmingly weighty to me to be responsible
[00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.640]   for forming another person's character for 18 years and beyond.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.740]   It has absolutely terrified me in the past, and for a time I decided not to have kids.
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.220]   As I found my identity in Christ, I have also found strength to agree
[00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.520]   to willingly have children and obey God's call on my life.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.160]   But I am still so afraid of perpetuating my own dysfunction and sins into them.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.200]   Of course, I'm afraid of childbirth, but even more, I'm afraid of ruining their hearts.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.860]   I would love to hear your advice that you would have for me.
[00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.740]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.840]   There are indeed glories in motherhood
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.440]   that every woman should think about and embrace and rejoice in
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.320]   as God calls them to motherhood.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.720]   And when I say glories, I don't necessarily mean things that are easy,
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.720]   but things that are profoundly significant
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.820]   and beautiful and precious in God's sight and essential
[00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.860]   for his purposes in the world.
[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.600]   So that's what I want to focus on.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.940]   So much more could be said about all those other issues she raised,
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.140]   but she asked me to say, what are some of those glories
[00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.600]   that you said were for another time?
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.920]   So I'll mention a few, maybe five.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.920]   One, it is a glorious thing
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.480]   that human life originates in the womb of a woman
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.720]   and is sustained for nine months by the woman's own body
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.460]   and in most cultures is sustained at her breast for another year or two.
[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.900]   Both Moses and Paul in the Bible
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.240]   saw this as a glorious thing,
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.180]   a great wonder of the world that a mother should be continually amazed at.
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.820]   To be sure, all the glories of this life are fallen glories,
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.680]   imperfect glories, corrupted glories,
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.420]   because both our souls and all of nature
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.060]   has fallen into the judgment of God because of sin.
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.720]   But the glories still shine through.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.360]   And in Christ, we are meant to embrace them and free them
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.080]   as much as we can from the contamination of the fall.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.080]   Immediately following the words of God's judgment
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.680]   on the serpent and the woman and the man in Genesis
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.060]   and immediately before God's merciful clothing of the man
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.400]   and the woman with animal skins, right in that little place,
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.320]   Moses records this.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.600]   The man called his wife's name Eve
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.260]   because she was the mother of all the living.
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.580]   Now, it seems clear to me that God intends this
[00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.640]   right where it comes after the curse, before the mercy of those skins.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.420]   God intends this to be seen as a gift of unspeakable grace.
[00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.000]   Both Adam and Eve were warned that the day they eat of this fruit,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.260]   they will die.
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.800]   In one sense, they did.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.700]   But instead of only death, not only did they live,
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.100]   but Eve becomes the source of all human life.
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.640]   He could have done it another way.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.020]   The mother of all the living and every woman after her.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.180]   And then Paul tries to show how significant this is in 1 Corinthians 11,
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.820]   11 and 12, where he says, Nevertheless, in the Lord,
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.820]   woman is not independent of man nor man of woman.
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:33.220]   For as woman was made for man, so man is now born of woman.
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.760]   And all things are from God.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.340]   In other words, every man that has ever lived,
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.420]   however small or great, owes his life to a woman, his mother.
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:53.620]   Number two, then the Psalms multiply the glory and the wonder
[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.260]   of all of life originating in the woman by saying explicitly
[00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.960]   that her womb is no mere natural cocoon,
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.860]   but the sacred place of God's
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.700]   own personal handiwork himself.
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.760]   Psalm 139. 13.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.960]   You formed me in my inward parts.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.900]   You knitted me together in my mother's womb.
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.980]   I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.180]   Wonderful are your works.
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.920]   My soul knows it very well.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.580]   God is at work in the womb of every mother
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.520]   and his hands are forming an everlasting human being
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.120]   just as closely as if he were using his fingers and knitting needles.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.900]   And that is a great glory.
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.800]   Three, then the Bible describes the glorious ongoing shaping
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.140]   of every human by the influence and teaching of his mother.
[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.140]   Proverbs 1 8.
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.500]   Hear my son, your father's instruction and forsake
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:08.240]   not your mother's teaching, for they are a graceful garland
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.660]   for your head and pendants for your neck.
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.680]   She she has given her sons and daughters life.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.860]   And now by her teaching, she gives them garlands and pendants for their neck.
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.560]   These are intended to be signs of glorious ministry.
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.700]   In my opinion, the most influential people in the world are mothers.
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:40.020]   Thousands of of men may rise up to positions of power
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.860]   all over the world or women.
[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:48.260]   All of them come from the womb and the influence of mothers.
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.600]   Even kings and presidents, it says in this is amazing.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.440]   It says in Proverbs 31 1, the words of King Lemuel.
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.240]   An oracle that his mother taught him.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.640]   So not only do you have scripture, but you have.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.840]   I mean, I should say it the other way around, I suppose.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.080]   Not only do you have the words of a king, but you have scripture
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.180]   as the oracle of his mother that she taught him.
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:24.220]   For God's design in all of this is that a mother should be duly honored.
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.900]   Or you could say appropriately glorified for her gifts
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.260]   and her sacrifices to her children. Ephesians.
[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:38.180]   Ephesians 6 1. Children, obey your parents in the Lord for this is right.
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.380]   Honor your father and your mother.
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.940]   Children are to honor their mothers
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:51.460]   because their mothers have done an honorable and glorious thing
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.320]   in all that they've birthed and influenced.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.360]   Five. Lastly, the sorrows
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.440]   that every mother will experience in giving birth and raising her children
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.860]   will be glorious sorrows. And.
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:14.200]   What I mean is that when a mother sorrows,
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.440]   even over the forsaking of God,
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.940]   the forsaking of the family by a child, when a mother's sorrows
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:28.020]   it's a glorious sorrow because it is a partaking in the very sorrows
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:32.580]   that Jesus himself experienced at the one point
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.220]   where he compared himself to mothering.
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:40.520]   Oh, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.760]   and stones those who are sent to it.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.540]   How often would I have gathered you,
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:51.540]   your children together as a hen, as a hen, as a mother hen.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.480]   Gathers her brood under her wings and you were not willing.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:01.880]   So here we have Jesus comparing himself to a hen, a mother longing and aching
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:07.320]   and crying and praying out for the wayward children in Jerusalem.
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.120]   And they're not coming.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.060]   And he's weeping over Jerusalem.
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.820]   Your sorrows as a mother are glorious sorrows
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.900]   because they share in the very sorrows of the son of man
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.260]   when he compared himself to motherhood.
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.200]   And Kate, the list could go on.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.540]   So take heart.
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:31.420]   Of course, you and every woman and man bring brokenness.
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.840]   That's what you emphasize.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:38.780]   You bring brokenness as well as faith to the challenge of parenthood.
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.960]   But remember these promises.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:41.980]   I'll just give you two.
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.460]   They are daily precious to me.
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.660]   My God will supply all your needs
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.440]   according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.200]   Philippians 4, 9, that's mothering needs as well as others.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:58.880]   And Second Corinthians 9, 8, God is able to make all grace abound to you
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.980]   so that having all mothering sufficiency in all things relating to mothering
[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:10.460]   at all times in your mothering, you may abound in every mothering good deeds.
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:14.420]   Amen. Thank you, Pastor John, for that hope filled counsel.
[00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.920]   And Kate, thank you for the very open and honest
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.060]   self-disclosing question that you send in to us.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.500]   These are the kinds of questions we are always looking for in the inbox,
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:27.040]   questions that get into our heart tension, that you're feeling in your life
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.480]   and you're seeking biblical counsel to address it.

[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.420]   And we are going to return on Wednesday.
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.760]   A listener wants to know if any of the New Testament writers were self-conscious
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.660]   that they were writing down the very words of God.
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.460]   Were any of the New Testament writers aware that they were inspired
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.600]   in the moment that they were writing?
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.600]   And if so, where is the evidence?
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.680]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.480]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll see you then.
