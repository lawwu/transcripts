[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560]   You know, the reality, and I talk about this a little bit in my first book, is that most
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.780]   companies are just legal Ponzi schemes, right?
[00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.620]   It's like, that's how entrepreneurship works.
[00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.960]   It's like, there's the boss at the top and there's the shareholders and there's all the
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.400]   employees.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.620]   And the way that you build a profitable business or have, you know, a successful company is
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.320]   that you need to get some level of return on your investment on your employees.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.700]   Naturally, entrepreneurs default to trying to get as much out of their employees, you
[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.640]   know, as they can, right?
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.500]   It's like the revenue multiple or profit multiple that you get for your employees.
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.320]   And so your company is always going to set limits and they're going to try to push those
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.400]   limits and they know more about those limits than you know about those limits.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.180]   And they're thinking about you, the person, and they're like, how do I give this person
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.640]   enough to keep them happy and to keep them here and to stay?
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.340]   They're thinking about how to keep you just happy enough.
[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.340]   So this is important.
[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.960]   If you just accept what they're offering you, if you don't go in and push a little bit where
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.380]   you can, naturally, you're going to get pigeonholed with a lot of limits around your life that you
[00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.960]   didn't set.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.040]   And it's going to be difficult to escape from them.
