[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   By the way, let me introduce myself, because I'm new.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.360]   As you can see on this t-shirt, I work for Weights & Biases.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.120]   Weights & Biases is the one-stop shop for monitoring your training runs.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.320]   And you probably all know this because you follow Weights & Biases, but if you don't,
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.120]   you should come to our booth.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.080]   Let me show you around NeurIPS a little bit.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.200]   So we have all these fine folks trying to register.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.720]   It's actually pretty mild right now because everybody's in session.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.160]   I'll show you that in a second as well.
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.720]   You have folks from all around the world.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.040]   And for example, sessions right now, there's a bunch of sessions happening all at the same
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.040]   time.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.040]   It's huge.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.040]   I think the main session right now is...
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.040]   Women in the middle?
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.520]   No, I think it's this one.
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.600]   Let's see what else we have.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.600]   It's a map.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.640]   So we have a huge three-floor building of this convention center in New Orleans.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.560]   So we're coming to you live from New Orleans.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:04.640]   And let's go take a peek at one of the most popular talks right now.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.200]   So I'm walking, and hopefully you guys can hear me well.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.800]   I'm walking into the studio.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.120]   So we're going to have to be quiet over there.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.480]   I can't be speaking over the presenter.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.720]   But it's fully packed.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.200]   I think it's a vision machine learning talk.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.920]   Let's go check it out.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.120]   And then we're going to show you the expo.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.560]   We're probably going to do another expo run, but I'm going to show you the expo real quick.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:39.720]   Okay, now we're going to have to be quiet.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.720]   It's really packed.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.480]   There's a lot of people.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:50.480]   I want to say maybe 500 or so people.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:02:07.840]   Standing room only.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.120]   He's talking about AlphaGo.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.120]   That's really, really cool.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.120]   Okay.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.120]   Is this still high?
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.120]   All right.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:27.440]   Now we've left the first presentation, and there's going to be a bunch.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.640]   There's a bunch of different rooms.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.600]   I think there's like 20, 25 rooms.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.880]   And now we're in the expo hall.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.840]   And expo hall is where it's at.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.880]   That's also where the Weights & Biases booth is.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.120]   So if you are here, and somehow you're watching this instead of having fun, come by our booth.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.600]   But let me just show you some of the names that are in this conference today.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.440]   So we got Apple with their very Apple-looking like stand, which is super cool.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.320]   We're actually going to talk to them about some stuff that they're doing.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.800]   We have Microsoft over here.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.480]   Let's see.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.880]   We have Meta over there, and that's a busy booth.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.320]   Everybody's excited about Lama.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.760]   Everybody's excited about Seamless and Segment Anything and all these models.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.760]   It's super cool.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.600]   We have IBM behind there.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.880]   I don't know if you can see guys on the live stream, but there's IBM as well.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.880]   And this is still not super full, but we have AMD over there.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.960]   I actually haven't saw Nvidia yet.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.360]   I haven't seen Nvidia, but I'm sure that they're here also.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.600]   And so let's walk around a little bit and start for the shaky cam as I tell you about
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.600]   some of the stuff that we're here to do.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.320]   And so as I said, I'm new.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.520]   This is my third week in Weights & Biases, but I've been already called to come and stand
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.720]   at our booth and try to explain to people what we do.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.040]   You know what I found?
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.220]   The first thing that I found is about 70% of people who come to the show already use
[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.680]   Weights & Biases, and the thing they come to tell us is, "We love you guys.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.040]   We've been using you guys for forever.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.040]   We love you guys."
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.200]   And it's very interesting interaction to just talk to people who use the software that you
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.280]   just recently joined to help promote.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.000]   And it's been a really, really fun example when I just ask people, "Well, what else would
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   you want?
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.560]   What kind of features would you want?"
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.920]   So there's a lot of feedback happening as well.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.920]   Oh, look.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.320]   That's a cool demo.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.000]   They set up a video camera.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.920]   Oh, it's occluded right now.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.280]   That actually does some filtering on the fly.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.280]   That's pretty cool.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.280]   Oh, that's TikTok.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.200]   That's a TikTok filter running live.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.240]   That's pretty cool.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.040]   So we have TikTok over here, and there's a bunch of other booths.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.920]   I will do a full...
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.720]   Not maybe a full, but I will do an expo, come there, walk around, and we'll tell you about
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.080]   the expo and show you our booth in a second as well.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.800]   But I think that's it for me for this first live.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.000]   We've been here for five minutes.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.600]   I just wanted to show you some of the cool stuff at New York APS.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.880]   And this is it.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.040]   And this is the expo hall.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.720]   And we're probably going to speak to some folks as well as we find them.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.640]   So with that, I want to say hi and go get some swag.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.840]   Because we're at the conference, getting some swag is very interesting.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.640]   And I think most companies will run out of the cool swag very, very soon.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.760]   So we'll see you here.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.280]   Tune in for the next live session and check out Glades and Biases for sure.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.320]   Bye for now.
