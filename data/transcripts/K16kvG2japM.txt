[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.960]   the Gospel according to St. John in the second chapter, reading verses 9, 10 and 11.
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.000]   When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.280]   it was, but the servants which drew the water knew, the governor of the feast called the
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.520]   bridegroom and saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine, and
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.960]   when men have well drunk, then that which is worse; but thou hast kept the good wine
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.120]   until now.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.760]   This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory,
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.240]   and his disciples believed on him.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.080]   We are still continuing our study of this incident, this first miracle that was wrought
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.900]   by our blessed Lord and Savior at that marriage feast in Cana of Galilee.
[00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:08.440]   We are doing so not only because it is a record of something which actually and literally
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.720]   happened, a historical event.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.280]   It is a miracle.
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.200]   The Son of God here on earth worked miracles.
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.000]   It was one of his ways, as John puts it, of showing us, giving a sign that he is indeed
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.760]   the Son of God.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.480]   But we are interested in it primarily not only because it is a miracle and therefore
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:37.040]   a manifestation of his glory, but because it is at the same time a parable.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.100]   Now we must remember that these gospels, these four gospels which we have here in the New
[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.720]   Testament, are not exhaustive accounts of all that our Lord did and said.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.760]   John, the author of this particular gospel, actually tells us that if everything that
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.360]   he had done and said were actually recorded, that even the world itself would not be big
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.740]   enough to contain the books that would have to be written.
[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:11.040]   These are selections, and obviously there is a point and a purpose and a method in the
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.040]   selection.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:21.960]   And I am suggesting that what this writer does in particular is to give us these incidents,
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.080]   these miracles, these signs, in order that he may illustrate what is, after all, the
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.520]   great theme of his gospel, which is that the Lord Jesus Christ came into the world to give
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.520]   us life.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:41.200]   The key verse, in a sense, is the sixteenth verse of the first chapter, "of his fullness,
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.400]   his fullness, of all we receive, and grace upon grace."
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.720]   That is what he came to do, not merely to save us from hell and to procure for us forgiveness
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:59.200]   of sins, but to make of us the sons of God, to make us partakers of the divine nature,
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.560]   to participate as in the divine life.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.640]   And that is his great theme, that Christ came to give us this life, a life more abundantly,
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.000]   life which is life indeed.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.640]   And I am trying to show how in this one incident we are given here a picture of how he does
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.480]   that and especially of how we receive it.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.480]   That is the problem.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.600]   Here it is for us.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.960]   But do we all receive of his fullness?
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.720]   Have we all received of his fullness and grace upon grace?
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.600]   That is the question.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.480]   And we are trying to show how it is that can be done.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.520]   And here we are given great instruction.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.640]   We have seen negative instructions to what we are not to do.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.680]   And then we have been looking at what we have to do.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:49.360]   But at the moment we are now looking at the character or the nature of the blessing.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.920]   We have already started doing this.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:59.920]   We have shown how it is a blessing that always deals with a condition of desperation.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.200]   It is only the paupers in the spiritual realm who ever really become princes, those who
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.200]   realize their poverty.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.960]   Our Lord, of course, made that plain at the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.720]   Blessed are the poor in spirit.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:20.040]   That is the key to the whole of the spiritual, the Christian life, poverty of spirit.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:27.080]   Blessing is more inimical to this life and to receiving this life than any remnant of
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.080]   self-confidence.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.760]   It has got to go out at the very beginning.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:40.360]   It is only in a condition of desperation that our Lord manifests his glory by hearing our
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.480]   humble cry and plea.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.440]   And then we saw how when he does act, he changes the entire situation.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.080]   That is what he did here.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.760]   From need to satisfaction, desperation, to quiet and peace and calm.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.440]   Now that is what he always does.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.640]   And then we went on to show her that when he does this, it is always clear and evident
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.840]   that he is done so.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.440]   You do not take this by faith.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.080]   You do not say, "I do not feel any different at all.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.560]   I have not felt anything, but I have taken it by faith."
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.560]   Of course not.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.640]   When he acts, you know that he has acted.
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.840]   He turned the water into wine.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.840]   He solved the problem.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.760]   And thus it has always been throughout the centuries.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.040]   When you receive of this fullness, well, you know that you have done so.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.360]   And indeed I ended by saying that everybody else knows it.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:38.240]   And that is how the greatest evangelistic agency in the world this morning is redeemed
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.240]   people.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:46.720]   Those who are evidently setting forth the life of God in their souls throughout the
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.720]   running centuries.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:54.640]   Nothing has been so pertinent in that respect as the lives of men and women who show that
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:00.920]   they have indeed truly received of his fullness and grace upon grace.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.480]   But now we must go on.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:10.320]   And here I want to try and show you now something of the fullness of the satisfaction that he
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.160]   gives.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.040]   It comes out so clearly here.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.120]   He did not merely turn just a little water into wine.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.120]   There was a sufficiency.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.360]   There was a superabundance.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.240]   You will find many illustrations of that.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.920]   When he fed the five thousand, you remember, with the five barley loaves and the two fishes.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.400]   It is so typical of him and when he acts.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.600]   It is not merely the exact amount.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:44.720]   There were twelve baskets full, kind of over and above what was needed of the crumbs.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.960]   That is his method.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.480]   It is always this overflowing, full sufficiency.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.360]   And it comes out in this incident here at the very beginning.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:00.320]   And it is, I say, something that is emphasized right away through the New Testament.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.700]   And that is why I say all this is so important for us.
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.960]   It is his fullness.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.680]   And if we receive of this, well, there is this element of superabundance.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:17.160]   Now, you get, of course, Adam Brashen's foreshadowings of this in the Old Testament
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.160]   itself.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.760]   The psalmist, by the eye of faith, was able to see something of this.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.160]   He puts it like this, "My cup, he says, runneth over."
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.680]   It is not merely just full.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.680]   It is running over.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.480]   That is the characteristic of God's grace.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:39.120]   Not only its freeness, but its fullness, its abundance, its all-sufficiency.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.680]   And there it is, I say, and the psalmist sees it.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:47.960]   "My cup, it is running over, filled to the brim and overflowing."
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:54.480]   And that is why I read that second chapter of the Song of Solomon to you just now.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.480]   He puts it so perfectly.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:03.120]   That is undoubtedly a picture, again, of the prophecy of the relationship between Christ
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.120]   and his Church.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:11.760]   It is put in that poetic, dramatic form, but it is a perfect representation of the Church
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.560]   as the Bride of Christ.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.960]   That is the New Testament term.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.320]   And there Solomon sees it long before it came to pass.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.760]   And this is how he describes it, "He brought me to the banqueting house."
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.080]   And that is where he always brings us.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:32.800]   It is not to some kind of soup kitchen or to some temporary place where we can be given
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.160]   just a little food to keep us from starvation.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.040]   No, no, it is a banqueting house.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.640]   There is a freeness and a fullness and a sufficiency.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:46.680]   "And his banner over me was love; stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples, for
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.680]   I am sick of love."
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.800]   So much of it that it is almost overwhelming me.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:59.720]   And you get that brought out equally in verses 11 to 13 of that second chapter of the Song
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.720]   of Solomon.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:09.160]   "The flowers, O lo, the winter is past; the rain is gone, is over, and gone."
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.600]   You see, that is the test that we apply to ourselves.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:18.960]   Are we living in a kind of spiritual winter?
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.000]   What is the condition of ourselves this morning?
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.600]   Is it like the weather this morning?
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:31.720]   We are not meant to be like that, overcast, cloudy, drizzled, fog, neither hot nor cold.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.720]   No, no.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:39.120]   And when he visits the heart, when he exerts the glory of his power, and when he grants
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:45.480]   us this fullness of his Spirit, we are able to say, he says to us rather, "The winter
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:51.040]   is past; the rain is over and gone; the flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.560]   of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.960]   The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:00.960]   good smell.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.680]   Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away."
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.680]   Now that is it.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.680]   That is the picture.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:13.600]   You see, there in the Old Testament you get this suggestion of it.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.040]   The Old Testament is full of it.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:25.080]   Isaiah 35, "The wilderness of desolate parched places shall become a pool; the lame men leaping
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.080]   as a heart."
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:31.880]   There is the language and the imagery of the Old Testament putting this thing so plainly
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.880]   to us.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:37.800]   And so it can all be summed up in the 16th verse, if you like, of that second chapter
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.200]   of the Son of Solomon.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:46.960]   The effect of what he does to us is to make us say, "My beloved is mine, and I am his."
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.720]   There it is.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.000]   The Old Testament sums it up like that.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.960]   But when you come to the New Testament, of course, the thing is much plainer.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.600]   It is clearer and more explicit.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:04.840]   Here it is in a pictorial form, in the form of this enacted parable, if you like, at Cana
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:05.840]   of Galilee.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:11.920]   But our Lord, in words, put this thing very, very plainly so many times that there is no
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:18.080]   more beautiful illustration of it than that which he said to the woman of Samaria.
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.720]   You remember, there she is at a well.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.880]   She has come to draw water.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:26.040]   And that was one of the hard tasks of her life, having to go back and forth so many
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:31.280]   times during the day with her buckets in order to get water from the well.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.720]   And the sun was shining and the heat was terrible.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.560]   It was an awful burden.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.560]   But that was life.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.080]   And there she is going back and forth.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.080]   And our Lord begins to speak to her, you remember.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.480]   And he said, "If thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee, 'Give
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.240]   me to drink,' thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.240]   water."
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:55.640]   The woman does not understand this, so our Lord expounds it to her.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:01.120]   And he said, "Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again."
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:05.760]   Now that is life in this world, isn't it?
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.280]   You have to keep on going.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.760]   Satisfaction, as you think, permanent, never.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.760]   No, there will be a thirst that will come again.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.760]   Back you have to go.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.320]   You will thirst again.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.680]   And you have to keep on going backwards and backwards and backwards to the same, to get
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.880]   a little more, just to keep you going.
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.560]   And of course the tragedy is that many of us in the Christian life are living that sort
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:31.600]   of life, a kind of desperation, losing everything.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.920]   Then Sunday comes, we get more and then we lose it all.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.320]   Monday there is a good deal gone.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.880]   By Tuesday we wonder whether we have got anything left.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.240]   Wednesday it is all gone.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.240]   And then we exist.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:46.040]   And then, or perhaps in some other way, some meeting you attend or some friends you meet.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.920]   Now that is the old.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.520]   That is not the new.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:55.360]   So he goes on to put it like this, "Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:02.680]   But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:10.960]   But the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water, springing up into
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.720]   everlasting life."
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.720]   That is it.
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.440]   You see, he puts a well within us.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.960]   You are not always drawing from somewhere outside you.
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.160]   He puts it inside us, the well of the spring.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.280]   And it goes on springing up into everlasting life.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.960]   Oh, listen to him again.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:32.560]   I am just trying to show you that this is the great theme of this Gospel in particular,
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.760]   but it is the theme of the whole of the New Testament.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.040]   This is Christian life.
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.040]   This is true Christianity.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:43.520]   Listen to him again in the seventh chapter in verses 37 to 39.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:48.760]   On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, "If any man
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.320]   thirsts, let him come unto me and drink.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:14:00.120]   He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly, out of his innermost
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:06.720]   parts, shall flow rivers of living water."
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.920]   Rivers, from inside, from the depth of his being.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:15.640]   "There shall flow out," oh, not just a little trickle, "but rivers of living water."
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:19.680]   And John explains it, "This speak ye of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:20.680]   receive.
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:25.280]   For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because the Jesus was not yet glorified."
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.480]   Well now, there you are.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:31.440]   And then when you come on to the book of the Acts of the Apostles, you see, "The Spirit
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.600]   was poured out on the dear Pentecost."
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.200]   And that is the term that is used.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.880]   Poured out.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:45.280]   Nothing is ever said about this, except that you get this impression of profusion.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.280]   It's something overwhelming.
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.280]   It's a baptism.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.280]   It's a shower coming upon you.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.280]   And it's unmistakable.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:58.920]   But the thing that I'm emphasizing this morning, particularly, is this element of profusion.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:03.280]   And so, what we are told about those people on the day of Pentecost is that they were
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.720]   all filled with the Holy Ghost.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.720]   Filled.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.960]   And you get that term repeated.
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.480]   You get it again in Acts 4.
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.480]   You get it everywhere.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.840]   Filled with the Spirit.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.800]   And again, if you like, take the way the Apostle Paul puts it in Romans 5.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:28.360]   "The love of God," he says, "is shed abroad in our hearts."
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.200]   You see the idea?
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:38.240]   Not just a little touch of moisture, but it's poured out, shed abroad, in a great profusion.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.560]   Shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which he has given us.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.440]   And all the other terms are the same.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.440]   The fruit of the Spirit.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.920]   And you think at once of an orchard with trees.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.040]   There they are, literally groaning with the fruit.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.440]   There's so much of it.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.880]   The fruit of the Spirit.
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:00.280]   There's love, joy, peace, long-suffering, goodness, meekness, gentleness, faith and
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.280]   temperance.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.280]   There it is.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.600]   There's no end to it, this great profusion.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:10.360]   And then, of course, the Apostle surpasses himself at the end of Ephesians 3 when he
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:14.560]   talks about how being filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:18.920]   He's already talked about the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.920]   He's mentioned the exceeding riches of His grace.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.600]   Now you see, he brings out all his superlatives and still it's not enough.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.680]   And he can say nothing beyond this.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:31.080]   Filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.120]   And God is eternal.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.320]   There is no limit to Him.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.000]   All His qualities are absolutes.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.160]   And His fullness is endless.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.000]   It is eternal.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.280]   And so the Apostle, you see, in writing in a very personal manner and in a very tender
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:55.240]   manner to the Philippians, though he was in prison and so on, he uses terms like these
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:17:01.160]   which are really quite extraordinary when you come to think of his position.
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:05.800]   He says, "I am full."
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.200]   Now what more can a man say than that?
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.200]   He's in prison.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.200]   He's suffering in body.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.200]   He says he's become an old man before his time.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.200]   Calls himself Paul the Aged.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:19.040]   He's on the verge of death and it's going to be a very cruel death.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:25.360]   But you see, in that whole position, he says, "I have all and the bound.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.360]   I am full."
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:36.160]   Now there's a man who has received of His fullness and grace upon grace.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.040]   John says the same thing.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.840]   We have had life, he says.
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:41.840]   This life is in us.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.400]   There's a seed that remains in us.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.920]   And Peter says we are partakers of the divine nature.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.440]   There's nothing, I say, beyond this.
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:56.400]   And all of them are vying with one another to try and give some impression of this fullness
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:04.200]   and abundance and superabundance of life that they've received through the Spirit in Christ
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.200]   Jesus.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:13.840]   Well now there's the Bible, Old Testament preview, the New Testament showing the fullness.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:19.160]   It says somebody, "Yes, that's all right, but surely that was only for New Testament
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.200]   times.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.960]   We mustn't take these things too literally.
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.200]   We mustn't take New Testament history too literally.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.320]   That was only the beginning of the church."
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.720]   And things like that only happen at the beginning.
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.160]   You don't expect it to continue like that.
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:35.280]   Well I would have thought that that is one of the greatest denials of Scripture that
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.900]   is conceivable.
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:41.680]   The moment you begin to say like that, you are denying the teaching of the New Testament,
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:46.000]   the promise says the New Testament is to you and to your children and to as many as are
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   afar off.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.080]   If I believed that what I'm told here in the New Testament was only for the first generation
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:57.160]   of Christians and not for us today, my dear friends, I wouldn't be in this pulpit.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.160]   It's a lie, it's not true.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:06.280]   And of course it's not only wrong as understanding of the Scriptures, it's falsified completely
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:12.440]   by the long history and story of the Christian church.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:17.000]   And this is why one sometimes thinks that what people can do best in this matter is
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.280]   to just read the history of the church and the lives of the saints.
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:26.700]   And there you will see that what is described here continued.
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.320]   And you can read it in almost every century.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.600]   You read it in the early centuries.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:37.520]   You read the thrilling account of the first Christians, the confessors and the martyrs.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:43.440]   What a glorious body of people they were and how they rejoiced in this and how the spectators
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:48.640]   sitting in their comfortable seats in the arena in Rome, looking at these unfortunate
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:54.680]   people, these nobodies being thrown to the lions in the arena, could see a heavenly brightness
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.760]   shining from their faces which staggered them.
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.260]   They didn't understand it.
[00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.240]   But it was their life.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:08.200]   This fullness of Christ in them, making them more than conquerors as the New Testament
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.480]   had prophesied they would be.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.480]   Well now, there it is.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.480]   And you can come up.
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.560]   You can come up through the centuries.
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:20.040]   And as you read about these people, you'll find exactly the same thing.
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:26.640]   In all ages, in all countries, continents, climes, it's always the same.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:34.400]   And well, perhaps you get closer records and more personal records of this in the 18th
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:38.640]   century than any other time, although in the 17th century you will find it in many of the
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:43.040]   Puritans and from time to time I've quoted them to you here.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:48.240]   But when you come to the 18th century and you read of people like Jonathan Edwards and
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:54.080]   his wife and Whitefield and Howell Harris and the Wesley brothers, and there you see
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.760]   them describing this thing, how they were overwhelmed.
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:03.080]   Whitefield preaching and so preaching and preaching so much and too much that he was
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:07.520]   literally physically exhausted and could scarcely stand.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:11.520]   And his friends persuaded him to go and lie down on his bed and have a bit of a rest.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.120]   But he couldn't rest and sleep.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.120]   Why?
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:19.080]   Well, Christ was manifesting his love to him in such profusion and superabundance that
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.720]   he was thrilled by it and sleep was impossible.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.880]   Now that's the kind of thing about which we are speaking.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:31.480]   That's the kind of thing that is shown us here in this parable, in this miracle that
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.200]   was wrought of Cana in Galilee.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.440]   And it's equally true of all the others.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:41.720]   I could quote to you for the rest of this morning and for many other mornings out of
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:47.280]   the diaries and the journals of these various men, but God forbid that anybody again should
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:51.840]   say, "Oh, well, of course, but there you're dealing with very outstanding men."
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:56.040]   Well, I agree, I am dealing with outstanding men.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:01.120]   They were unusually gifted men, but at the same time it is true to say that they were
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.160]   men like all of us.
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:08.640]   And there was a time in their lives when with all their brilliant gifts they were very miserable
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.000]   and very unhappy people.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.260]   I could tell you about these men before this happened to them, before this great thing
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:21.720]   was done to them, I could show you them as unusually miserable men.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.720]   Yes, they were religious and they read their Bibles.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:32.280]   They not only did that, they spent time in prayer and they fasted twice a week and sometimes
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.280]   even more.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:39.120]   Undoubtedly, Whitefield permanently did harm to his health by over-fasting in those early
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.920]   days of his, when he was trying to make himself a Christian.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.400]   He'd read, you see, about this life of God in the souls of men.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:51.080]   He knew he hadn't got it and he wanted it and he thought that was the way to get it.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.440]   And he half killed himself.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.560]   But he was miserable, he was unhappy.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.080]   So it's nothing innate in the men.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:03.200]   You don't explain it in terms of a personality or in terms of human abilities or propensities
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.200]   or powers.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.440]   They are the same before and after.
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.160]   No, no, this is the gift of God.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:13.440]   As I'm showing you, this is the action of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.240]   The position remains hopeless until he decides to act.
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.800]   Then the whole position is entirely changed.
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:26.400]   And what is, I think, so wonderful therefore is this, that you find this kind of thing
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:33.400]   not only in the lives of these outstanding great men, great preachers, great thinkers
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:40.120]   and others, but you find it in the lives of the most ordinary people.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:45.080]   And that is why we should thank God that these greater men have recorded so much of the experiences
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:50.800]   given to them by the more ordinary people whose names we don't even remember.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.680]   But they participated in the same thing.
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:57.880]   And at every time of revival there is no distinction between great and small.
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.000]   The spirit wind bloweth where it listeth.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.760]   And he chooses people of all types and kinds.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:09.520]   And you will find some of the most ordinary people filled until their hearts are overflowing,
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:14.000]   almost incapable of expressing what they've received and what has happened to them.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.240]   Now that is the thing, I say, which we've got to realize, that it is his action.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:26.880]   And when he acts, he sheds abroad, he pours forth, with the result that out of our innermost
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:31.920]   parts there are streams of living water.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.200]   And the whole thing is overwhelming.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:40.080]   Well now let me sum it up again in those two verses out of John Royland's hymn.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:46.880]   He puts it so well, "No good in creatures can be found, but may be found in thee.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:54.160]   I must have all things and abound, while God is God to me.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:59.400]   He that hath made my heaven secure will here all good provide."
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:03.360]   Now here it is, listen to this logic, answer this if you can.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:09.540]   While Christ is rich, can I be poor?
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:10.880]   Is it possible?
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:14.240]   While Christ is rich, can I be poor?
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.040]   What can I want beside?
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.920]   I am in Christ.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.840]   He is the head of the body.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.600]   There is an organic, intimate relationship.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:30.120]   So John Royland puts the question, and it's a question in logic, while Christ is rich,
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:39.360]   and he is, he is the Lord of glory, he is the Lord of everything, while Christ is rich,
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.880]   can I be poor?
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.640]   There's a contradiction in terms here.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.280]   There's something wrong here.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.520]   Beloved Christian people, how can we be poor?
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.520]   What's the matter?
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.400]   There's something wrong somewhere isn't there?
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.560]   We are in him, we belong to him.
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:58.280]   He is our head, we are his people, and he is so rich.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:01.600]   The unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.320]   How can we be poor?
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.560]   What's the matter?
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.280]   Why don't we receive of his fullness?
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:09.600]   While Christ is rich, can I be poor?
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.400]   What can I want beside?
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:17.960]   You see, it's all due to our failure to realize the riches that are in him and our relationship
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:18.960]   to him.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:23.540]   We listen to the devil, we listen to our adversary, we listen to our own vain thoughts instead
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:26.120]   of believing the scriptures.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:31.720]   And here, God in his infinite tenderness through the spirit has even put it for us in a pictorial
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.720]   form.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:40.760]   You and I, there we are, we are like the people in the feast and we say there is no more wine.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:46.240]   We look to him and he arises and he gives the command, and there's a super abundance.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.240]   That's it.
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.680]   Very well, but let me go on with this.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.240]   You see, it's not confined to your John Ryland.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.280]   Take the hymn we've just been singing.
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:59.200]   In heavenly love abiding, no change my heart shall fear.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.600]   And safe is such confiding, for nothing changes here.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:03.600]   And on he goes.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:09.000]   Wherever, on she goes rather, wherever he may guide me, no one shall turn me back.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.120]   My shepherd is beside me and nothing can I lack.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.560]   His wisdom ever waketh, his sight is never dim.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.560]   He knows the way he taketh.
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:24.960]   And I will walk with him.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.920]   We sing these glorious hymns, but you know, these people wrote these hymns not because
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.720]   they were poets, primarily.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.640]   They were poets, but that isn't why they wrote their hymns.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:37.840]   There are many poets who don't write things like this, they write the exact opposite.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.320]   Many of your great poets like Keats can be atheists.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.760]   They couldn't write hymns like this.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.760]   Why?
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.080]   Well, because they knew nothing about it.
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.960]   These people are writing their experience.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.600]   So take one of the great poets, Charles Wesley.
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.840]   He was a great poet, a poet in his own right.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.880]   Had he never been a Christian, he would have been an outstanding poet.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:55.880]   He puts it like this.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:28:03.760]   Thou, O Christ, art all I want, more than all in thee I find.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:04.760]   Then he goes on.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:10.760]   Plenteous grace with thee is found, grace to cover all my sin.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:15.520]   Let the healing streams abound, make me, keep me, pure within.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:19.400]   Thou of life, the fountain of life.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.040]   That's it, he's the fountain of life.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.720]   In him was life, and the life was the light of men.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:30.520]   Thou of life, the fountain art, freely let me take of thee.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:36.800]   Spring thou up within my heart, rise to all eternity.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:37.800]   That's it.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.680]   Glorious poetry, isn't it?
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.520]   But oh, it's true experience.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.240]   There was a time when Charles Wesley couldn't have written that.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.560]   He couldn't have written that until May 1738.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.120]   He was in an exact opposite position.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:56.360]   But from May 1738, he's able to write like that.
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:03.120]   And you see, he writes again, thou hidden source of calm repose, thou all sufficient
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.560]   love divine.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.080]   That's his language.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.080]   Then listen to another.
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:15.080]   Loved with everlasting love, led by grace, that love to know, spirit breathing from above
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.280]   thou has taught me it is so.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:21.320]   Oh, this full, this perfect peace.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:27.760]   Oh, this transport all divine, in a love which cannot cease.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.960]   I am his, and he is mine.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.200]   You hear the echo of the song of Solomon.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:39.560]   It is the experience of God's people throughout the centuries, and in spite of all variations
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.040]   in circumstances and conditions.
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:46.640]   Now, my friends, I leave it at that.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.400]   But all I'm asking is this, do we know anything about this?
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:53.880]   Can we appropriate this language in any measure?
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.160]   This is what is being offered us in the New Testament.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.160]   This is true Christianity.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:05.360]   Not a man just managing to hold on, not a man with a great effort of the will just managing
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.880]   to keep himself religious.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.760]   Oh, in a sense, it's a terrible contradiction of what we have here.
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:15.520]   And of course, that's what's antagonized so many people from Christianity.
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:19.840]   If we give the impression that the main effect of Christianity is to make us miserable, well,
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:24.520]   then it's not surprising that 90% of the people of this country are outside the Christian
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:25.520]   church.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.680]   Miserable Christians, they say.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:28.680]   Look at them.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:33.360]   And they say they've got life, they've got the joy, they've got the fullness, and we
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.000]   are some negative, shame on us Christian people.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.160]   But it's not merely a question of shame on us.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:43.200]   What a terrible responsibility ours is.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:50.960]   If we are so misrepresenting this blessed, glorious gospel of the blessed God, we are
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.080]   meant to be filled to overflowing.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:57.680]   We are meant to say, "My cup runneth over.
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:03.360]   I have received of his fullness and grace upon grace."
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:11.080]   Well, that brings me to my next point, which is this, that this is not just some one experience
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.600]   which people get.
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.560]   Now, many fall into this trap.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.680]   It is something that goes on and increases.
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:24.920]   Here, this superabundance is characterized by just that.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:29.280]   It wasn't just a temporary supply given, and then again, they're without wine.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.560]   And back they have to go once more.
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:35.400]   But no, no, when he acts, it's enough for the whole occasion until everything's finished.
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:40.680]   And that's a picture of what he does in our lives and in our experiences.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:46.640]   Indeed, there is a phrase here which seems to me to put it all very beautifully and will
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.880]   help us to remember it.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.280]   It's the statement again of this governor of the feast.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:56.000]   He says, "Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine, and when men are well
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:04.280]   drunk, then that which is worse; but thou hast kept the good wine until now."
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:09.480]   Not the beginning, but now, much later on, when the proceedings had gone on for some
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:12.680]   time, towards the end, as it were.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.480]   And this is, I think, something very wonderful.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:19.560]   The best is at the end, my dear friends.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.800]   Now many seem to fail at this point.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:28.440]   I have always been more depressed, I think I can say quite truthfully, I have been more
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:35.200]   depressed than by anything else in my experience as a Christian and as a minister, by the kind
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:41.280]   of person who, whenever you meet him or her, will always for sure tell you the story of
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.960]   their conversion.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:49.600]   Many years ago, some of them perhaps fifty years ago, and they tell you that story every
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.720]   time and they go on repeating it.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.160]   I have known people do exactly the same thing with revival.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:59.720]   Now don't misunderstand me, there is a sense in which I can understand this.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:05.920]   There is something always about an initial experience which makes it remarkable and outstanding.
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:11.400]   A time of revival is such an amazing and wonderful time, it's not surprising people go on talking
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.400]   about it.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.800]   But you know, if they go on talking about it in this sort of way, as to give the impression,
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:24.240]   "Oh, it was wonderful, but they have had nothing since, and ever since they have been
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:30.320]   walking through a wilderness and travelling through a desert," well then I say, "It
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:33.480]   is absolutely wrong."
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.800]   But there are many Christian people like that.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:39.480]   All they can tell you about is what happened when they were converted, and nothing seems
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.480]   to have happened since.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:44.840]   Their idea of the Christian life is this dramatic thing perhaps when you come into it, but then
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:50.360]   from there on you just trudge along, and you are living in the strength of that and partly
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:53.120]   keeping a right turn backwards as you are going forwards.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.920]   My dear friends, this is quite wrong.
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:34:03.420]   This is really almost a denial of this essential principle, and thank God it is wrong.
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:10.600]   What a tragedy it would be if it were only the beginning of the Christian life which
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.160]   could be described in this way.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.160]   But it is wrong.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:19.640]   I will say once, if you will forgive me for giving a personal story, I do it in order
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:20.640]   to illustrate my point.
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:24.440]   I remember I was preaching in a certain part of the country and staying with a man who
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:29.760]   was the chairman of the education committee of his county.
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:33.920]   We were invited by the headmaster of the local grammar school to address the children in
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.880]   the afternoon, and we did so.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:43.920]   I made this older man speak first, and he did what I anticipated he would have done.
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.920]   He looked at the children.
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:49.560]   He was, you can imagine, the type of man from what I am going to tell you about him, one
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.360]   of the jovial types.
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:55.680]   He looked at them and he said, "Boys and girls, what wouldn't I give if I could only
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:57.240]   be back where you were?"
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.880]   That was wonderful.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.960]   Oh, to be a boy again!
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:01.960]   I am an old man now.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:05.200]   Oh, if I could only go back, I would give the whole world.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.040]   Well, when my time came to speak, I said the exact opposite.
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:12.320]   I said, "Boys and girls," I said, "I thank God I am not sitting where you are."
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:21.000]   "I thank God," I said, "I can tell you life gets better as it goes on."
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   And it can.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   I meant it.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.160]   I still mean it.
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.160]   But there is that attitude.
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.640]   It comes into the Christian life.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:28.640]   And my friends, it is wrong.
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.640]   It is a denial.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:34.400]   Listen, the Old Testament is clear even about this.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:41.400]   Let me read to you, for instance, something that we read way back in the 92nd Psalm.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.920]   Here is the Psalmist, remember, under the old dispensation.
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.960]   And this is how he puts it.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:51.560]   "The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree.
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:54.480]   He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:36:00.400]   Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:04.800]   They shall still bring forth fruit in old age.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.480]   They shall be fat and flourishing."
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:11.760]   Did you know where the expression "fat and flourishing" came from?
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.600]   That is where it comes from.
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.880]   Thank God that this is true.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:21.080]   If I am not a better preacher now than I was thirty years ago, shame upon me.
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:25.480]   I am a better preacher, I will tell you that, because this is a growing life.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.560]   It is an increasing life.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:31.760]   You don't just live on some original resources.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:32.760]   No, no.
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.120]   "They shall flourish in the courts of our God.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:40.040]   They shall still bring forth fruit in old age.
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.960]   They shall be fat and flourishing."
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.560]   The best is yet to be.
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.920]   The best is at the end.
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:51.840]   Listen to the prophet Isaiah, 46 and verse 4.
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:59.120]   "God says to him, 'And even to your old age I am he, and even to whorehairs will I carry
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.120]   you.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.880]   I have made you and I will bear you.
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.880]   Even I will carry you and I will deliver you.'"
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:06.880]   That's God.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:10.160]   He doesn't merely start and then abandon us.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.160]   No, no.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:17.720]   "Even to old age I am he, and even to whorehairs will I carry you.
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:23.360]   He has said, 'I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.'"
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:28.120]   And so, you see, when you come to the New Testament statement of all this, you remember
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:33.680]   how Paul, rising to one of his great mountain tops at the end of the third chapter of 2
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:39.680]   Corinthians, says, "We all with open face beholding," and going on it means, "as in
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:48.760]   a glass, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory."
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:49.760]   That's it.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:50.760]   That's the Christian life.
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:51.760]   It's progressive.
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.760]   It's expanding.
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:53.760]   It's increasing.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:58.040]   It's from glory to glory.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.240]   Changed from glory into glory.
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:04.200]   You don't just get born again and then remain there and remain static and just hold on to
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:08.000]   what you've got and rather give the impression that you've lost something wonderful.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.440]   The great thrill you had at the beginning is gone.
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:11.600]   It's run, my friends.
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:12.600]   That's not life.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.780]   That's machinery.
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:22.680]   This is a life that changes you from glory into glory, and it is endless and eternal.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:27.840]   Again, let me allow the poets to express it for us.
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:39.240]   "Streams of mercy never ceasing call for songs of loudest praise."
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:40.960]   Now this is the characteristic of this.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:51.200]   They are streams of mercy never ceasing, and they call for songs of loudest praise.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:57.360]   So the hymn I've already quoted goes on to say this, "Green pastures are before me,
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:00.240]   which yet I have not seen.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:05.040]   Bright skies will soon be all me where the dark clouds have been.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:08.720]   My hope I cannot measure.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:11.880]   My path to life is free.
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:19.200]   My Savior has my treasure, and He will walk with me."
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.640]   You see, this is it.
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:24.960]   Now, we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:33.000]   "Oh, I know in part, but then shall I know even as also I am known."
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.640]   Now this is the great characteristic of this life.
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:39.320]   Because it is life, it develops, it grows, it increases.
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:42.920]   It is merely one experience, and then you live in the memory of that.
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:43.920]   Not at all.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.200]   It goes on being repeated.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:51.200]   Now, if you examine the lives and biographies of the saints again, I think you will find
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:56.680]   that this is something that is constantly found in all their records.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.760]   And I say again, thank God for this.
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:05.280]   You will find that they went on enjoying this, and it went on, in a sense, deepening and
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.280]   increasing.
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:11.200]   And when you come to look at them on their deathbeds, well, as John Wesley put it, "Our
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.520]   people die well."
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:18.160]   Indeed, some of them had their greatest experiences of all on their deathbed.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:24.640]   There they received in yet greater measure than they had ever received before.
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:28.400]   And so I end on this note with this matter.
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:34.360]   The effect then ultimately of this is to increase our faith.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:40.840]   That is why John leaves the account of the miracle at Cana in Galilee in these words.
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:47.760]   He tells us here that this beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee and manifested
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:53.800]   forth his glory, and his disciples believed on him.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.960]   Now, they had already believed in him.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:56.960]   That's the point.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:01.240]   They were already disciples, and they had already believed.
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:06.600]   But as the result of this, they believed more than ever.
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:12.920]   And that is one of these great principles and rules in the whole of this Christian life.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:17.080]   The more you receive, the more you desire.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.080]   It encourages you.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:19.560]   It gives you proof.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.040]   And you know.
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:24.080]   And therefore, you seek him more and more.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:29.240]   Now, that's the argument, of course, of Paul in the third chapter of the epistle to the
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:30.240]   Philippians.
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:35.040]   Here's a man who'd experienced so much, but he still tells us in verse 10 and following
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:38.280]   that his desire is that I may know him.
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.280]   He knows him.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.360]   That's why he desires to know him.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.960]   He wants more and more.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:46.440]   And the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, etc.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:48.160]   Not as though I had already attained.
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.600]   What he means by that is I haven't got it all.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:51.760]   I haven't arrived at the end.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.120]   I haven't exhausted it.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:54.600]   Not as though I had already attained.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:56.120]   Either we're already perfect.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.040]   But I follow after.
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:01.920]   If that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:04.600]   Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.720]   I haven't got there.
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:07.040]   But this one thing I do.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:09.200]   Forgetting those things that are behind.
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:14.000]   And I feel sometimes like telling many Christian people that forget what's happened to you.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.480]   What's happened to you now is the question.
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.240]   And what are you expecting?
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:22.400]   Forgetting the things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.400]   before.
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:29.280]   I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.400]   Very well.
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:36.920]   All the effect of this then upon us should be to make us utter something like this.
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:40.720]   Oh Lord, I cast my care on thee.
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:43.040]   I triumph and adore.
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:52.080]   And henceforth my great concern shall be to love and please thee more.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.880]   Or take another one expressing it.
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:57.600]   Teach me to love thee as thine angels love.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.480]   One holy passion filling all my frame.
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:05.000]   The baptism of the heaven descended down.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.440]   My heart an altar and thy love the flame.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:14.000]   And God, we can quote these words of Horatius Bonner.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.560]   It blesses now and shall forever bless.
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:22.040]   It saves me now and shall forever save.
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.360]   It holds me up in days of helplessness.
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:27.840]   It bears me safely o'er each swelling way.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:36.760]   'Tis what I know of thee my Lord and God that fills my soul with peace, my life with
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:42.000]   song thou art my health, my joy, my staff, my rod.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.920]   Leaning on thee in weakness I am strong.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:52.960]   More of thyself, O grant me hour by hour.
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:58.400]   More of thy glory, O my God and Lord.
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:03.120]   More of thyself in all thy grace and power.
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:09.800]   More of thy love and truth, incarnate Word.
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:15.080]   Very well my friends, there it seems to me are the lessons of this first miracle performed
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:18.120]   by our Lord in Cana of Galilee.
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.120]   It's a picture.
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:27.080]   It opens our eyes to the possibilities of the glorious fullness of this Christian life.
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:37.920]   This life which is life indeed, life and life more abundantly, life without end, life developing
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:48.480]   and increasing until we find ourselves face to face with him, knowing no longer in part,
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:45:02.240]   but knowing even as we are already known and filled and glorified and made like unto him.
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:11.960]   May God by his Spirit give us the understanding to realize that all this is meant for us.
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:24.640]   This is Christianity of his fullness, of all we receive and grace upon grace.
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:26.640]   Amen.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:36.920]   Now let us sing this closing hymn of George Wesley's 471, though hidden source of calm
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:52.480]   repose, though all sufficient love divine.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:46:04.440]   471.
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:27.440]   Though hidden source of calm repose, though all sufficient love divine.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:44.440]   That hope from sin and freedom came, I would be filled with the flame of his.
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:58.440]   I would be filled with the flame of his, and his my life is full of love.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:19.440]   The holy King, the God of peace, the joy of everlasting love, to me he died in the early morning,
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:29.440]   the love of holy men died there.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:44.440]   He took my hope with a bow, my head because I needed faith,
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:59.440]   the nature of my brotherhood, before I reached him was my faith.
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:17.440]   I shall be the light of love, in faith my glory and my life.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:32.440]   Before my death he rose alive, in me there's my own ideal.
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:47.440]   Before my dying he awakes, my life in shame and trial.
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:49:06.440]   My life in shame, my life, my hope.
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:13.440]   And now unto him who is able to keep us from falling, and to present us faultless
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:22.440]   before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God, our Savior,
