[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.600]   the rough economic, fiscal, and monetary waters ahead.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.740]   Wish I had a more positive topic,
[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.040]   but that's what we gotta deal with today.
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.280]   Thankfully, I will share with you
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.680]   that I have arrived back home from my travels,
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.280]   and so I did make it home to be back with my family,
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.220]   and certainly I cut it pretty close.
[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.220]   I don't know if I was wise to take a trip
[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.220]   right in the middle of the chaos that I saw coming or not.
[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.220]   I thought I had enough time,
[00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.720]   and I thankfully did have enough time,
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.060]   but it was certainly an interesting,
[00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.200]   caused me to feel exposed to be away from the family
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.340]   and not sure with all the increasing travel restrictions
[00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.600]   whether I was gonna make it home or not.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.000]   So I did make it home,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.500]   and I've been busy, busy, busy the last couple of days
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.940]   doing kind of some next step preparations,
[00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.740]   which I won't talk too much about in this show,
[00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.420]   but I've just been busy getting ready
[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.520]   for the next step ahead.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.880]   Today I need to work very quickly,
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.560]   and so I'm gonna talk primarily about
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.480]   the economic, fiscal, and monetary path ahead,
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.120]   but we do of course need to understand first
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.020]   where we are with the current event.
[00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.460]   Obviously, the event that is causing
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.160]   this economic difficulty is the virus,
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.400]   the viral pandemic, COVID-19,
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.080]   as it is expanding all across the world.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.000]   Now, the good news is you can be confident
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.680]   that at some point in time this virus will end,
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.040]   this pandemic will end.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.080]   The unknown is how it will end and how long it will take.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.460]   Certainly at this point I would say at minimum
[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.220]   we're looking at a couple of months
[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.900]   of this kind of hardcore lockdown.
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.800]   We can see if the data from China is reliable,
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.940]   and if the data from South Korea,
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.540]   which is where we have better data
[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.600]   that's more reliable than the Chinese,
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.540]   if the data that we're getting is reliable,
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.200]   we can see that there is a path
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.240]   to stopping the massive proliferation and explosion
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.640]   of this particular disease,
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.920]   and that path involves severe social isolation.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.880]   That is the most reliable path
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.580]   to stop the spread of a viral pandemic,
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.000]   which is why social isolation
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.760]   and social distancing is so important.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.460]   At this point, my family and I,
[00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.120]   we are locked down in our compound here.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.240]   We're not going anywhere, we're not doing anything.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.300]   I may still go to the farmer's market and get groceries.
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.880]   That's where we get the majority of our groceries
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.140]   from the farmer's market.
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.340]   That seems like a modest risk activity.
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.840]   It's an outside market, it's not inside of closed space,
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.680]   so I really don't wanna start eating storage food
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.820]   if I don't have to, but we've canceled everything else,
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.360]   and so we are at home, and hundreds of millions of people
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.000]   all around the world are doing exactly the same thing.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.860]   They're just simply sitting at home.
[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.660]   Now, this certainly feels silly.
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.400]   It feels unnecessary because you look down and you say,
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.940]   okay, so there's 150 or 180,000 people sick
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.240]   that we know of for sure,
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.100]   and there's some tens of thousands of people who are severe.
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.820]   It seems silly to lock down the lives
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.540]   of billions of people, and yet we know
[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.780]   that this is necessary in order
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.520]   to stop the spread of the virus.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.860]   The major risk factor that is different
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.020]   from past pandemics is simply the mobility
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.700]   of people throughout the world.
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.420]   If we were to go back to the 1600s
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.860]   or go back to World War I, the great Spanish flu,
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.300]   people moved around the world, but fairly slowly,
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.300]   even though people were moving around the world a lot
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.700]   during the 1918 Spanish flu,
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.540]   it was still generally at the speed of a ship
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.220]   or generally at the speed of a train.
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.920]   Today, there's such a tremendous flow of people
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.220]   via airplane all around the world
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.780]   that the whole world has to respond at once,
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.580]   and so that's what we're seeing right now.
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.940]   The good news is this works, this works.
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.420]   If I'm not sick, right, if I didn't get sick in my travels,
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.860]   hopefully I didn't, but that's another reason
[00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.140]   why we are in quarantine, 'cause if I got sick
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.000]   in an airplane or in the airport,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.280]   I don't wanna pass it along to any of my neighbors,
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.900]   but if I'm not sick and I just simply sit here in my house
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.320]   and do nothing that brings me into physical contact
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.920]   with another human being, I'm not going to get sick.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.380]   Now, how long that's practical depends, right?
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.940]   I can certainly do that for months.
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.220]   I can sit here and I can work, and I can,
[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.060]   we have enough food, we can stay here for months.
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.420]   I don't have to go anywhere,
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.780]   and so many people can do that as well,
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.220]   and the risk is relatively modest.
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.880]   Even if you live in a big city and you just leave the house
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.740]   to go to the grocery store, you'll see grocery stores
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.520]   continuing to expand their limited hours.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.800]   You'll see grocery stores continuing to limit
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.240]   the number of shoppers at one time.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.180]   This is both to, in addition to their rationing,
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.120]   which they're doing right now,
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.900]   this is to extend the supplies of food.
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.500]   It's also to minimize the amount of human contact.
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.760]   I'm thrilled to see grocery stores coming out with policies
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.200]   such as reserving their first hour of open business
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.040]   to high-risk individuals.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.400]   They can go through the store at night,
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.400]   they can restock the shelves with the supply
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.700]   that they have available,
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.500]   they can clean and disinfect everything,
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.300]   disinfect the carts, clean everything,
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.920]   and then allow elderly people or high-risk individuals in
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.560]   to shop when everything is clean.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.840]   I think that's wonderful,
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.660]   and I think you'll see more and more things
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.040]   like that happening.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.160]   So this social distancing strategy works.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.880]   It's basically the only strategy
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.660]   that's pretty much guaranteed.
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.820]   The problem and the question comes down to how does it end?
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.840]   There are a few ways that it could end.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.840]   It can end by just simply the health officials
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:24.380]   being able to get on top of the individual cases,
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.540]   the people who are actually infected.
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.620]   This comes if you have widespread testing
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.080]   and the people have confidence in the test results,
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.980]   then the social distancing can be enacted simply
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.500]   through just quarantining the infected persons,
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.540]   and many other people can go back to their lives.
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.960]   You see, that's what has happened in China.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.560]   Now that China has done extensive testing,
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.280]   they've instituted a mobile application using the data
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.900]   that they have on all of their individual citizens,
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.940]   demonstrating high-risk versus low-risk individuals.
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.740]   And so if you're gonna go and get on the train in China,
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:59.880]   you have to show your mobile app
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.420]   that's tracking your every move,
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.660]   and it says, "Yes, I'm low-risk,
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:03.720]   "and I can go on the train."
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.020]   That's why they're getting life back to productivity
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.520]   and back to generating some economic activity,
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.540]   back to some semblance of normal.
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.140]   Now, will that happen in the United States of America?
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.220]   Maybe, have a hard time seeing it.
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.640]   Will that happen in India?
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.340]   Have a hard time seeing it.
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.740]   Will that happen in Nigeria?
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.060]   I have a hard time seeing it.
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.280]   Will that happen in Mexico, in Canada?
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.880]   It's a little bit different.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.140]   China has inoculated its citizens to be comfortable
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.540]   with government oversight of everything.
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.000]   For years now, they've been running the social credit score.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.440]   And so individual citizens in China
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.560]   are used to having every detail of their life
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.520]   managed by the government.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.760]   I'm not putting an app on my phone.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.840]   I don't care what public health benefit there is.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.440]   I'm just not gonna do it.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.120]   I don't trust any government official that much,
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.240]   and I think that I'm well-warranted in that suspicion.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.480]   And so you even see the US government
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.760]   trying to get more data.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.420]   If they do that, I won't have a phone anymore.
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.260]   My phones will be sitting in a Faraday bag,
[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.020]   and I won't even be touching them.
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:13.620]   I just simply do not trust that.
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.600]   I think we have far too much historical evidence
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.980]   of how that data is exploited.
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.000]   And in the past, it was,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.580]   when we see the destruction that happened in the past,
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.980]   you think back to Germany prior to World War II,
[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.940]   and how the development, IBM and the computer systems
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.860]   that they developed and the census that they accomplished,
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.160]   and how that was used to almost exterminate
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.240]   an entire religious and ethnic group of people.
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.240]   It's just the historic,
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.080]   I'm much more fearful of that than I am of a virus.
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.640]   If you think back to how the census data
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.260]   was used in the United States
[00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.300]   to lock up the Japanese during World War II,
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:00.300]   it's just, those things are so obvious that it's,
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.640]   to me, I think it's absolutely foolhardy
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.760]   to participate in any kind of system like that.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.020]   Even though the Chinese are currently using it
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.520]   to stem the flood of the virus,
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:17.920]   I don't deny that it can be useful for that,
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.440]   but it's, they've also been systematically locking up
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.780]   and exterminating religious minorities,
[00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.200]   Christians, Muslims,
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.880]   and they've been doing that for decades.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.480]   It's just, it's horrific.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.500]   And so, if you care about human rights,
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.960]   I don't see how you ever give any government
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.060]   that kind of power.
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.060]   So, I'm not gonna be participating in those kinds of things.
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.880]   I don't even participate in a census.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.520]   So, if you're gonna participate in a census,
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.200]   the only thing you should do is simply,
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.880]   the only thing that is legally required
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.520]   is you say, this is the address
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.320]   and this is the number of persons involved.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.160]   That is it.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.480]   That's all the information
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.400]   that your government needs from you.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.840]   It's just simply the number of persons there.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.160]   That way, they can appropriately
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.480]   set out congressional districts,
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.060]   that they can appropriately choose
[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:04.700]   the number of congressional representatives
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.740]   for each state, for each district.
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:07.580]   That's it.
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.420]   It's just a population count.
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.700]   And there's no data more than that that's needed.
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.300]   And there is major danger
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.740]   of providing that detailed level data.
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:20.500]   The historical analogs are just simply horrific
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.900]   when you study them through.
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:26.400]   Forgive the tangent, but back to the task at hand.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.100]   So, the good news is that the crisis will end
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:29.940]   at some point.
[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.340]   So, it can end with social distancing
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.540]   being effective enough to get on top of new cases
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.900]   and it can start to be quarantined down.
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.860]   You see this in successful disease management,
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.620]   even with diseases like Ebola.
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.400]   Once they're able to get ahead of the community spread,
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.040]   you can start to stamp it out.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.540]   It could also end with improved therapeutic treatment.
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.220]   The therapeutic treatment could sufficiently
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.060]   be effective.
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:54.880]   New drugs could be developed that are effective
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.260]   in beating the infection.
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.180]   It's possible it could be treated
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.540]   with some sort of vaccine, if that were developed
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:02.820]   and if it were considered to be safe
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.720]   and if there were widespread development of it,
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.260]   then that would be a possible outcome of it.
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.760]   Or it could just simply be managed
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.660]   with a continual low-level scenario
[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.940]   in which the medical infrastructure
[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.460]   was able to handle the number of serious critical cases
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.660]   and most people say, "I've gotta get back to work."
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:19.740]   We don't know.
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.860]   I don't see how the viral event
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.540]   is anything less than a couple of months, though.
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.380]   As I've watched the timing development,
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.780]   for example, you see leaders of nations,
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.620]   the president of France, the president of the United States,
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.500]   say, "We've gotta go on lockdown for 15 days."
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.800]   I think that's good and 15 days is probably good.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.700]   I don't think 15 days is gonna eventually be long enough
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.700]   just simply because it will have an effect,
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.700]   but probably when you get to the end of 15 days,
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.640]   they're gonna say, "We need a little bit more time."
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.460]   It would seem if we study the lessons learned in Wuhan,
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.300]   it would seem that a month would be kind of the minimum.
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.900]   And then for time to get back,
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.580]   even if a month were able to completely stop the spread,
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.540]   you had total complete compliance,
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.940]   which is a big if, a big question mark,
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:06.180]   it still seems a little bit short.
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.860]   A month seems to me to be the minimum.
[00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.540]   And I think that the government representatives
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.040]   who are trying to manage it probably know that,
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.300]   but they're not sure of it any more than I'm sure of it.
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.300]   They're thinking, "Let's start with 15 days.
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.960]   "It's easier to announce 15 days
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.720]   "than it is to announce two months."
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.980]   And so then people that in terms of social management,
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.580]   the biggest danger in a situation like this
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.940]   is human psychology,
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.400]   panic that destroys the supply lines, everything.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.420]   Just the contagion of human psychological panic
[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.720]   is the number one risk.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.060]   And so they're trying to manage that.
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.300]   And government officials know
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.280]   that they can't simply lie anymore.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.620]   They can't say, "Oh, it's not a big deal.
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:45.860]   "We're gonna beat this virus back
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.300]   "and we're well on top of it."
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.380]   They know that that is not gonna be believed.
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.260]   And so now their public position has to go to,
[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.000]   this is a serious problem.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:56.920]   But then little by little,
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.720]   they ramp up the potential effects.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.440]   And so you start to see government officials
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.720]   giving more serious warnings.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.240]   And that gives time for the human population
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.440]   to come to terms with the seriousness of the event.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.200]   So that's what you're seeing right now.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.920]   Now, your guess is as good as mine,
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.880]   but in my mind, I would say I see a minimum
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.500]   of a couple of months.
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.280]   Now, I do think a lot can change in a couple of months.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.480]   Possibly we'll get some relief due to warmer weather.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.580]   That might have some impact.
[00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.480]   Possibly we'll be able to get on top of the quarantining.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:34.480]   Possibly new therapeutic methodologies
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.420]   will be developed by the doctors who are studying this.
[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.880]   Two months is a lot of time for things to happen.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.640]   And we'll come up with some new solutions
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.440]   and new opportunities of things that could happen, possibly.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.280]   But we don't know.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.600]   So maybe this is longer term.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.200]   But even a month or two is certainly devastating.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.000]   Now, I've talked about the economic problems,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.920]   and those should be by now be completely apparent to you.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.720]   You right now have on a global basis,
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.160]   almost every country and every economy in the world
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:08.160]   freezing a huge percentage of their economic activity.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.060]   Now, it's not every country yet,
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:14.440]   but it will likely be every country very soon.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.560]   About the only countries that can be spared
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.240]   would be countries that took very early action
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.680]   to close their borders.
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.400]   I think this is what you see happening in Russia,
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.240]   for example.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.240]   Russia has continuing to experience
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.000]   strong economic activity.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.720]   And I think that's for two reasons.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.360]   Number one, Russia has very difficult border controls
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.200]   with a lengthy visa process for anybody who wants to come.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.240]   And so there are only a small number of countries
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.600]   that can travel to Russia with visa-free access.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.740]   And most people have to go through a process
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.960]   of visiting Russia by obtaining a visa.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.360]   And that process takes generally at least a week or two,
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.600]   a couple of weeks to finalize.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.400]   And so there are fewer people,
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.080]   there's fewer people traveling in and out of Russia
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.600]   than there is in other places.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.360]   In addition, Russia was very quick
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.840]   to close their borders completely.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.520]   They sealed off their border with China.
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.500]   And at this point,
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.560]   they've been very quick to close other things.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.520]   And so I think they got ahead of the curve
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.880]   by locking down people coming in.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.880]   Now, that assumes that the data is accurate.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.520]   I don't have any reason to believe it's not,
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:16.880]   but we'll see in time.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.420]   And so a country like Russia
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:20.120]   can still be at that initial phase
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.560]   where they're just simply containing the individuals
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.680]   and they don't have to lock down all of the economy.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.200]   And so, and that's, if that's true,
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.820]   if they've been able to quarantine the individuals,
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.920]   there's no reason why they would have to lock down
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.200]   the entire economy.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.300]   If you have a nation,
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.280]   and if that nation has sealed borders
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.600]   with no people coming in and no people going out,
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.800]   and the virus is outside of the borders,
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.960]   except in a few, several dozens of cases inside,
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.200]   and those people inside the borders are quarantined,
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.320]   and if all the people
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.400]   that they've come in contact with are quarantined,
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.400]   then that can be sufficient
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.800]   to stop the spread of a viral pandemic.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.800]   And that's what countries tried in the beginning.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.620]   It's just simply that in many countries,
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.720]   there was not enough testing
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.360]   and there was too many people infected.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.480]   And once you get to thousands
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.880]   of thousands of people infected,
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:10.400]   there's just no way to pursue that strategy anymore.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.880]   And so the locking down the borders,
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.080]   that's happening all around the world.
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.360]   Point is that you can see
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.920]   this is obviously economically devastating,
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.540]   completely devastating.
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.080]   And this is only just getting started.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.240]   Now, I've spoken extensively in previous shows
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.800]   about the economic impacts.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.720]   You can see that happening right now.
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.540]   Our neighbors are hurting.
[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.200]   There's no other way around it.
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.680]   Our neighbors are hurting.
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.700]   But it's only just getting started.
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:38.420]   If you actually look at what's happened,
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:42.100]   very few people have actually missed their first paycheck.
[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.700]   People are starting to get laid off,
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:44.660]   but there's still,
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:45.660]   you're being paid for the work
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.180]   that you did a week or two ago.
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.100]   It's only getting started.
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.700]   And so we're still at a situation,
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.300]   we're still in a scenario
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:56.140]   in which the actual effects are not being
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:00.820]   really felt yet.
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.740]   Many employers are still trying to keep their staff.
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.220]   Many employers are still trying to say,
[00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:06.740]   well, let's cut overtime.
[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.700]   Let's keep staff, et cetera.
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.380]   Some employers have reserves.
[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.240]   They're trying to figure out how to keep those reserves.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.420]   They're figuring out what they can do
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:14.860]   that's just a minimum amount
[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:16.620]   to keep their employment staff.
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:18.700]   But we're just getting started.
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:22.420]   And I think you need to honestly recognize that fact.
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.260]   This is just getting started.
[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.340]   It may feel exhausting by this time,
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:28.700]   but we're just getting started.
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:33.020]   And so the rippling effects
[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:36.380]   are gonna continue to be felt broadly, broadly, broadly.
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.380]   If you're a landlord, for example,
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:43.380]   and you make your money collecting rents from your tenants,
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.140]   it's unlikely that any of your tenants
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.560]   have missed any payments yet.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.020]   There's not really any reason
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.860]   except for the moral hazard of new laws,
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.180]   which we'll come to in a moment.
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:57.580]   But it's just getting started economically.
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:00.100]   Now, my concerns economically
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.320]   have been extremely high for a while,
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.300]   but now my concerns about monetary and fiscal policy
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:06.700]   are growing.
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:07.700]   And I think you need to think,
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.540]   we need to talk briefly about this
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.980]   because you need to understand how severe this is.
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:18.700]   I'm going to differentiate fiscal policy
[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.220]   versus monetary policy.
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:21.860]   This is normal in macroeconomics.
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.500]   Fiscal policy is generally considered
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.120]   to be the behavior and the actions of a government
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.800]   in terms of how that government runs their finances.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:33.580]   It comes into taxation policy, spending policy, et cetera.
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.740]   That's lumped in under fiscal policy.
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.860]   Monetary policy is when you have a Federal Reserve Bank,
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.860]   a national bank for a country, like in the United States,
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.100]   even though it's not a governmental entity,
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:45.940]   it's a private entity,
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.300]   you have the Federal Reserve Board
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.940]   that runs the money supply.
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:52.020]   And so you see the actions of the Federal Reserve
[00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.980]   trying to bring in monetary stimulus
[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.540]   and trying to bring in cut rates.
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:58.860]   They're trying to,
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:03.340]   eliminating cash reserve requirements for banks,
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:06.820]   dramatically increasing the amount of money,
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:09.620]   quantitative easing, various softening of regulations,
[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.420]   trying to pump money in,
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.860]   in order to keep employment up
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.220]   and make money easily available
[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.340]   so that people will stay economically active,
[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.860]   and then to keep inflation down.
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.740]   That's the dual fold mandate of the Federal Reserve.
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.780]   Now, fiscal policy is the actions of the government.
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:26.940]   And so you see right now,
[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.940]   you see major changes and major cries
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.460]   across the political spectrum for people to do something,
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:36.780]   do something to relieve the pain.
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:40.540]   Now, these are very, in some ways, predictable,
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:43.260]   but this is dangerous territory.
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.820]   And I am deeply concerned about what happens.
[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:50.100]   Now, you can take a mainstream perspective,
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:54.980]   and let's assume that you believe in modern monetary theory.
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.820]   You believe that the Federal Reserve of the United States,
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:01.500]   and I know that you may be an international listener,
[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.460]   it's just, of course, being a US American myself,
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.620]   it's very difficult for me to properly understand
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.780]   what the Guatemalan government is doing,
[00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:13.460]   while also considering what the Indian government is doing
[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:14.940]   and the Canadian, I cannot,
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.700]   I'm not competent to do it internationally.
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.540]   So I need to focus on the United States,
[00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.900]   but you interpret this for your country of residence
[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.500]   and/or countries of concern.
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:28.100]   Let's assume that you believe in modern monetary theory,
[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:31.020]   believe in modern, in the Federal Reserve system,
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.620]   that you believe that the Federal Reserve
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:36.620]   is a necessary and effective control mechanism
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:45.460]   that can properly stimulate the economy
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:48.460]   during difficult times and then properly pull back.
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.920]   You're a Keynesian through and through,
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.960]   you're convinced that this system works.
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.300]   I'm not, but let's assume that you are.
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.660]   In these kinds of situations,
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:03.900]   you have to at least admit that this balance,
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.540]   striking this balance is extraordinarily difficult.
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:12.460]   Figuring out how to do things just enough,
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:17.860]   but not too much, is extraordinarily difficult.
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:23.460]   There are many learned investors,
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.020]   there are many learned economists
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:27.820]   who applaud the massive action
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.940]   that the US Federal Reserve Board
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.860]   has taken over the last week
[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:36.500]   and is still taking day by day a new announcement comes out.
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.560]   And so there are many people who applaud that
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.340]   as doing the right thing.
[00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.580]   And you see that reflected, for example, in the stock market.
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.580]   You'll see big, lots of money here,
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.380]   lots of free money and the stocks go up, right?
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.140]   And then the next day something else happens
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.900]   and things change.
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.700]   So maybe this is all true.
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.180]   Maybe this is exactly what's needed
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.220]   and maybe this is right.
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.340]   But it's at least extraordinarily risky
[00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:01.500]   and extraordinarily delicate to get the balance right.
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.740]   And it's hard for me to believe
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:05.420]   that the balance is gonna be gotten exactly right.
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.460]   Now, maybe it's just a minor difference,
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:11.460]   but it's a very, very difficult place to be.
[00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.300]   Time will tell.
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:18.020]   I hope that they get it right.
[00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:21.140]   I hope that this is just another bump in the road
[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:24.020]   and we get back to life is good and everything is fine.
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:28.700]   But we're at the level in terms of the economic risk.
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:32.020]   This is certainly at the level that comparing it
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.840]   to the Great Depression in the United States
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.720]   is not unwarranted.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.220]   Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin,
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.300]   how do you say his name?
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:42.220]   I don't listen to news.
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.140]   I don't know how to say his name.
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:47.860]   I just read it, Mnuchin, probably.
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:50.300]   M-N-U-C-H-I-N, however you pronounce his name.
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.140]   I don't know.
[00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:57.180]   He was quoted as using an example case of 20% unemployment
[00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:03.140]   and some of his scenarios that he was recently discussing.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.780]   That quickly made the headlines about 20% unemployment.
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.220]   Now then, it was quickly walked back.
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.180]   No, we're not predicting this.
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.100]   We're not saying this.
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.780]   We're just saying this is an example of what could happen.
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:14.400]   Well, this is certainly a valid example of what could happen.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.460]   If you look around you at the percentage of people
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:21.500]   who are being impacted by current events,
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.980]   it sure seems like more than 20% of the economy to me.
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.900]   It sure seems like much more than that.
[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:30.140]   And so to say that that could lead to 20% unemployment
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:33.740]   does not to me seem to be a stretch.
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:34.740]   Time will tell.
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.620]   But 20% of unemployment is devastating.
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:38.460]   It's devastating.
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.540]   That's the level of unemployment that was experienced
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.660]   during the Great Depression in the United States.
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:43.880]   Totally devastating.
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.000]   Let me go now to fiscal policy.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.820]   What concerns me greatly,
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:52.980]   well, first, what can we be grateful for?
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:57.360]   We can be thankful that this current economic crisis
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:02.360]   has come after a period of somewhat strong economy.
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.420]   I think that we would certainly acknowledge
[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:07.540]   that economic activity has been high for the past years.
[00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:11.100]   Unemployment has been historically low for the past years.
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.340]   And this has been great.
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:13.740]   The stock market was high.
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.020]   People were feeling good.
[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.020]   Things were happening.
[00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:17.900]   And that was great for a lot of people.
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:21.260]   And so you would think that hopefully this means
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.300]   that some households were strengthened
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.440]   during periods of high employment.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.500]   Perhaps they were able to set aside savings.
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.940]   They were able to engage in prudent planning, et cetera.
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.180]   Now, if you believe that,
[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.980]   I don't know where you get that evidence.
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.700]   Because my observation,
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.040]   which is only being strengthened by my opinion,
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.800]   which is being strengthened right now,
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.540]   is that generally the vast majority
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.420]   of modern US Americans at least
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.340]   simply have completely forgotten
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:53.300]   about the idea of thrift and frugality and saving.
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.560]   Outside of putting money into a retirement account,
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:57.820]   it seems as though most people
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:00.340]   have almost no concept of saving anymore,
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.260]   that everything is fueled by debt.
[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:04.700]   And so I hope I'm wrong,
[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.580]   but there's such a tiny percentage of people
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.860]   who probably use that period of high employment
[00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:10.660]   to set aside reserves.
[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:14.680]   And because the saving that most people do
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.860]   is in the stock market, they're hurting.
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.060]   Many people,
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.740]   and especially in the personal finance community,
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.140]   have, "Oh, I've got a three-month emergency fund,
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.260]   "but I've got hundreds of thousands
[00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:24.700]   "always in the stock market."
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:25.760]   That's crazy.
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.780]   Because now your stocks are down 20, 30%, possibly,
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:31.020]   depending on how your portfolio is allocated,
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.900]   and you've got a mere three-month emergency fund.
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.460]   Well, three-month emergency fund is good,
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:39.020]   but if I'm right, and I hope I'm wrong,
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:39.860]   but if I'm right,
[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.500]   all of a sudden that three-month emergency fund
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.620]   starts to feel a little bit light
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.140]   when you look forward at the coming months
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.940]   of potential economic hardship.
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.060]   So, and the number of people
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:54.940]   with a three-month emergency fund is vanishingly small.
[00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:58.260]   So let's go back to where we were.
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:00.700]   So good thing is that the economy has been pretty good
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.860]   over the past couple of years, generally speaking.
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:07.700]   But how good has the budget been
[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:09.420]   for the United States of America?
[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:11.820]   Well, of course, I've talked about this a lot,
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:14.320]   but I want to emphasize to you
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.580]   that the US government was running this year,
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.840]   prior to the emergence of COVID-19,
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.520]   was planning on a $1 trillion deficit.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:28.740]   The US government, prior to the emergence of COVID-19,
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:32.100]   was running a $1 trillion deficit
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.960]   during a booming economy.
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:38.820]   Now what?
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:42.760]   What happens when now we add everybody clamoring
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.980]   for free money for everyone to that?
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.260]   Where does that come from?
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:49.340]   The first thing you have to ask is,
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:52.300]   is it likely that we'll get lots of free money?
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.940]   I don't see any way to stop it.
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:58.340]   Generally, historically in the United States,
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:00.620]   Republicans have had more sympathy
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:04.440]   for financial conservatism than they have now.
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:09.920]   That has completely disappeared over the past years.
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:13.720]   The Republicans oversaw a $1 trillion deficit
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:16.480]   when they had control of Congress
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.780]   and they had control of the House, sorry, same thing,
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.500]   the House of Representatives and the Senate
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.060]   and the presidency.
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.940]   They didn't rein in any kind of government spending.
[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:28.760]   They didn't repeal Obamacare.
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.380]   They just continued to spend money like crazy.
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.940]   You have at the head of the Republican Party,
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.580]   you have a president who is not known
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.020]   for his thrift and frugality.
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.580]   And he's very much a populist figure
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:40.860]   who wants to appeal to the people
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.620]   and he wants to be seen as moving fast.
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:43.820]   So you see the headlines.
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:45.780]   President Trump says, "We're gonna deliver money fast.
[00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.540]   "We're gonna do it within the next two weeks."
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:49.200]   Now maybe that's what's needed, right?
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.640]   Maybe I'm completely wrong.
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.340]   I often am, right?
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.660]   Maybe that's what's needed.
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:58.400]   But regardless, how is somebody gonna stand up
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.760]   and rein that in?
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.540]   Now on the other side, so on the Republican side,
[00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:06.780]   there are no prominent fiscal hawks like there once were.
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:09.100]   Nobody is loud about stopping that.
[00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:11.160]   On the Republican side,
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.120]   Republican congressional representatives and senators
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.020]   have learned that to oppose President Trump
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.260]   is very dangerous politically.
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:22.180]   And so if President Trump is openly hawking the need
[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.660]   for lots of money for Americans,
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.580]   it's hard to see how a Republican stands up
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.780]   and says something against that.
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:31.100]   On the Democratic side, there is no,
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:34.340]   I'm not aware of any prominent Democrat
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:39.140]   who believes in and advocates for fiscal conservatism
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:40.060]   in any way.
[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.280]   We're going through the last stages
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.580]   of a Democratic presidential primary
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.940]   in which it seems like a race to see who can promise
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:50.140]   more money, more bigger government programs to anybody.
[00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:53.020]   And so where is the political restraint gonna come in?
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.080]   I even think historically,
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.700]   if you were to go back to 2008 and the financial crisis,
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:00.340]   if you remember, there was a major outcry
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:03.620]   on behalf of US American society saying that,
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.660]   "No, we should not bail these banks out.
[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:06.940]   "We should not bail these people out."
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:09.900]   And the first bill in the fall of 2008 failed,
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:13.820]   the big stimulus TARP bill failed because of that outcry.
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:15.940]   And then all of a sudden, I can't remember which firm it was,
[00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:17.780]   somebody went bankrupt, blah, blah, blah.
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.420]   And now everyone said, "Oh, okay, we've got to act."
[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:21.820]   And then everyone started to act
[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:23.540]   and all the Republicans started signing for it
[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:26.500]   and they passed TARP and the big bailout funds
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.900]   against the outcry of the American people.
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.340]   Now, if you were a politician looking back on that,
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:35.580]   you would see that, "Hey, you know what, that worked."
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:38.140]   'Cause you could make an argument that that worked.
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.020]   You could also make a very strong argument that it didn't,
[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:41.980]   that it just postponed the inevitable,
[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.860]   but you could make an argument that that worked.
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:45.660]   And what I would say is that it seems to me
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:48.860]   that there's a very different US general population,
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:52.860]   a very different citizenry, a very different voter base
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:55.020]   than existed in 2008.
[00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:57.260]   In 2008, you had the Tea Party movement,
[00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:59.580]   fiscal conservatism and we're not gonna spend money
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.220]   and no new tax, blah, blah, blah.
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:04.180]   2020, where is that?
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.340]   Where are those people?
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:09.820]   I'm in that camp ideologically.
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:12.900]   I don't have any friends really that really believe that.
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.500]   Everybody has gone all in on big government.
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:18.100]   And so I don't expect even that kind of restraint.
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.700]   And so I think that some version
[00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.620]   of these massive new programs is going to spend.
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.540]   Now, whether it's $1,000 a month
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:26.620]   or $10,000 of free money for everyone,
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:28.140]   something's gonna get spent.
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:31.740]   Well, now let's go back to the basics of government.
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.540]   Where does the government get money?
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:35.980]   Let's say you're running the US government,
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:36.820]   you're trying to sit down and say,
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.580]   how do I increase my income?
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.580]   Where does the US government get money?
[00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:45.220]   Well, it could come from some form of user fees, right?
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.380]   Maybe you fund the national park system by park entrances.
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:51.660]   That is an almost meaningless number
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:54.700]   in terms of the global expenditures of the US government.
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.420]   Yes, you have to pay 100 and whatever dollars
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:57.900]   for a passport and yes, you have to pay
[00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:59.660]   to go into a national park system,
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:01.860]   but user fees are a tiny percentage.
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.460]   They're almost not even worth thinking about.
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.460]   But yes, user fees do exist.
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:06.620]   What's the next big thing?
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.780]   Well, taxes.
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.500]   That's where most money comes from is taxes.
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.220]   Even though there's a $1 trillion deficit,
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.020]   there's still trillions of other dollars of tax revenue.
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:19.820]   Well, what's gonna happen with tax revenue this year?
[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:24.540]   Because so much tax revenue is tied to income
[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:27.560]   and income taxes fund a huge percentage
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.380]   of the tax base for the US federal government,
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:33.980]   tax revenues are going down because incomes are going down.
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.380]   Do you think that investors are gonna be paying
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:40.140]   lots of capital gains taxes on their tax returns this year?
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.140]   That's where most of the tax revenue is from the wealthy
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:43.500]   is in capital gains taxes.
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.260]   And where are they gonna be experiencing
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:46.560]   major capital gains?
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:50.180]   So capital gains revenues are going down.
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:51.540]   What about income taxes?
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:52.380]   Do you think a lot of people
[00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.860]   are gonna be increasing their incomes this year?
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:56.980]   You're gonna have losses everywhere
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:58.480]   across the tax base.
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.900]   Many business owners are gonna be reporting business losses.
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:05.220]   Many individual employees are gonna be having
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:08.560]   severe cuts in income, if not going down to nothing.
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.420]   So you're gonna have major decreases in tax revenue
[00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:14.220]   just simply due to the economy being pulled back.
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:16.940]   And this is obvious when especially when you base
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:18.920]   an entire system on income taxes.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:22.200]   Now, in addition to that,
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:25.300]   there'll probably be some version of tax cuts.
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:29.080]   You've seen proposals about tax cuts on payroll taxes.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.820]   There'll probably be some version of tax cuts
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:34.100]   because especially politically,
[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:36.740]   generally Republicans will want to advocate
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:39.140]   for some form of tax cut
[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.140]   rather than just giving away free money.
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:46.420]   And so maybe some kind of tax cut proposal goes through.
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:48.460]   Regardless of any changes in tax code,
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.200]   tax revenues are going down.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.080]   So that's the big source of government revenue.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.260]   Tax revenues are going down.
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.340]   Well, remember, we already had a trillion dollar deficit
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:57.440]   during a good economy.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.300]   Well, what about the next source?
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:01.800]   Well, the next source is debt.
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:05.700]   The US government can finance its debt,
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:07.500]   finance its spending through the creation of debt,
[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:08.740]   the purchasing of debt.
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.900]   And I think that this is an area where the debt market
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:12.700]   will probably continue to be strong.
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.640]   You see that people still believe,
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.560]   many investors still believe in the safety
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.620]   of US federal debt because the US federal debt,
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.980]   the federal government has unlimited taxing ability.
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:23.740]   They've never defaulted on a debt payment.
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.820]   And so you'll have the issuance
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:27.940]   of billions of dollars of new debt.
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:30.620]   Maybe so, right?
[00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:34.260]   That's probably the least damaging for right now
[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:36.420]   because there's still significant room
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.820]   where the government can borrow a lot more money.
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:41.140]   It's not quite so short term
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:42.860]   in terms of the amount of money they can borrow.
[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:44.900]   That's probably least damaging.
[00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:47.820]   But then the third area is inflation, right?
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:50.140]   That's the third way other than, sorry, fourth way, I guess,
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:52.580]   user fees, taxes, debt, and then inflation.
[00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:54.540]   Governments can inflate away their debt
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:57.980]   by just simply increasing the monetary supply
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:01.420]   and making their repayment of the debt
[00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:05.340]   using less dollars that are worth less.
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:06.980]   So if you think about these scenarios,
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:08.720]   these are what you have to face.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:11.360]   Where is it gonna come from?
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.320]   Well, either of those scenarios is bad,
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:17.860]   meaning the two probable ones, debt and inflation.
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.380]   User fees aren't gonna increase,
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:22.420]   and those are meaningless anyway.
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:24.060]   Taxes aren't gonna increase.
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:26.420]   Nobody, not even the most staunch Democrat
[00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:28.180]   during this time of this crisis is gonna go out
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:30.260]   and say we need to increase taxes, even on the wealthy.
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:31.140]   No one's gonna do it.
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:32.520]   They don't do it during times of crisis.
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:33.860]   They've never done it.
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:36.300]   You send me the articles if you find somebody doing it.
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.620]   But when times are booming,
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:40.860]   then you'll have candidates such as Senator Warren
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:43.820]   or Senator Sanders or Senator Biden,
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:44.900]   you'll have these candidates saying,
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:46.660]   yeah, we gotta increase taxes.
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:48.940]   They will not be talking about that anymore.
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:49.780]   They never do.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.820]   During times of economic crisis,
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.460]   everyone who's vocal advocate for increased taxation,
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:58.180]   they kind of quietly close their mouth,
[00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.200]   just like during times of economic crisis,
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.780]   those who are vocal advocates
[00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:03.820]   of cutting government spending go down.
[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:04.680]   Because that's the other side.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.860]   I forgot to start there.
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:08.220]   I talked about revenue.
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.340]   Well, what else could the government do?
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.940]   Well, they could cut services, right?
[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:13.740]   They could cut spending.
[00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:15.680]   The problem is that the vast majority of the spending
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.660]   is now non-discretionary.
[00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:18.500]   It's required.
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:21.920]   The vast majority of the government budget
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.880]   is built up on social security,
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:26.720]   Medicare, Medicaid, and military spending.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.400]   Well, where are you gonna have any cuts in those?
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.920]   And people are hurting.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.960]   So where are you gonna have any cuts?
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.900]   US government doesn't cut spending anymore.
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.640]   And so it just gets worse and worse.
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.240]   So you're gonna have debt and inflation,
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.200]   either more debt or more inflation.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.440]   Now, if you have more debt,
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.160]   all this does is extend the problem out
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.520]   to farther in the future.
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:46.760]   Or if you have inflation,
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.900]   all this does is create more problems.
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:53.120]   So I know I'm just giving you a long list of problems,
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.520]   but think soberly and seriously
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.320]   about where we go from here and don't be caught unaware.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:02.720]   On both the monetary side,
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:05.200]   you've got potential for huge problems.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:09.320]   And on a fiscal side, you've got huge problems.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:10.840]   Now, the interaction of these two things,
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.500]   the monetary side and the fiscal side,
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.680]   is extraordinarily complicated.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:17.520]   I hate to talk about it because I've studied this stuff
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.500]   for years and I barely understand it enough
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.820]   to even open my mouth.
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:23.140]   And I especially am cautious
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.780]   about opening my mouth in public.
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:32.940]   Point is that it's rough waters ahead.
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:37.140]   Very, very rough waters ahead.
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.460]   The most perfect scenario,
[00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:41.800]   perfect balancing of monetary stimulus
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.140]   by the Federal Reserve,
[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:47.400]   huge amounts of money going to US taxpayers,
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.340]   the most perfect scenario ahead
[00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:52.980]   indicates major increases in debt.
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:55.580]   Assume that taxes, okay, we deal with that by debt.
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.500]   Assume that we don't have inflation.
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:00.540]   The best scenario is major increases in debt.
[00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:03.380]   What does that do for the future 10, 15, 20 years from now?
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.100]   Does that make it brighter?
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.200]   Do you honestly believe
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.020]   that somehow something's gonna change
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:10.540]   and now somebody's gonna come to power
[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:12.820]   that's gonna pay down the debt?
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:14.380]   Politically, do you see that?
[00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:15.540]   Think back to the shows I did.
[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:16.580]   If you didn't listen to them, go back.
[00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:19.700]   The ticking time bomb that no one wants to talk about,
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:20.580]   not gonna happen.
[00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:25.560]   Worst case scenarios, massive inflation.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.220]   I don't think hyperinflation,
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.420]   maybe it's just my normalcy bias,
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.500]   but I just can't believe the US government
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.700]   gets in a situation of hyperinflation,
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.520]   but at least mass inflation.
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:44.180]   And that's the most perfect scenario.
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:48.060]   Two months shut down, goose things a little bit,
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.420]   give away some free money.
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:55.500]   And I guess the final thing I would say,
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.340]   give away some free money
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.820]   and then everything kind of gets back to normal.
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:59.100]   I don't see it happening.
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:00.500]   I can't really believe that scenario,
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.200]   but that's the best case scenario.
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:05.780]   I'll go back one more thing.
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:09.180]   The single biggest thing that concerns me right now
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:13.320]   is what is properly termed moral hazard.
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:17.840]   I'm having a hard time believing the newspaper headlines
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.200]   that I'm reading right now.
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.200]   I was doing a live stream for one of my courses
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.040]   the other night.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:25.560]   We were talking about my radical preparedness course.
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:27.320]   I was talking with the students and somebody said,
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:32.320]   "The governor of my state has just canceled evictions,
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.560]   "has just made it possible,
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.160]   "made it illegal to evict a tenant."
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.840]   I asked him what state, he said, "Maryland."
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.240]   I went and looked it up later.
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:42.620]   Government of the state of Maryland
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:43.880]   said that if you're a landlord,
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.040]   you can't evict your tenant
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.560]   during a time of national emergency
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.680]   or a state emergency.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.720]   You can't evict a tenant.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:51.640]   And it said to every single service provider,
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:55.800]   you can't cut off the service of the local people.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.680]   You can't cut off somebody's water,
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:00.440]   somebody's power, et cetera.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:03.600]   Now, obviously you can understand the appeal that that has.
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.280]   All of us would understand,
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:07.520]   "Hey, that sounds pretty good."
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.560]   But just think about that.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.400]   Put yourself in the shoes of those people.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:12.900]   If I were in the state of Maryland
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.680]   and I knew that my landlord could not evict me,
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.840]   would I pay my rent?
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:23.040]   I think I probably would,
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.880]   'cause to me it's a matter of moral duty.
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:26.740]   I've said I'll pay you,
[00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:27.800]   and if not, I've said I'll get out.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.440]   I don't care what the law is.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.420]   But I'm not trying to make myself sound good.
[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:34.140]   I just know that most people don't believe that.
[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:36.920]   Most people aren't in that situation.
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:37.920]   Why would you pay your rent
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.120]   if you know you can't be evicted?
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.640]   Why wouldn't you just hang on to your rent
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:43.240]   and keep your rent money and keep the cash in the bank?
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:44.280]   You'd be safer that way.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:45.360]   Why would you pay your utilities
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.920]   if you know they can't be turned off?
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.400]   Just keep your money and hoard your money.
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.480]   'Cause toilet paper is one thing,
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.760]   but hoarding cash is far more impactful
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.900]   and far more important if you're actually concerned
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:57.840]   about the difficult road ahead.
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:01.080]   I wouldn't pay my rent in that situation.
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:02.180]   I wouldn't pay my utilities.
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:03.180]   I would just wait.
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:04.680]   They can't shut 'em off.
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.840]   Worst case they can do is impose fees,
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:07.840]   and they probably won't do that,
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:09.160]   'cause that would be politically unpopular.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.040]   So I'll just pay it later after the crisis passes.
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.860]   For now, I'm gonna hoard money.
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:18.000]   Think about the moral hazard of just people wanting money.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.440]   Where is there any expectation?
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.040]   Again, people haven't even lost paychecks yet, barely.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:26.000]   Or if they've lost paychecks, it's one paycheck.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.720]   And yet, where is the expectation?
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:31.440]   Where is the moral leadership on behalf of politicians
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.840]   saying, "We're gonna have a hard time,
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:34.680]   "but you know what?
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:37.720]   "You've prepared for this because you've saved money."
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.880]   It's like immediately the whole culture goes to,
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:40.960]   "Gimme, gimme, gimme.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:41.900]   "Gimme, gimme, gimme.
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:43.200]   "Gimme, gimme, gimme."
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:47.040]   Now, I've had that basic assessment for many years
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:48.680]   that we've created a culture
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:51.280]   that's built upon the foundation of greed.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:53.920]   Greed and larceny, the desire for other people's stuff,
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:55.160]   and greed for more of ourself.
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.520]   I don't wanna pay for it, I need more stuff.
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.720]   Give me more government services,
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.280]   and that's just what's gonna happen more.
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.880]   Now, if that moral foundation is true,
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.120]   where do we go from here?
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:07.400]   And then now, what about the war on savers?
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.400]   What if we do go to negative interest rates?
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.200]   Free money for everybody, cancel student loan interest,
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.200]   cut interest rates to zero.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.800]   What about those who save money?
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:23.320]   I have for years believed in the moral rightness of thrift,
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.400]   of frugality, of caring for myself, of planning ahead.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.520]   And I'm not gonna change that
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.040]   because I don't have any confidence
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:33.240]   in the ability of someone else to solve my problems.
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:36.080]   I have a responsibility to care for my family.
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.800]   I have a responsibility to care for my wife,
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:38.640]   to care for my children.
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:39.960]   That responsibility doesn't change
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.760]   whether someone else does it or not.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:45.960]   Again, not trying to make myself sound good,
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:49.400]   but I acknowledge and I know that that's a minority position.
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:54.760]   Most people look to someone else to solve the problem
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:57.120]   and they don't take action.
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:03.120]   So what do you do when savers don't get any money?
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.080]   That's what's always already been had
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.520]   for the last number of years.
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:09.960]   The moral hazard here is tremendous.
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:12.200]   What about even at the corporate level?
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.680]   You immediately have the airlines coming and saying,
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:17.680]   well, we need to bail out.
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:20.040]   Well, why weren't you thinking about that
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:22.160]   over the last few years
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.400]   when you're doing billions of dollars of stock buybacks?
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.400]   Did you not think it would be a good idea
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.720]   to actually just save some money?
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.440]   And this goes back to 2008.
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:32.400]   What did we learn in 2008?
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.920]   We learned that if you're too big to fail,
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:35.600]   you'll never have to fail.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.160]   You won't have to go bankrupt.
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:42.880]   The investors won't have to pay the price.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.400]   And what do you see happening right now
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.840]   in the market in general?
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.320]   Well, everyone comes in and says,
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:49.040]   well, look, we're gonna have a hard times,
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.400]   but the Federal Reserve comes out and says,
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.360]   we're gonna prop you up.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:54.800]   The US taxpayer, we're gonna prop you up.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.720]   And so you have investors all in.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:57.840]   And who does this make happy?
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.600]   It makes happy the vast majority of people
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.400]   who own mutual funds in their retirement accounts.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.640]   And they have this glib idea
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.040]   that somehow it's all gonna be okay
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:07.040]   because I'm gonna be bailed out.
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.320]   Now we know that on the periphery,
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:09.960]   there might be some people that would lose money.
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.240]   Yeah, General Motors went bankrupt
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.800]   and some people got stiffed there.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:17.120]   Yeah, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and Bear Stearns.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.520]   Yeah, we know that a few people lost money.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.760]   But in general, we know that
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.840]   it all just worked out in the end.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:28.280]   Now, what I think should happen
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:31.240]   is I think that you should allow the markets to work.
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.440]   And if Delta Airlines goes bankrupt,
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.440]   I'm sorry, if you work for Delta Airlines,
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:36.560]   that's unfortunate,
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:38.660]   but Delta Airlines needs to go bankrupt.
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:42.040]   It cleans the market of the dead detritus
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:43.440]   of these old companies
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:46.400]   and allows somebody else to come in to buy the airplanes.
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.520]   It allows the company to be reorganized
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:49.360]   and it works it through.
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.080]   Bankruptcy is the most moral,
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:53.440]   properly right way to handle it
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:56.480]   because everybody knows that was the risk.
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.080]   When you come in with these massive bailouts,
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.440]   it just gets worse and worse and worse
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.120]   and the moral hazard increases.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:04.280]   And in the same way that you have the moral hazard
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:07.040]   of a tenant knowing that they don't have to pay
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.600]   their rent payment and they can't get evicted
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.400]   and knowing they don't have to pay their water bill
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.960]   and they can't have their water shut off,
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.280]   what do you think all the big executives know?
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.560]   Well, I'm Delta Airlines, I'm too important to fail,
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:20.960]   I'm too big to fail.
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.520]   And now you see that all across the entire economy.
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:27.140]   And so from a moral perspective,
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:32.120]   where is there any right moral thinking on this topic?
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:37.160]   If I went on a public news program
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:38.800]   and I said anything like that,
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:41.520]   all people would say is that I'm just mean
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.680]   and have harsh words, right?
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.680]   Because you're saying these things that are just mean
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:49.440]   and can't you see how, you know,
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:52.480]   can't you just see how mean this is?
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:57.200]   Somebody should say, you should have saved money.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:02.480]   I don't like being the mean guy, but it's true.
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:07.480]   If you can't pay your rent because you lost one paycheck,
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:11.520]   that's your responsibility.
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.600]   I'm filled with sympathy of how difficult it is
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:17.320]   to make it on a small income, I'm filled with sympathy.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:21.720]   I struggle to know how to help people,
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:25.640]   but the reality is nobody's gonna bail you out.
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.520]   And if you get used to people bailing you out
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.000]   because that's the political winds of the day,
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   what do you do when the money is gone?
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.240]   This is why welfare is so destructive.
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:35.520]   It destroys people, why?
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:40.520]   Because it takes away any sense of self-worth.
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:43.560]   We all acknowledge that people need help,
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:47.840]   but we've gone so far past that, societally speaking.
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:50.040]   We've gone so far past that.
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.620]   It's just simply completely,
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:54.180]   (sighs)
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:58.620]   we've become untethered.
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:04.220]   Now, I hope, for my sake and your sake,
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:09.220]   I hope that this analysis is wrong.
[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:12.420]   I hope that it works just one more time.
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:16.260]   Goose the economy one more time,
[00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:19.540]   give everybody $1,000 free money one more time.
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:23.660]   I hope that the virus is solved in two months.
[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:25.760]   I hope that that is true.
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:30.220]   If that is true, I tell you what I will be doing.
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:35.940]   I will be tripling down on my previous pessimism
[00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:38.800]   and preparing for global financial collapse
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.000]   like never before.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.020]   I felt pretty well prepared,
[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:47.220]   far better prepared than the vast majority of people.
[00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:49.780]   But I'm getting ready to record an update
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:51.060]   for the students of my,
[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:52.860]   how to prepare to survive and thrive
[00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:53.940]   during an economic crisis.
[00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:55.540]   I'm getting ready to prepare an update for them
[00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:57.420]   and all the things I wish I'd done,
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:59.540]   all the stuff that I thought was a little too extreme,
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:01.500]   I probably don't need that, probably won't be so bad.
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:03.620]   All of a sudden, things can change really fast,
[00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:05.300]   as you well know now.
[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:07.860]   And now I feel a lot more exposed.
[00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:10.020]   And I'm not bragging, I'm saying,
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:12.380]   I am better prepared than the vast majority of people.
[00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:15.980]   My day-to-day looks like every other normal day.
[00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:22.140]   There's no actual apparent change in our life right now.
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:25.220]   Now, a month from now, there sure could be.
[00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:31.420]   But these problems are just stacking up.
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:35.740]   The economic problems are stacking up
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:37.640]   and it's only getting started.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.720]   The monetary problems are stacking up
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:42.420]   and we've only just begun.
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:44.860]   The fiscal problems are stacking up
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:46.260]   and we've only just begun.
[00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:49.540]   (mouse clicking)
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:52.940]   This stuff is serious.
[00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:56.460]   Again, hope I'm wrong, hope it works one more time.
[00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:59.020]   But there comes a day in which it ain't gonna work.
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:02.380]   Now, what does that look like?
[00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:04.180]   I don't know.
[00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:06.820]   I'm thinking about it every day
[00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:08.620]   and I just don't, I'm not confident enough
[00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:09.580]   to say what it looks like.
[00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:13.340]   I'm trying to warn you of what could happen months from now.
[00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:15.620]   I'm trying to warn you of what could happen months from now
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:17.260]   and give you the things to watch.
[00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:19.900]   As I did with the virus, I've said, look for these things.
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:22.220]   If you see these things happening, it's serious.
[00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:25.900]   If you see these things not happening, it's not serious.
[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:28.100]   Well, a lot of the things happened,
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:29.800]   started to get pretty serious.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:34.640]   Now, we have a chance for the measures to work.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:38.740]   The social isolation, it can work.
[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:41.660]   But in the very base situation,
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:43.380]   the very best case scenario,
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:48.300]   when social isolation works, it's economically devastating.
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:52.120]   So now I'm saying the same thing, economically.
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:54.580]   There are some things that are gonna be done
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:55.920]   the next few weeks.
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.460]   Could they work?
[00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:01.140]   Maybe for the short term, they might work.
[00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:02.900]   If they do work for the short term,
[00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:04.660]   they're going to create much bigger problems
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:05.560]   for the long term.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:10.100]   If they work for the short term,
[00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:12.300]   they're going to create much bigger problems
[00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:13.660]   for the long term.
[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:16.900]   That was the lesson from many people from 2008.
[00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:18.260]   It worked for the short term,
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:21.500]   and it created much bigger problems for the long term.
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:25.380]   For years, I have been persuaded that the next recession
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:27.020]   was going to be more difficult
[00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:29.780]   because of what happened last time.
[00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:31.560]   And I think you see left, right, and center,
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:32.460]   if you look around the news,
[00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:35.600]   you see right now the moral hazard that was created
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:39.980]   from the previous event.
[00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:44.100]   You see that moral hazard that was created,
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:47.220]   and you can see how fast
[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:50.980]   we've gone immediately to give away free money.
[00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:53.740]   You can see how fast all the companies
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:55.140]   came begging for a bailout.
[00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:58.660]   You can see how fast,
[00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:00.180]   Paul just said, "We'll bail you out, we'll bail you out.
[00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:01.580]   "We've got plenty of money."
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:05.740]   You cannot just make this stuff up.
[00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:07.260]   You can make this stuff up for a little while,
[00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:08.740]   but you can't do it forever.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:13.240]   If you could do it forever, and this is an event,
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:14.500]   if you can just make it up,
[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:16.440]   then why not make it up with more?
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:18.120]   Why talk about $1,000 a month?
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:18.960]   It's interesting.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.080]   Andrew Yang, his signature series.
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:23.220]   Now all of a sudden, everybody just wants to steal
[00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:25.040]   Andrew Yang's UBI idea.
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:26.560]   If you can send everyone $1,000 a month,
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:28.600]   why not send everyone 10,000?
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:32.020]   And hey, I mean, 10,000, I can live okay on 10,000,
[00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:34.120]   but if you can send everyone $1,000 a month,
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:35.600]   and you can send everyone $10,000 a month,
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:37.140]   why not $50,000 a month?
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:43.680]   And the answer to that question is obvious to you,
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:46.240]   but you don't want to accept it any more than I do.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:49.000]   The answer is you can't.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.500]   And because you can't,
[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:56.180]   you know that this current charade,
[00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:59.280]   it cannot continue indefinitely.
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:06.280]   Now what I have always hoped for is a slow economic crisis,
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:12.040]   a slow economic collapse, a slow adjustment,
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:14.420]   because that gives time for people to adjust.
[00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:20.600]   I still think that's possible.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:23.580]   You don't have to have a massive all of a sudden collapse.
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:26.800]   You don't have to have a massive all of a sudden crisis.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.740]   But when you look around at the speed of change
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:30.100]   of the last two weeks,
[00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:35.960]   you can see certainly that it's very possible
[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:38.800]   that things can happen faster.
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:45.760]   I got to end today's show.
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:48.520]   I got to go work with some clients and make some money.
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:53.080]   But I want you to be cautious.
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:54.680]   I want you to be looking around,
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:58.640]   and I want you to be more pessimistic than most other people.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:01.400]   There's no reason to be scared.
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:03.960]   At the end of the day, you're going to be fine.
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:05.760]   Even if you lose all your money, you're going to be fine.
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.860]   Even if you go bankrupt, you're going to be fine.
[00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:10.860]   If you can keep your family together, you're going to be fine.
[00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:11.820]   I took a shower this morning,
[00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:13.740]   I sat there and I pondered bankruptcy.
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:15.380]   And I thought, okay, I'll go bankrupt.
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:16.500]   All my money becomes worthless.
[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:17.900]   What do I do?
[00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:19.300]   I'm going to be fine.
[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:20.140]   You are too.
[00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:23.420]   I don't have perfect answers on everything.
[00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:25.820]   You can work your way through it.
[00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:27.940]   One of the things I have learned by studying
[00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:30.820]   and seeing real collapses
[00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:35.820]   is that life looks surprisingly similar post-collapse
[00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:39.680]   as to how it looks now, pre-collapse.
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:42.320]   I hope I've been clear.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.740]   I'm not predicting that in one week,
[00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:44.600]   there's going to be a collapse
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:45.720]   in the United States of America.
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:49.100]   I'm saying these are very serious systemic problems,
[00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:52.560]   and there's no good solution.
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:56.160]   The only good solution
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:58.440]   is the one that is politically unfeasible.
[00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:04.100]   The good solution is you let bankruptcy happen.
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:09.280]   You fight the virus with everything that you can,
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:12.320]   with the measures that are being put in place.
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:15.920]   Then you let bankruptcy happen.
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:18.280]   You let individuals go bankrupt.
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:20.040]   That individual that goes bankrupt
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:22.240]   allows them to start afresh.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:24.180]   You let the companies go bankrupt.
[00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:25.900]   That lets them start afresh.
[00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:28.040]   You let people learn from the fact
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:29.940]   that I should not have lived so close to the edge.
[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:31.080]   I should have saved more money,
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:34.060]   because what happened was I lost one paycheck
[00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:35.500]   because I worked at a gym,
[00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:37.260]   and I lost my job because the gym shut down,
[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:39.020]   or I lost one paycheck
[00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:39.960]   because I worked at a restaurant,
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:41.420]   and the restaurant shut down,
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:42.560]   or I lost two paychecks,
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:44.920]   and then all of a sudden everything fell apart.
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:47.840]   You let people go bankrupt,
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:49.200]   and as painful as that is,
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:51.120]   bankruptcy clears the slate,
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:54.760]   and it's the proper morally right thing to do.
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:57.040]   The creditors hurt,
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:01.760]   so you let people and businesses go bankrupt.
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:03.800]   You let their assets be purchased,
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.000]   be taken by the creditors.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.120]   You let their assets be purchased,
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:07.200]   and you let them start again,
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.720]   and that cleans out,
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:12.840]   and then that pain creates a different culture,
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:15.360]   a different person who's much more attuned
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:17.380]   to the dangers of over-leverage.
[00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:20.760]   There are a lot of people who've gone bankrupt
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:23.160]   that vowed, "This ain't gonna happen again,
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:25.480]   "and from now on I'm gonna be conservative."
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:26.960]   And then you have a conservative culture.
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:29.920]   There are cultures that are very fiscally conservative.
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:32.180]   The US American culture is not that,
[00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:35.080]   but there are cultures that are very fiscally conservative.
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:37.600]   When you have a fiscally conservative culture,
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:39.440]   just take as an example,
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:41.960]   most American households spend more than they make.
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:42.820]   Seems that way.
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:45.920]   Let's say that you have a culture
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:49.340]   where people spend traditionally half of what they make.
[00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:51.440]   Well, this creates a radically different culture
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:54.160]   when you have times of economic hardship,
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:55.860]   where people have a 20% cut in their income,
[00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:57.040]   they can absorb it.
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:59.800]   They have a 30% cut in their income, they can absorb it.
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:03.000]   This is what is necessary,
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.520]   is you have to have a culture like that
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:06.800]   to have a culture that is sustainable.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:09.320]   And you can see this in nature itself.
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:10.320]   Let's say that you,
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:13.440]   I hope I've got to finish the show.
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:16.080]   Let's just look at nature.
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:18.120]   Okay, what is the major problem
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:21.360]   with most modern monocrop farming?
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:23.100]   What happens is you have
[00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:25.200]   no fundamental biological diversity,
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:29.040]   and thus you have no real biological resiliency.
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.920]   You have one crop that you grow.
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:33.680]   And so if you have one pest
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:35.660]   that successfully attacks that crop,
[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:37.600]   your crop is wiped out.
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:38.800]   You have one crop that you grow,
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:40.000]   and if a flood comes in,
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.440]   your crop is wiped out and your year is ruined.
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:45.560]   You don't have a diverse anti-fragile farm
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:48.360]   when you have a monocrop farm.
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:50.040]   Now, if you go, and the best example I would say,
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:52.000]   if you go and look at someone,
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.420]   I don't know, a permaculture designer
[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:54.960]   like Ben Falk in the United States,
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:56.260]   or you go and you look at,
[00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:59.320]   my favorite was Jeff Lawton
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:01.960]   did a review of a tour of his property
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:05.080]   during the bushfires recently in Australia.
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:07.040]   If you think like a permaculture designer
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:08.720]   and you design a system
[00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:11.120]   that acknowledges that many things can go wrong,
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:15.280]   and you design a system that has a polycrop system,
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:16.760]   you have a diversity of crops,
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:18.280]   you have a diversity of animals,
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:20.660]   you even plan for a diversity of climate zones, right?
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:22.400]   You don't know if the climate's gonna get warmer
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:23.900]   or if the climate's gonna get cooler.
[00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:26.360]   So you plant the most of your crops
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:28.000]   for your current climate zone,
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.960]   but then you plant some crops that will flourish
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:31.520]   if your climate gets hotter,
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:33.000]   and you plant some crops that will flourish
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.400]   if your climate gets cooler.
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:36.840]   You plan water management,
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:38.760]   you plan the ability to flood your property,
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:39.740]   you plan ahead for fire.
[00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:43.240]   Now, we do this in some ways in modern systems.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:46.040]   So why do you have fire sprinklers required by code
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:47.240]   in most modern buildings?
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:48.860]   Because people know that works.
[00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:50.120]   Why do you have so much redundancy
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:51.160]   and you have smoke detectors
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:53.500]   and you have modern electrical codes
[00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:58.000]   and in South Florida, you have these crazy building codes?
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.400]   Well, it's because people know hurricanes come,
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:03.040]   fires come, wires short,
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:05.480]   and so you need all of these stopgaps,
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:10.480]   you need ground fault interrupt boxes in the wall,
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:11.860]   you need circuit breakers,
[00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:13.960]   and these are incredible technologies.
[00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:15.720]   But now when you come to finances,
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:17.920]   where is that?
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:20.980]   What is it?
[00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:23.980]   It's the stuff that we talk about on the show all the time.
[00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:27.180]   It gives you circuit breakers, it gives you options,
[00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:32.180]   but that's not popularly accepted.
[00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:33.820]   That's not culturally prominent.
[00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:34.940]   It could be.
[00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:38.260]   There's no reason why you can't have a culture
[00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:40.380]   that thrives on that.
[00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:43.260]   But you have the mess of the ridiculously fragile
[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:45.860]   modern system in the United States.
[00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:47.460]   You have such a mess that,
[00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:50.460]   it means that you have to consider
[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:51.860]   some very severe scenarios
[00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:56.220]   when you start to face a significant event like a virus.
[00:57:56.220 --> 00:58:02.420]   Everyone's invested in stocks, 100%.
[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:09.180]   In closing, I would say this.
[00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:15.820]   There are very choppy waters ahead.
[00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:22.820]   Economically, fiscally, and monetarily.
[00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:26.420]   Choppy waters don't necessarily mean capsizing.
[00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:28.740]   Choppy waters don't necessarily mean
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:30.660]   that everyone goes under.
[00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:33.180]   It's possible that the solutions will work.
[00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:35.180]   I'm hoping for a best case scenario.
[00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:38.460]   Best case scenario is already pretty tough.
[00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:41.660]   So I'm trying to give you the things to look for
[00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:44.180]   so that you can kind of see what's gonna happen.
[00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:48.300]   I don't know what this means in your personal finances,
[00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:51.100]   but if you have the ability, you see choppy waters ahead,
[00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:54.820]   consider rowing over to the shore, parking your boat,
[00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:57.660]   kind of getting out and pursuing it on foot,
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:00.700]   taking a look, just sitting and waiting.
[00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:06.660]   Times of economic crisis are times of opportunity.
[00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:08.220]   In the middle of an economic crisis,
[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:11.860]   you'll have the opportunity to make wise investments.
[00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:14.060]   You have the opportunity to make a lot of money.
[00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:15.580]   To make wise investments.
[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:17.660]   You have the opportunity to start new businesses.
[00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:19.380]   You'll have the opportunity to do those things,
[00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:21.340]   but you need to be prepared to do them.
[00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:25.940]   If there's something that you know you should have done
[00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:28.140]   to prepare that you haven't done, do it.
[00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:32.060]   Pull the boat over to the side of the river,
[00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:34.420]   tie off on the tree, and just wait.
[00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:37.140]   Take a look and see.
[00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:42.140]   I don't know what that is for you, but take a look and see.
[00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:44.580]   There are going to be opportunities through this.
[00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:48.980]   You can use this crisis for your benefit.
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:52.540]   Even if the only benefit that comes out of it
[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:55.460]   is you realized how exposed you are as an individual
[00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:57.340]   or how exposed you are as a family,
[00:59:57.340 --> 01:00:00.300]   and in the future, you're more conservative,
[01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:03.140]   more thoughtful, and make a plan to be less exposed,
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:03.980]   that's good.
[01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:07.900]   I hope that from now on,
[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:09.500]   there are people who look around and say,
[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.580]   "I'm never gonna have less than a month's supply
[01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:13.340]   of toilet paper in my house."
[01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:18.060]   Because if you can have that be the cultural norm,
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:22.060]   if 80% of the people always have a month's supply
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:24.700]   of toilet paper in their house,
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:26.960]   then there won't be a toilet paper crisis in the future,
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.620]   because those 20% can go out and get toilet paper
[01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:31.260]   all of a sudden 'cause they're scared,
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:33.740]   and the 80% just sit back and rest.
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:36.540]   And the system, the supply chain, can then keep up.
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:41.100]   Same thing financially, same thing at every level.
[01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:42.960]   As you create an anti-fragile system,
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:46.140]   you create a system that has resiliency.
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:52.540]   I could give example after example
[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:53.660]   after example of resiliency.
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:56.380]   We could do it biologically, we could do it ecologically,
[01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:58.540]   we could do it financially, we could do it in every area,
[01:00:58.540 --> 01:00:59.900]   but I'm done.
[01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:00.940]   Just think about it.
[01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:03.220]   What does it take to create resiliency?
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:06.620]   At the very least, look around and say, "What do I need?"
[01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:08.740]   What I'm doing is I'm making lists and saying,
[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:11.300]   "All right, I thought I was pretty well-prepared.
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:12.580]   This has proceeded.
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:14.340]   I always thought this was a worst-case scenario,
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:16.620]   and it's proceeding according to that.
[01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:18.620]   What do I really wish I'd done?"
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:19.820]   Simple example.
[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:21.980]   "All right, I wish I had some gas masks.
[01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:25.300]   I've always thought, 'Meh, come on, gas masks.'
[01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:26.740]   A little bit of an overreaction.
[01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:29.980]   I've never even seen a gas mask other than in a movie.
[01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:33.420]   And so, too much."
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:34.940]   But at this point in time,
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:37.980]   if I were going to the supermarket,
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:40.380]   I'd be happy to wear a gas mask.
[01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:41.460]   I've got some respirators,
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:43.420]   I've got some masks and things like that,
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:46.700]   but a gas mask is basically perfect protection.
[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:47.540]   And you know what?
[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:49.380]   You could buy gas masks for,
[01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:52.020]   you know, masks and some extra filters, a few hundred bucks.
[01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:53.900]   I always thought the people who stocked gas masks,
[01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:55.340]   "Eh, a little bit extra, a little crazy,
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:57.860]   a little bit too extreme.
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:59.860]   Wish I had some gas masks."
[01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:01.220]   So what is that for you?
[01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:02.420]   At the very least, learn the lessons,
[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:05.740]   and let's hope that, right, let's hope this all works.
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:06.940]   Let's hope we find some solutions,
[01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:08.340]   hope we beat back the virus,
[01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:09.780]   hope we just have some, you know,
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:12.540]   tens of thousands of people dead and not millions.
[01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:15.180]   Hope that economically it's a short term.
[01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:17.700]   But meanwhile, look ahead
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.460]   and think about what you would do at each stage.
[01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:22.020]   What are your triggers?
[01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:22.860]   What do you see?
[01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:26.140]   There are some serious problems.
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:29.100]   If those problems are limited to simply more debt
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:32.020]   at the federal level,
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:35.620]   and some bailouts and some things that get monetized,
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:37.820]   some assets get purchased by the Federal Reserve,
[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:40.500]   and those problems are simply that people have some money
[01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.820]   and have some short term hard times,
[01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:45.620]   get through a few months, man, am I gonna be thankful?
[01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:49.140]   But even in that, I wanna emphasize
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:51.980]   that's going to create more structural problems
[01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:53.900]   for the future, and at some point,
[01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:56.640]   those bills have to get paid in some way,
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.660]   usually through bankruptcy of some kind.
[01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:05.700]   This is a time where people will really shine.
[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:07.500]   I'm so encouraged to see,
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.180]   I loved that story that came out of Italy
[01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:11.900]   where they ran out of valves for ventilator machines
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:14.460]   or something like that, and somebody brought a 3D printer
[01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:16.260]   and started printing valves for them.
[01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:18.060]   I'm thrilled by what you see.
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:21.060]   Times that are hard can bring out incredible,
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:24.980]   just goodness and solidarity and love from people.
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:28.100]   And so I'm thrilled to see that.
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:29.500]   It can also be very, very difficult.
[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:30.340]   I'll give you an example.
[01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:32.340]   One of the areas where I've been beefing up
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:35.960]   my own preparations is just in home security right now.
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:38.380]   Home security is very concerning,
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:41.980]   and security risks always increase in a financial crisis,
[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:45.940]   and right now, you have all over the country,
[01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:47.580]   you have police departments saying
[01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:49.780]   that they're not going to be able to respond
[01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:53.220]   to unsignificant or less significant crimes,
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:55.340]   and so there's a percentage of the population
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:58.060]   that is going to be stimulated in this
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:03:59.580]   to go out and do more.
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:02.340]   Here is from the city of Philadelphia.
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:04.300]   The city of Philadelphia has updated its posture
[01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:06.140]   concerning the COVID-19 pandemic.
[01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:09.060]   Public release, beginning today, March 17, 2020.
[01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:10.120]   That was yesterday.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.700]   The city is suspending all public-facing services.
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:14.220]   To that end, most municipal buildings
[01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:15.860]   will be closed to the public as the city tries
[01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:17.200]   to limit the potential for exposure
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:19.300]   to COVID-19 patrol districts.
[01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:20.580]   Not going on here.
[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:21.620]   Listen to this.
[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:24.540]   Effective Tuesday, March 17, 2020,
[01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:26.980]   at the start of the 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. tour,
[01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:28.780]   arrests for the following offenses
[01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:31.140]   will be effectuated via arrest warrant.
[01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:34.820]   All narcotics offenses, theft from persons,
[01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:37.380]   retail theft, theft from auto, burglary, vandalism,
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:38.620]   all bench warrants, stolen auto,
[01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:41.780]   economic crimes, bad checks, fraud, prostitution.
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:44.220]   Officers who encounter persons who would ordinarily
[01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:46.300]   be arrested for these offenses and processed
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:49.440]   at a detective division immediately following arrest
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.700]   will adhere to the following procedures.
[01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:53.900]   Temporarily detain the offender for the length of time
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:55.840]   required to confirm identity.
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:56.980]   This may require the deployment
[01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:58.580]   of mobile fingerprint scanners.
[01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:00.540]   Prepare all relevant paperwork.
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:01.680]   Release the offender.
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:03.660]   Submit all paperwork to the detective division
[01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:05.580]   of occurrence.
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:07.380]   So you see this in Philadelphia.
[01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:09.820]   You see this in New York City changes.
[01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:11.420]   You see this in Portland, Oregon.
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:12.620]   You see this in Lansing, Michigan.
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:14.260]   You're gonna see this all over the place.
[01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:15.740]   So one of the things, if you're proactive
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:17.860]   and forward-thinking, you need to be significantly
[01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:19.540]   considering your security plans.
[01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:21.780]   There may be a run on toilet paper,
[01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:23.160]   but there's probably still plenty
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:25.340]   of surveillance cameras available.
[01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:28.760]   There's probably still plenty of motion detector lights
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.600]   available that you can order and you can set up
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:32.320]   to improve your security plans.
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:35.820]   Don't sit back and wait for that to be the next run.
[01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:37.460]   Prepare accordingly.
[01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:38.300]   Thank you all for listening.
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:39.460]   I gotta go.
[01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:43.280]   Few things to close as I announce in closing.
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:46.320]   Number one is I'm still doing consulting work.
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.240]   If you would like to do consultations
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.200]   on personal financial movements,
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:52.460]   I'm running a March Madness sale.
[01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:55.660]   Discounted my normal rate from $400 to $250 an hour.
[01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.340]   If you book with code March Madness,
[01:05:57.340 --> 01:05:59.960]   March Madness have canceled, but my sale was not.
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:01.360]   If you were interested in that, email me,
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:02.940]   joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com,
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:05.760]   and I'll give you details on my private consulting services.
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:08.720]   Joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:11.240]   Number two is I still am running,
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:13.180]   I have a number of courses available.
[01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:15.560]   You can find probably the most useful course
[01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:16.940]   at radicalpreparedness.com.
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:18.680]   That's one of the cheapest courses.
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:20.480]   I started that back in January when I was concerned,
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:21.480]   especially about the virus.
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:22.520]   And I said, I gotta get a basic
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.160]   family preparedness course going.
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:26.200]   29 bucks at radicalpreparedness.com.
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:27.240]   You can still join there.
[01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:28.680]   The classes are archived.
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:31.320]   And then we still have more live classes coming out.
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.560]   So join me there at radicalpreparedness.com.
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:36.200]   And then go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/store.
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.560]   And if you have not taken my economic crisis course,
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:39.600]   you should do that.
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:44.080]   Because the strategies that I have talked about in that
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:47.160]   are absolutely strong,
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.760]   and they seem more important than ever.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:51.920]   And there's still time to prepare.
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.120]   There's still time to prepare.
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:55.960]   Not for being quarantined in your house for two weeks.
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:56.880]   That's done.
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.320]   But there's still time to prepare financially
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:00.780]   because all these things take time to work out.
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:02.760]   So go and check out my how to survive and thrive
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.800]   during the coming economic crisis course.
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:08.360]   The strategies in that course are sound,
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:11.480]   and they are things that I am doing to prepare.
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.440]   I've done them, and I'm doing them.
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.640]   I'm gonna be posting a special live Q&A
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:17.200]   for the students of that course soon.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.840]   We'll talk about some of those monetary strategies,
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:21.240]   especially in light of the current events.
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:23.480]   So go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/store
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:24.520]   and sign up there.
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:27.280]   In fact, you know what?
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:29.240]   I'm gonna host a sale on that.
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:34.240]   And so the coupon code is going to be coronavirus.
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:38.040]   I will give a 20% discount on all of my courses
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:44.200]   through the end of March using coupon code coronavirus.
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:47.960]   All one word, coronavirus, as a coupon code.
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:49.440]   20% off all my courses available
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.800]   at radicalpersonalfinance.com/store
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:54.240]   using coupon code coronavirus.
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:56.160]   Thank you for listening.

[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:15.980]   (wind whooshing)
