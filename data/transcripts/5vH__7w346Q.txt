[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780]   - Do you have advice for young minds today
[00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.560]   dreaming about creating, as you have dreamt,
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.240]   creating intelligent systems?
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.760]   What is the best way to arrive at new breakthrough ideas
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.200]   and carry them through the fire of criticism
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.400]   and past conventional ideas?
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.340]   - Ask your questions.
[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:28.020]   Really, your questions are never done.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.760]   And solve them your own way.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.060]   And don't take no for an answer.
[00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.740]   If they are really dumb, you will find out quickly
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.520]   by trying an arrow to see that they're not leading
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.780]   any place.
[00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.780]   But follow them and try to understand things your way.
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.960]   That is my advice.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.360]   I don't know if it's gonna help anyone.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.880]   - No, that's brilliant.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.880]   - There is a lot of inertia in science, in academia.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:08.820]   It is slowing down science.
[00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.720]   - Yeah, those two words, your way, that's a powerful thing.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.480]   It's against inertia, potentially.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.320]   Against the flow.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.000]   - Against your professor.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.800]   - Against your professor.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.200]   - I wrote the book of why in order to democratize
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.320]   common sense.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.000]   (laughing)
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   In order to instill rebellious spirit in students
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.080]   so they wouldn't wait until the professor
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.300]   get things right.
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.960]   - So you wrote the manifesto of the rebellion
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.640]   against the professor.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.080]   - Against the professor, yes.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.360]   (laughing)
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:16.260]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
