[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   People say to me, "Are you looking for the ultimate
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.900]   "laws of physics?"
[00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.880]   No, I'm not.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.960]   I'm just looking to find out more about the world.
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.080]   And if it turns out there is a simple ultimate law
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.040]   that explains everything, so be it.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.520]   That would be very nice to discover.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.320]   If it turns out it's like an onion with millions of layers
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.220]   and we're just sick and tired of looking at the layers,
[00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.580]   then that's the way it is.
[00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.380]   But whatever way it comes out, its nature is there
[00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.280]   and she's going to come out the way she is.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.320]   And therefore, when we go to investigate it,
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.760]   we shouldn't pre-decide what it is we're trying to do
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.440]   except to find out more about it.
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.840]   If you say, "But your problem is why do you find out
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.680]   "more about it?"
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.200]   If you thought that you were trying to find out more
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.960]   about it because you're going to get an answer
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.520]   to some deep philosophical question, you may be wrong.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.040]   It may be that you can't get an answer to that particular
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.680]   question by finding out more about the character of nature.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.640]   But I don't look at it.
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.000]   My interest in science is to simply find out
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.920]   about the world.
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.320]   And the more I find out, the better it is.
