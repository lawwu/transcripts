[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.560]   Mike writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, I have been over the last few years moving
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.320]   away from a Calvinistic reformed piety among the so-called New Calvinists and towards a
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.580]   more Lutheran law gospel distinction and a less obligation to the third use of the law
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.400]   view of the Christian life.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.400]   Although the differences are subtle, there are nevertheless differences.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.360]   My assurance is more consistent and more joyful, so much so that I feel like I'm deceived
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.040]   into cheap grace.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.560]   I'm a part of a Calvinistic reformed church and there are subtle tensions beginning on
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.560]   the subject.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.560]   Am I moving in a wrong direction and is there no difference at all, just a misunderstanding
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.560]   of language?"
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.760]   Oh my.
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.920]   This is just so huge.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:54.240]   The law gospel conversation has been going on for a thousand years and 2000 and involves
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.200]   huge and complex issues.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.080]   So here's the way I've thought about answering this.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:10.440]   I just want to say a few things that are a contribution to people's thought, not a solution
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.400]   to every issue they're facing.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.800]   And it may be a few thoughts they haven't had, and so if the Holy Spirit would be pleased
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.720]   to just take these few thoughts and stir them in to all their biblical reflections and all
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.160]   their reading, I would be happy with that outcome.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:36.600]   In the New Testament, the word "law" is used in several ways, numerous ways.
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.120]   It refers to the Old Testament.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.400]   It refers to the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Old Testament.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.240]   It refers to the covenant at Sinai, the Mosaic covenant and the commandments there.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.720]   It refers to the principle of authority.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.120]   It refers to a summary statement of God's demand for perfect obedience, etc.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:03.040]   So it will be very confusing if we speak of a law gospel distinction without making clear
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.000]   what we mean by "law" when we say it.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.160]   And I think lots of confusion happens when people just constantly say "law, law, law,
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.360]   law, law" and don't define what they mean by "law."
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.080]   Let me give an example of how I would talk.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:27.400]   If I should say there is a clear distinction between law and gospel in the Bible, then
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:38.000]   what I would be meaning by "law" at that moment is not the first five books of Moses.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.080]   Now why is that?
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:49.160]   Because the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible, include Genesis, which contains
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:57.160]   the Abrahamic covenant, where Paul says, God says, that Abraham was justified by faith.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.640]   And Paul uses that text to illustrate the gospel.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:08.720]   In Galatians 3, the Scripture, he says, "The Scripture," Genesis 12, "for seeing that God
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.400]   would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel."
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.400]   There it is.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.400]   So the Pentateuch is preaching the gospel in Genesis 12, "If in you shall all the families
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.400]   be blessed."
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.200]   So the Pentateuch preached justification by faith, preached the gospel, and pointed to
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.560]   Christ when it did it.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:39.680]   And then Galatians 3:17 says, "The law, which came 430 years later, does not annul a covenant
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.320]   previously ratified by God."
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.040]   So now you've got, within the law, the law.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.280]   So you've got to distinguish between—what are you talking about, "law"?
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.240]   Do you mean the Pentateuch and its message, or do you mean the specificities of the commandment
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:04.000]   of the Mosaic covenant, which coming 430 years later doesn't annul the covenant made with
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.880]   Abraham and is used by Paul to illustrate the gospel?
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.200]   So the law, in the sense of the Pentateuch or the whole Old Testament, teaches that the
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.440]   law, in the sense of the commandments given at Sinai, is not the path of justification.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:30.240]   I think John Selhammer used to say that the Pentateuch is the Galatians of the Old Testament.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:41.500]   In other words, the Pentateuch goes to battle against the Mosaic covenant as the means by
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.760]   which we move into a right standing with God.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.360]   It cannot be done.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.960]   So there is no law-gospel distinction if by "law" you mean the Pentateuch.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:01.300]   They're both preaching the same message, and they're both distinguishing the gospel from
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.240]   something about the Mosaic covenant.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.240]   Now what's that?
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.280]   Maybe we should go there.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:14.080]   It seems then like embedded in the Mosaic law given at Sinai is a principle, an ultimate
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:22.080]   principle that if you seek to be justified by commandment-keeping, you must be perfect
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:29.120]   in keeping them or fall back on the provision of an animal sacrifice pointing to the final
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.120]   sacrifice.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:37.200]   So Galatians 3.10, "It is written, 'Cursed be everyone who does not abide in all things
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.880]   written in the book of the law to do them.'
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.520]   For James, whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.520]   to all."
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.640]   So embedded in the Mosaic law is this principle that this isn't all or nothing, folks.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.720]   If you want to be circumcised, you got to keep the whole law.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.720]   If you want to be justified, that is, come into a right standing with God through law-keeping,
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.520]   rule-keeping, commandment-keeping, then you got to keep it all.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:14.320]   And nobody can do it, and that is what brings that principle into distinction to the gospel,
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.240]   because the gospel says, "Okay, you can't do it.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.340]   Christ has done it for you.
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.800]   Christ has borne your punishment for not doing it.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.240]   Christ has provided your perfection, which you can't measure up to."
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:33.800]   And so we have a gospel, and the gospel is different from the principle of law that is
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:40.360]   the demand for commandment-keeping perfection to get right with God.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.600]   That is simply not what the gospel is.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.200]   The gospel declares, "Christ has done that.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.280]   He's finished that.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.760]   He's provided that."
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:54.720]   And now the way into justification, the way into a right standing with God is by faith
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.260]   in this Redeemer, faith in this substitute.
[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:05.700]   So that leaves just one more question to do in this little daily podcast.
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.500]   What do you do with the commandments, then?
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:13.300]   Because that's probably what he's wrestling with, is the use of the commandments for the
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.640]   Christian.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:22.300]   And I would say the commandments never can make God to be for us.
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.900]   He's already for us in Christ by trusting Christ.
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:34.220]   We're in Christ so that no commandment-keeping can make us acceptable to God.
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:39.600]   We are acceptable in Christ, which puts commandment-keeping at a lower level.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.500]   The way to live the Christian life is not by focusing on commandments.
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:51.220]   They can help discern the path of love, but the key to living the Christian life is now
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:08:01.940]   very different than a focus on commandment-keeping towards pleasing God and bringing us 100%
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:02.940]   into his favor.
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:11.220]   And the key verse that I love so much that I try to live in each day is Romans 7, 6,
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.420]   and I'll end with this.
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:21.220]   Now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive.
[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:27.420]   So we die to the law and are no longer under the law, we're no longer its slaves, so that
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:36.980]   we may serve—oh yes, there is a serving of—we may serve in the new way of the Spirit, not
[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.660]   the old way of the letter.
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:45.100]   The letter kills; the Spirit gives life.
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:52.420]   So that's what we're aiming at, and I don't know whether that touches where this question
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:57.460]   was coming from, but those are the kind of thoughts that I wrestle with and where I am
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.980]   right now in my thinking.
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:03.140]   Thank you for those thoughts, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast.
