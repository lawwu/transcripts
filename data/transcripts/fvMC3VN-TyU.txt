[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   But what tactics do you have for someone who's like, I want to find a great restaurant,
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.920]   have a great dish. And I don't know anyone, what would you tell someone who doesn't know that?
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.960]   I think first and foremost, probably do some research, but don't just follow Yelp.
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.240]   Or if let's just say you do follow Yelp, and you find a restaurant that has
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.600]   a three and a half star rating, but that restaurant has a lot of fives and a lot of ones.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.840]   That right off the bat looks something that's probably gonna be awesome.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.360]   Right? If you dive deeper into the data, and you realize most of the people that give it ones are
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.240]   people that don't understand the kind of cuisine. Most people that give it fives are the people that
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.040]   do understand the cuisine, that's probably a good thing.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.840]   So the numbers don't always tell you the truth, but what's behind it.
