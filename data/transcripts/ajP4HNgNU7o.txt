[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600]   And I think this is the biggest disconnect for me is that I spent my whole career with kind of this Western mind trying to think my way and outsmart my way through everything.
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.180]   But you have to really listen to how you feel and how your body's responding to something.
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:24.200]   And this is one of those perennial, timeless debates within philosophy and spirituality where it's like, do I try to think my way through this or do I trust my intuition?
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:34.580]   The longer that I've been an entrepreneur, the longer I've been financially independent, the more I recognize that your intuition is actually the strongest gift that you have.
[00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.080]   And most of us just silence it.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.780]   We just keep doing the thing that we've always done because we feel like that's what we are supposed to do.
[00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.040]   And it's often the easiest thing to do.
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.060]   And so you end up in a place in your life where all these limits have been set by someone else.
[00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.600]   And you're like, geez, how did I get here?
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.740]   How can I change this up a little bit?
