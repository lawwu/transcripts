[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.100]   I know God disciplines me because the Bible tells me so, but Pastor John, how do I know
[00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.800]   when I'm personally experiencing God's discipline?
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:21.840]   Here's one of the most remarkable things about God's ordaining hard things in our lives in
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.680]   a disciplinary way.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.920]   Jesus was disciplined and never sinned.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.200]   Notice what I mean.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:37.240]   Hebrews 5.8, it says Jesus learned obedience from what he suffered.
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.800]   Now a lot of people read that and say, "Whoa, learned obedience.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.080]   You mean like he stopped being disobedient and became obedient and thus sinned?"
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.520]   No, that's not what it says and that's not what it means.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:57.400]   When it says he learned obedience, he means he moved as he grew from one degree of obedience
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.400]   to another.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.200]   Here comes a new challenge and he becomes obedient again.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.400]   Here comes a new kind of challenge and he becomes obedient again.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:12.840]   He's learning at each stage the actual implementation of his obedient heart in acts of obedience
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.800]   and he's doing it through what he suffered, which means that God ordained suffering in
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.720]   the life of Jesus to bring him to the fullest expression of obedience.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:35.760]   Now the reason that's important is because we, I think, forget that God's hand of discipline
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:43.600]   may be on us not simply to spank us because we've been bad, but to stretch us and broaden
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.720]   us in what we're doing well.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.840]   Job, remember, was described in the very first verse as being an upright man and blameless.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.280]   And God gives Satan permission to beat up on him.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.560]   And it wasn't because Job was acting in any overt, sinful way that needed discipline,
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.760]   but it did turn out in the end that Job had some sediment of pride at the bottom of his
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.480]   life that got jostled up into that beaker of life.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.040]   That's my picture.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.620]   He's got the sediment at the bottom and then you shake the glass and whoa, there it comes.
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.480]   And at the end in chapter 42, he says, "I've got to repent in dust and ashes.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.400]   I've said things I shouldn't have said."
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.280]   And so God is always, I think, always disciplining us.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.880]   Here's another factor.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:42.960]   In Romans 2, 4, it says, "Don't you know that the kindness of God is meant to lead
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.960]   you to repentance?"
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:52.360]   So now here you have God using another strategy besides spanking, besides suffering, to bring
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.600]   us to repentance.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.500]   So we're doing something we shouldn't be doing.
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.640]   He sees something defective in our life.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.680]   And what does he do?
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.680]   He makes the sun shine.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.480]   I mean, I'll give you an illustration.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.280]   I one time got really mad at Noelle because I found a whole crate of rotten pears in the
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.280]   garage.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.020]   This is about 35 years ago and we were still teaching.
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.660]   And she had forgotten these fruits she bought and it just rotted in the garage.
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.500]   And I went into her and said, "What's with the pears?"
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.980]   "Oh, I forgot them."
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.380]   A whole crate of pears just rotted in the garage.
[00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.420]   I'm just getting down on her like I've never done anything like that.
[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.180]   And she kind of went back to her bedroom.
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.420]   She's hurt and I'm mad as all get out.
[00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.820]   To kill time, I pick up the garbage and I take it outside to put it by the street because
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.860]   it's garbage pick up day.
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.980]   And when I got on the driveway, the sun was as bright as glorious could be.
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.620]   The sky was blue.
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.500]   A sweet breeze was blowing on my face.
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.140]   And I stopped and cried.
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:04.980]   I just cried because God was kissing me on the cheek after that rotten attitude.
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.420]   And it broke me like no...
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.540]   He could have caused a car to careen over the curb and smack me smack into the hospital
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.100]   and he would have been absolutely right to do so.
[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.180]   But instead, he smiled upon me.
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.860]   So the point there is God is always disciplining us.
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:30.060]   He's always doing things good, hard, and gentle to us.
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.940]   And so what we need to remember is that we're always loved.
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.940]   Hebrews 12, 6, he disciplines those whom he loves.
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.220]   For God's children, no spanking is ever anything but love.
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:52.820]   And there are people I know who have a very hard time feeling loved by God.
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.660]   Their dad treat them in such a way that they never felt affirmed.
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.100]   They never felt delighted in.
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.460]   They never felt accepted.
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.340]   They could never measure up.
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.220]   He's always on their case, spank and criticize and speak ugly words.
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:18.460]   So when I say to them that God disciplines us in love, that's very hard for them to feel.
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:26.420]   The difference between a dad like that and our God who disciplines us in love is that
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:33.220]   God never, never feels contemptuous of us.
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:41.420]   In other words, a dad often in his sinful meanness will say, "You're such an idiot.
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.420]   You always do that," and maybe hit them.
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.900]   And his words are contemptuous.
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.660]   They're despising.
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.380]   God never says, "You always did that.
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.380]   You're just an idiot.
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.460]   You never do anything right."
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.460]   God never loses control like that.
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:05.500]   If he spanks, if he brings any kind of hardship into our life, it's with measured, careful,
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:12.300]   wise, loving application of his wisdom and his grace to our situation.
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.820]   And so he's calling for us to have greater faith and greater humility.
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:24.460]   And I think my final underlying answer to the person who asks, "Well, then how do I
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.700]   know if I'm being disciplined?"
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:32.220]   I think what they're really asking is, "How do I know if I've sinned?"
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.220]   And the answer to that is, "Read your Bible."
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:42.380]   Don't base your conclusion about whether you've done something wrong on how God is treating
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.060]   you, because that's going to be very confusing, because sometimes he treats you way better
[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.020]   than you deserve, and sometimes he spanks you in order to bring it to your attention,
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.580]   but you can't tell which it is.
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:59.540]   And so you need to decide, "Am I sinning by looking at the Word of God and discerning
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.420]   what was my behavior like?"
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.660]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast.
