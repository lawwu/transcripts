[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.560]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from the Financial Samurai podcast where I help you achieve financial
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.180]   freedom sooner rather than later.
[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.220]   In this solo episode, I want to talk about what I think is the most important personal
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.300]   finance ratio you can follow.
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.880]   It is my house to car ratio for financial freedom.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.240]   We all need to live somewhere and most of us, or at least many of us, need transportation
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.300]   to get somewhere, maybe to go to work, to send your kids to school, and so forth.
[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.240]   However, what I have noticed since I started Financial Samurai in 2009 is that people spend
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.360]   way too much money on a car to their financial detriment.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.360]   I don't know what it is, but in America we have a love affair with cars, maybe it's because
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.520]   we have so much space to drive around, but I think we can all agree that paying a lot
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.640]   of money for an asset that is guaranteed to depreciate in value over time unless you are
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.080]   buying an expensive, expensive collector's item is not good for your wealth.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.460]   I think that's pretty clear.
[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.540]   So when you see numbers like the average new car price is now around $49,000 in 2024 and
[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.920]   likely to continue going up over time, that to me is absurd because the median household
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.760]   income is about $76,000.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.760]   That's pre-tax.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.480]   So after tax, maybe that's $60,000.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:40.080]   So you're saying the median or typical household in America is going to spend 80% of their
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.600]   after tax income or thereabouts on a new car?
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.600]   That's absurd.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.600]   That is a recipe for financial mediocrity over time.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.700]   So I came out with my 1/10 rule for car buying, which states to spend no more than 10% of
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.900]   your gross income on the purchase price or lease price of a car.
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.780]   It's a very simple rule that I think if you can stick with, it'll help you going forward.
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.540]   Now a lot of people are against this rule, probably because they have already violated
[00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.540]   the rule.
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.540]   And that's understandable.
[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.160]   If you read something on the internet or you hear something in a podcast that goes against
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.720]   what you've done, you might feel defensive.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.840]   You might want to back up your reasoning for doing.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.240]   That's totally fine.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.240]   This is a free world.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.240]   You can do whatever you want.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.520]   I'm just providing this rule to help you stay disciplined so you can save and invest more
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.380]   of your money over time.
[00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.360]   Just rewind time back to let's say 2009.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.120]   It's the depths of the financial crisis.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.960]   Instead of buying that new car for then what was maybe $30,000 or maybe you spend more,
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.760]   I don't know, think about how much more money you would have if you had invested that money
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.240]   in the S&P 500 or in real estate.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.960]   You would have a lot more money, probably triple, quadruple, maybe five times.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.060]   Meanwhile, your car is probably worth next to nothing now.
[00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.680]   So yes, I know you enjoyed your car, you needed a nice car, whatever the case may be.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.260]   But always think about the opportunity cost of not investing in things like stocks, real
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.360]   estate and other risk assets.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:21.200]   My strong, strong belief is that the freedom you feel after becoming financially independent
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:28.480]   or after you feel more financially independent feels way better than any type of car you
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.760]   will drive.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.040]   You will get bored of your car within six months.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.040]   Trust me on this.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.080]   I've gone through 15 cars in my life.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.080]   It's way too many cars.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.600]   And over time, as you get older, you just realize, hmm, it's just a car, gets you from
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.600]   point A to point B. And that interest generally fades for the majority of the car buying and
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.620]   driving population.
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.080]   So let's focus on the house to car ratio because I think we can also all agree that buying
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.740]   a home, getting neutral real estate by owning your primary residence is a good idea due
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:08.640]   to inflation and due to the historical rate of return of residential real estate in America.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.440]   That rate of return is about 4.8%, let's call it 5%, which has been historically 2-3% above
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.580]   the rate of inflation of 2-2.5%.
[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.000]   Inflation is running higher now post pandemic and all that stimulus.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.800]   So we're around 3.5%.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.720]   However, home prices since 2020, since the pandemic have gone up way faster than inflation
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.160]   plus 2-3% that historical spread.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.040]   So getting neutral real estate I think is very important for the vast majority of listeners
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:46.040]   here because inflation is too powerful, too powerful an economic force to combat.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.580]   You just cannot win.
[00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.320]   You want to fix your costs as much as possible because the average person spends about 33%
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.560]   of their cash flow, their cash flow on living expenses.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.280]   If you can fix that cost over time as inflation whittles down the real cost of paying down
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.080]   your mortgage or any other expenses, that's a good thing because just look at history.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:14.000]   Just like you wouldn't short the S&P 500 long term, you wouldn't short the housing market
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.800]   long term.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:22.040]   So with the house to car ratio, we have to first come up with a baseline ratio for what
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.720]   is going on in the average, the typical American household.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.640]   So the median home price in America is about $420,000.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.200]   The average car price $48,000, $49,000.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.600]   So you have a ratio of about 8.8.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.040]   So in other words, the typical American has a house to car ratio of around 8.8.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:46.120]   The higher your ratio, I think the better because that means your car's value is a smaller
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.680]   percentage of your home's value.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.360]   And the other assumption is that the average person spends way too much on a car, right?
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.160]   Now for used cars, well according to Edmunds.com, the average price of a used car vehicle is
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.160]   about $27,300.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.920]   Therefore we can conduct another simple calculation by dividing $420,000, the median home price,
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:14.360]   by $27,300, the average used car price, and that gives you a ratio of 15.4.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:20.640]   So in other words, the typical American household has a house to car ratio of between 8.8 to
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.800]   15.4.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.520]   And since you're seeking financial freedom sooner than the masses, your goal is to beat
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:35.140]   this ratio by as much as possible if you want to attain financial freedom sooner rather
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.400]   than later.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.560]   Pretty straightforward, right folks?
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.880]   You don't want to be like the typical American because the typical American doesn't have
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:49.400]   a lot in taxable retirement savings or tax-advantaged retirement savings accounts.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:55.360]   Typical American saves around 3.5% of their cash flow every single month.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.120]   The typical American is not someone you want to model your finances after if you want to
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.140]   outperform the typical American, right?
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:08.280]   We want to achieve more wealth, have more freedom, have the optionality of retiring
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.800]   earlier if we want, and to just have more optionality in general so we can do more of
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.360]   the things that we want to do.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.040]   Now just a couple notes on this ratio.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.840]   If you have more than one car, you must add the total current value of your cars, not
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.280]   the purchase prices, to come up with the denominator.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:30.040]   And your house's value is the current estimate value, not your home's purchase price.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:35.460]   And if you lease a car, use the estimated value of your car for the denominator as well.
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.800]   Some of you might be asking, "Well, what if you don't own a car, but you own a home?"
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:45.400]   Well, I say you're winning because you're resourceful, you're taking public transportation,
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:51.560]   carpool, you're utilizing rideshare platforms, and/or have the ability to work from home.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.400]   You might be lucky enough to live in a city with fantastic public transportation, such
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.680]   as New York City or every major city in Europe and Asia.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.360]   Given a car is a liability that will grow over time with maintenance issues, wear and
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.900]   tear parking tickets, and potential accidents, to not need a car to get around is a huge
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.880]   financial benefit.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.680]   As long as you're saving and investing in the stock market, public real estate funds,
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:23.140]   private real estate funds, or other risk assets based on your risk tolerance and goals, you're
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.880]   likely going to build much more wealth than the average person over time.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.520]   So I say with this scenario, where you don't own a car, but own a home, you can have a
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:39.520]   house-to-car ratio default of 30, so you are outperforming the typical American household.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.880]   Now, what if you own a car, but not a home?
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.840]   Well, I say this is a negative scenario.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:51.400]   Most people will own a car first before buying a home, given a car is cheaper than a home,
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.400]   and that's fine.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:58.680]   However, after age 35, if you still own a car, but not a home, unfortunately, I don't
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.820]   think you're going to achieve financial independence before the traditional retirement age of 60
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:09.740]   to 65, and you may underperform the typical American household, because again, inflation
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:15.500]   is too hard to combat, so you might as well ride it, and cars depreciate in value.
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:22.180]   When I got to San Francisco in 2001, I was 24, 24 and a half years old, and I got a raise
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.340]   and a promotion.
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.820]   So what did I do?
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:28.020]   I spent a lot of the money on a car.
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.940]   First, it was a used BMW 528.
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:37.300]   I loved the car because it was tinted windows, it had BBS rims, 18-inch rims, and it had
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:43.700]   an amazing sound system inside with a display that came out of the dashboard and popped
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.700]   up.
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:50.100]   So back then, that was really, really cool, and I spent, I think, about $20,000, $22,000
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.280]   on the car, and that was a lot of money for me.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.100]   And soon I realized after about a year, man, this was just not good for my wealth.
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:03.500]   So I sold it, but not before I bought another car, a more expensive car, after my first
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:10.280]   bonus with this new firm, which was a G500 Mercedes, and that was another financial mistake.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:15.100]   So it's almost like you've got to get this car desire out of your system to realize a
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:21.900]   nice car is kind of overrated after a while, because after a while, your payments stay
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:26.560]   the same, but your enjoyment and appreciation of the car declines.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:31.740]   Now what about the final scenario if you don't own a car or a home?
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:36.940]   Well, in such a scenario, I say you have a clean slate, so don't blow it.
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:43.100]   You are lucky to hear about this car ratio because you have an opportunity to asset allocate
[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.740]   and spend your money appropriately.
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:51.740]   Now we know the typical American household has a house-to-car ratio of between 8.8 to
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.700]   15.4.
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:59.060]   So what is that ideal home-to-car ratio you should shoot for?
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.140]   Well, here it is, folks.
[00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.220]   I think that ideal ratio is 50.
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:10.540]   Once you have a house-to-car ratio of 50 or higher, you're in the golden zone of financial
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.260]   responsibility.
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:18.560]   The longer you own your car, the higher your ratio will grow, given your car will depreciate
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.760]   and your home will tend to appreciate.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:27.860]   And ideally, you get a home-to-car ratio of 100 or higher.
[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:35.140]   At a ratio of 100, I feel financial freedom sooner for you is an inevitability.
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:39.140]   Now does shooting for 30 or higher seem unreasonable?
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.980]   Well, let me share you some real-life examples.
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.480]   Here's a software engineer.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.100]   He's 39 years old.
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:51.120]   He owns a home for $850,000 and he drives a $30,000 Hyundai Sonata.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.180]   So his home-to-car ratio is 28.
[00:11:53.180 --> 00:12:00.340]   And so if he waits just one year, he's going to hit a house-to-car ratio of 30+.
[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.300]   Now I have a roofer here in San Francisco.
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:03.300]   He's 56 years old.
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.960]   He owns a $780,000 home down south.
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.140]   So that's really cheap for the San Francisco Bay Area.
[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:16.520]   And his cars total about $250,000 because he has five cars and two motorbikes.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:20.480]   So he has a home-to-car ratio of 3.1.
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.480]   He is 56.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:27.660]   He's still climbing up ladders and I think that's pretty dangerous after like 50.
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.900]   You really want to be climbing up ladders and doing roofing but that's just his business
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:31.900]   and he's probably an expert.
[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:37.860]   He doesn't feel that fear that typical folks who don't climb up roofs feel.
[00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:43.900]   And so I feel, unfortunately, he's going to have to be working on roofs for the rest of
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.840]   his life with a ratio of 3.1.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:52.880]   Now here's an entrepreneur, he's age 46, owns a median home price in San Francisco of $1.7
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:53.880]   million.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.800]   It's actually more like $1.8 million now.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.560]   He drives a $29,000 Toyota Prius.
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.220]   So his home-to-car ratio is 59.
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:11.240]   And here's a retiree age 75, owns a home that's worth $1.8 million now, owns a car, a 1997
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:15.680]   Toyota Avalon that's worth about $3,200.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.560]   Home-to-car ratio of 563.
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:25.120]   So at 74, the retiree has no need for a fancy car, doesn't really drive, can take Uber or
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.360]   Lyft or the bus and the retiree is good to go.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.720]   Now if you think about it in a different way, these people I've surveyed live in more expensive
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.420]   parts of the country, San Francisco Bay Area and Honolulu.
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:43.000]   So what about the rest of the country that lives in more moderately priced cities where
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:50.560]   you can buy a home for let's say $500,000, $500,000 and you drive a $30,000 car.
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:56.100]   Doesn't seem too obnoxious or too unreasonable financially, a $30,000 car.
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.120]   But that ratio is only 16.7.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.740]   So what do you do in that case?
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.360]   Are you a bad person?
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.120]   No, of course not.
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.860]   Because you're thoughtful, you give to charity, you help others and you think about others
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.460]   first before you think about yourself.
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:17.960]   What you do is you simply own your car, your $30,000 car until it depreciates to the level
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:22.320]   where your ratio, home to price ratio, gets to 30 or higher.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.920]   So doing some simple math, if your home price stays the same at $500,000, all you have to
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:32.600]   do is own your car until it depreciates to $16,650.
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:37.360]   And then you want to keep on owning your car until it depreciates to $10,000 or less because
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:42.960]   then you'll have a home to car ratio of 50 or higher, which is the golden zone.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:47.960]   Now since I came up with this financial samurai house to car ratio for financial freedom,
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.080]   I've received a lot of criticism about it.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:57.280]   And supposedly, I'm assuming these people who criticize don't have a ratio of 30 or
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.280]   higher.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.880]   And they say, "Are you kidding me?
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:05.440]   Are you telling me I have to buy a much more expensive home to get to a ratio of 30 or
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.440]   higher?"
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.720]   And no, that's not what I'm saying at all.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:16.560]   This ratio is predominantly to help you focus on buying a more affordable car and owning
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.280]   that car for a longer period of time.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:24.240]   The average tenure or the average age of a car on the road today is something like 12
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.920]   to 13 years.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.160]   So it's another barometer.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.400]   Our target to shoot for is to own your car longer than the average.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:37.040]   In terms of home buying, it's super important to follow a home buying guide.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:42.900]   I recommend following my guide, the 30/30/3 Home Buying Guide Ratio.
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:47.720]   And it talks about spending no more than three times your average gross household income
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:52.960]   on the purchase price of a home and to spend no more than 30% of your monthly cash flow
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.440]   on a mortgage.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:16:00.640]   And it's to come up with a 20% down payment and have a 10% buffer, liquidity buffer, after
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.960]   you put down that down payment for the home.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:09.480]   Now it is also a strict home buying rule to prevent you from spending too much on a home,
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.420]   getting into a bidding war, and getting stressed out once you buy a home.
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:19.360]   So please, my house to car ratio is not about buying the most expensive house possible so
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.680]   you can have a higher ratio.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:28.600]   It's really about buying the most affordable car possible and owning it for as long a time
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:33.960]   period as possible so you can naturally let that depreciation of the car work for you.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.000]   How awesome is that?
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.480]   If you believe in the logic of my house to car ratio, if you believe that homes tend
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:48.480]   to appreciate in value over time and cars tend to depreciate in value over time, I strongly
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:54.600]   believe you are going to do much better financially than the typical American or the typical person
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.400]   in this world, frankly.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:02.360]   And yes, there is a lift, a ratio lift if you live in an expensive city because homes
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.160]   are much more expensive in expensive cities, right?
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.600]   But a Honda Accord is generally the same price everywhere in America.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:14.040]   And that's something to think about too because if you live in an expensive city, there are
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.440]   more income generating and wealth building opportunities.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.520]   So expensive cities are expensive for a reason because of the wealth it can create.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:27.200]   Think about Apple after its Worldwide Developers Conference coming out with all their AI initiatives
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:33.040]   and stock is up 5% plus and that's building hundreds of billions of wealth for tens of
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.640]   thousands of people.
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.200]   This is what happens in expensive cities.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:40.360]   They get generally more expensive because the wealth generally increases at an even
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.440]   faster rate.
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.960]   So it's just something to think about.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.600]   Expensive cities, don't look at them as a vacuum like, "Ah, the house price is so expensive."
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.760]   Well, think about how much you could potentially earn.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:56.440]   And yes, there is a penalty for living in a less expensive city because home prices
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:00.100]   are less and cars are generally the same price.
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:05.700]   So if you want to make an adjustment and say, well, if you live in a city that has a median
[00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:12.200]   home price that's 20% below the median, well, you can take my ideal ratio of 30 or higher
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:17.240]   and discounted by 20% to say 24, shoot for a 24 target.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:22.180]   My house to car ratio is really to help you think about where to be spending your money
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:26.620]   if you don't own a home, if you own a home, you want to buy a car, you want to get rid
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:27.860]   of a car.
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:33.720]   In conclusion, run the numbers for your own self and see how long you have to own your
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.760]   car to get to a ratio of 30 or higher.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:42.240]   I promise you once you get there, you are going to feel great about your finances if
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.440]   you aren't feeling great already.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:50.400]   The financial samurai home to car ratio, I think is the most important personal finance
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.080]   ratio we can think about and talk about today.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.880]   Please run the numbers and let me know what your ratio is and tell me how you plan to
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:18:59.880]   improve it.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.880]   All right, everyone.

[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.200]   loved ones and see whether they agree or disagree.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:17.320]   I'm always willing to listen to feedback, to improve these ratios, to improve these
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:23.200]   concepts for the number one purpose of helping you achieve financial freedom sooner rather
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.200]   than later.
