[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   [Music]
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.320]   We fight off personal despondency through a habit of daily Bible reading.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.920]   That's what we've been seeing here in these early weeks of 2023 as we focus our attention
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.920]   on Psalm 77.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.880]   Thank you for joining us here on this Wednesday.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.720]   We're going to do so with one last clip from John Piper's sermon on Psalm 77.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.640]   We close our little study of the psalm with a practical plea and a summons from Pastor
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.160]   John for making and holding to a daily Bible reading routine in this new year.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.360]   Here he is speaking to his church in the early days of the year 2000.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.560]   Remember, I will remember, I will meditate, I will muse.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:52.440]   We must become an intentional, purposeful, active, aggressive, warrior people who fight
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.160]   for delight.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.360]   It doesn't come automatically.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.200]   We fight for delight.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.200]   I close with this very practical plea, summons, call, and this.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.120]   Will you, this afternoon, before you go to bed tonight, if you haven't already got it,
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:21.680]   take enough time, five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen minutes, whatever, to plan when in
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.520]   your days you are going to read the Bible every day in the year 2000.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.800]   When?
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.800]   If you don't have a time picked out, it won't happen.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.880]   If you say, "I'll read it tomorrow whenever I get a chance," there will be no chance.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.920]   Satan will see to that.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.260]   Your flesh will see to that.
[00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:45.080]   If you don't plan to read the Bible at a particular time, you will become a hit and miss, hazard
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.760]   Christian and weak.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.400]   Another question to ask this afternoon is, "Where will I read the Bible?"
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:59.160]   Closet, kitchen, bedroom, living room, den, car, conference room at work, park.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.160]   You choose.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.200]   If you don't have a place picked out, you'll stand in the halls and you'll say, "There's
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.080]   no quiet place.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.080]   There's no place to go.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.080]   Music in there.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.080]   TV's in there.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.120]   Cooking's in there.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.120]   There's no place to go."
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.320]   Well, let's check the email.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.160]   You never know what you might get sent.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.800]   Susanna Wesley had 16 children.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.040]   Housewives, she knows where you're coming from.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.760]   So five little kids, noise, noise, noise.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.760]   Where are you going to go?
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.760]   What are you going to do?
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.160]   Two of them are sick.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.360]   Susanna Wesley was such a disciplinarian that she taught these 16 kids, "When you walk into
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:51.000]   the kitchen and my apron is over my head, you don't say a word."
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.600]   That's her closet.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.920]   She's created one.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.280]   And she was strong enough, really strong, I'll read some maybe of her excerpts from
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.040]   her words on Wednesday night, really strong that they obeyed.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.600]   When mommy's apron is over mommy's head, we know what's happening.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.000]   The Bible is open and she's praying.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.280]   And you don't go into the holy place.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.840]   It can be done if you want it, if you believe in it.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.480]   And the third question, when, where, and how.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.920]   How are you going to do it?
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.520]   If you don't have your own way, you've got to have a way.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.920]   I tell you, I've been working at this now for 48 years or so, and I know a lot about
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.080]   defeat in Bible reading.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.560]   And one of the defeats that's most painful is to have the place, have the time, sit down
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.240]   and open the book and you don't know where to go.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.080]   I don't know where to go, I'm a pastor.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.040]   And you just open it and you say, "Well Malachi doesn't look right."
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.800]   "Son, look right."
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.600]   And Satan will actually persuade me that's a good enough reason to reach for a book on
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.600]   theology.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.600]   Isn't that crazy?
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.640]   And if it happens to me, probably it happens to you.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.960]   And therefore, we just got to have some guidelines.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.520]   You don't have to keep them, you just got to have them there so that you can fall back
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.720]   on them if there's no better thing to do that day.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:14.840]   Okay, how, where and when will you, if you don't already have a plan, take whatever amount
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.200]   of time, 5, 10, 15 minutes a day to plan to do it?
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.760]   I'm not asking you to do it.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.000]   Isn't that easy?
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   I'm asking for intentionality here.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.240]   I'm asking for a plan.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.760]   And you might in your heart even make it a vow to the Lord.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.560]   Would you stand with me for closing prayer?
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:46.560]   Father, I ask you that you would fulfill every good resolve and work of faith by your power.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:53.520]   Bless these people who have seen the way to live the Christian life as a life on the Word,
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.120]   meditating, musing, remembering.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:04.960]   And Lord, make it part of our arsenal of how we triumph day in and day out against the
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:05.960]   evil one.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.880]   Oh Lord, make us good warriors, I pray.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.480]   Help us know how to fight for delight.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.000]   And all the people said, "Amen."
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   You're dismissed.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.160]   Yeah, that apron story reminds me of an old APJ we recorded titled "Bible Time for Busy
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.160]   Moms."
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.880]   There, Pastor John encouraged moms of young kids to "find your apron."
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:31.520]   That was APJ 437, and you can find that episode at AskPastorJohn.com.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.640]   This sermon clip was from a message preached on January 2, 2000 on Psalm 77.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.720]   The sermon is titled "I Will Meditate on All Your Work and Muse on Your Deeds."
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.800]   A message in the sermon archive at DesiringGod.org.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.000]   I am your host Tony Reinke.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   We'll see you back here on Friday.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.640]   Thanks for listening.
