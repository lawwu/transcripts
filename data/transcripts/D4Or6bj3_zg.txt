[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.760]   Jason Su.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.420]   Jason graduated with a degree in physics
[00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.840]   from California Institute of Technology,
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.440]   was awarded his Master's of Science in Finance
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.240]   from Stanford University,
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.080]   and earned his PhD in Finance from UCLA,
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.980]   where he conducted research on the equity risk premium,
[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.100]   business cycles, and portfolio asset allocations.
[00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.360]   Jason has authored more than 40 peer-reviewed articles.
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.780]   He is the Associate Editor
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.680]   of the Journal of Investment Management,
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.240]   and serves on the editorial board
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.900]   of the Financial Analyst Journal,
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.680]   the Journal of Index Investing,
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.680]   the Journal of Investment Counseling,
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.960]   and the Journal of Investment Management.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.080]   Professionally, Jason has been on the forefront
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.880]   of factor investing as one of the founders
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.440]   of research affiliates,
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.960]   and now has taken factor investing to a new level
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.960]   as he applies it to the Chinese stock market.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.740]   So with no further ado,
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.000]   let me introduce Jason Su.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.840]   Welcome to the Vogelheads on Investing podcast, Jason.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.160]   - Glad to be here, Rick.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.520]   - Well, it's great that you joined us.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.960]   I've always been super impressed with your background,
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.480]   and all the things that you've done
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.600]   in the financial services industry,
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.880]   in the investment management industry.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.280]   Been a very successful person.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.320]   Although, I have to say, you kind of fly under the radar,
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.340]   in that you've done so much,
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.440]   and you've got so many awards,
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.600]   but you may have fortune,
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.820]   but you don't have the fame,
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.520]   which is a little bit odd in a way,
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.400]   given who you are and everything that you've done.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.920]   And so maybe we'll elevate that a little bit here,
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.120]   at least among the Vogelheads.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.520]   So I've been a big fan of yours for years.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.940]   And before we get started,
[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.560]   tell us, going as far back as you feel comfortable,
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.120]   a little bit about your background.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.760]   - Well, going really far back, Rick,
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.560]   I came to this country really as an immigrant.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.720]   No, you know, I arrived when I was 10.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.760]   At the time, I spoke, I think, no English.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.960]   But the country's been really, really good to me.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.520]   I learned a tremendous amount.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.480]   And eventually I found myself at Caltech,
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.480]   studying to be a physicist.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.480]   - You got into California Institute of Technology,
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.800]   and you decided you were going to be a physicist.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.480]   And you've excelled in that.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.480]   You actually graduated summa cum laude in physics.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.600]   What happened after that?
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.320]   I mean, you've made a pivot for sure.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.240]   - Yeah, the one thing that I experimented with
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.240]   while at Caltech was I did sort of a weekend gig
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.840]   at a economic laboratory,
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.680]   where they had students play essentially market games.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.720]   And we were the subject of the experimentation.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.960]   And I was really good at those games.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.360]   Eventually they prevented me from participating.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.160]   And that's when I got to learn about markets,
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.920]   and about equilibrium, and also about market efficiency,
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.440]   and how competition leads to price efficiency,
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.440]   and how that generally leads to better outcome
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.200]   for everyone involved.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.960]   - What year was this, when all this was going on?
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.960]   - 1994, so I was a sophomore.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.240]   - And then you decided after you graduated
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.560]   to pursue a master's of science in finance
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.280]   at Stanford University.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.160]   You've got some pretty good schools in your background.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.560]   - Yeah, I decided to learn about financial markets,
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.480]   really be an economist and understand
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.880]   how this stock market thing work,
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.560]   how the capital markets work,
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.480]   how that's relevant to the real economy.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.480]   And I guess to how society are shaped
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.120]   as a result of how these markets interact.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.120]   - And then from there you went on to get your PhD at UCLA.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.880]   - That's right.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.680]   - And what was your PhD thesis?
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.280]   - So I was studying the differences
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.280]   between American households and Asian households.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.720]   And the thing that I was trying to understand
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.240]   is why do Asian households save too much
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.800]   and American households save too little?
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.480]   And as a result, what you see is Asian households
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.160]   participate in the stock market very directly
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.480]   and very meaningfully, and American households do not.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.600]   The participation is very indirectly
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.760]   through their defined benefit pension plans or 401(k).
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.040]   There's really very little of individual wealth
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.360]   outside of retirement plan
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.800]   that's committed to the stock market.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.320]   So that was kind of the primary thing that I studied.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.160]   - Well, it's interesting.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.560]   And we're gonna get to this a little bit later on
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.200]   in the podcast, but it's interesting now
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.560]   that you've circled back to that with your new company
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.000]   in a way to try to capitalize on these individuals
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.640]   in the market as opposed to through institutions.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.840]   I can see where you ended up going with all this
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.440]   is a little bit where you currently are right now
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.440]   and without getting too far ahead, is that true?
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.640]   - Yeah, I mean, I didn't know at the time
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.080]   that that was going to be of any practical usefulness.
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.520]   Really, I was very much set on pursuing
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.920]   a academic research career.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.040]   It really was through a sequence of, I guess,
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.600]   happy coincidence that I ended up being
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.200]   more of a practitioner than a academic scholar.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.200]   It's like a bigger accident that 20, 25 years later,
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.000]   it ended up being quite useful given the business I'm in.
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.000]   - But you did do a lot of academics.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.280]   I mean, you were an adjunct professor
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.960]   and you were a visiting professor at various colleges,
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.440]   both here and in Asia.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.360]   And you did get the feel for being an academic.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.840]   - Yes, I did put my PhD to good use.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.600]   - And you also wrote many papers.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.320]   You wrote 40 peer-reviewed papers.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.920]   And could you explain what the difference is
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.960]   between just writing something and having it published
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.640]   in a peer-reviewed paper?
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.400]   - Yeah, so it is now fashionable in our industry
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.240]   for firms to do white papers.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.240]   And white papers feel a little less marketing and salesy
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.880]   and perhaps more educational and neutral.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.720]   But frankly, oftentimes, the quality is suspect.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.640]   And you can definitely see an angle
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.480]   where this is just a dressed-up marketing document.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.840]   But when it's a peer-reviewed journal article,
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.640]   whether it's industry journals or academic journals,
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.960]   they're meant to be educational, right?
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.280]   You're supposed to do research
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.880]   that answers the important question
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.400]   and you're supposed to use methods that are robust,
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.960]   that is replicable.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.080]   And the conclusion you draw from it has to be logical.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.120]   And there's at least one referee, if not two,
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.840]   and the journal editor will also sort of vet the paper
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.720]   to ensure that it is truly educational and useful
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.760]   and then not sort of a sales document in disguise.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.480]   So it's a much higher bar that's required
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.400]   in terms of rigor and the time committed
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.760]   to doing a peer-reviewed article.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.280]   Most articles that are submitted to journals
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.840]   are actually rejected.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.600]   And even the ones that get accepted
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.480]   go through two, three rounds of editing and re-editing.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:36.160]   - You are also very familiar with getting articles published.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.440]   Not only have you written 40 peer-reviewed articles,
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.640]   but you're also a member of the editorial board
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.200]   for the Financial Analyst Journal.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.800]   You're a trustee for the CFA Institute Research Foundation.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.400]   You're an associate editor
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.840]   for the Journal of Index Investing,
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.080]   an associate editor
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.880]   for the Journal of Investment Management.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.600]   You could tell the difference, I think, if anybody could,
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.120]   between something that's a marketing piece
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.840]   and something that is a actual academic paper.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.160]   - Yep, part of that is the PhD training,
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:14.160]   and part of that is also being on both sides of the table,
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.880]   writing something as a scholar,
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.040]   and of course, being a gatekeeper
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.560]   to ensure that only scholarly pieces sort of come through.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.200]   And I've been doing that for about 20 years.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.400]   - Yeah.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.000]   You also have been in the field.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.240]   You've got a distinguished career, not only in academics,
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.360]   but also you have a distinguished career
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.800]   in the investment management field,
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.800]   first as the co-founder of Research Affiliates,
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.680]   and co-founded that with Rob Ardott.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.840]   Can you give me a little history?
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.280]   Because I know Rob, and I've known him for many years,
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.160]   and he's an interesting character.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.720]   But I'd like to know how that all came about.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:00.840]   - Yeah, again, as I mentioned, a very lucky coincidence.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.520]   So I was at UCLA, really finishing up.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.560]   That was my last year in a PhD program,
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:11.560]   and Rob had just sold and exited out of his last company,
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:15.520]   First Quadrant, and decided to volunteer
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.960]   at UCLA Anderson School.
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.920]   Of course, the dean was very excited,
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.080]   having someone who's so well-known,
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.240]   and who, at some point in the future,
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.000]   could be a very meaningful donor to the business school.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   And so we were put together to co-teach a class together,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.120]   because, obviously, I'd been a lecturer at UCLA
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.960]   by that time for a number of years,
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.640]   and Rob, obviously, someone with great war stories,
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.320]   so the dean thought that would be a great pairing.
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.960]   So that's how we got to know each other.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.080]   And Rob is someone, I guess at that time,
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.080]   still very young, had a lot of ambition,
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.960]   and had a lot more left in his tank.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.240]   And he quickly decided, well, he said,
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.480]   hey, I'm gonna start something,
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.160]   and Jason, would you be interested in joining in the startup?
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.480]   And that's how we got started,
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.320]   literally two guys in a garage,
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.040]   'cause we didn't have an office back then,
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.320]   and then a Bloomberg.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.400]   - A living room and a Bloomberg,
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.040]   that's how I actually got started myself
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.360]   in the advisory business.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.080]   So I understand where you're coming from on that.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.000]   But that's interesting.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.280]   And tell us originally about the focus
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.440]   of research affiliates.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.640]   What is it that you were trying to do with that company?
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.360]   And then what did it evolve into?
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.720]   - Like many startups that eventually succeed,
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.560]   what the original founder set out to do
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.680]   is often not what ended up being successful.
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.800]   So I think when Rob and I first got started,
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.160]   a number of ideas we tried.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.720]   Like we initially wanted to offer software, actually.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.280]   And it was way ahead of its time.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:59.240]   It was a smart software to help wealth management platform
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.680]   to manage rep accounts.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.800]   So it would be very intelligent
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.920]   in terms of tax loss harvesting,
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.680]   crossing, offsetting trades.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.760]   That great idea, probably ahead of its time,
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.720]   at a time when technology was a lot more expensive,
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.520]   a lot more unwieldy.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.600]   So that didn't fly.
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.240]   But I still think it was a great idea.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.600]   And later on, others have clearly done a much better job
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.040]   with that idea.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.560]   We then set out to do a liability defeasement strategy.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.840]   Again, a clever strategy that played off
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.720]   of the way the yield curve worked.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.000]   And we thought there was gonna be great demand,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   but I think liability defeasement back in the early 2000
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.120]   was still a little too early for most pension funds.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.720]   So again, a decent idea.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.200]   I even got a seed investor to trial the program,
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.480]   but it didn't actually go anywhere.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.000]   Was almost a side hustle,
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.160]   which was sub advising a asset allocation mutual fund,
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.680]   kind of a little pilot experiment for PIMCO.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.120]   And that ended up taking off and became a runaway success.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.720]   And then like, I think what most of you know us for,
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.320]   eventually we use the income from that product
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.640]   to develop fundamental indexing,
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.320]   which is what today research affiliates,
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.960]   but Rob and I are probably best known for
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.760]   and likely will be best remembered for.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:28.160]   - I recall all of this because I was in the industry
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.080]   at the time and watching this happen.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:36.120]   And to me, DFA, Dimensional Fund Advisors,
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.520]   had a real headstart on this factor investing,
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:44.680]   fundamental indexing strategy,
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:49.600]   but you did it in an exchange traded fund form mostly,
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.560]   and you captured that market fairly quickly.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:57.560]   - Back in the early 2000, ETF was a very new concept.
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.000]   A lot of people didn't know what it was, right?
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.200]   This mutual fund at the time was the vehicle of choice.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.360]   All the big ETF players you know of today
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.440]   didn't exist back then.
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.800]   And probably back then they didn't want to do ETF.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.920]   They thought it was a stupid thing to do.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.680]   So very early on, after we wrote the paper
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.600]   on fundamental indexing,
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:21.600]   we were contacted by Bruce Bond and Ben Fulton.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.760]   They started PowerShares.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:28.760]   And they said they are looking for innovative indexes
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.480]   on top of which they can create ETFs on.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.480]   And they knew it wouldn't make sense
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.320]   for them to do an S&P and compete with the SPDR.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.400]   So they really wanted something
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.400]   that was very differentiated.
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.640]   And they saw our research paper that was published
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.360]   in the "Financial Analyst Journal"
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.720]   and said, "This is it, this is it."
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:52.520]   And so we met one snowing afternoon in New York,
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.480]   agreed to a deal, found FTSE,
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.840]   had FTSE basically convert our fundamental index methodology
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.320]   into an index.
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.760]   - Just to clarify, FTSE is who?
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.080]   - Yeah, FTSE is one of the largest index calculators
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.600]   in the world, owned by the London Stock Exchange.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.000]   - And they took your methodology
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.120]   and created an index out of it?
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.600]   - That's right.
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.120]   - It was one of the things that I looked at
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.200]   and I personally said, "Well, this isn't an index.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.120]   "This is active management."
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.280]   (laughs)
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.680]   And that was really a debate back then.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.320]   I know that ship has sailed
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.760]   because the SEC said, "Yes, it's an index."
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.520]   But back then, I can recall the mudslinging
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.080]   that went on between you or your company
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.720]   and Standard & Poor's as to what is an index.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.080]   But I think that the SEC allowed all this
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.360]   to be called indexing and there it was.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.640]   Much different than what the slang became
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.600]   and the slang became smart beta,
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:58.360]   which at first you embraced,
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.080]   but then later on,
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.520]   didn't seem like you were embracing it so much.
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.560]   - Yeah, so Rick, I gotta tell you the backstory to that.
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.200]   So we didn't come up with the moniker smart beta.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:13.080]   We called our strategy fundamental indexing
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.200]   and we really were trying to play off
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.160]   of cap-weighted indexing, right?
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.680]   We think about cap-weighted indexing
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.720]   is market capitalization,
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.720]   which is determined by price times shares outstanding.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.520]   So really, there's a lot of price indexing
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.720]   in that construct and we wanted to play off
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.520]   of price-based indexing against something
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.040]   that's not price, but still related to value.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.960]   So we think of a company fundamental.
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.440]   So we said, okay, now fundamental indexing
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.240]   would be this play on word and it would contrast
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:49.280]   against say, cap-weighted or price-based indexing.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.240]   And that's really how we came up with the name.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.520]   And like you say, most people didn't think
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.320]   what we created was an index because everyone
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:04.320]   had by that time come to, except that the index
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.960]   should be cap-weighted because that's how S&P is built.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.440]   And there's a paper by Bill Sharp and others
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.880]   that talked about the merit of cap-weighting
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.240]   as a portfolio construct.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.440]   And so we were really swimming upstream
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.960]   against that established school of thought.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.800]   And as we were talking to investment consultants,
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.160]   financial advisors, most people said like,
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.240]   you got an active strategy, it's not an index.
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:36.040]   So you really shouldn't be in the ETF space
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.560]   because ETF is really meant to track passive indices
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.720]   for people who believe in market efficiency.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.320]   And so we actually had a lot of struggle
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.280]   in the early get-go.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.800]   - And I think I was part of the struggle.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.120]   I was the one that's sitting in the audience
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.760]   raising my hand, yelling at you.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.040]   - That's right, I do remember that.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.920]   - Well, anyway, it took a lot.
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.720]   Fundamental indexing, you know,
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.320]   I talked with Robert Knott about this.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.360]   I think it's an everlasting term,
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.840]   but you know, the smart beta isn't
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.520]   because it kind of dirties the water
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.880]   and muddies the water, in my opinion.
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.120]   Okay, this thing takes off then.
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.840]   I mean, you start rolling like a steamroller
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.960]   with fundamental indexing due to great returns
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:24.960]   from value stocks after the tech wreck in the early 2000s.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.560]   I mean, you're on the radar and things are growing.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.280]   Can you just take us through that part
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.880]   of the growth of the company?
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:32.720]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.560]   So from the initial get-go where, you know,
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.760]   people didn't even like the word indexing,
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:43.240]   to it being embraced by, I think it was first by,
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:47.560]   at the time, you know, Towers Watson, later on Mercer,
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.520]   and they coined the category name smart beta.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.120]   And then, like you say, it just grew like wildfire
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.840]   once consultants sort of validated the concept
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.760]   with a category name.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:01.120]   And we were the first, you know, off the board.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.320]   Yeah, we just had momentum behind us being the first mover,
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.840]   being the claim to the original IP.
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.960]   We, yeah, we had a lot of, I would say,
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.640]   active-oriented pension funds who say,
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:19.240]   "Hey, you know, we heard about the merit of a lower cost,
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.600]   "more transparent index strategy,
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.920]   "but we're not ready to go full-on passive
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.720]   "into the S&P 500.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.680]   "So going into a fundamental index
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.120]   "is kind of like halfway move,
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.600]   "going from full active to full passive."
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.200]   And then that was a good compromise
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.320]   for, I think, a lot of pension funds
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.760]   and their investment consultants.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.480]   And similarly, I think we had a lot of people
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.760]   who already bought into the concept of indexing
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:51.400]   and love and understood the ETF chassis who said,
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:55.920]   "Well, you know, here is a index product
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.680]   "that could actually have some credible success
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:04.040]   "in delivering outperformance slightly more consistently
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.600]   "and slightly more scientifically."
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.440]   And so we kind of were attracting flows
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.080]   from both sides of the argument, right?
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.320]   Attracting flows from active investors
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.760]   and attracting flows from some passive investors.
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.600]   And that really, like you say,
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.760]   it sort of steamrolled through the industry
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.480]   and then put research affiliates on the map.
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.280]   - Yeah, I remember this whole period of time
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:31.280]   and I remember discussions with you and discussions,
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.840]   I know I had discussion with you, Rob, about this.
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:38.120]   It was, look, you're sort of barking up the wrong tree.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.760]   This is initially, this is right at the beginning
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.800]   once you came out with fundamental indexing.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.600]   I remember saying, you know,
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.720]   don't go after the cap-weighted index first.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.200]   Don't go after them.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.400]   I mean, that's not your market.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.120]   Your market is active management
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.840]   because what you've done here
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.240]   is you've lowered the cost of active management
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.560]   and you've made it more consistent
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.240]   than what it was in the past
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.240]   because you have a set of rules.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.840]   And that's the enduring part of what you're doing.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.920]   So in my view, it was exactly what you said
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.000]   about a lot of these pension funds.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.760]   Look, we're not ready to go from active
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.760]   to cap-weighted indexing,
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.240]   but what we're ready to do, at least partially,
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:22.120]   is to go from active to fundamental indexing
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.680]   and at least lower our cost and make things more consistent.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.920]   When that shift happened,
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.320]   you know, that kind of the mental shift of marketing,
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.160]   if you will, happened,
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.160]   I think that really helped to propel
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.040]   the whole industry that you started.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.360]   - Yeah, Rick, you're absolutely right.
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:43.680]   I think your prediction and your advice at the time
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.360]   turned out to be, I think, key.
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:47.840]   I think, ultimately, we attracted a lot more assets
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.520]   from the active camp
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.240]   who really haven't had that much success
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.480]   with active management.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:22:00.160]   But, you know, I think it's going fully to pure passive
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.480]   took some meandering, I think,
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.200]   before they could fully sort of get on board.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.600]   And, you know, going to fundamental indexing
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:11.200]   was kind of a safe middle way compromise.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.800]   - And, like I said, it really cut the cost of doing it.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.640]   And it was consistent.
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.120]   I mean, when you're following a strategy
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:17.960]   like you're following,
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.400]   and you have to follow a systematic methodology,
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:26.400]   you don't get manager whims don't get in the way.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.720]   I mean, if you believe in the methodology
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.920]   and you look at the data and you say,
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.240]   "Well, it worked in the past
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.280]   "and this is why it worked in the past."
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.920]   And so we know that since it's a quote unquote index,
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.000]   that this is the methodology
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.240]   that's going to be used in the future.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.880]   So we can rely on that rather than relying on the manager
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.960]   to do one day be a value manager.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.720]   And the next day, they're not so much a value manager
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.480]   because that's just not where the momentum is at the time.
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.840]   That there was a lot of value to that.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.840]   And I have to believe that that's continuing
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:57.840]   to be that way.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.280]   Although it was a struggle, right?
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:04.280]   I mean, after the financial crisis occurred,
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.840]   value investing, fundamental indexing,
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.320]   although a lot of assets were going that direction,
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:14.040]   those factors didn't perform well.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.320]   I wanna get into here a little bit
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.240]   that they're not always going to perform well
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:22.640]   and that there is a 25 year,
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.320]   I don't wanna say cycle or something,
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.760]   a wave to these things
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.360]   and that people who are in it need to be patient.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.200]   - Yeah, Rick.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.320]   I mean, I think what we saw in 25 years,
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.800]   probably going out 30 years,
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.160]   there are really two things happening in the background
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.920]   that's made it difficult to be a value investor.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.360]   And given value is a big underpinning
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.640]   of the fundamental index methodology,
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.160]   it's been tough for value investors
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:54.080]   in fundamental index the last 30 years.
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.760]   And part of what's driving that
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.160]   is market has become more efficient, right?
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.840]   If you think of value as an anomaly,
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.440]   meaning you can buy good quality asset cheap,
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.560]   that's not supposed to happen.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.640]   Good quality assets are supposed to be expensive
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.400]   and it's generally the risky stuff
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.440]   that's supposed to be cheaper.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.520]   So you're generally supposed to see value stocks
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.760]   as more expensive, not cheaper,
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.560]   if they're truly high quality, right?
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.040]   So a lot of the value premium,
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.320]   you could say was an anomaly
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.800]   for whatever reason that it existed.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.600]   But as the market gets more efficient,
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.480]   it's supposed to go away.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:31.280]   So I think part of the diminishing value premium
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.280]   is related to the U.S. market
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.400]   becoming ever more institutional, ever more efficient,
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.040]   and any anomalies that's been documented historically
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.800]   is arbed out or just less relevant.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.920]   But you also have, I think, the last few years,
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.800]   if you're looking at Reddit,
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:52.920]   you're looking at Robinhood trading,
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.800]   you're looking at prices for cryptocurrency
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.440]   and GameStop stocks,
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.880]   you also recognize that U.S. market
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.000]   has, the last few years,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.520]   became probably more inefficient, right?
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.080]   I think retail trading's gone from 3%
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.480]   to closer to 30% now,
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:10.440]   and where exciting, sexy growth has done much better
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.360]   because that's where the retail sort of flows
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.240]   and retail trading have been concentrating on.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.280]   So you got two things, right?
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.320]   One is market becoming more efficiently priced,
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.040]   which makes value work less well.
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.120]   And then more recently,
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.960]   the market's sort of kind of gone
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.720]   to a bit of a tech bubble,
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.280]   which has a further punished value.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.040]   And when you combine those two together,
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.520]   it's been tough to be a value investor.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:36.440]   - But has that been true internationally?
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.040]   And let's kind of work outside the U.S. now
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.880]   and look internationally at developed markets
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.400]   and then, secondly, emerging markets.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.360]   Is it becoming more efficient?
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.400]   - Yeah.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.840]   So generally, I would say,
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:53.360]   when you want to get a sense of efficiency,
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.640]   probably the best indicator to look at
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.200]   is the fraction of the trading volume
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.080]   that's accounted for by retail trading.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:05.320]   Because I guess market efficiency is about price discovery,
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.960]   so it's about well-informed, analytical,
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.600]   rational, experienced investors making trades.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.040]   And when you're talking about individuals,
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.720]   that's not what drives efficiency.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.960]   So if you look at developed markets,
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.880]   by and large, are very institutionalized
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.000]   because they have giant pension funds
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.480]   and very developed mutual fund
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.640]   and wealth management industry.
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.720]   So most of the money's been delegated out
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.120]   and ultimately, the people who manage these assets
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.560]   are experienced.
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:39.360]   So it's basically super smart, experienced traders
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.120]   and PMs competing against each other.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.200]   So markets tend to be more efficient.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.880]   That's, by and large, not what you see in emerging markets.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.840]   Many of them have underdeveloped wealth management markets.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:54.480]   Their mutual fund industry is in their nascent stage.
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.560]   A lot of the trading are still just done
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.720]   by individual investors who are gambling in a stock market.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:05.720]   And so as a result, efficiency is generally poor.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:10.560]   And the funny thing is in the Asian emerging markets,
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:14.080]   I would say the efficiencies are particularly poor.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:18.200]   Part of it, you might say, might be culture for gambling.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.880]   A lot of the Asian investing is more gambling
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.440]   than really retirement planning or retirement saving.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.560]   And also what you see is Asian households,
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:30.680]   like my dissertation found out, they save way too much.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.560]   And some of that money end up going
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:35.360]   to the stock market unproductively.
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.720]   - So back to research affiliates,
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.040]   are you still associated with research affiliates?
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:44.520]   - I'm associated with research affiliate as an advisor.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:49.520]   So I exited or I spun out of research affiliates in 2016
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:54.280]   to launch Rayleigh & Global Advisors
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:57.960]   to focus on basically China.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:02.040]   We are now a specialty China manager,
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:05.440]   working with large institutions as well as financial advisors
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.400]   to help them get access to all things China.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.760]   That's my new focus now.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:13.200]   And it's because that's where I think as a researcher,
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.680]   as a portfolio manager,
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.720]   we could still create alpha consistently
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.480]   and reliably net of fees.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.640]   - Research affiliates was a research shop.
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:24.880]   You actually didn't manage investment portfolios there.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.000]   You were doing research and you were creating
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.480]   the methodologies for choosing stocks and weighting stocks.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:35.200]   Is that what your company Reliant is also?
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.120]   - Research affiliates had a very small book of business
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.360]   that was running assets directly,
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:45.360]   but it was so small as to be not known by most people
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.320]   who've done business with us.
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.040]   Rayleigh & Global Advisors,
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:52.800]   we now are more like a traditional
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.360]   quantitative active manager.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:58.120]   We both develop the IP, the strategy.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:00.320]   And while we do license them out
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:04.560]   to other larger asset managers who wanted our research
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.920]   and our strategies,
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:08.920]   we also have a thriving practice
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.640]   in terms of creating our own funds.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.560]   We have funds in China, in US,
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.920]   and we run segregated accounts for institutional clients.
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.880]   So we got a different business model now
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.920]   versus research affiliates.
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.560]   - So let's get into all of the research that you did
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.600]   on factor investing that was pretty much
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:32.080]   centered on US investors and the US markets
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.080]   with fundamental indexing initially.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.400]   I know you expanded that globally,
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.240]   but you primarily started it in the US markets
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.360]   and a lot of the work that you did,
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:44.120]   a lot of your papers and so forth were on the US markets.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:48.000]   You take these tools that you created, this research,
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.320]   you bring them to China.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.840]   And now the first thing you do is take those
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:57.360]   and did you attempt to apply them to the Chinese market?
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.480]   And if so, what happened?
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.320]   - Yep.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:04.760]   So first thing I did was to apply everything as is, right?
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.240]   So I've taken all of the anomaly factors
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:12.960]   that we documented in academia based on US data
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.240]   and say, well, do they work in China?
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.000]   And surprisingly or not surprisingly,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.800]   they work in China and they work quite well.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.920]   And when I thought about it, I go, oh, of course, right?
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:27.480]   A lot of the anomaly factors for the US,
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.160]   they sort of lived in the past
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:33.640]   and are sort of less effective or almost non-effective
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:37.120]   the last 10, 15 years because markets become so efficient,
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:37.960]   but they certainly work
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.400]   when the US market was less efficient.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:44.640]   Now, if you're applying those same intuition to China,
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.360]   it being a much more inefficient market,
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.440]   these anomalies ought to be larger.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.600]   And since these anomalies are often related
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:56.600]   to retail individuals and their behavioral biases, right?
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:00.080]   Mental accounting, loss aversion,
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:05.160]   preference for high volatility as sort of lottery substitutes
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.880]   but you see all of that in China in spades.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.680]   So what used to work in the US
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:14.680]   that maybe doesn't work anymore are alive and well in China.
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:18.120]   - I listened to your podcast with Jeff Patak
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:22.200]   and Christine Benz on Morningstar Longview.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:27.200]   And you were talking about a 9% performance gap
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:32.800]   between Chinese fund returns and investors in those funds.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.640]   And just for some background,
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:39.600]   in the US that gap has been closing significantly
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.760]   over the last 10 or 15 years.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:45.000]   And the gap between mutual fund returns
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.560]   and market returns and client investor returns
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.640]   has really narrowed down.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.880]   In fact, balanced funds,
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.640]   which you're actually getting an alpha now
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.560]   by being in a balanced fund.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:59.000]   But this is not the case in China.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.160]   Can you elaborate on that?
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.240]   - Yeah, there are two things that are super surprising
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:07.560]   when you look at Chinese fund data.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:08.800]   First of all,
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.840]   if you just track the average mutual fund in China,
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:15.040]   on a net of cost basis,
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:18.960]   they outperform by about 4% per annum.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:22.240]   So this is adjusting for survivorship bias,
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.040]   obviously taking costs into account.
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.800]   So this is really net performance.
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.680]   And of course, that's not what you see in the US, right?
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.040]   In the US net of cost,
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.400]   the average mutual fund underperforms.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.080]   So that's the first surprising thing.
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.200]   Now, again, if you think about it,
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.240]   just tells you US market very efficient.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.480]   Therefore, even well-trained portfolio managers
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:45.280]   can't consistently beat the market.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.160]   In China, it's very inefficient.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.120]   So someone who's a trained money manager,
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:52.280]   he's basically extracting alpha
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.720]   from essentially retail gamblers.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.840]   So that's the first surprising thing.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.680]   The next surprising thing is,
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:01.240]   the mutual fund industry in China is very underdeveloped,
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.720]   meaning most people don't trust mutual fund managers
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.320]   enough to buy mutual funds.
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:10.080]   They somehow trust their own skill more
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.160]   or prefer to gamble.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.520]   And so as a result,
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:18.000]   they speculate in the stock market
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.440]   to obviously great detriment of their own wealth.
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.240]   So that's another thing we see in China,
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.480]   despite the outperformance,
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:30.040]   mutual fund industry is in its very nascent stage.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:33.000]   It's actually not grown very fast at all.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.480]   - I was reading a research paper that you put out,
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.880]   "China's Got Talent, Fund Manager Skill
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.360]   and Alpha in Chinese Stocks."
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:47.360]   And you track the growth of the mutual fund industry.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:50.560]   And back in 1999,
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:55.560]   there was a whopping 22 mutual funds for all of China.
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:59.480]   But by the end of 2020, you wrote,
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:03.160]   there was almost 8,000 mutual funds.
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:06.600]   So, and most of them were developed in the last,
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.840]   call it seven years.
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:12.720]   How do you think this is gonna affect the efficiencies
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.640]   of the market efficiency in China?
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:19.880]   - So usually I will be on the side of competition.
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.640]   I will bring about greater efficiency.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:25.440]   As I study more time with the data,
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:29.720]   what I have discovered when I look at this proliferation
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:33.000]   of mutual funds are really two things.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   One is most mutual funds in China are very concentrated.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.760]   So unlike the U.S. where most mutual funds
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:45.040]   are benchmark huggers, right?
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.760]   Where kind of, you're looking at closet indexers
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:50.760]   and therefore net of cause,
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.280]   it's very hard for them to beat the index.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:56.040]   In China, most of the mutual funds are quite concentrated.
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:59.120]   They would have enormously large bets on a sector,
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.040]   sometimes on a single stock.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.680]   And you kind of think about, well, why does that happen?
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.360]   Right, that goes against diversification,
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.840]   it goes against sensible portfolio management.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:12.240]   The reason it happens is Chinese fund investors
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.000]   are very short-term oriented,
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.160]   meaning they look at mutual fund performance leaks table
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.680]   on a weekly basis.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:23.520]   And they would buy a fund and if they see another fund
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.560]   that had the better performance,
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.440]   the next time they pick up a newspaper,
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:31.240]   they would be trading out of their last fund
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:33.080]   to get into this new hot fund.
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.360]   And as a result, if you're a mutual fund company
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.880]   and you want to not lose asset,
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.200]   or at least keep the asset within your family of funds,
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.800]   you've gotta constantly launch a new fund
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:46.040]   that's sort of flavor of day, theme of the day,
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.320]   and that's very concentrated.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.680]   So when the theme is right,
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.800]   you have insane performances.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.400]   And so that's largely what describes
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.800]   the funds industry in China.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:58.600]   So this fund proliferation hasn't brought about
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.840]   better price discovery or better competition.
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.080]   It's really just everyone is creating
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.280]   more and more extreme portfolios
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:10.320]   trying to benefit from the volatility effect
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.480]   so they can randomly become the best performer
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.280]   and gather a lot of assets.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.840]   - You know, it does remind me of the mutual fund industry
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.240]   in the United States, say in the '70s and '80s,
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.000]   there was a lot of that going on.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.760]   I think that Fidelity would create a fund
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.680]   based on whatever, it didn't matter what it was.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.400]   We're gonna create it and we're gonna launch it
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.680]   because people want it.
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:34.200]   And even though the owners of that company
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.320]   would never put a dime of their own money in it,
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.440]   it didn't matter.
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:38.680]   They were in the mutual fund business.
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:39.960]   And if this is what people want,
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.480]   then we're gonna give it to them.
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:44.000]   Now that's not so much anymore in the United States.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.840]   I think it's become too expensive to do that.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:48.760]   And it's thinned out as far as the amount of money
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:49.600]   that's available.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:52.160]   So it's almost become almost prohibitively expensive
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.400]   to do that.
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.800]   You still see some of that perhaps in the ETF industry,
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.720]   but just not as much as they used to be.
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:01.840]   But it seems like in China, this is what is going on.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:05.400]   - Yes, it is the mainstream practice.
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:09.880]   And so the fund proliferation really hasn't created
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:14.200]   a competition to lower fees or a competition
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.760]   toward sort of better practices in portfolio management
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.960]   that leads to them better price discovery,
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.560]   which then would lead to a more efficient market.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.560]   So we're many, many innings away
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.480]   from getting to that outcome.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:32.040]   - Now the market in China, if you wanna use an indice,
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:37.040]   I'm just looking at the China MSCI Stock Price Index.
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:40.960]   There is a beta there, although if you look back
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:45.960]   from 1995 through 2001, this market collapsed
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:49.600]   about, well, it looks like 95%.
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:53.480]   And then it came roaring back from 2002 up to 2007
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:57.280]   by I don't know how many multiples.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.160]   And then it collapsed again during the financial crisis.
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.000]   And now it's been crawling back up again.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.760]   Can you tell us a little bit about, you know,
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:08.440]   beta and people who say, well, I get what you're saying
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.280]   about the inefficiencies in the market.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:14.160]   And then if I used an active manager that I might do better,
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.960]   but I wouldn't know, you know,
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.200]   one active manager from another, of course,
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.520]   without, you know, getting into your firm yet, of course.
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:25.440]   But, you know, what if you just bought beta?
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.400]   I mean, would that work in China?
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.560]   - So if you just bought beta,
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:34.800]   it would have worked out okay the last 15 years.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:37.560]   Prior to that, not so much.
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.560]   Now the question is, well, is that just me
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:41.880]   cherry picking the last 15 years?
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:45.360]   Well, no, because prior to the last 15 years,
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:49.880]   beta is poorly constructed in the following sense.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:52.480]   It was mostly state-owned enterprises.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:55.200]   They weren't a lot of companies.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.520]   And so when you kind of bought that beta,
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.680]   you actually really had just a very concentrated exposure
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:04.080]   to a few large state-owned entities.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:07.400]   And then that I don't think is what you want to buy
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:10.520]   when you're betting on, you know, the growth of China,
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:13.280]   the transformation from being an export-oriented economy
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:16.600]   into a more consumption-based economy
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.200]   where you're hoping a very educated,
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:23.200]   hungry young workforce will drive productivity gains, right?
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.040]   That, you know, the 15 years prior to the last 15 years,
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.800]   you just couldn't buy things like that.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.000]   So it's really the last 15 years
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.160]   that you're starting to have breadth
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.960]   where the listed market
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.440]   is more than just state-owned enterprises.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.760]   Actually, a lot of interesting smaller cap stocks
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.040]   that were purely, you know, privately controlled
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:45.800]   became listed and were driving value
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.920]   and driving earnings growth.
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.960]   So I think, you know, the last 15 years
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.480]   was more representative.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.800]   Still, last 15 years, of course,
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:57.640]   you still had, you know, the global financial crisis.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.720]   You had the European debt crisis
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:02.080]   that had some spillover, like China.
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:04.440]   You had China's own crisis of the 2015
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.240]   with the credit crisis.
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.760]   But, you know, even through those ups and downs,
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:13.760]   the beta did deliver about a 11% return,
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:17.520]   compounded geometric return, which is not bad.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.840]   So yes, the beta itself,
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:22.280]   even if you go purely passive, is decent.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:26.080]   It is a lot more volatile than, say, the S&P 500.
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.240]   - I found some of your research
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.720]   that you did on state-owned enterprises
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.760]   to be interesting because you divide them up
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:36.760]   into big, mega, country-wide state-owned enterprises
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:42.480]   and then more local enterprises that are localized.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:48.360]   And the research found that these localized
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:51.480]   state-owned enterprises were far less
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:54.880]   likely to produce profits.
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.120]   Could you dig into that a little bit for us?
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.400]   - Yeah, I think most of us,
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:02.400]   when we think about state-owned enterprises,
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.800]   we tend to have this very negative view, right?
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.760]   We don't think of them as actually companies.
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.600]   You just don't see them as very efficient,
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:14.040]   nor do they really care about, say, stakeholder value.
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:17.440]   And that is not entirely true, but it's true enough.
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:20.640]   So in the data set, when we look at just the sort
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:24.080]   of city-level, town-level state-owned enterprises,
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.120]   when you look at all the operating efficiencies,
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.000]   they're just not very efficient.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.640]   You know, they have poor margins.
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.800]   They have a lot of debt.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:36.520]   If you look at all the metrics for management efficiency
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.400]   and quality, just not very high-quality teams.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.240]   And you're not surprised because they're really,
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.960]   you know, controlled and dominated by local bureaucrats
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.240]   and then subject to all the issues that occurs
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:50.600]   when a local sort of political power boss
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:53.840]   has his sway with everything in town.
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.840]   But when you look at the big Beijing-connected
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.680]   central state-owned enterprises,
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:01.520]   they tend to be, you know, well-oiled machines.
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.360]   The very best of the managers, you know,
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.880]   are in leadership positions,
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:10.160]   and their efficiency ratios are very, very high.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.080]   And they actually tend to have decent performances
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:12.920]   over time.
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:16.120]   - You also did research on,
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:18.320]   and I found this to be fascinating, by the way,
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:23.200]   the China companies that list in the U.S. market,
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.640]   we are here in the U.S., at least I've always been,
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:28.200]   under the belief that, well, these things have to be,
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:30.200]   go through a certain level of scrutiny,
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:33.200]   and that the accounting has to be right
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.320]   before they can be listed on the U.S. exchanges.
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:38.160]   And there's a certain level of confidence
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:40.200]   that I would have in a Chinese company
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.800]   that lists in the U.S.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:46.240]   versus just listing in the local markets in Asia.
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:48.640]   So I would be more inclined as a U.S. investor
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:51.040]   to trust those companies more.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.520]   But your research actually shows the opposite.
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:57.960]   - Yep, I mean, I had the same intuition as you did, Rick.
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.200]   I thought, look, you know,
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.760]   if you are willing to expose yourself to, you know,
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:06.280]   New York, right, to the financial money center,
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.280]   and compete out here as a stock, right,
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.640]   you gotta be pretty good when it comes to, you know,
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:13.360]   dotting your I's and crossing your T's
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.720]   and having good governance.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:15.560]   As I did more research,
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:17.160]   I realized it was actually the opposite.
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:21.040]   So the listing requirement and the level of scrutiny
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:24.520]   that you have to go through as a firm
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:28.640]   before you get listed in China is extraordinary.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:32.840]   And it's because the regulator at the stock exchanges
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:36.240]   who, you know, is in charge of approving your listing
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:38.360]   has personal liability.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:41.800]   If you list and it was discovered you made up numbers
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:43.920]   or for whatever reason you blow up later,
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:47.040]   that regulator has a lot of personal liability
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:49.840]   and his career is ruined and he might be going to jail.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:52.400]   So they take forever to approve anything.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:56.320]   And essentially they actually have this very cynical view
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:57.880]   about the underwriter,
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.960]   the investment bank that's helping you go IPO,
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:03.640]   expecting all of you to be in cahoots to defraud investors.
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:07.480]   So they actually have a separate underwriting process.
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.240]   Now in the U.S. it's not like that, right?
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:12.880]   In the U.S. our regulatory environment
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.920]   and our listing requirement
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:18.240]   is such that the consenting adults making trades, right?
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.480]   If you're willing to buy shares in a Chinese company
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:25.920]   that doesn't want to subject itself to independent auditing,
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.320]   hey, you know, it's in the disclosure.
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:30.960]   It's, you know, buyers beware.
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:33.520]   So you can't blame anyone if you invest in these companies.
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:34.920]   So as a result, our listing requirements
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:35.840]   are actually very low.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:38.720]   And most Chinese companies who cannot qualify
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:41.880]   for listing in mainland China or Hong Kong
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.800]   have chosen to list in the U.S.
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:44.880]   - Sorry to interrupt Jason,
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:47.680]   but could you say that one more time?
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:51.720]   - So the listing requirement for the U.S.
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:54.680]   is substantially lower than the requirements
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:56.560]   for mainland China and Hong Kong.
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.840]   So as a result, a lot of companies
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:02.320]   who fail listing requirement in mainland China and Hong Kong
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:04.120]   actually choose to list in the U.S.
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.760]   - That's just fascinating.
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:09.000]   I would have never known that.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   You know, I mean, here I am, a U.S. investor, you know,
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   thinking, oh, all these big companies
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.200]   that come over here to list,
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.960]   they must be the cream of the crop
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:18.320]   to come over here to the United States
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.160]   and list on the New York Stock Exchange
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.000]   or something like that.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.560]   But I would have never guessed
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:25.080]   that it's much more difficult to list
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:27.320]   as a Chinese company to list in China
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:29.320]   than it is to list in the United States.
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.240]   - It's absolutely true.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.400]   It's very strange, but it is true.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:34.880]   - Okay.
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:36.320]   All right.
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:38.040]   So you set up the shop over there
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:40.760]   and you first started out with factor investing
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:42.640]   and that was in 2016.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.640]   But I imagine you learned a lot very quickly
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.240]   and things are shifting for you.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.360]   - Oh yeah, absolutely.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.960]   So the first thing I learned was
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:54.200]   while many of these behavioral factors
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:57.640]   that we research and discover in the U.S. can work
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:00.440]   and then do work well in China,
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:03.160]   it is still a different market,
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:06.000]   certainly with a lot more retail participation.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.240]   And also with accounting rules are different than the U.S.
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:13.440]   and then also a market structure that's quite different.
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.800]   It's still got a lot of state-owned enterprises.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.520]   And as a result, you have to localize the research, right?
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.920]   You gotta take all these institutional features
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:26.720]   that's uniquely China and adapt your research.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.080]   And so what we found is we found a lot
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:30.800]   of China-specific factors.
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.160]   So again, they're behavioral in nature,
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.480]   but they exist in China only
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:38.520]   because either the data is available in China
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:39.880]   and not available in the U.S.
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:41.840]   So there's just more ways to characterize
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:44.120]   that behavioral bias,
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:46.360]   or they're just sort of features of the Chinese market
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:48.880]   that allow for retail individuals
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:51.400]   to express more of their biases.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.920]   So what we found is you've got to really have boots
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:57.800]   on the ground, know that market, learn the psychology.
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:01.800]   And if you do that, you'll discover a lot more factors.
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.480]   - Jason, a lot of investors are worried
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:05.880]   about the ESG factors,
[00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:08.640]   which are environmental, social, and governance.
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:10.800]   In other words, look, a lot of these are state-owned
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:14.000]   companies, they're not gonna report human infractions,
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.360]   they're not gonna report environmental infractions.
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:18.080]   People don't wanna invest in China
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:20.560]   because a lot of things are covered up.
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:24.360]   What is changing in China to make more disclosure?
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:25.520]   And can we trust it?
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:32.480]   - Well, today, if you want to apply ESG to Chinese stocks,
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.960]   if you hold them to Western standard
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.360]   by requiring them to be at the same level,
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:41.160]   clearly you're gonna eliminate so many of the stocks
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:43.480]   as to make the portfolio very concentrated
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:47.920]   and perhaps one that is unlikely to produce return.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.000]   But if you wanna apply a rule,
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.440]   which is more about the slope,
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:55.000]   meaning the speed at which they're improving,
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.760]   you'll find many companies to be great ESG citizens.
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:02.200]   That's because they're starting at a low base
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.920]   and the increased global pressure
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:08.520]   and increased self-awareness in terms of why ESG matters
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:11.360]   has actually encouraged a lot of them to make changes.
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:14.520]   Part of that is because if society becomes more wealthy,
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.920]   frankly, there's very little difference
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:18.880]   between a Chinese parent and American parent, right?
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:21.880]   They all want better water, better air,
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.880]   better food safety, better work environment
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:25.600]   for their children, and they're gonna demand that
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:29.480]   as consumers and they're gonna demand that as regulators.
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:31.600]   So we're definitely seeing improvement,
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:32.840]   even though the level today
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:35.720]   is clearly not international standard.
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:37.880]   Now, the one thing that is additionally interesting
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:41.960]   is governance is certainly the one dimension of ESG
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:45.560]   that is highly correlated with return in China.
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:47.440]   It may be less so outside of China,
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:48.720]   but in China, it's very correlated.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:51.320]   I think it's true for all emerging markets.
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:54.840]   I think people who are more short-term oriented
[00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:56.640]   in the way they evaluate stocks
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.400]   tend to not care about governance,
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:48:59.560]   but in the long run, it matters.
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:02.760]   So it's an underappreciated factor in China.
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:04.840]   And if you focus on firms with great governance,
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:06.720]   you often end up having great return.
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.480]   So even without requiring that,
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.880]   most portfolio managers in China,
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:13.760]   and ourselves certainly included in that,
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:15.480]   are very governance-focused,
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:18.880]   and that's critical in terms of driving portfolio value.
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:22.120]   - Without getting too into politics at all,
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:26.040]   there's been some real changes in things like tariffs,
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:30.600]   and that has affected some exports from China to the U.S.,
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.080]   that is, until the coronavirus hit,
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:35.160]   and then we all started spending our government checks
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:40.160]   on Amazon, and exports went up from China after that.
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:45.080]   But there's a shift, it seems, out of China now
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:46.800]   towards places like Vietnam.
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:51.000]   Are you thinking of expanding your search for companies
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.360]   outside of China to someplace like Vietnam?
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:58.840]   - Well, we're definitely sort of looking
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:01.840]   for other alpha reservoirs.
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.040]   Now, the thing with Vietnam is,
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:08.600]   it certainly is even more inefficient than China,
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:12.160]   because it's just an even younger stock market.
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.640]   But it doesn't have a lot of depth,
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:15.440]   and it doesn't have a lot of stocks.
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:17.720]   And then, of course, for a proper portfolio,
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:19.640]   it's gotta have some breadth.
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:22.920]   And of course, as a reservoir, right,
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:25.760]   to really be able to extract alpha,
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:28.200]   the reservoir has to be large enough.
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:31.640]   So for small markets with very little liquidity,
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.280]   and perhaps not enough wealthy household
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:36.880]   to enter the market to supply alpha,
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.920]   it's, even though there's inefficiency,
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:41.480]   it's actually not likely for managers
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:42.960]   to do very much with it.
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.920]   You're gonna be severely capacity constrained.
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:49.560]   So in a way, if you think about big alpha reservoirs
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:52.160]   that are available in the EM basket,
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:54.160]   really, it's China,
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:57.840]   and maybe a distant second would be India.
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:00.320]   - And that has-- - That's got the population.
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:03.280]   - And they have a trading mentality in many ways.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.240]   - Yep, as that market becomes more wealthy,
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:08.720]   as sort of the per capita GDP starts to catch up
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:10.920]   toward the Western world, like China has,
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.440]   you'll see more of the household wealth
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:14.560]   enter the stock market.
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:17.200]   And that's when sort of retail trading
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.320]   as a fraction of the market,
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:21.240]   and overall market liquidity will go up,
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:24.880]   and then therefore making the opportunity more meaningful
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:27.800]   for someone who wants to sort of be actively
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:30.760]   on the other side of those retail trades.
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:32.920]   - Well, Jason, it's really been interesting.
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:34.640]   Let's get to your company,
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:38.760]   and if our listeners want to learn about your company
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:43.520]   and what they might be able to follow you,
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:44.680]   where should they look?
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:48.400]   - So while we've been running
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:53.400]   a lot of different Chinese equity strategy onshore in China,
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.960]   the success of that business has convinced us
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:58.880]   to explore that.
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:03.360]   So we've launched our very first active ETF in the US.
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:05.440]   So to find out more about that strategy,
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:10.440]   you can go to funds.ralian.com
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:12.720]   to learn about what it does,
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:14.760]   whether it makes sense for you.
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:18.400]   We're obviously looking to build out a whole family
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:21.520]   of different Chinese equities exposure
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:25.760]   and fixed income exposure and other alternative exposures.
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:30.720]   And our belief is most investors
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:34.080]   are underexposed to China.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:36.280]   So the correlation is definitely going to come in
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:37.640]   as a major benefit
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:40.680]   in terms of making your portfolio more diversified.
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:43.720]   And insofar that you want to have exposure
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:46.160]   to a different currency,
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.760]   Chinese assets will give you exposure
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:50.160]   to another major currency
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:52.960]   that might be emerging and rivaling China.
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:54.840]   So you don't have to go to cryptocurrency
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:56.760]   to hedge against your dollar exposure.
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:59.680]   You can look at the renminbi based assets.
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:01.200]   And of course you want to buy more growth
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.360]   and it's differentiated growth.
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:03.800]   I guess China is just on a different part
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:06.400]   of the growth curve versus the US.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.200]   This is a market where you can buy that growth
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.640]   and buy it cheaper.
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.280]   But of course, to find out more about our research,
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:15.960]   go to our website, ralian.com.
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:17.160]   And if you're interested in the strategy,
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.560]   go to funds.ralian.com.
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:21.200]   - Okay, that'd be great.
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:22.200]   I had to ask you one question
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:23.640]   because you brought it up,
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:25.080]   the cryptocurrency.
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:29.040]   China's central bank is rolling out a digital yuan,
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:30.520]   making it the first central bank
[00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:34.840]   to issue a central bank digital currency.
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:36.280]   What do you think about this?
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:38.360]   - Well, I think it's super smart, right?
[00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:41.320]   'Cause as we're looking at cryptocurrency,
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:43.520]   we've often found two things, right?
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:45.960]   One is the technology, the blockchain technology,
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:48.400]   which is just a superior technology
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.040]   in terms of settling payment,
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:53.360]   tracking the flow of funds, it's safer,
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:56.000]   and it's just more technological advance, right?
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.720]   The existing settlement process we have
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:01.560]   came from 60 years ago.
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:03.920]   So China is pursuing that.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:06.320]   It's pursuing the blockchain technology.
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:07.680]   The rest of the cryptocurrency
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:09.680]   is a combination of that blockchain technology,
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:11.080]   which is wonderful,
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:13.920]   with a currency that you're not sure
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:14.960]   if it's actually a currency
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.520]   'cause it's not backed by anyone,
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:17.680]   not backed by anything.
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:20.200]   It's not really legal tender.
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:22.120]   So I think this actually helps investors
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:24.360]   in terms of really understanding
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:27.760]   what the blockchain technology can do for central banks
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:29.760]   if they wanna digitize their currency
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:33.440]   and improve the existing financial infrastructure.
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:35.840]   And then it helps us then understand,
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:38.960]   okay, if you take out the digital aspect
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:42.000]   and just have this new fiat currency
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.080]   issued by a non-central bank collective,
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:48.240]   like, is there really value in that?
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:52.440]   So I think what China has done is genius
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:54.400]   in terms of adopting a technology.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:57.240]   Many central banks are likely to do the same thing.
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:58.440]   And as that happens,
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:02.120]   I think you'll find existing cryptocurrencies
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:05.200]   to sort of be left behind.
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:07.680]   - Well, I don't wanna upset too many of our listeners
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:10.000]   by getting into cryptocurrency.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.880]   Discussions on cryptocurrency were just recently banned
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.720]   on the bogleheads.org website.
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:16.880]   But it's been a fascinating discussion, Jason.
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:20.000]   I mean, you've done so well in your career
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.720]   and we just greatly appreciate you being our guest today
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:24.680]   on the "Bogleheads on Investing."
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:25.520]   - Thanks, Rick.
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:26.920]   I'm so glad to be here.
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:30.680]   - This concludes "Bogleheads on Investing."
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:32.680]   I'm your host, Rick Ferry.

[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:52.880]   Thanks for listening.
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:56.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:59.240]   (upbeat music fades)
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:01.820]   (upbeat music)
