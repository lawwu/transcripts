[00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.200]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.900]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.880]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.360]   Today, my guest is Dr. Alia Crum.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.680]   Dr. Crum is a tenured professor of psychology
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.420]   at Stanford University and the founder and director
[00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.600]   of the Stanford Mind and Body Lab.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.840]   Her work focuses on mindsets,
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.520]   how what we think and what we believe
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.360]   shapes the way that our physiology,
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.660]   our biology reacts to things like what we eat
[00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.960]   or stress or exercise.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.360]   Indeed, as you will soon learn
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.200]   from my discussion with Dr. Crum,
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.540]   what you believe about the nutritional content of your food
[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.280]   changes the way that food impacts your brain and body
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.720]   to a remarkable degree.
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.240]   And the same is true for mindsets about exercise
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.600]   and stress and even medication.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.120]   For instance, recent work from Dr. Crum's laboratory
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.160]   shows that what we believe about the side effect profiles
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.720]   of different drug treatments
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.360]   or different behavioral treatments
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.720]   has a profound impact on how quickly those treatments work
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.920]   and the effectiveness of those treatments.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.580]   I just want to mention one particular study
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.880]   that just came out from a graduate student
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.540]   in Dr. Crum's laboratory, Lauren Howe, H-O-W-E,
[00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.940]   showed that how kids react to a treatment
[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.100]   for peanut allergies can be profoundly shaped
[00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.180]   by whether or not those kids were educated
[00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.260]   about the side effects of the treatment,
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.560]   such that if they learned that the side effects
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.740]   were a by-product of a treatment that would help them,
[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.800]   and they learned a little bit
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.400]   about why those side effects arose
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.200]   and that the side effects might even help them
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.480]   in route to overcoming their peanut allergy,
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.320]   had an enormous impact
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.160]   on how quickly they move through the treatment
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.760]   and indeed how much they suffered
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.640]   or in this case did not suffer from those side effects.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.620]   And that is but one example that you will learn about today
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.160]   as we discuss what mindsets are,
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.520]   the number of different mindsets that exist,
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.280]   and how we can adopt mindsets
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.080]   that make us more adaptive, more effective,
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.640]   allow us to suffer less
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.280]   and to perform better in all aspects of life.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.640]   I personally find the work of Dr. Alia Crum
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.800]   to be among the most important work
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.120]   being done in the fields of biology and psychology
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.680]   and the interface of mind-body.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.060]   Everything that she's done up until now and published,
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.180]   and indeed the work that she continues to do,
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.520]   has shaped everything within my daily routines,
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.440]   within my work routines, within my athletic routines.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.940]   And we probably shouldn't be surprised
[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.160]   by the fact that Dr. Crum works on all these things.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.320]   She was not only an incredibly accomplished
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.960]   tenured research professor,
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.840]   she's also a clinical psychologist,
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.500]   and she was also a division one athlete
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.220]   and an elite gymnast at one period in her life.
[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.160]   So she really walks the walk
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.380]   in terms of understanding what mindsets are
[00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.640]   and applying them in different aspects of life.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.860]   I'm sure you're going to learn a ton from this conversation
[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.200]   as did I, and come away with many, many actionable items
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.560]   that you can apply in your own life.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.080]   In fact, as we march into today's conversation,
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.940]   you might want to just put in the back of your mind
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.600]   the question, what is my mindset about blank?
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.940]   So for instance, ask yourself,
[00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.480]   what is my mindset about stress?
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.820]   What is my mindset about food?
[00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.340]   What is my mindset about exercise?
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.080]   What is my mindset about relationships of different kinds?
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.980]   Because in doing that, you'll be in a great position
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.160]   to extract the best of the information
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.600]   that Dr. Crum presents, and indeed to adapt those mindsets
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.460]   in the way that is going to be most beneficial for you.
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.060]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.800]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.760]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.320]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.880]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.900]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.600]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.640]   Our first sponsor is Thesis.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.400]   Thesis makes custom nootropics that are ideal
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.860]   for the particular brain states that you want to be in.
[00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.160]   The term nootropic means smart drug,
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.740]   and it is not a term that I like
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.440]   because there is no such thing
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.820]   as a universally useful smart drug.
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.420]   The reason for that is that our brain can be creative.
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.740]   We can be focused.
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.620]   We can be good at task switching.
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.100]   And each of those different things, creativity, focus,
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.340]   and task switching, involves different neurochemicals
[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.920]   in different states of mind and body.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.200]   So the notion that there's one best nootropic
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.540]   is just not accurate.
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.740]   There's just no way that could possibly be.
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.100]   Thesis understands this.
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.680]   And for that reason, designed custom nootropics
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.340]   that are designed to bring your brain and body
[00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.720]   into the states that you want
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.100]   and that are specifically designed to your neurochemistry.
[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.980]   They use only the highest quality ingredients,
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.940]   many of which I've talked about before on the podcast,
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.420]   things like DHA, ginkgo biloba, phosphatidylsterine.
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.620]   Alpha GPC is one that I particularly like
[00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.020]   and is in several of the formulations
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.460]   that are customized for me.
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.220]   However, ginkgo biloba,
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.960]   which has a lot of research to support it
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.020]   and is well tolerated by many people,
[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.040]   doesn't work well for me.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.020]   It actually gives me headaches.
[00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.540]   So that one is not included
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.020]   in any of the custom formulations
[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.120]   that Thesis has made particularly for me.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.060]   Thesis has this tremendous asset,
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.460]   which is that they give you the ability
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.060]   to try several different blends over the course of a month
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.940]   and discover which nootropics work best
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.780]   for your unique brain chemistry and genetics.
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.180]   So the formulas that work for me
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.820]   may not be the best ones for you and vice versa,
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.060]   but in a short period of time,
[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.300]   you can dial in the exact nootropic formulas
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.260]   for the states of mind and body that you want to be in.
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260]   I've been using Thesis for close to six months now,
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.300]   and I can confidently say
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.980]   that their nootropics have been a total game changer.
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.640]   I love the motivation formula.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.060]   I also like the energy formula.
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.380]   I use those for different things, it turns out,
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.720]   but I love those, and I use their logic formula
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.540]   and their clarity formula that they've customized for me.
[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.260]   In addition to their personalization,
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.000]   Thesis takes it a step further.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.340]   They'll offer you a free consultation with a brain coach
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.620]   to help optimize your experience with the nootropics
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.220]   and dial in the best formulas for you.
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.220]   To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.340]   go online to takethesis.com/huberman,
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.880]   take their brief three-minute quiz,
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.960]   and Thesis will send you four different formulas
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.400]   to try in your first month.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.580]   That's takethesis.com/huberman

[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.140]   to get 10% off your first box.
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.900]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.060]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.340]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.420]   I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system,
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.260]   and I can tell you that our visual system
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.940]   has to contend with a huge number of different challenges,
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.620]   not the least of which is when we go
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.660]   from a very bright sunny spot outside into the shade,
[00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.180]   our visual system has to adapt
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.620]   in order for us to continue to see clearly.
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.980]   Many sunglasses out there just don't allow that adaptation
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.020]   to occur in a seamless way.
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.380]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses are designed
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.740]   with all of the biology of the visual system in mind
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.940]   so that you always see things with crystal clarity
[00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.940]   no matter what environment you're in.
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.860]   They also have a terrific aesthetic.
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.960]   They have many, many different styles to choose from,
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.140]   so their eyeglasses can be worn to dinner
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.620]   or out to lunch or to work.
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.060]   Their sunglasses can be worn essentially anywhere.
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.900]   They're very stylish,
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.140]   and they were designed for performance.
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.260]   They won't slip off your face if you get sweaty.
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.760]   Indeed, you can wear them while running or while cycling.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.740]   They're really terrific.
[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.000]   They're really versatile.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.260]   If you'd like to try Roca glasses, go to Roca,
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.220]   that's R-O-K-A.com, and enter the code Huberman

[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.460]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A.com,
[00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.580]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.540]   Today's episode is also brought to us by InsideTracker.
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.820]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.380]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.140]   to help you better meet your immediate
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.000]   and long-term health goals.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.700]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.840]   for the simple reason that many of the things
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.900]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.420]   can only be assessed from a quality blood test.
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.060]   And nowadays, with the advent of modern DNA tests,
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.860]   you can also get a window into how your genes
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.620]   are impacting your health in the short and long-term
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.360]   and the various things that you should do
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.020]   in order to adjust your health in the right direction.
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.020]   Now, one of the major issues with a lot of blood tests
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.240]   and DNA tests out there is you get numbers back,
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.620]   and you learn whether or not your lipids
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.920]   or your hormones, et cetera,
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.120]   are within the proper range or not.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.440]   But there aren't a lot of directives
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.280]   about what to do with that information.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.640]   InsideTracker makes all of that very easy.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.520]   They have a personalized dashboard
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.840]   that allows you to, of course,
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.060]   see the numbers that come back to you
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.780]   and to make various changes in nutrition,
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.740]   various changes in exercise,
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.460]   various changes in all sorts of lifestyle factors
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.420]   that can bring those numbers into range.
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.480]   And so if you have a particular value
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.080]   for a particular metabolic factor or hormone or so forth,
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.900]   you click on that, and it will actually bring up
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.320]   the full menu of things that you can do
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.840]   in order to adjust that factor
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.260]   into the ranges that you like,
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.140]   all based on quality, peer-reviewed research.
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.480]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.160]   And now my conversation with Dr. Alia Crum.
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.680]   Great to have you here.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.600]   - Great to be here.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.440]   - Yeah.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.240]   For the record, it's Alia Crum, but you go by Ali, correct?
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.180]   - That is correct.
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.520]   - Dr. Ali Crum.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.360]   - Or just Ali.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.600]   - Okay, great.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.520]   Well, I've been looking forward
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.840]   to talking to you for a long time.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.480]   Just to start off, you've talked a lot
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.600]   and worked a lot on the science of mindsets.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.600]   Could you define for us what is a mindset
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.040]   and what sort of purpose does it serve?
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:54.960]   - Of course, yeah.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.960]   Mindsets have been described or defined in a lot of ways.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.760]   We define mindsets as core beliefs
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.600]   or assumptions that we have about a domain
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.100]   or category of things that orient us
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.420]   to a particular set of expectations,
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.000]   explanations, and goals.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.520]   So that's kind of jargon-y.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.640]   I can distill it down for you.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.080]   So mindsets are an assumption that you make about a domain.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.680]   So take stress, for example, the nature of stress.
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.160]   What's your sort of core belief about that?
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.760]   And mindsets that we've studied about stress are,
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.200]   do you view stress as enhancing, good for you,
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.580]   or do you view it as debilitating and bad for you?
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.040]   Those mindsets, those core beliefs orient our thinking.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.740]   They change what we expect will happen to us
[00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.360]   when we're stressed, how we explain the occurrences
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.640]   that happen or unfold when we're stressed,
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.200]   and also change our motivation
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.780]   for what we engage in when we're stressed.
[00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:57.560]   So we have mindsets about many things,
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.280]   mindsets about stress, mindsets about intelligence,
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.300]   as Carol Dweck's work has shown,
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:06.760]   mindsets about food, mindsets about medicine, you name it.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.060]   It's sort of distilling down those core assumptions
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.560]   that really shape and orient our thinking and action.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.120]   - I've heard you say before that mindsets simplify life
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.640]   in some way by constraining the number of things
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.960]   that we have to consider.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.020]   And it sounds to me like we can have mindsets
[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.880]   about many things, as you said.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.360]   What are some different mindsets?
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.660]   I think many people are familiar with our colleague,
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.260]   Carol Dweck's notion of growth mindset,
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.560]   that if we're not proficient at something
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.820]   that we should think about not being proficient yet,
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.320]   that we are on some path to proficiency.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.800]   But what are some examples of mindsets
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.880]   and how early do these get laid down
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.800]   or do we learn them from our parents?
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.360]   Maybe if you could just flesh it out a bit for us
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.920]   in terms of what you've observed in your own science
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.240]   or your own life even.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.920]   - Yeah, sure, so I think it's important with Carol Dweck's
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.520]   work, a lot of people kind of get focused
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.160]   on growth motivation and all these things.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.400]   But her work really originated from thinking about
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.560]   what she called as implicit theories or core beliefs
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.440]   about the nature of intelligence or ability, right?
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.960]   So do you believe that your baseline levels of intelligence
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.100]   or your abilities are fixed, static,
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.280]   set throughout the rest of your life?
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.680]   Or do you believe that they can grow and change?
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:29.640]   Now, those are oversimplified generalizations
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.640]   about the nature of intelligence.
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.680]   And the reality is as it always is complex
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.920]   and it's a bit of both and it's all these things.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.660]   But as humans, we need these simplifying systems
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.120]   to help us understand a complex reality.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.680]   So those assumptions that we jump to,
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.040]   oh, intelligence is fixed or intelligence is malleable,
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.640]   they help us to simplify this complex reality,
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.280]   but they're not inconsequential, right?
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.660]   They matter in shaping our motivation.
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.180]   And as she has shown, if you have the mindset
[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.900]   that intelligence is malleable,
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.360]   you're motivated to work harder, to grow your intelligence.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.920]   If you have a setback and you're learning, you think,
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.840]   okay, there's something there that I can grow
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.360]   and learn and build from.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.260]   If you have the mindset that it's fixed,
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.540]   why work harder at math if you don't think you're good at it?
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.500]   So in retrospect, it's pretty clear
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.900]   how these mindsets can affect our motivation.
[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:30.180]   What our work has aimed to do is to expand
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:35.180]   the range of mindsets that we are studying, focused on,
[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:38.620]   and also understand and expand the range
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.380]   of effects that they have.
[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.900]   So by and large, we focused on mindsets
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.060]   in the domain of health and health behaviors.
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.380]   So I mentioned mindsets about stress.
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:52.200]   We've also looked at mindsets about food and healthy eating.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.620]   So do you have the mindset that foods that are good for you,
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:59.700]   healthy foods are disgusting and depriving,
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.940]   or do you have the mindset that healthy foods
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.700]   are indulgent and delicious?
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.280]   Now, you know, it could be a variety of different foods.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.200]   You might have different thoughts
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.780]   about different healthy foods, but generally people,
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.580]   at least in our culture and in the West,
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.660]   have this view that stress is debilitating,
[00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.140]   healthy foods are disgusting and depriving,
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.480]   and those mindsets, whether or not they're true or false,
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.420]   right or wrong, they have an impact,
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.040]   and they have an impact not just
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.780]   through the motivational mechanisms
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.440]   that Dweck and others have studied,
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.600]   but as our lab has started to reveal,
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.380]   they also shape physiological mechanisms
[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:41.320]   by changing what our bodies prioritize and prepare to do.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.660]   So those are just two examples, mindsets about stress,
[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:44.920]   mindsets about food.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.660]   We've looked at mindsets about exercise.
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.420]   Do you feel like you're getting enough,
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.940]   or do you feel like you're getting an insufficient amount
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:56.560]   to get the health benefits you're seeking?
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.940]   Mindsets about illness.
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:03.940]   Do you view cancer as an unmitigated catastrophe,
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.440]   or do you view cancer as manageable,
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.520]   or perhaps even an opportunity?
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.500]   We've looked at mindsets about symptoms and side effects.
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.620]   Do you view side effects as a sign
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.120]   that the treatment is harmful,
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.220]   or do you view side effects
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.540]   as a sign that the treatment is working?
[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.580]   Again, these are sort of core beliefs
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:27.140]   or assumptions you have about these domains or categories,
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.300]   but they matter because they're shaping,
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.540]   they're synthesizing and simplifying the way we're thinking,
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.980]   but they're also shaping what we're paying attention to,
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.340]   what we're motivated to do,
[00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:39.080]   and potentially even how our bodies respond.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.740]   - I'd love to talk about this notion
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.500]   of mindset shaping, how our bodies respond.
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.540]   And maybe as an example of this,
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:50.820]   if you could share with us this now famous study
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:54.580]   that you've done with a milkshake study.
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:58.300]   If you wouldn't mind sharing the major contours
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.500]   of that study and the results,
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.580]   'cause I think they're extremely impressive
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.100]   and they really speak to this interplay
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.060]   between mindset and physiology.
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:05.900]   - Certainly, yeah.
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.540]   This was a study that I ran as a graduate student
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.140]   at Yale University.
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.300]   I was working with Kelly Brownell and Peter Salovey.
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.780]   Peter Salovey had done a lot of work
[00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.420]   on really coining the term emotional intelligence,
[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.260]   studying that. - He's now the president
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.420]   of Yale, right? - He's now the president
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.060]   of Yale, yes. - So he's done well.
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.220]   - He's done well for himself
[00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.700]   and for the university and society.
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.100]   And Kelly Brownell, who was doing a lot of research
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.220]   on food and obesity.
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.660]   And I had come in doing some previous work
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.300]   on mindsets about exercise and placebo effects and exercise
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.340]   and was in this sort of food domain
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.420]   and this emotions and food domain.
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.620]   And it really occurred to me
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.540]   that there was a very simple question
[00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.100]   that hadn't been probed yet.
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:50.540]   And that was, do our beliefs about what we're eating
[00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:54.700]   change our body's physiological response to that food,
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:59.140]   holding constant the objective nutrients of that thing?
[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.380]   So that question might sound outrageous at first,
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.860]   but it's really not outrageous
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.100]   if you're coming from a place of having studied
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.700]   in depth placebo effects.
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.740]   Placebo effects are this row, in medicine at least,
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.820]   are this sort of robust demonstration
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:20.260]   in which simply taking a sugar pill, taking nothing,
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.820]   under the impression that it's a real medication
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:26.660]   that might relieve your asthma, reduce your blood pressure,
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.340]   boost your immune system,
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.460]   can lead to those physiological effects
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.660]   even though there's no objective nutrients.
[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.220]   And we have more evidence on placebo effects
[00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.980]   than we have for any other drug
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:40.860]   because of the clinical trial process
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:45.740]   in which all new drugs and medications are required
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.860]   to outperform a placebo effect.
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.300]   So we have a lot of data on the placebo effect.
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.820]   Now, we can get nuance there.
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.620]   We don't have a lot of data comparing the placebo effect
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.620]   to doing nothing,
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.660]   which is important for distilling mindset effects
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:05.100]   or belief effects from sort of natural occurring changes
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.140]   in the body.
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.660]   But anyways, going back to this question,
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:11.020]   it was like, all right, we've moved from medications
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.940]   solving our health crises
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:16.980]   to behavioral medicine solving our health crises,
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:20.460]   increase people's exercise, get them to eat better.
[00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.660]   To what degree are these things influenced
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.180]   by our mindsets or beliefs about them?
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:26.860]   So to test this question,
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:30.340]   we ran a seemingly simple study.
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:31.860]   This was done at the Yale Center
[00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:35.060]   for Clinical and Translational Research.
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:38.340]   And we brought people into our lab
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.660]   under the impression that we were designing
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.140]   different milkshakes
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.460]   with vastly different metabolic concentrations,
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.540]   nutrient concentrations
[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.780]   that were designed to meet different metabolic needs
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:51.460]   of the patrons of the hospital, right?
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.580]   So you're gonna come in,
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.220]   you're gonna taste these milkshakes,
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.220]   and we're gonna measure
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.100]   your body's physiological response to them.
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.220]   This was a within-subjects design.
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.620]   So it was the same people
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.340]   consuming two different milkshakes,
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.940]   two different time points separated by a week.
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.100]   And at one time point,
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.740]   they were told that they were consuming
[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:15.020]   this really high-fat, high-caloric, indulgent milkshake.
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:19.820]   It was like a 620-calorie, super high-fat and sugar.
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:20.740]   The other time point,
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:22.620]   they were told that it was a low-fat,
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.980]   low-calorie, sensible sort of diet shake.
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.060]   In reality, it was the exact same shake.
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.100]   It was right in the middle.
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.860]   It was like 300 calories,
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.980]   moderate amount of fats and sugars.
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:36.300]   And we were measuring their body's gut peptide response
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.140]   to this shake.
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:37.980]   And in particular,
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.100]   we were looking at the hormone ghrelin.
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.020]   So as you know,
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.340]   ghrelin hunger,
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.740]   medical experts call it the hunger hormone,
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.260]   rises in ghrelin,
[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:50.260]   signal, you know, seek out food.
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.980]   And then theoretically,
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.580]   in proportion to the amount of calories you consume,
[00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.700]   ghrelin levels drop,
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.220]   signaling to the brain,
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.900]   okay, you don't need to eat so much anymore.
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:00.780]   You can stop eating.
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.700]   And also revving up the metabolism
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.780]   to burn the nutrients that were just ingested.
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.740]   What we found in this study was that
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.460]   when people thought they were consuming
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:14.180]   the high-fat, high-calorie, indulgent milkshake,
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.020]   in response to the shake,
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.620]   their ghrelin levels dropped
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.860]   at a threefold rate stronger than when they thought
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.660]   they were consuming the sensible shake.
[00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.460]   So essentially, their bodies responded
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.380]   as if they had consumed more food,
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.620]   even though it was the exact same shake
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.500]   at both time points.
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.060]   So this was really, you know,
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.220]   interesting and important for two reasons, really.
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.700]   One was that it was, to my knowledge,
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.620]   one of the first studies to show any effects
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:47.380]   of just believing that you're eating something different
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:48.780]   on your physiology.
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:51.140]   Lots of studies have shown that
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.980]   believing you're eating different things
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:54.540]   changes your taste, you know,
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.140]   and even your satisfaction and fullness after.
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:59.020]   But this shows that it has a metabolic
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.420]   or a physiological component.
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:04.660]   But the second piece was really important as well,
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.420]   and especially for me,
[00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.820]   this was one study that really transformed
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.260]   the way I think about how I approach eating,
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:16.260]   and that was the manner in which it affected our physiology
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.620]   was somewhat counterintuitive.
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.180]   So I had gone in thinking,
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.220]   the better mindset to be in when you eat
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:24.940]   is that you're eating healthy, right?
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.220]   Like, you know, it just makes sense.
[00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.780]   Like, placebo effects, think you're healthy,
[00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:28.620]   you'll be healthy, you know?
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:32.300]   But that was a far too simplistic way of thinking about it,
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.660]   and in fact, it was the exact opposite,
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.260]   because thinking that they were eating
[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.980]   when these participants thought they were eating sensibly,
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.100]   their bodies left them
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.140]   still feeling physiologically hungry, right?
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:49.820]   Not satiated, which could potentially be corresponding
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.740]   to slower metabolism and so forth.
[00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.180]   So if you're in the interest of maintaining
[00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.260]   or losing weight, what's the best mindset to be in?
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.060]   It's to be in a mindset that you're eating indulgently,
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.500]   that you're having enough food, that you're getting enough.
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.140]   And at least in that study,
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.660]   we showed that has a more adaptive effect
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.620]   on ghrelin responses.
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.460]   - So interesting, and especially interesting to me
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:17.020]   as a neuroscientist who has worked on
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:18.540]   aspects of the nervous system
[00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.060]   that are involved in conscious perception,
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:23.900]   like vision and motion and color perception and so forth,
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.620]   but also our lab has worked
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.420]   and is increasingly working on autonomic functions
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.180]   that are below our conscious detection.
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:36.020]   In this case, a lie about how much something,
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:39.860]   these milkshakes contain, affected a subconscious process,
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.540]   because I have to imagine that the ghrelin pathway
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:43.820]   is not one that I can decide,
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:46.180]   oh, you know, this particular piece of chocolate
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.940]   is going to really reduce my ghrelin
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.580]   'cause it's very nutrient rich,
[00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.500]   as opposed to one if you told me
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:52.940]   that a different piece of chocolate, for instance,
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.140]   is low calorie or sugar-free chocolate
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:57.140]   or something of that sort.
[00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:01.740]   The ghrelin pathway, however, it seems, based on your data,
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:06.340]   that the ghrelin pathway is susceptible to thoughts,
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.700]   which is incredible.
[00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.860]   But then again, there must be crossover
[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:13.060]   between conscious thought and these subconscious
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.820]   or kind of autonomic pathways.
[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:16.520]   So it's really remarkable.
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:21.140]   It raises a question that I just have to ask
[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:26.100]   because increasingly, so I'm involved in online discussions
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.100]   and social media.
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:30.360]   And one of the most barbed wire topics out there,
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.980]   and that's being generous,
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:35.020]   is this topic of which diet or nutrients are best.
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.740]   You've got people who are strictly plant-based.
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.420]   You've got people who are omnivores.
[00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.940]   You've got people who are carnivores.
[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:43.460]   You have every variation.
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:44.740]   You have intermittent fasting,
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.300]   also called time restricted feeding.
[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.540]   And it seems like once a group kind of plugs into
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.500]   a particular mode of eating that they feel works for them,
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.800]   for whatever reason, energy-wise, mentally,
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.340]   maybe they're looking at their blood profiles,
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.700]   maybe they're not.
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:02.940]   But once they feel that it sort of, it works for them,
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.940]   each camp seems to tout all the health benefits
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.340]   and how great they feel.
[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:11.260]   Could it be that mindset effects are involved there?
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.940]   That people are finding the nutritional program
[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:17.660]   that they feel brings them the most enrichment of life,
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:21.480]   but also nutrients and that their health really is shifting
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.400]   in a positive direction,
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.740]   but not necessarily because of the food constituents,
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.020]   but because of the community and the ideas
[00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:28.020]   and the reinforcement.
[00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.420]   - Yeah, and the belief that this is the right way
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:31.900]   of doing something.
[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:36.900]   I think 100%, 100% it has something to contribute.
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.380]   You know, I don't want to,
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.220]   I'm not going to weigh in on the debate.
[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:45.220]   What I will most certainly weigh in on is the notion that,
[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:48.660]   look, going back to the placebo effect, right,
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:51.820]   we have a outdated understanding of what that is,
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:54.420]   which is based on this randomized control trial.
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:57.300]   You compare a drug to a placebo.
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.380]   If the drug works better than the placebo,
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:01.340]   you say great, the drug works.
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.380]   If the drug doesn't outperform the placebo,
[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.340]   you say the drug doesn't work.
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.100]   That's really oversimplified.
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.840]   It's a good test for the specific efficacy of the drug.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.400]   It's not a good test for understanding
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.020]   the total impact of that drug.
[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.300]   Because in the reality of things, you know,
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.300]   if a drug outperforms a placebo,
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.940]   then, you know, you start prescribing it,
[00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:27.180]   but the reality is that the total effect of that drug
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:31.740]   is a combined product of the specific chemical,
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.740]   you know, attributes of that drug
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.580]   and whatever's going on in the placebo effect,
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:39.140]   which is, you know, at least from our perspective,
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.220]   it's beliefs, it's social context,
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.220]   and it's your body's natural ability
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.040]   to respond to something.
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.940]   So, you know, that's in the placebo effect example.
[00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:53.180]   The same is true for everything we do or consume.
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:56.380]   So when it comes to what diet you're eating,
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.740]   both are true.
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.380]   It does matter what it is,
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:05.380]   and it matters what you think about that diet
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:08.540]   and what others around you in our culture
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:09.620]   think about that diet,
[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:13.420]   because those social contexts inform our mindsets.
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:17.580]   Our mindsets interact with our physiology
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:20.920]   in ways that produce outcomes that are really important.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.100]   So let's not get dualistic and say, you know,
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.440]   it's either all in the mind or not in the mind.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.260]   Let's also not be unnecessarily combative
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:31.280]   and say, oh, it should be all plant-based
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.820]   or, you know, keto or whatever.
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:36.780]   It's all of those things are a combined product
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.660]   of what you're actually doing
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:41.500]   and what you're thinking about if you believe in it,
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.840]   if you don't, if you're skeptical or, you know,
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:47.300]   in some cases you think you should be eating a certain way
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.620]   and then you don't live up to that,
[00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.260]   it might have an adverse effect
[00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:55.940]   because of the stress and the anxiety associated with that.
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:57.360]   - Very interesting.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.100]   Along the lines of belief effects,
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.820]   can we call these belief effects or mindsets?
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:06.220]   Is there a difference between these,
[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:09.560]   what I'm calling belief effects and placebo effects?
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.460]   I mean, are placebo effects distinctly different
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:14.260]   from mindset effects or are they more or less the same?
[00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:15.340]   - They're related.
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.780]   So I think placebo effects, you know,
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.460]   maybe should be reserved for the, you know,
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.060]   conditions in which you're actually taking a placebo,
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:27.260]   which is a inactive substance.
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.760]   When you get out of that sort of placebo versus drug,
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.020]   you know, realm and you start looking at, you know,
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:37.300]   placebo effects, I use quotes with my hands here,
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.700]   in behavioral health, the term kind of becomes confusing
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.100]   because you're not, you know, in the milkshake study,
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:45.860]   we didn't give people a placebo milkshake, right?
[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:48.340]   We just changed what they believed about it.
[00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:52.220]   So how I like to think about it is that placebo effects,
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.260]   as they're traditionally construed,
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:55.580]   are made up of three things.
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:59.540]   It's the social context, mindsets or beliefs,
[00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:04.060]   and the natural physiological processes in the brain and body
[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:06.540]   that can produce the outcomes.
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:10.840]   And so we could just call them belief effects
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.760]   because the beliefs are triggering
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.600]   the physiological processes and the beliefs are shaped
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.460]   by the social context.
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:19.300]   Does that make sense?
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.280]   - It makes sense.
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.220]   Yeah, there was a paper a year or two ago
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:26.700]   published in Science Magazine about brain regions
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:30.180]   involved in psychogenic fever that if people,
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.920]   or you can actually do this in animal models too,
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:33.760]   think that they are sick,
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.680]   you get a genuine one to three degree increase
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.680]   in body temperature.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.840]   One to three degrees Fahrenheit increase in body temperature.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.400]   It was pretty impressive.
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.240]   - Yeah.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.700]   - And I guess it plays into, you know,
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.000]   symptomology generally.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.720]   So I'm a believer in belief effects.
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:50.520]   - Well, it's also, and I would just say that, you know,
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:54.560]   the term that we use in our field is nocebo effect for that,
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:58.280]   which is sort of the placebo's ugly step-sister.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.400]   You know, it's when negative beliefs
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.220]   cause negative consequences.
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:05.300]   So you are told you will have, you know,
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:08.540]   it's very well demonstrated that when people are told
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:09.880]   about certain side effects,
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:14.360]   they're far more likely to experience those side effects.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.840]   When people think that they're sick or going to get sick,
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.780]   sometimes that can create, you know,
[00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:22.220]   the physiological symptoms.
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:25.580]   And, you know, there's, you know, various debates.
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:28.300]   It's not only that physiology changes,
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:31.120]   it's also that your attention changes.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:35.200]   So we're experiencing things like fatigue and headache
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.980]   and upset stomach all the time.
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.380]   And then when you take a drug and somebody says,
[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.660]   you're going to feel fatigue and headache,
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:45.280]   you start noticing that you're tired and have headaches
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.520]   and attribute it to the drug.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.580]   So some of the mechanisms are attention
[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:53.200]   and some of them are real changes in physiology.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:59.020]   - Love for you to tell us about the hotel worker study.
[00:28:59.020 --> 00:28:59.860]   - Yeah, sure.
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:01.440]   - I know you get asked these questions all the time,
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.860]   but I find these, just these results also amazing.
[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:08.340]   - Yeah, no, I think that this is a really good example
[00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:11.780]   of this phenomenon, right?
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.540]   That the total effect of anything is a combined product
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.960]   of what you're doing and what you think about
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.180]   what you're doing.
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:21.780]   So this was a study that I ran with Ellen Langer way back
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:24.760]   when I was an undergrad, actually, we started this study.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:27.540]   Ellen Langer is a professor of psychology at Harvard
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:30.260]   and she's done a lot of really fascinating work
[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:32.980]   on her flavor of mindfulness,
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:37.420]   which is distinct from a more Eastern mind,
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.300]   Buddhist sort of mindfulness based work.
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:46.300]   And she actually was the one who said to me originally,
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.820]   I was an athlete at the time, I was a ice hockey player
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:52.860]   and I was training constantly.
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:55.140]   And one day I'll never forget it, she said,
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:59.260]   you know, the benefit of exercise is just a placebo, right?
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.660]   And I was like, well, that's outrageous.
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:04.420]   Ellen's known for saying very provocative,
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.580]   but also very wise things.
[00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.380]   And that statement really got me thinking about that.
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:12.980]   So we designed this study together and that was to look at,
[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:15.900]   you know, how would you study if exercise,
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:17.720]   the benefits of exercise were a placebo,
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.180]   how would you even test that?
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:20.920]   Because, you know, what does it mean
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.620]   to give a placebo exercise?
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:23.980]   So we sort of flipped it on its head
[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.860]   and we found a group of people
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.520]   who were getting a lot of exercise,
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.140]   but weren't aware of it, that they were, right?
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:34.780]   So this, we settled on a group of hotel housekeepers.
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:38.060]   So these were women working in hotels
[00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:40.580]   who were on their feet all day long,
[00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:44.740]   pushing carts, changing linens, climbing stairs,
[00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:47.900]   you know, cleaning bathrooms, vacuuming.
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.060]   It was clear that they were getting above and beyond
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.140]   at least the surgeon general's requirements at that time,
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.580]   which were to accumulate 30 minutes
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.780]   of moderate physical activity per day.
[00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:00.700]   But what was interesting was when we went in
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.540]   and surveyed them and asked them,
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:05.340]   hey, how much exercise do you think you're getting?
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:09.900]   A third of them said zero, like I don't get any exercise.
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.340]   And the average response was like a three
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.220]   on a scale of zero to 10.
[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:18.440]   So it's clear that even though these women were active,
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.200]   they didn't have that mindset, right?
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.760]   They had the mindset that their work was just work,
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.980]   hard, maybe thankless work that led them to feel tired
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:30.360]   and, you know, in pain at the end of the day,
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.960]   but not that it was good for them,
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.660]   that it was good exercise.
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:35.300]   So what we did was we took these women
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.540]   and we randomized them into two groups
[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:42.540]   and we told half of them that their work was good exercise.
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:45.580]   In this case, it was true factual information.
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:48.340]   We oriented them to the surgeon general's guidelines.
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.460]   We oriented them to the benefits that they should
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:54.100]   be receiving and then we had measured them previously
[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:58.600]   on their physiological metrics like weight and body fat
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.740]   and blood pressure and we came back four weeks later
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:02.980]   and we tested them again.
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:05.120]   And what we found was that these women,
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.660]   even though they hadn't changed anything in their behavior,
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:10.360]   at least that was detectable to us,
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:14.000]   they didn't work more rooms, they didn't start, you know,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.020]   doing pull-ups or push-ups in between cleaning hotel rooms
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.300]   as far as I'm concerned.
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.640]   They didn't report any changes in their diet,
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.740]   but they had benefits to their health.
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:27.140]   So they lost weight, they decreased their systolic
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:30.100]   blood pressure by about 10 points on average
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:33.960]   and they started feeling better about themselves,
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:37.420]   their bodies and their work, not surprisingly.
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:38.620]   - That's amazing.
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:42.980]   How should we conceptualize that result in light
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:47.880]   of all of our efforts to get more out of exercise, right?
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.020]   'Cause earlier you mentioned it from the milkshake study
[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:54.120]   and our perceptions about nutrient density that, you know,
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.420]   it's a little bit, the right message that actually
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:58.640]   a little bit counterintuitive that if you think,
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.640]   oh, this is very low calorie, nutrient sparse,
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.940]   then it's good for me in the context of losing weight,
[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:07.600]   for instance, but it turns out the opposite is true
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:11.620]   because as you told us, the body responds differently
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:13.340]   when you think something is nutrient dense
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:15.080]   and can actually suppress hunger more.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:18.360]   So in light of this result, if I were to say,
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:22.920]   okay, my current understanding of the literature
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:26.120]   is that getting somewhere between 150 and 180 minutes
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.780]   per week of cardiovascular exercise
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:30.060]   is probably a good idea for most people.
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:32.700]   If I tell myself that it's not just a good idea,
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.100]   but that it's extremely effective
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:37.220]   in lowering my blood pressure and maintaining healthy weight,
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.900]   et cetera, et cetera, according to these results,
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.460]   it will have an enhanced effect on those metrics.
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:43.300]   Is that right?
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.960]   - Definitely, so this is a really important point
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:50.020]   because what this reveals is that we have to be
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:55.020]   more thoughtful in how we go about motivating people
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:58.420]   to exercise or teaching people about the benefits.
[00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:02.740]   Our current approach is just to basically tell people
[00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:05.320]   writ large, you know, here's what you need to get.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:06.900]   Here's what you need to get good for, you know,
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:10.260]   to get enough benefits to receive the, enough exercise
[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:12.000]   to receive the health benefits.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.180]   The problem with that approach is that most people
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:18.700]   aren't meeting those benefits yet
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:21.240]   or aren't meeting those requirements yet.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:26.240]   And the risk with that is that, well,
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:29.120]   the intention with that is to motivate them
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.000]   'cause, you know, public health officials think,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.260]   well, if I just tell people you need to get more exercise
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:35.100]   'cause it's good for you, they'll do it.
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.780]   We know now that that doesn't work,
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.560]   that these guidelines are not motivational.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.820]   They don't change our behavior.
[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:43.980]   And what our work adds to that is that not only
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:47.340]   is it not motivational, it also creates potentially
[00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:52.340]   a mindset that, you know, makes people worse off
[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:55.700]   than they were without knowing about the guidelines.
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:57.420]   So again, it's tricky.
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:00.580]   I'm not saying that mindset is everything.
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:04.900]   Certainly exercise is good for us and use is helpful for us.
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:07.780]   It's one of the things we have the best data on.
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:11.020]   So I'm not saying, oh, exercise is all a placebo.
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:13.880]   What I am saying is that we need to be more mindful
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:17.100]   about how do we motivate people to exercise,
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:19.700]   but how do we help people to actually reap the benefits
[00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:22.860]   of the exercise they are already doing?
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:26.520]   Now, Octavia Zart, who is a grad student in my lab,
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:30.780]   ran a number of interesting studies along these lines.
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:34.620]   One in which she looked at three nationally representative
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:38.660]   data sets, which had this interesting question in them,
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:43.580]   which was how much exercise do you get relative to others?
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:47.740]   Do you get about the same, a little more, a lot more?
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:49.860]   Do you get a little less or a lot less, right?
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:52.040]   So, you know, the audience, your listeners,
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.780]   you could all answer this.
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:57.300]   And then in these data sets, what she did was she had,
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.000]   you know, pulled from data that tracked death rates
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.100]   over the next 21 years.
[00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:05.460]   And a couple of interesting things revealed themselves.
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:09.140]   One was that the correlations between these perceptions
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:13.120]   of exercise relative to others and people's actual exercise
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:16.580]   is measured through accelerometer data,
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.740]   as well as more rigorous sort of,
[00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.420]   what did you do today kind of data.
[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.060]   Those don't correlate much at all.
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:25.060]   - People lie.
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:26.060]   - Well, people lie, but also-
[00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:27.060]   - Or misperceive.
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:29.360]   - They misperceive and, or, you know,
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.020]   who's to say it's misperceiving.
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:32.980]   There's just, everything's relative, right?
[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:37.100]   If you're, I used to do triathlons very seriously.
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.320]   So if you were to ask me now,
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.900]   I feel like I'm totally inactive, right?
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:42.860]   'Cause I'm not doing anything near what I used to.
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:46.020]   And if that's my focus set, right,
[00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:49.000]   I feel like I'm not exercising much.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.100]   But if I think about, you know, compared to other people,
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.540]   given what I know about, you know,
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:56.700]   national representative statistics,
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.700]   then I could feel like, oh, I'm getting a lot, right?
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:02.300]   So you can see how these perceptions
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:07.300]   are decoupled from objective reality.
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:10.020]   And what we found in these studies
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:14.220]   is that that one question mattered,
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:18.040]   in some cases more than objective activity,
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:21.020]   but in all cases controlling for objective activity
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:22.260]   and predicting death rates.
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:24.340]   And in some, in one of those samples,
[00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:28.820]   it was a 71% higher risk of death rate, you know,
[00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:30.620]   if people rated themselves as feeling
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:33.460]   like they were getting less activity than others.
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:34.300]   - Wow.
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.380]   - So yeah. - That's a big deal.
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:37.220]   - It's a big deal.
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:39.700]   And again, you know, that study is cross-sectional,
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:41.940]   longitudinal, it was not experimental,
[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:47.580]   but, you know, combined these really sort of, you know,
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:51.780]   coalesced to say, hey, this is important too, right?
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:54.380]   Like let's figure out ways to be active
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:55.500]   and get people active,
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.660]   but let's also not make people feel horrible
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:00.620]   about themselves when they're not getting enough.
[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:03.180]   And going back to the hotel study, again,
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:05.420]   I mentioned that I did that at a time when I was a,
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:08.100]   I was a division one ice hockey player at the time.
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.860]   We were training all the time
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:13.340]   and I was in an unhealthy mindset about that.
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.160]   I never felt like I was getting enough.
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:19.140]   I would, you know, come off a two-hour practice
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:20.780]   into a weightlifting session
[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:23.840]   and then I would get on the elliptical for 30 minutes
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.020]   'cause I thought I had to do that also.
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:29.060]   My teammates who were with me at the time
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:30.380]   could attest to that.
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:33.140]   And so that study was really helpful for me
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.820]   to realize that I needed to pay attention
[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:37.180]   not just to what I was doing,
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:40.300]   but also take care of my mindset about that.
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:43.540]   And I think the essence is how do you get people
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:45.140]   to feel like they're getting enough?
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:48.060]   It's a sense of enoughness that really matters.
[00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:49.100]   - Yeah, I can see the dilemma
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:54.100]   because you don't want people thinking that exercise
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.900]   and its positive effects are so potent
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:00.560]   that they can get away with a three-minute walk each day
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:04.260]   and that they're good because most likely they are not.
[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:10.500]   But again, you don't want them to be so back on their heels
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.880]   psychologically that they don't even do that
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:16.480]   or that they never exceed that by very much.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:20.180]   But it seems like the message from the milkshake study
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.180]   and what we're talking about now in terms of exercise
[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:25.180]   would be to really communicate to the general public
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:28.120]   that food has a potency,
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:31.940]   even healthy foods have a potency to give us energy,
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:36.200]   to fuel our immune system and endocrine system, et cetera.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.660]   And that exercise has a remarkable potency
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:41.000]   and that that potency can be enhanced
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   by believing in or understanding that potency.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.660]   Is that an accurate way to state it?
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.140]   - Totally, that's exactly right.
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:52.940]   And that's where I really feel like we need to push.
[00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:54.760]   And what I try to do in our research
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.740]   is to not just show, oh, mindset matters,
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:57.580]   isn't that interesting?
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:01.880]   But it's both matter, right?
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.100]   Both exercise and what you think about it matter.
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:05.020]   Both what you eat
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:07.540]   and how you think about what you eat matter.
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:10.780]   And so we really as individuals and as a society
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:15.440]   need to work on what is the right way to cultivate
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:18.700]   both behaviors and mindsets about those behaviors
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:19.700]   that serve us.
[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:22.820]   And in the food context, this again,
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:26.000]   that milkshake study really changed me on a personal level
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.580]   because I had been somebody
[00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:32.180]   who was constantly trying to restrain my eating, right?
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:37.180]   I wanted to maintain or lose weight, look fit.
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:39.380]   And so I was like, well, I should diet,
[00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:42.280]   I should have low calorie, low carb, low this, low that.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:44.200]   But what that was doing was putting me
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:47.640]   into this constant mindset of restraint.
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:51.500]   And what that study suggested was that that mindset
[00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:56.500]   was potentially counteracting any benefit, right?
[00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:01.520]   Or any objective effects of the restrained diet.
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.940]   'Cause my brain was saying, okay, you're restraining,
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.860]   maybe my body was responding to that.
[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:11.340]   But the brain was also saying, eat more food, stay hungry,
[00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.340]   'cause you need to survive.
[00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:17.240]   And so the answer isn't, oh, we'll throw everything
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.860]   into the wind and just drink indulgent milkshakes
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:20.700]   all day long.
[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:25.700]   The answer is eat healthy foods, right?
[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:28.560]   Based on the latest science and what we know to be true
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.340]   about nutrients and our body's response to them.
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:34.620]   But try to do so in a mindset of indulgence,
[00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:38.300]   a mindset of satisfaction, a mindset of enjoyment, right?
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:40.040]   That is really the trick.
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:43.040]   And that's what I at least try to do in my own life.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:43.880]   - I love that.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.060]   And as I get more involved in the kind of public facing
[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:49.900]   health communications, this comes up again and again.
[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:51.900]   How should we conceptualize our behavior?
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:54.140]   How should we think about all these options
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:55.020]   that are offered to us?
[00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:58.780]   And I'm excited that the potency of mindsets
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:01.260]   are coming through again and again.
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:02.400]   So I have a question about this.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.580]   I don't know if this study has ever been done,
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:06.940]   but a lot of these mindset effects
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:11.900]   are something that years ago I felt I did vis-a-vis sleep
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:15.220]   because I was in graduate school and as a postdoc,
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:17.540]   and even as an undergraduate, I had so much work to do
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:20.920]   that I decided I would sleep when I was dead in quotes.
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:23.280]   Not a good idea from what we know.
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:28.220]   However, I found that a couple nights of minimal sleep
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:30.440]   or even an all-nighter and I could do pretty well.
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:32.300]   Eventually it would catch up with me.
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:34.240]   Has there ever been a study exploring whether or not
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:37.460]   the effects of sleep deprivation can be impacted
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:39.140]   by these mindset effects?
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:42.140]   Because over the years I keep learning more and more
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.300]   about how much sleep I need and I've really emphasized sleep
[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.400]   and I do feel much better when I'm getting it.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:50.780]   But as new parents know, or students know,
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:53.300]   or athletes know, or anyone that lives a normal life
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:56.740]   finds sometimes that they don't get a good night's sleep.
[00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:58.740]   Would believing that we can tolerate that
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:00.900]   and push through it and function just fine
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:03.660]   and then it's not going to kill us or give us Alzheimer's,
[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:07.340]   could that help us deal with a poor night's sleep
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:10.380]   or even two or chronic sleep deprivation?
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:12.280]   - Certainly I would guess.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.900]   There's been one study to my knowledge that's tested
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:19.780]   that Dragana and colleagues and they looked at,
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:22.900]   they had people come in and they gave them sort of a,
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:26.540]   I think it was a sham sort of EEG test
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:29.720]   to sort of figure out how,
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.140]   this was done a number of years ago,
[00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:33.720]   now we actually have devices to test this,
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:37.000]   but theirs was this sham test and then they gave people
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.720]   fake feedback about the quality of their sleep
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:43.540]   and how it had been the night before.
[00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:46.880]   And they also asked the participants
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:48.500]   how they felt about their sleep.
[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:53.500]   And essentially what they found was that the sham feedback,
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:57.820]   if they were told that they had gotten lower quality sleep
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:02.300]   led to deficits in a variety of cognitive tasks
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:04.940]   and that was sort of decoupled
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:07.640]   from their actual qualities of sleep,
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:09.280]   at least as self-reported.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.500]   So that's one study that attest to this.
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:16.340]   I think certainly, I mean, I would bet a lot of money,
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:17.780]   I haven't run this myself,
[00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:20.780]   but that your mindsets can push around
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:25.540]   your cognitive functioning, physiological effects of sleep.
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:28.540]   But once again, it's not all or nothing, right?
[00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:31.500]   There are real important benefits of sleep
[00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:35.360]   and how far we can push around that through our mindset
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:36.860]   is an open question.
[00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:39.820]   - The result that you mentioned is really interesting
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:42.100]   'cause a lot of people use these sleep trackers now,
[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:43.860]   they're using rings or wristbands.
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:46.180]   In fact, my lab has worked pretty closely with a company
[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:48.580]   they supply us data on how well people are sleeping
[00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:51.340]   and you get a score, people get the score back
[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:52.880]   and when they see that score,
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.540]   they might think based on these results,
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:57.620]   oh, my sleep, my recovery score, my sleep score was poor,
[00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:59.500]   I shouldn't expect much for myself today
[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:02.660]   or it makes sense that my memory would be going.
[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:03.500]   For this reason,
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.220]   and I'll probably lose a few friends for saying this,
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:06.620]   but hopefully I'll gain a few as well.
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:11.100]   That's why I like to just do a subjective score for myself.
[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:13.020]   If I wake up in the morning, I just decide,
[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:14.580]   okay, did I sleep well or not?
[00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:15.980]   I don't like seeing a number.
[00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:18.980]   I don't like getting a readout from a device.
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:20.660]   That's me, I know a lot of people like it
[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.380]   and they can be very useful, but gosh,
[00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:24.580]   it seems that these belief effects
[00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:26.440]   are weaving in at all levels.
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:30.100]   I'd love for us to talk about stress
[00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:33.580]   because your lab has worked extensively on this
[00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:38.440]   and if you would, could you tell us at some point
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.540]   about the study that you've done about informing people
[00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:42.660]   about the different effects of stress,
[00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:45.460]   but also if there's an opportunity,
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:49.320]   some takeaways about how we could each conceptualize stress
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:52.340]   in ways that would make it serve us better
[00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:53.580]   as opposed to harm us
[00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:55.660]   and our mental and physical performance.
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:58.380]   - Great, yeah, so I had come off the heels
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:03.380]   of doing some research in exercise and diet
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:06.260]   and finding these provocative
[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:09.580]   and also counterintuitive effects with respect
[00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:13.100]   to how we should try to motivate people, right?
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:16.540]   And as I was thinking about this
[00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:21.540]   and this grouping of going from medicines to saving us,
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:23.660]   to behaviors to saving us
[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:27.740]   and how those behaviors might be influenced by mindsets,
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:31.780]   the obvious next thing to think about was stress, right?
[00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:33.500]   'Cause it's like, okay, well, you wanna be healthier,
[00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:37.260]   fix your diet, fix your exercise and stress less.
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:40.140]   And so I started doing some digging
[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:43.780]   into the nature of stress and a couple of things were clear.
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:48.060]   One was that the public health message was very clear, right?
[00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:50.180]   That stress was bad, right?
[00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:55.180]   Unmitigated and harmful on our health,
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:58.560]   our productivity, our relationships, our fertility,
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.860]   our cognition, you name it, right?
[00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:04.600]   The messages that were out there,
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:07.380]   by and large oversimplified messages
[00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:11.260]   focused on the damaging consequences of stress.
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:13.900]   But as you know, if you actually dive deeper
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:16.860]   into the literature on stress and the origins of stress,
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:19.520]   what you find is that the literature,
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:21.760]   like most literatures is not so clear cut.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.740]   And in fact, there's a large amount of evidence
[00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:28.580]   to support the fact that the experience of stress,
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:31.240]   meaning encountering adversity or challenge
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:33.360]   in one's goal-related efforts
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:37.320]   does not have to be debilitating.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:40.460]   And in many cases, the body's response was designed
[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:44.560]   to enhance our ability to manage at those moments, right?
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:48.700]   So some research showing that stress narrows our focus,
[00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:51.200]   increases our attention, speeds up the rate
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.400]   at which we're able to process information.
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:56.600]   There was some research out there showing this phenomenon
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:48:00.800]   of physiological toughening, the process by which
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.680]   the release of catabolic hormones and the stress response
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.120]   recruit or activate anabolic hormones,
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:08.780]   which help, as you know, build our muscles,
[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:12.400]   build our neurons to help us grow and learn.
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.600]   And there was a whole body of emerging research
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:17.800]   on post-traumatic growth or this phenomenon
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:21.520]   in which even the experience of the most traumatic stressors
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:24.420]   and the most chronic and enduring stressors
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:26.480]   could lead not to destruction,
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.300]   but in fact, to the exact opposite,
[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:32.960]   to an enhanced sense of connection with our values,
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:37.960]   connection to others, sense of joy and passion for living.
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:42.780]   And so, you know, I found that to be interesting.
[00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:47.080]   And you know, my work since then has been not to try
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:49.840]   to argue that stress is enhancing and not debilitating,
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:54.040]   but try to point out that the true nature of stress
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:55.040]   is a paradox.
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:58.680]   The true nature of stress is manifold and complex
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:01.200]   and lots of things can happen.
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:05.240]   But to question what's the role of our mindset about stress
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:08.240]   in shaping our response to stress.
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:11.700]   So some work had already been done looking at
[00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:14.020]   your perception of the stressor, right?
[00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:17.780]   So do you view a stressor like a challenging exam
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:20.940]   or a health diagnosis as a challenge or a threat?
[00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:23.800]   And that had shown pretty convincingly
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.280]   that when you view stressors more as a challenge,
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:29.260]   less as a threat, that your brain and body
[00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:32.680]   responds more adaptively.
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:35.000]   What our question was was to take the sort of
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.560]   psychological construal one step higher in abstraction.
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:42.340]   So not just the stressor, but the nature of stress, right?
[00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:45.140]   Do you, you know, at that core level,
[00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:48.160]   do you view stress as something that's bad,
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:50.760]   is going to kill us and therefore should be avoided?
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:54.080]   Or do you view stress as natural
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:56.780]   and something that's going to enhance us?
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:50:00.040]   And so we set out to design a series of studies
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:02.920]   to test the extent to which these mindsets
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:04.460]   about stress mattered.
[00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:08.280]   We first, this again was with Peter Salovey
[00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:12.080]   and Sean Aker originally, we designed a measure
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.360]   to test people's mindsets about stress.
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:18.120]   Simple questions like, what extent do you believe
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:21.020]   or agree or disagree with statements like,
[00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:23.900]   stress enhances my performance and productivity,
[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:28.900]   stress heightens my vitality and growth, things like that.
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:32.000]   And we found in a number of correlational studies
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.560]   that that more enhancing stress mindset
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:38.760]   was linked to better health outcomes,
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:41.340]   better wellbeing and higher performance.
[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:43.240]   So then we set out to see if we could
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:45.240]   change people's mindsets.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.720]   And in our first test of this,
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:50.600]   we decided to do so by creating these multimedia films
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:55.600]   that showcased research, anecdotes, facts about stress,
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:51:01.680]   all true, but oriented towards one mindset or the other.
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:03.400]   So you can imagine one set of films
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:06.360]   showed basically the messages that were out there
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:07.980]   in the public health context.
[00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:11.320]   The other showed, hey, you know, stress, you know,
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:14.080]   stress has been linked to these things,
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:15.680]   but in fact, the body stress response
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:16.800]   was designed to do this.
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:17.840]   Did you know it could do that?
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:22.080]   And we had empowering images like LeBron James
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:23.960]   making the free throw in the final minute
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:25.440]   versus missing it, right?
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:28.720]   So all of these things are true, you know, possibilities,
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:32.720]   but oriented to two different mindsets about stress.
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.400]   - So either people saw a video that basically made it seem
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:38.680]   like stress will diminish you, crush you, reduce you,
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:42.920]   or a video, very similar, stress will grow you,
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.440]   bring out your best and maybe even take you
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.960]   to heightened levels of performance
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:48.600]   that you've never experienced before.
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:49.960]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:51.820]   So yeah, examples in the sports.
[00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:54.080]   We also had like true leaders emerge
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:57.000]   in the moments of greatest stress, you know, Churchill.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.440]   And so all those examples are out there
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:02.360]   for both the enhancing nature and the debilitating nature.
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:05.760]   And our question was, does orienting people
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:09.600]   to different mindsets change how they respond to stress?
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.320]   So this study was done in the wake
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:14.460]   of the 2008 financial crisis.
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:19.240]   We worked with UBS, a company, a financial service company
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:22.320]   that was undergoing pretty massive amounts of layoffs.
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:25.660]   So these employees were stressed about being laid off.
[00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:27.480]   They were taking on more pressure.
[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.200]   It was just a tough time.
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:32.760]   And we randomized them into three conditions.
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:36.240]   And this was all pre-work before getting a training
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.380]   on stress, but the three different conditions,
[00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:41.000]   some watched no videos,
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.520]   some watched the stress will crush you videos,
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:47.160]   and some watched the stress could enhance you videos.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.500]   And what we found was that just, you know,
[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:51.800]   it was a total of nine minutes of videos
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:54.140]   over the course of the week led to changes
[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:56.040]   in their mindsets about stress,
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:53:00.240]   which led to changes in their physiological symptoms
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.560]   associated with stress.
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:03.920]   So people who watched the enhancing films
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:06.480]   had fewer backaches, muscle tension,
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:09.920]   insomnia, racing heart, and so forth.
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:14.020]   And they also reported performing better at work
[00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:16.900]   compared to those who watched the debilitating videos.
[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:19.240]   Now, interestingly, we didn't make anyone worse
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:21.960]   with the debilitating videos, which was good.
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:25.600]   We had told that the IRB, we didn't expect that
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.960]   because that message was already out there.
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.280]   That's what they were already seeing.
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:31.080]   That wasn't new to them.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:34.000]   It was more this enhancing perspective
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.240]   that turned out to be inspiring.
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:38.080]   - I love that study.
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:41.600]   And I know we both have friends and ties
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:43.200]   in the special operations community
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:45.360]   through just sort of happenstance.
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:47.840]   And we can, maybe we'll get into that a little later,
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:50.760]   but a good friend from that community always says,
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.480]   "You know, there are only three ways to go through life
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.520]   at any moment, which is either back on your heels,
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:57.680]   flat-footed, or forward center of mass."
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.040]   And I said, "Well, what's the key
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.160]   to forward center of mass?"
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:01.900]   And he said, "Stress is what places you
[00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:03.400]   in forward center of mass."
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.480]   Meaning leaning forward and into challenge.
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:07.840]   And I know that you've actually looked at that community
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:10.040]   and it does really seem like that's a mindset
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:12.840]   that either they have going in or that they cultivate
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:15.200]   through the course of their training.
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:18.260]   But this notion that stress is what puts us
[00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:21.760]   in forward motion is true physiologically, right?
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:23.920]   I mean, adrenaline's major role is to place us
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:26.880]   into a moment of, or bias us towards action.
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:27.700]   That's why we tremble.
[00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:30.420]   That's the body trying to initiate action.
[00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:33.180]   But actually, this is probably a good opportunity.
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:34.780]   If there's anything interesting to extract
[00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:38.860]   from the study on seal teams, what was it?
[00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:41.860]   - Yeah, no, I loved working with the seals.
[00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:45.060]   One of the interesting things we found,
[00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:49.580]   so we've studied this, measured this mindset
[00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:51.180]   in several different populations.
[00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:55.340]   And in every single one that we had tested so far,
[00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:58.520]   the average had been on the debilitating side of the scale.
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:54:59.800]   - People just saying stress is bad.
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.080]   - Stress is bad, right?
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:05.240]   And you know, it's like with measures of growth
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:07.560]   and fixed mindsets about intelligence,
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:09.240]   people are in the middle,
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:11.480]   but oftentimes have a more positive mindsets
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:13.040]   about intelligence.
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:14.600]   That was not the case with stress.
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:15.900]   It's still not the case.
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:17.560]   I'm trying to get the message out there,
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:20.320]   except for this group of Navy Seals
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:22.440]   where they were actually recruits.
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:24.680]   So people who were going through basic training
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:26.920]   in order to become Navy Seals.
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:30.520]   And we found that they, on average,
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:33.160]   had stress as enhancing mindset,
[00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:34.640]   perhaps not surprisingly, right?
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:36.600]   If you're going in to devote your whole life
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:40.380]   to being a Navy Seal, you must have some inclination
[00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:44.360]   that stress is a source of strength for you.
[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:45.460]   But what we found with them,
[00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:48.500]   we measured this at the beginning of their basic training,
[00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:52.760]   of Bud's training, and then looked at how well they succeeded
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:53.720]   through that program.
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:57.480]   So as you know, this is an extremely rigorous program.
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:00.320]   You know, at the time it was only like 10 or 20%
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:02.440]   of trainees make it through. - It still is.
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:05.260]   The numbers have never shifted from about that.
[00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:08.840]   No matter how hard pressures on the community change,
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:11.720]   the numbers are still, on average, about 15%.
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:12.560]   - Yeah, wow.
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:17.080]   So what we found was that our measure predicted that rate.
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:19.260]   So people who even within that range
[00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:21.040]   had a more stress as enhancing mindset
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:23.440]   were more likely to complete training,
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:26.920]   become a Seal, they also had faster obstacle course times,
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:30.560]   and they were rated by their peers more positively.
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:34.360]   So, you know, again, let's break this down, right?
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:37.200]   This doesn't mean, and other people get me,
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:38.640]   people get this wrong sometimes.
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:40.040]   They think that I'm saying
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:42.520]   that a stress as enhancing mindset
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:44.680]   means you should like stress, right?
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:46.860]   Well, maybe Seals do. (laughs)
[00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:48.620]   But that's not what we're saying, right?
[00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:50.440]   Having a stress as enhancing mindset
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:53.680]   doesn't mean the stressor is a good thing, right?
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:55.060]   It doesn't mean it's a good thing
[00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:59.380]   that you have to go into combat and it's not pretty, right?
[00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:02.720]   It doesn't mean that getting a cancer diagnosis
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:05.560]   is a good thing or being in abject poverty is a good thing.
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:07.480]   These are not good things.
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:10.520]   But the experience of the stress associated with that,
[00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:12.520]   the challenge, the adversity,
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:17.520]   that experience can lead to enhancing outcomes
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:21.040]   with respect to not just our cognition,
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:24.040]   but our health, our performance, and our wellbeing.
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:27.560]   So that mindset, right, how does that work, right?
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:30.760]   Well, it works through a number of different pathways.
[00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:32.940]   One is that it changes fundamentally
[00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:34.780]   what we're motivated to do.
[00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:39.000]   So if you just imagine we're stressed about something,
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:43.080]   maybe a global pandemic, for example, for instance,
[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:48.140]   and you think that stress is bad,
[00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:50.160]   then what's your motivation, right?
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:51.800]   Your motivation is to,
[00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:54.200]   well, first you get worried about the stress, right?
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.680]   Now, not only do you have the pandemic,
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:58.040]   you're stressed about the stress of the pandemic.
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:57:59.480]   But second is your reaction
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:01.000]   is typically to do one of two things.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.480]   It's either to freak out and do everything you can
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:07.520]   to make sure that this doesn't affect you negatively,
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:10.280]   or to check out and say, oh, it's not a big deal,
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:11.480]   I'm not gonna deal with it.
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:12.800]   You're basically in denial.
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:15.740]   So people who have a stress-indebilitating mindset,
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:17.400]   and we've shown this in our research,
[00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:19.760]   tend to go to one or the other of those extremes.
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:22.000]   They freak out or they check out.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.240]   Why, because if stress is bad,
[00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:26.000]   you need to either get rid of it and deal with it,
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.240]   or it needs to not exist, right?
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:30.800]   If you have a stress-enhancing mindset,
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:32.400]   the motivation changes, right?
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:36.400]   Then the motivation is how do I utilize the stress
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.700]   to realize the enhancing outcomes?
[00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:40.660]   What can we do here, right,
[00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:45.140]   to learn from this experience to make us stronger,
[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:50.000]   fitter, have better science and treatments for the future,
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   deepen my relationships with others,
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.580]   improve my priorities and so forth, right?
[00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:57.820]   So the motivation changes.
[00:58:57.820 --> 00:58:59.580]   The affect around it changes.
[00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:01.580]   It doesn't make it easy to deal with.
[00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:03.060]   But what we've shown in our research
[00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:05.740]   is that people who have a stress-enhancing mindset
[00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:07.500]   have more positive affect,
[00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:10.280]   not necessarily less negative affect.
[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:13.240]   And it potentially changes physiology.
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:16.860]   We have a few studies that show that people
[00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:21.560]   who are inspired to adopt more enhancing mindsets
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:24.240]   have more moderate cortisol response,
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:28.060]   and they have higher levels of DHEA levels
[00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:29.280]   in response to stress.
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:32.080]   So more work needs to be done on the physiology,
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:35.600]   but I'd love your take on the mechanisms
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:37.120]   through which that's possible.
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:40.880]   - Yes, and DHEA, of course, has an anabolic hormone
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:42.400]   in both men and women.
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:46.360]   Very interesting because we had a guest on this podcast.
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:48.540]   He actually is a PhD scientist
[00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:51.800]   who runs the UFC Performance Training Institute.
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:53.320]   His name is Duncan French.
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:56.560]   And his graduate work at UConn Storrs was very interesting.
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:58.840]   It was in exercise science and physiology.
[00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:00.640]   What he showed was that
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:03.000]   if you could spike the adrenaline response,
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   I think they did this through first-time skydive
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.200]   or something like that,
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:09.240]   that testosterone went up.
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:11.220]   Now, this spits in the face of everything
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:15.820]   that we're told about stress and testosterone levels, right?
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:19.640]   And this has also been looked at in females with estrogen,
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.400]   although, of course, there's estrogen and testosterone
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.300]   in both males and females,
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:24.880]   but that's how they designed the study.
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:27.880]   So it turns out that at least in the short term,
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:32.800]   that a very stressful event can raise anabolic hormones.
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:35.980]   And I think that people forget at a mechanistic level
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:37.880]   that adrenaline is epinephrine,
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.960]   and epinephrine is derived,
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:42.680]   biochemically derived from the molecule dopamine.
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.660]   If you look at the pathway and even just Google it
[01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:46.420]   and go images, you'll see that
[01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:49.100]   adrenaline is made from dopamine.
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:52.080]   And dopamine and these anabolic hormones have a very close,
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.140]   they're sort of close cousins.
[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:55.480]   They work together in the pituitary and hypothalamus.
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:59.960]   So it makes sense that one could leverage stress
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:03.060]   toward growth and towards anabolism
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:04.720]   as opposed to cannibalism,
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:07.380]   which is not saying cannibalism as in eating other people,
[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:10.280]   but catabolic processes is, I guess,
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:11.760]   the right way to refer to it.
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.620]   But what's again, remarkable to me is that
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:15.700]   all of these brain structures that control dopamine,
[01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:18.260]   epinephrine, testosterone, and estrogen,
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:19.940]   they're all thought to be in the subconscious,
[01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:24.280]   meaning below our ability to flip a switch
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.840]   and turn them on or off.
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:28.280]   And yet mindset seemed to impact them.
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:33.280]   So all that to say that there's a clear mechanistic basis
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.800]   by which this could all work.
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.760]   And so on the one hand, I'm surprised
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.440]   because these are incredible results.
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:41.560]   On the other hand, I'm not surprised
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:43.400]   because there's a physiological substrate there
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:45.300]   that could readily explain them.
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:49.040]   - Yeah, and I think figuring out exactly how it works
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.960]   is really, you know.
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:51.800]   - We should do that.
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.040]   - We should do that, let's do it.
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:54.800]   - We've got common friends in both departments,
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.240]   so we should do it, why not?
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:00.700]   - But I did want to mention the way I think about mindset,
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:03.180]   and again, I think we need to study this.
[01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:05.240]   I'm not a neuroscientist, so I haven't looked at this,
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.140]   but this is something we could do.
[01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:08.880]   But the way I think about mindset
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:11.800]   is that mindsets are kind of a portal
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:16.360]   between conscious and subconscious processes.
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:20.940]   They operate as a default setting of the mind, right?
[01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:25.720]   So if sort of programmed in there,
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:29.500]   you have stress equals bad, right?
[01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:34.500]   That is gonna be something maybe conscious, right?
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:38.800]   But it doesn't have to be conscious, right?
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:40.880]   People don't have to know their mindsets about stress
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.460]   until they're asked, really.
[01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:46.240]   That's been programmed in through our upbringing,
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.180]   through public health messages,
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:50.480]   and through media and other things,
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:53.360]   and it kind of sits there as an assumption in the brain,
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.600]   and the brain is then figuring out
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:59.320]   how should it respond to this situation,
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.040]   and if the assumption, the default,
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:04.260]   the programming is stress is bad,
[01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:06.840]   that's gonna, through our subconscious,
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:08.260]   trigger all the things that's like,
[01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:13.260]   okay, well, I need to rev up the things that protect me
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:16.340]   versus rev up the things that help me grow.
[01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:19.280]   And so that's at least how I think about it,
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:22.020]   and what's cool about it is that
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:24.240]   because it operates as a sort of portal,
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:26.520]   it communicates with more
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:28.960]   subconscious physiological processes,
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:32.080]   but it can also be accessed through our consciousness, right?
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:36.560]   So just talking about this, right, for your listeners,
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:40.720]   they're now invited to bring their stress mindsets
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.440]   up to the consciousness and say,
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.520]   what is my stress mindset?
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.000]   Am I thinking about stress?
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.640]   Can I reprogram that?
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:51.040]   Can I start to think about it as more enhancing?
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:54.240]   That takes a little bit of a conscious work, potentially,
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.640]   but then once you do that,
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:59.080]   that can kind of operate in the background,
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:00.920]   influencing how your body responds,
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.560]   and you don't have to say, okay, I'm stressed.
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:05.880]   I better tell my, you know, anabolic hormones.
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:07.560]   That doesn't work that way.
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:08.440]   - No.
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:12.560]   - But these mindsets can help with the translational process.
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.680]   - I love the idea that mindsets are at the interface
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:16.760]   between the conscious and subconscious,
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:20.140]   and I think there's a lot to unpack there,
[01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:25.140]   but it clearly is the case that the mindsets,
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.100]   they sort of act as heuristics, right?
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:29.040]   And as we talked about earlier,
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:31.640]   they can limit what the number of things to focus on,
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:33.440]   because one thing that is really stressful
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:35.240]   is trying to focus on everything all the time.
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:37.000]   I mean, trying to navigate the public health
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.560]   around anything, the public health information
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:40.920]   around anything is kind of overwhelming.
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:42.000]   As you mentioned, for stress,
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.060]   you see a lot in the stresses will crush you,
[01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:45.940]   and then you can also find evidence
[01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:47.360]   that stress will grow you.
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:53.480]   How should we, the listeners, think about stress?
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:57.240]   I mean, what's the most adaptive way to think about stress?
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:59.280]   And should we talk about our stress?
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:01.220]   Should we not talk about our stress?
[01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:04.640]   Is there a short list of ways
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.000]   that we can cope with stress better?
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.140]   Or I should be careful with the word cope.
[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:12.440]   Is there a way that we can leverage stress to our advantage?
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:15.880]   - Great, yeah, and that's an important nuance
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:19.320]   in your language, which is people have, by and large,
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:21.720]   come from a place of how do you manage stress?
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:24.320]   How do you cope with it, which implies
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:26.280]   how do you fight against it?
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:29.320]   - Vacation, massages, yoga classes.
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:32.080]   - Fight against it or check out from it, right?
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:35.320]   And yeah, the real challenge is how do we leverage it?
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:36.640]   How do we utilize it?
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:38.680]   How do we work with it?
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.620]   And I have a lot of thoughts on this.
[01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:42.760]   The first and most important thing
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:47.320]   is to clarify our definition of stress.
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:50.240]   So I think people often associate,
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:52.120]   the stress mind, negative stress mindset
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:57.120]   is so insidious that now people define stress
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:00.560]   with its negative consequences.
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.660]   So the first step is to decouple that
[01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:06.860]   and to realize that stress is a neutral, right,
[01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:11.960]   yet to be determined effect of experiencing
[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:16.880]   or anticipating adversity in your goal-related efforts.
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.520]   So let me unpack that a little more.
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:20.520]   You can be in the midst of it
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:23.480]   or you could just be worried about something happening.
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:24.920]   That's one aspect.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:27.200]   Second is adversity or challenge,
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.920]   so something that's working against you.
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:31.520]   But the third piece is critical
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:34.760]   and that is in your goal-related efforts.
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:37.280]   What that means is that we only stress
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:41.740]   about things we care about, things that matter to us.
[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:44.840]   So this is really important, right,
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:49.040]   because stress is linked with,
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:53.520]   it's the other side of the coin of things we care about.
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:56.960]   And so I think that's the first thing to realize, right,
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:01.960]   that as humans, we stress because we care
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:06.360]   and we don't stress about things we don't care about.
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:09.220]   So the simplified example I like to use is,
[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:12.700]   you know, if Johnny was failing school,
[01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:17.600]   that wouldn't stress you out unless Johnny was your son
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.900]   or you were Johnny or you really cared
[01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:22.300]   about educating the Johnnies of the world, right?
[01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:23.700]   It only becomes stressful
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:25.860]   to the extent that you care about it.
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:30.420]   So why are we trying to fight or run away or hide
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:32.100]   or merely cope with our stress
[01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:34.940]   or, you know, overcome it through our massages
[01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:39.940]   when the stress is connected to the things we care about?
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:43.320]   So then the question becomes, okay, if that's true,
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:47.380]   how can I better utilize or leverage
[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:50.780]   or respond to the inevitable stresses
[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:52.880]   that we're going to experience?
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:55.560]   I'm not saying go out and seek out more stress.
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.880]   What I am saying is that you're gonna experience stress
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:00.120]   if you have any cares or values or passions
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.160]   and most all of us do.
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:05.240]   And so then what do you do?
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:08.120]   And we've developed a three-step approach
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:10.540]   to adopting a stress-enhancing mindset.
[01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:14.300]   And briefly, the first step is to just acknowledge
[01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:19.300]   that you're stressed, to own it, see it, be mindful of it.
[01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:22.960]   The second step is to welcome it.
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:25.240]   Why would you welcome it?
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:28.760]   You welcome it because inherently in that stress
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:30.300]   is something you care about.
[01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:32.980]   So you're using it as an opportunity to reconnect
[01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:35.760]   to what is it that I care about here?
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:39.720]   And then the third step is to utilize the stress response
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:43.120]   to achieve the thing that you care about,
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.940]   not spend your time, money, effort, energy
[01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:48.740]   trying to get rid of the stress.
[01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:49.580]   Does that make sense?
[01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:51.000]   - Makes sense and I love it.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.360]   As somebody who's laboratory studies
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:54.260]   the physiological effects of stress,
[01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:57.820]   the effects that impress me the most are, for instance,
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:08:59.980]   the narrowing of visual attention
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:04.980]   that then drives a capacity to parse time more finely,
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:09.020]   which then drives the capacity to process information faster.
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:10.600]   It's almost like a superpower.
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:16.440]   And yes, it can feel uncomfortable often,
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:21.560]   but I love the idea that acknowledging it, embracing it,
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:26.440]   and then understanding its power and leveraging that power,
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:29.720]   I think is in, what I like so much about that framework
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:32.520]   is that the stress response is very generic.
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:33.920]   Unlike the relaxation response,
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:36.080]   we don't actually have to train up the stress response.
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:39.080]   So we all kind of get this as a freebie.
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:40.320]   And then it sounds like it's a question
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:41.780]   of what we end up doing with that.
[01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:44.160]   - Right, and Hans Selye, father of stress,
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:47.040]   said himself it's a nonspecific response, right?
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:50.100]   So it occurs, it's what you're doing with it.
[01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:51.720]   It's how you're channeling it.
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.920]   And yeah, like we talked about before,
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:57.600]   what most people do is they stress about the stress,
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:59.600]   which then over-exacerbates it,
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:01.320]   or they check out from the stress,
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:04.080]   which leads to depression and anhedonia,
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:05.980]   because by checking out from stress,
[01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:08.460]   you're also checking out from the things we care about.
[01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:09.960]   - And substance abuse. - Exactly.
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.720]   - Our colleague, Anna Lemke, who also,
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:13.120]   we had the good fortune of having as a guest
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:15.000]   on this podcast, talked a lot about this,
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.760]   that so much of substance abuse,
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:20.080]   because she runs the addiction clinic
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:22.720]   over on the med side of campus,
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:26.080]   it takes over people's lives
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:28.920]   because of this increased ability
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:31.760]   to find a solution to the stress
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.480]   that then eventually becomes its own stressor
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:34.660]   and its own problem.
[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:40.200]   Well, I love that mindset and framework.
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:42.800]   I'd love for you to tell us just a bit
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:45.320]   about what you're up to right now
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.120]   and what's most exciting to you now.
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:50.900]   If you are able or willing to talk about
[01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:52.440]   some of the work that's on the way,
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:54.200]   I saw a brief mention of something
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:57.120]   on your publication's website of a paper
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:00.760]   about influencers, online influencers and nutrition.
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.560]   That might not be the main thrust of what you're up to,
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.060]   but if you're able to tell us about it,
[01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:06.520]   sort of interesting, given that a lot of the communication
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:09.440]   in and around this podcast takes place through social media,
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:12.800]   and I've kind of launched into this landscape now
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:16.440]   where I'm constantly bombarded with health information
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:21.440]   and influencers, a term I didn't even know until a couple-
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.520]   - You are one.
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:24.740]   - Well, one could argue one way or the other,
[01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:28.620]   but so what is the deal with influencers?
[01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:31.040]   Are they doing something good for health information
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.820]   or are they ruining the landscape?
[01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:36.180]   And don't try and protect my feelings.
[01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:39.800]   'Cause I now know that stress is actually an asset.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:44.500]   - Yes, well, that work is part of a body of work
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:47.420]   that we've been sort of venturing into,
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:51.560]   which is to understand where do these mindsets come from?
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:54.080]   Right, and I mentioned sort of public health entities
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:58.600]   as one source of, say, our mindsets about stress,
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:01.340]   but I think that our mindsets are influenced
[01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:04.320]   by four different sources.
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:08.420]   First is our upbringing, how our parents talked about,
[01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:10.400]   you know, things like when we're stressed
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.860]   or food or other things.
[01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:15.840]   Second is culture and media.
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:20.840]   So movies, you know, podcasts, and now social media.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.480]   Third is influential others.
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:29.920]   So what doctors say to us or close friends or peers.
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:32.680]   And fourth is your conscious choice.
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:34.920]   So, you know, we talked about that a little.
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:37.720]   You do have, we have, as humans,
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:40.400]   have the ability to be mindful of
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:43.140]   and to change our mindsets.
[01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:46.620]   But, you know, the social media and influencer stuff
[01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:49.760]   has been in part an attempt to understand
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:52.420]   where do our mindsets about things like healthy foods
[01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:54.760]   come from, and Brad Turnwald,
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:56.560]   who was a former grad student in my lab,
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:59.340]   has done a series of really interesting studies on this,
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:02.800]   showing that, you know, if you rate the nutritional quality
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:07.800]   of the, you know, top grossing movies in the last 20 years,
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:10.180]   or you look at the Instagram accounts
[01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:14.360]   of all the most influential people on Instagram,
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:17.240]   what you, and you analyze the nutrition content
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:18.800]   of what they're eating.
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.920]   What he's shown is that, you know,
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:25.440]   depending on the study, 70 to 90% of those movies
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:29.340]   or influencers would fail the legal standards
[01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:31.740]   for advertising in the UK.
[01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:35.400]   So they're putting out their nutrition contents
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.580]   that are, you know, maybe not surprisingly,
[01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:40.500]   but undeniably unhealthy.
[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:44.320]   And, you know, to me, that's interesting and important.
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:48.280]   It shows that where are we getting this mindset
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:51.000]   that, you know, those unhealthy foods
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.400]   are pleasurable, desirable.
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.600]   What's maybe even more interesting than that
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:58.520]   is some of the work that he and others in our lab
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:01.720]   have done to show that the ways people are talking
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:04.360]   about the foods they're eating really matter too.
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:07.980]   So generally what we found is that when people talk
[01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:12.320]   about unhealthy foods, they use language
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:17.320]   that connotes a sense of excitement, fun, sexiness,
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:22.560]   danger, indulgence, basically anything good and desirable.
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:24.760]   - This would be like cookies, cakes, high sugar.
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:25.600]   - Sorry, yeah.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:26.440]   - Just really unhealthy.
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:29.320]   - Like truly unhealthy foods or, yeah,
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:32.520]   that's actually the objective.
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:33.980]   What health means is challenging,
[01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:35.600]   but yeah, high fat, high sugar.
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:37.240]   - I think there's pretty good agreement now
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:39.720]   that excessive sugar isn't good.
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:40.960]   - And highly processed.
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:42.360]   - Yeah, highly processed excessive sugar.
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:43.720]   I think there's general consensus.
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:45.200]   I'm sure someone will, if you're going to come after,
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:47.760]   anyone come after me, I'll stand behind that statement.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:50.600]   - But on the other hand, when people are talking about,
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:53.160]   if they do, which, you know, healthy foods
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:55.400]   aren't portrayed in media, they aren't portrayed
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.900]   by influencers, rarely ever.
[01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:00.120]   And when they are, they're often talked about
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:04.160]   with language that conveys a sense of deprivation.
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:07.800]   It's, you know, it's nutritious, but it's sort of boring.
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:08.640]   It's bland.
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:10.520]   It's less tasty. - Recovery from the holidays.
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:12.720]   Sort of the post-holiday reset, right.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:16.480]   And this is really important because, you know,
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:18.020]   you're doing all this work trying, you know,
[01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:21.080]   and others are doing all this work trying to inform people
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:23.160]   about what actually is good for them.
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:26.520]   And meanwhile, there's this, you know, hurricane
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:31.320]   of other, you know, a force that's telling people,
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:34.380]   that's seeping into our minds that sure,
[01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:37.040]   those might be good for you, but those foods are not fun
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:39.340]   or sexy or indulgent or desirable
[01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:41.440]   in any way, shape or form, right.
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:45.680]   And it's also paid advertising for fast foods
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:47.640]   and sugary beverages and other things.
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:52.080]   So, it's not surprising that we have this mindset
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:55.120]   that healthy foods are the less desirable thing to eat
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:58.140]   because of those cultural and social forces.
[01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:01.780]   What our work has just tried to do is to reveal that,
[01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:04.720]   you know, quantify it as a way to say,
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:06.880]   all right, let's maybe be a little bit more mindful
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:09.480]   about how we talk about healthy foods.
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:12.280]   And could, you know, if you're a movie producer,
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:15.440]   can you be a little bit more mindful to showcase
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:17.840]   healthy and delicious foods and have the characters
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:20.540]   talk about them in ways that are more appealing?
[01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:25.360]   There's a lot of room for people who produce this content
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:28.900]   to have an impact, not just on, you know, what people do,
[01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:31.820]   but what they think about the foods they're eating.
[01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:32.700]   - It's really interesting.
[01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:35.340]   I hadn't thought about it until now,
[01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:37.400]   but it makes sense that any food that's packaged
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:40.560]   and can be sold can be woven into a film
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:44.340]   or promoted by a celebrity influencer,
[01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:46.940]   not a health influencer per se,
[01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:49.680]   but a celebrity influencer because they'll get paid, right?
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:53.200]   It's part of the ecosystem that allows them an income
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:55.680]   and it feeds back on sales to the company.
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:59.940]   And whereas things that can't be commoditized,
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:02.200]   it's more difficult, right?
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:07.120]   It's hard to, whoever makes oranges and sells oranges
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:11.480]   is unlikely to promote oranges in a celebrity post
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:13.600]   or in a movie because oranges can be purchased
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.040]   from many, many sources.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:18.380]   There's no identifiable source of oranges
[01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:20.960]   as there is with a packaged food, for instance.
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:23.360]   - Yeah, but the interesting thing we found in those studies
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:27.480]   is that it wasn't driven by promoted content
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:29.040]   or branded content.
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:30.560]   There's some of that, certainly.
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:34.420]   And yeah, all of the promoted and branded content
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:37.180]   is usually for processed high-sugar foods.
[01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:41.340]   But 90% or more of these foods that they were showing
[01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:43.240]   were not promoted or branded.
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:48.240]   And so there's a lot of flexibility in what, you know,
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:52.580]   these producers or influencers could show on their media.
[01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:54.120]   Although it goes both ways, right?
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:56.200]   It's not just the producers
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:58.980]   and the influencers' responsibility.
[01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:00.660]   The public is reacting to this.
[01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:05.520]   And we showed, too, that people respond more positively.
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:10.080]   There are more likes on posts about unhealthy foods.
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:15.080]   So it's a, yeah, it's a sort of a distasteful
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:19.480]   and, you know, it's a distasteful culture
[01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:20.560]   around healthy eating.
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:23.160]   And we really have a lot to do to change it.
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:25.640]   - Yeah, well, it's dopamine circuits through and through.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:28.880]   Just the sight of some very calorie-dense,
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:33.880]   extremely tasty food drives those dopamine circuits.
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:38.240]   And I realize that there are people out there
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:42.040]   who derive the same sort of or similar levels of pleasure
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:42.880]   from healthy foods.
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:44.640]   And that's a wonderful thing if one can accomplish that.
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.960]   So we just need more of that is what it sounds like.
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:47.800]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:49.760]   And that's what's really inspiring to me, at least,
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:53.200]   is that it is possible, right?
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:54.200]   I mean, people think, oh, well,
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:57.240]   vegetables are just inherently less tasty than ice cream.
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:59.600]   And it's like, well, that's not necessarily true.
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:01.640]   Also, it doesn't have to be a competition, right?
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:05.200]   I don't have to get my three-year-old to hate ice cream
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:07.640]   in order for her to like broccoli.
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:10.040]   There's a lot more I can be doing to help shape
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:14.120]   a more positive approach-oriented, indulgent mindset
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:18.640]   around healthy, nutritious vegetables and fruits
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:20.440]   and other foods, right?
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:22.600]   In addition to having her like ice cream, right?
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:23.840]   And that's totally fine.
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:25.120]   - Sounds like a really interesting study.
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.000]   When it's published, will you let me know and I'll-
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.920]   - Yeah, I think it was actually released this week.
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:29.760]   - Oh, great.
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:30.600]   I will be sure to-
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:31.960]   - In JAMA Internal Medicine.
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:33.840]   - JAMA Internal, okay.
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:34.680]   Great journal.
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:37.960]   I will definitely talk about it on social media
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:40.000]   and elsewhere.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.040]   Sounds very interesting.
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:42.980]   What else are you up to lately that's,
[01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:45.240]   my favorite question to ask any scientist or colleague,
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:47.920]   by the way, is what are you most excited about lately?
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:51.520]   What are you up late thinking about
[01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:53.360]   and getting up early thinking about?
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:56.160]   - Yeah, so hands down the thing I'm most excited,
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:58.520]   well, I guess there's so many things.
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:01.120]   The thing that I'm most into right now,
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:02.160]   we're doing the most work in,
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:04.840]   is I started by getting inspired
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:07.160]   by placebo effects in medicine.
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:11.240]   I did a long stint in placebo or belief-like effects
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.680]   in behavioral health.
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:15.480]   And now we're moving back into medicine.
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:18.960]   So I'm really interested in looking at how we can work
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:23.960]   with active drugs and treatments to make them better
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.200]   and make the experience of them better
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:29.200]   by instilling different mindsets.
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:31.360]   So one study we did along those lines,
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:36.360]   we worked with kids undergoing treatment for food allergies,
[01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:38.760]   so allergies to peanuts, for example.
[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:40.140]   This was with Kari Nadeau,
[01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:42.640]   who's the head of the Stanford Allergy Center here.
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:45.520]   She has a great treatment for food allergies.
[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:48.600]   Basically, kids take gradually increasing doses
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:51.880]   of the thing they're allergic to, like peanuts.
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:54.560]   And over the course of six or seven months,
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:59.560]   these kids become less reactive to peanuts.
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:01.800]   And the problem with that treatment
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:05.200]   is it's really difficult
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:08.160]   because they're having all sorts of negative symptoms
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:09.420]   and side effects.
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:12.800]   These kids are getting itchy mouths and upset stomach,
[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:14.940]   they're puking, and it's scary
[01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:17.640]   because they're literally eating the thing
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:20.200]   that they've been told might kill them, right?
[01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:21.960]   And what we did in the study
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:24.560]   was we attempted to improve the experience
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:28.880]   and outcomes of that by reframing mindsets
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:31.560]   about the symptoms and the side effects.
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:34.200]   So as it was being conducted before,
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:36.940]   the kids were told, "Look, these side effects
[01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:40.800]   "are just an unfortunate byproduct of this treatment,
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:44.000]   "and you have to sort of endure them to get through it."
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.280]   But what we found in our conversation with Kari
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:49.120]   was that the reality of those side effects
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:50.640]   was not so negative.
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:54.760]   In fact, they were mechanistically linked
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:57.980]   to the body learning how to tolerate peanuts
[01:21:57.980 --> 01:21:59.280]   or the allergen.
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:02.740]   And so what we did was we worked within a trial,
[01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:04.640]   they were all getting the treatment,
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:09.240]   but half of them helped to see this more positive mindset,
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:12.240]   that symptoms and side effects from this treatment
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:15.480]   were a positive signal that the treatment was working
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:17.840]   and their bodies were getting stronger.
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:21.240]   And what we found was that that mindset led to reductions
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:25.960]   in anxiety, fewer symptoms when at the highest doses,
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:30.080]   and most interestingly of all, they had better outcomes.
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:32.260]   So based on immune markers
[01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:34.640]   that were a sign of the allergic tolerance,
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:36.280]   those who had this mindset throughout
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:38.640]   had better outcomes to the treatment.
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:40.120]   So that's just one example.
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:42.960]   I think my goal is really to move us
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:47.760]   beyond the placebo versus drug mindset,
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:51.380]   versus behavior to get to a place
[01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:53.160]   where we can blend them together
[01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:56.040]   and maximize the benefit of these treatments.
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:59.040]   So we're doing a lot of studies like that,
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:01.800]   how can we improve treatment for cancer
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:03.480]   with different mindsets.
[01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:07.600]   We've done some work recently with the COVID-19 vaccine
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:10.320]   and symptoms and side effects.
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:13.320]   So that's what I'm really passionate about right now.
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:15.640]   - Incredible.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:16.800]   I can't wait to read that study.
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.960]   Is that one out or on the way?
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:22.760]   Okay, well then I will also read and communicate with you
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:23.760]   and then about that study.
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:25.320]   Who knows, maybe you would come on Instagram
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:27.620]   and do a little Instagram live
[01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:31.000]   to make sure that I don't screw up the delivery
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.560]   and that we can hear it direct
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:34.380]   from the person who ran the study.
[01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:38.400]   I find this issue of side effects really interesting.
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:40.160]   I don't take a lot of prescription drugs,
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:42.900]   but recently I was prescribed a few
[01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:47.700]   and the list of side effects is, it's incredible.
[01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:49.260]   And it just goes on and on and on.
[01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:51.340]   I realized some of that is legal protections.
[01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:52.180]   It's hard for me to believe
[01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:54.460]   that they're actually expecting anyone to read those
[01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:57.000]   because you need a high powered microscope
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.480]   to read this print, it's truly fine print.
[01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:02.640]   But I did realize that in reading over the side effects
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:05.620]   that you prime, one primes themselves
[01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:07.300]   to experience those side effects.
[01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:09.420]   And so now I just rip up the side effects thing
[01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:11.380]   and or the sheet and just throw it away.
[01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:12.900]   I just take it as recommended.
[01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:16.460]   Do you think it works in the other direction too?
[01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:19.860]   Where if an effective medication
[01:24:19.860 --> 01:24:23.700]   is supposed to have result A, B, or C,
[01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:26.020]   and you are told again and again
[01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:27.980]   how effective it is for that treatment,
[01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:29.860]   that it could amplify the effect.
[01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:33.080]   So in other words, it's not strictly a placebo.
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:35.580]   It's not nocebo as you described before,
[01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:38.100]   but that perhaps at a lower dose,
[01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:41.340]   a given medication could have a amplified effect.
[01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:44.220]   Or at a appropriate dose, if you will,
[01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:46.620]   it could have a super physiological effect.
[01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:48.220]   Has that ever been demonstrated?
[01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:50.580]   To some degree.
[01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:53.300]   I think where it gets tricky is for a long time,
[01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:55.260]   people thought the effects of placebos
[01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:57.060]   were expectancy based.
[01:24:57.060 --> 01:25:02.060]   So you expect to get a benefit and that benefit occurs.
[01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:04.940]   There's certainly some truth to that.
[01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:08.060]   But I think the mindset approach is more powerful
[01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:10.960]   because it helps us understand the mechanisms, right?
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:15.720]   So if you just expect that your blood pressure will go down,
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:21.100]   what are the mechanisms through which that expectation
[01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:23.220]   would lead to your blood pressure going down?
[01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:26.280]   It's hard to even understand that, right?
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:31.280]   But if you have the mindset that you're in good hands,
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:34.760]   that this is being taken care of,
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:39.460]   that this illness is not going to kill you, right?
[01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:41.880]   That you're being treated well.
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:45.280]   Then you can start to unpack the mechanisms
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:47.020]   through which blood pressure could be relieved.
[01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:49.560]   Maybe it's anxiety reduction.
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:53.920]   Maybe it's changing the sort of anticipation
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:57.820]   or the prioritization of what the body needs to focus on.
[01:25:57.820 --> 01:26:01.920]   And so I really think that the work of the future
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:04.340]   needs to be on getting more sophisticated
[01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:07.500]   about what is the mindset that we're instilling
[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:09.580]   when we say something will work or it won't work?
[01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:12.260]   And how do we understand the mechanisms
[01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:14.740]   through which that changes physiology?
[01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:17.500]   So to answer your question, I think that that could be true,
[01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:20.160]   but it depends on what actually is the mindset
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:21.000]   you're evoking.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.940]   - I know you're a parent and to the other parents out there,
[01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:28.700]   but also to kids and people who don't have kids,
[01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:32.040]   what is the best way to learn and teach mindsets?
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:34.980]   I mean, clearly a conversation like this informs me
[01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:37.700]   and many other people out there about mindsets
[01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:39.260]   and how we can adopt them.
[01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:43.780]   But it also seems to me that if we have the opportunity
[01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:47.240]   to teach mindsets and really cultivate certain mindsets,
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:50.260]   that the world would be a much better place.
[01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:51.860]   How does one go about that?
[01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:54.900]   Given that we're kids and we are all being bombarded
[01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:56.580]   with conflicting information all the time,
[01:26:56.580 --> 01:26:58.460]   how do we anchor to a mindset?
[01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:04.340]   - Yeah, and you're getting at my other major passion
[01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:07.060]   right now, which is what we're calling in our lab,
[01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:10.420]   meta mindset, I'm working on this with Chris Evans
[01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:14.260]   and others, and that is how do we consciously
[01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:17.120]   and deliberately change our mindsets?
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:20.060]   And the first step is really simple,
[01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:22.800]   and that's just to be aware that you have them,
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:25.980]   that the world, your beliefs aren't sort of
[01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:30.260]   an unmitigated reflection of reality as it objectively is.
[01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:32.860]   They are filtered through our interpretations,
[01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:36.100]   our expectations, our frameworks,
[01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:38.540]   and simplifications of that reality.
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:42.420]   And as your work and as you know so well,
[01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:45.080]   most of what goes on in our brain
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:47.700]   is an interpretation of reality.
[01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:50.560]   Mindsets are just the simplified core assumptions
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:53.980]   about things, and the first step
[01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:56.180]   is to realize that we have them.
[01:27:56.180 --> 01:27:59.260]   The second step is to start to think about
[01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:02.300]   what the effects of those mindsets are on your life
[01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:04.220]   to sort of play out the story, right?
[01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:07.580]   Okay, I have this mindset that stress is debilitating.
[01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:10.100]   How is that making me feel?
[01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:11.700]   What is that leading me to do?
[01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:15.000]   Is this mindset helpful or harmful?
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.260]   The question isn't is the mindset right or wrong,
[01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:20.220]   'cause you can find evidence for or against it.
[01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:23.220]   We can fight about it 'til we're exhausted.
[01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:26.980]   The question is is it helpful or harmful?
[01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:31.080]   And then you can go about seeking out ways
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:34.900]   to adopt more useful mindsets.
[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:36.960]   So we've been doing a lot of work
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:38.300]   on how to actually do that.
[01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:39.980]   How do you consciously change it?
[01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:42.740]   Sometimes it's really simple, I think,
[01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:45.220]   in cases where we don't have a lot of prior experience,
[01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:50.220]   like the kids with allergies who are getting treatment.
[01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:53.900]   They didn't have any other mindsets about symptoms,
[01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:57.080]   so we just had the luxury of setting it, right?
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:58.700]   When it comes to healthy food,
[01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:01.500]   I think it's harder to change people's mindsets
[01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:04.140]   'cause we have a lot of baggage weighing us down.
[01:29:04.140 --> 01:29:09.960]   As a parent, for me, I guess my number one piece of advice
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:14.300]   is to lighten up trying to get your kids
[01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:18.980]   to do certain things and focus more on helping them
[01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:22.080]   to adopt more adaptive mindsets.
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:25.480]   So I'm by no means an expert at this,
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:27.820]   but I'm testing it with my own child.
[01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:31.460]   - In real time, the real kind of experiment.
[01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:34.900]   - It's how do I resist the urge
[01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:37.280]   to force my child to eat her dinner
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:39.740]   so that she can have her dessert, right?
[01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:40.940]   'Cause that's the real urge.
[01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:42.960]   It's like, no, you need to do that.
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:44.980]   Because when you start thinking about it
[01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:47.760]   in terms of mindset, you realize,
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:50.300]   oh, that's just reinforcing to her
[01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:53.560]   that the dessert is the exciting, fun thing to have.
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:56.300]   And this thing that I have to do must be horrible,
[01:29:56.300 --> 01:30:00.420]   so horrible that my parent is forcing me to do it, right?
[01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:04.620]   So it's letting go a little bit of the behavior,
[01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:05.940]   the objective reality,
[01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:09.420]   and really thinking about the subjective reality
[01:30:09.420 --> 01:30:12.800]   and focusing on adaptive mindsets.
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:16.660]   So my goal as a parent has been to try to help her
[01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:19.620]   instill a healthy mindset about eating,
[01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:22.620]   that healthy foods are indulgent and delicious,
[01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:25.580]   that the experience of stress is inevitable,
[01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:29.220]   that it's natural and that it can help,
[01:30:29.220 --> 01:30:32.540]   going through stressful experience can help her learn, grow,
[01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:36.100]   and become a more connected and happier individual.
[01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:39.380]   And with exercise and physical activity,
[01:30:39.380 --> 01:30:40.740]   we haven't really gotten to that yet,
[01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:43.140]   but we will with time.
[01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:44.260]   - Yeah, it's great.
[01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:45.920]   I wrote down, and I'm going to keep this
[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:48.580]   in the front of my mind going forward,
[01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:50.740]   to continually ask what is the effect
[01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:52.620]   of my mindset about X?
[01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:54.820]   And just to evaluate that about exercise,
[01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:57.540]   about food, about school, about stress, about relationships,
[01:30:57.540 --> 01:31:00.060]   about relationship to self, et cetera,
[01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:03.180]   and to really think about that in a series of layers.
[01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:05.180]   You think that would be a useful exercise?
[01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:06.020]   - Definitely.
[01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:08.020]   And you know, and your work speaks to the,
[01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:11.420]   I mean, the mindful, it's not, I would, yeah,
[01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:15.340]   really urge against people getting dogmatic
[01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:16.780]   about their mindset also, right?
[01:31:16.780 --> 01:31:18.380]   Like, oh, I need to have the right mindset.
[01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:19.740]   Or, and if I don't have the right mind, you know,
[01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:22.980]   it's like, okay, mindset is a piece of the puzzle.
[01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:26.380]   It's a piece of the puzzle that's really empowering
[01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:29.340]   because we have access to it and we can change it.
[01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:31.180]   But it is just one piece of a puzzle.
[01:31:31.180 --> 01:31:33.180]   So treat yourself like a scientist.
[01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:35.420]   Look at your life, look at your mindsets,
[01:31:35.420 --> 01:31:38.420]   see what's serving you, see what isn't.
[01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:42.260]   Find more useful, adaptive, and empowering mindsets
[01:31:42.260 --> 01:31:45.700]   and live by those.
[01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:46.700]   - I love it.
[01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:50.740]   Now, in one version of this kind of discussion,
[01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:53.420]   I would have asked the question I'm gonna ask next
[01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:57.180]   at the beginning, but I'm going to ask it now close
[01:31:57.180 --> 01:32:00.260]   to the end, which is you're a unique constellation
[01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:03.620]   of accomplishments and attributes.
[01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:06.100]   And I only know a subset of them, of course,
[01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:08.260]   'cause today's the first time that we've met in person,
[01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:09.780]   even though I've known your work for a long time
[01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:11.740]   and we're colleagues across campus.
[01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:15.860]   So you run your laboratory where you do research.
[01:32:15.860 --> 01:32:20.420]   You were also an athlete in university, a serious athlete.
[01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:22.580]   And then you're also a clinical psychologist.
[01:32:22.580 --> 01:32:23.860]   Is that right?
[01:32:23.860 --> 01:32:25.580]   - I was trained as a clinical psychologist.
[01:32:25.580 --> 01:32:29.820]   So my PhD is in clinical psychology and I did, you know,
[01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:34.820]   all my pre and post internships with stress and trauma.
[01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:37.340]   - Do you see patients or did you see patients at that time?
[01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:39.300]   - I did, yes, I don't anymore.
[01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:41.500]   - Okay, that's a very unique constellation
[01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:43.580]   of practitioner and researcher.
[01:32:43.580 --> 01:32:49.020]   So what are the mindsets that you try and adopt
[01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:51.940]   on a regular basis as a consequence
[01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:53.460]   or in relation to those things,
[01:32:53.460 --> 01:32:56.180]   sort of athlete, researcher, clinician?
[01:32:56.180 --> 01:32:58.420]   You know, for yourself, as you move through life,
[01:32:58.420 --> 01:33:01.500]   do you have an overarching mindset
[01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:04.140]   that all challenge is good,
[01:33:04.140 --> 01:33:06.820]   or do you have any kind of central mindsets
[01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:09.860]   that help you navigate through, you know,
[01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:12.900]   has to be a pretty complex set of daily routines
[01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:14.500]   given everything that you juggle.
[01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:17.420]   But I think that people like you are unique
[01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:20.180]   in that you have the inside knowledge
[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:22.060]   of how this stuff works,
[01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:24.300]   and you've also existed in these different domains.
[01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:28.900]   And I know a lot of listeners have a more athletic slant
[01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:30.940]   to their life or a more cognitive,
[01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:32.740]   or some are raising kids, or some people are just,
[01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:34.980]   you know, are doing any number of things.
[01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:36.460]   So this is where I think it would be useful
[01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:38.540]   for people to hear, what do you do?
[01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:39.980]   This is what I'm asking.
[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:42.380]   - Yeah, well, it's certainly true in my case
[01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:45.260]   that research is me-search, right?
[01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:48.980]   Everything that I study as an intellectual
[01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:53.260]   has come from my own experience or my own failings, right?
[01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:55.620]   And when I was, you know,
[01:33:55.620 --> 01:33:59.820]   really intensely exercising and training,
[01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:01.820]   those were the questions I asked
[01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:03.780]   when I was dealing with eating
[01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:06.260]   and, you know, concerns about my weight.
[01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:07.700]   Those were the questions I asked
[01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:10.940]   when I was stressed about my dissertation.
[01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:13.580]   I decided to do my dissertation on stress, right?
[01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:15.580]   You know, now I think we're in the midst
[01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:17.260]   of a global pandemic.
[01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:22.260]   It's, you know, how can our mindsets be useful here?
[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:26.500]   You know, so I don't think there's a obvious answer
[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:30.700]   to your question other than the guiding light for me
[01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:35.140]   has been an undercurrent of understanding
[01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:36.140]   that our mindsets matter.
[01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:40.060]   I think I got that very clearly and deeply as a child,
[01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:43.980]   both through my experiences as an athlete, you know,
[01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:45.940]   I know many of your listeners are athletes.
[01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:49.540]   Any athlete knows that you can be the same physical being
[01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:52.060]   from one day to the next, one moment to the next,
[01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:54.940]   and perform completely differently
[01:34:54.940 --> 01:34:57.020]   just depending on what you're thinking.
[01:34:57.020 --> 01:35:00.980]   I was a gymnast growing up, and if you can't visualize,
[01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:02.580]   if you can't see something in your mind,
[01:35:02.580 --> 01:35:04.520]   you have no chance when you get up there
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:05.860]   on the balance beam, right?
[01:35:05.860 --> 01:35:08.540]   And I also, my father was a martial artist,
[01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:09.740]   a teacher of meditation,
[01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:13.740]   so this kind of mind-body work was baked into me
[01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:17.020]   from an early age, and I think what I've done recently
[01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:19.960]   is to try to understand it scientifically,
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:23.340]   and more importantly, to figure out
[01:35:23.340 --> 01:35:26.540]   how can we do better with this, right?
[01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:29.380]   How can we, you know, we're all talking about AI
[01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:31.640]   taking over the world, and technology this,
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:34.240]   and personalized medicine that, and it's like,
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:38.580]   we have done so little, relatively so little,
[01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:43.340]   with the human resource, our human brains,
[01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:48.340]   that the, you know, the potential for which is so great,
[01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:51.380]   and we've done almost nothing, you know?
[01:35:51.380 --> 01:35:55.460]   Take the placebo effect, we know a lot about what it is,
[01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:59.060]   we've done almost nothing to leverage that in medicine,
[01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:00.800]   consciously and deliberately.
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:04.540]   So my, what keeps me going,
[01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:06.080]   what gets me through the hard times
[01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:09.680]   is just that burning question of what is going on here,
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:13.080]   and what more can I do with the power of my mind?
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:16.120]   - Well, I and millions of other people
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:17.640]   are so grateful that you do this work.
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:20.160]   It's so important, and it's truly unique.
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:22.940]   Tell us where people can learn more about your research,
[01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:24.500]   where they can find you online.
[01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:25.600]   I'm gonna try and persuade you
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:29.380]   to take more of a social media presence going forward,
[01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:32.160]   but whether or not I succeed in that effort or not,
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:34.040]   where can people find you?
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:37.360]   Ask questions, find your papers, learn more.
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:39.700]   I'd love to have you back for a conversation in the future,
[01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:41.060]   but in the meantime.
[01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:42.120]   - Yeah, no, it's really,
[01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:44.300]   it's been such an honor getting to chat with you.
[01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:47.240]   I'm just, you have such an impact on the world,
[01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:48.080]   and I look forward,
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:49.900]   I hope we can do some science together also.
[01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:51.040]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:55.540]   - Yeah, all our papers and materials and interventions
[01:36:55.540 --> 01:37:00.540]   are housed on our website, mbl.stanford.edu.
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:04.800]   We also have a link there that takes you to Stanford SPARK,
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:07.520]   which stands for social psychological answers
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:08.920]   to real world questions.
[01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:12.640]   We have a lot of toolkits on that website,
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:16.140]   including a toolkit for this rethink stress approach
[01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:20.480]   of acknowledging, welcoming, and utilizing your stress.
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:24.840]   And then I guess I'm on Twitter, oleacross.
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:28.080]   I don't do much there, but maybe I will start too.
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:29.280]   - Well, those are all great resources.
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:31.080]   We will provide links to all of those
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:32.920]   for our listeners and viewers.
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:37.020]   And I also hope to convince you to write a book
[01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:38.760]   or many books in the future.
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:40.100]   The world needs to know about this,
[01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:42.800]   but thank you so much for taking time
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:44.680]   out of your exceedingly busy schedule
[01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:46.600]   to talk to us about these ideas.
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:47.480]   I learned so much.
[01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:49.600]   I'm going to definitely think about
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:52.280]   what is the effect of my mindset about blank
[01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:54.340]   in every category of life,
[01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:57.940]   and really just on behalf of everybody and myself.
[01:37:57.940 --> 01:37:59.280]   Thank you so much.
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:00.120]   - Yeah, thank you.
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:01.960]   And I guess I just want to end by saying,
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:04.960]   I think this work is really the tip of the iceberg
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:07.080]   of what can and should be done.
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:10.780]   And so I really invite you, your listeners,
[01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:13.760]   and anybody who's inspired by this work,
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:15.540]   if they want to share stories
[01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:20.360]   or want to partner on a collaboration to please reach out.
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:22.200]   - Great, well, and the comments section on YouTube
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:24.680]   is a great place to do that as well.
[01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:25.760]   You will hear from them.
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:26.600]   - Great.
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:27.420]   - All right, great.
[01:38:27.420 --> 01:38:28.320]   Thank you so much, Allie.
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:29.160]   - Thank you.
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:30.940]   - Thank you for joining me
[01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:33.020]   for my conversation with Dr. Alia Crum.
[01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:37.400]   I'm guessing by now you can appreciate the enormous impact
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:40.720]   that mindsets have on our biology and our psychology
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:44.520]   and how those interact at the level of mind and body.
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:46.760]   If you'd like to learn more about Dr. Crum's work
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:48.960]   and perhaps even be a research subject
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:51.520]   in one of their upcoming studies on mindsets,
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:55.080]   you can go to mbl.stanford.edu.
[01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:57.960]   There you will also see a tab for support
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:01.080]   where if you like, you can make a tax deductible donation
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:02.800]   to support the incredible research
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:05.000]   that Dr. Crum and her colleagues are doing.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:05.920]   If you're learning from
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:08.080]   and/or enjoying the Huberman Lab Podcast,

[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:35.160]   mentioned at the beginning of this episode.
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:37.360]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:38.460]   We also have a Patreon.
[01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:41.040]   It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:42.840]   And there you can support the podcast
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:44.560]   at any level that you like.
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:45.920]   If you're not already following us
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:47.960]   on Instagram and on Twitter,
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:50.440]   we are @hubermanlab at both Instagram and Twitter.
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:53.480]   And there I teach neuroscience in short form,
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:55.780]   sometimes videos, sometimes text slides,
[01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:57.300]   some of that information overlaps
[01:39:57.300 --> 01:39:58.640]   with what you find on the podcast.
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:01.380]   Some of it is distinct from what you find on the podcast.
[01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:03.860]   On previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:40:03.860 --> 01:40:05.380]   I often discuss supplements.
[01:40:05.380 --> 01:40:08.380]   While supplements aren't necessary or used by everybody,
[01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:11.180]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them.
[01:40:11.180 --> 01:40:13.140]   An important consideration when using supplements
[01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:16.440]   is that they be sourced from the highest quality sources.
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:19.520]   For that reason, we partner with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:20.600]   because Thorne supplements use
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:21.980]   the highest quality ingredients
[01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:23.680]   and the greatest degree of precision
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:25.140]   in terms of what's listed on the bottle
[01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:27.800]   is actually what you will find in their products.
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:29.640]   And that is not true for all supplement companies.
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:31.180]   If you'd like to see the supplements that I take,
[01:40:31.180 --> 01:40:36.180]   you can go to Thorne, that's T-H-O-R-N-E.com/u/huberman,
[01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:39.640]   and you can get 20% off any of those supplements.
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:41.840]   In addition, if you navigate into the Thorne site
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:45.120]   through that portal, thorne.com/u/huberman,
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:47.780]   you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements
[01:40:47.780 --> 01:40:49.000]   that Thorne makes.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.640]   In closing, I'd like to thank you once again
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:52.960]   for joining me for my discussion about mindsets
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:54.680]   with Dr. Alia Crum.
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:57.480]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:00.060]   [upbeat music]
[01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:02.640]   (upbeat music)
