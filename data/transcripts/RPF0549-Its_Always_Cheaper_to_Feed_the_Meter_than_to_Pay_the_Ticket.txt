This allows the horse to walk and to work on paved and rocky surfaces without wearing down their hooves so that they don't go lame. It allows the horse to be more comfortable and allows them to do more work.

[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:11.040]   Probably about a decade ago. Now I made a firm decision that I was always going to feed the meter rather than thinking about how I would battle the ticket.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:26.000]   I can name the street and the city was right here in South Florida. I had parked my car outside an office building. I was running in to pick up some paperwork from a client of mine. I knew I'd only

[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.260]   The potential examples are legion. I encourage you to consider your own examples. Consider your life, or excuse me, I should say, consider a friend's life. Think of a friend of yours who seems to always be struggling, always be behind, always be scrambling, in trouble with the law, in trouble with the authorities, in trouble with somebody. A dollar late and a day late and a dollar short, no matter what.

[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:48.660]  , and I ask you, does that person simply feed the meter? Or do they try to take the risk and run the ticket? My experience has been most people who are always struggling and scrambling are that way because they don't ever stop and decide to feed the meter. But it doesn't have to be that way. You can indeed feed the meter.
[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.720]   I'm not saying that you're going to be a leader. I'm just saying that you're going to be a leader.
