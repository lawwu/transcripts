[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   Hey parents, join the LA Kings on Saturday, November 25th for an unforgettable kids day
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.480]   presented by Pear Deck. Family fun, giveaways, and exciting Kings hockey awaits. Get your tickets now
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.720]   at lakings.com/promotions and create lasting memories with your little ones.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:24.080]   For want of a nail, the shoe was lost. For want of a shoe, the horse was lost. For want of a horse,
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.400]   the rider was lost. For want of a rider, the message was lost. For want of a message, the battle
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:39.920]   was lost. For want of a battle, the kingdom was lost. And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:49.280]   Now perhaps you've not shod a horse recently, but if you've ever had the pleasure of being
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.080]   around a farrier while they put horseshoes on, I'd encourage you to take a careful look
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:04.720]   at a horseshoe nail. It's a basically insignificant little hunk of metal.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:13.040]   Blacksmiths can bang them out pretty quickly. If you're not familiar with the methods of
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.320]   shoeing a horse, basically the farrier will come along and file down the horse's hooves,
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.040]   make it nice and make it shape it nicely, shape a horseshoe to the horse's hooves. And then they'll
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.840]   take a hammer and just a simple little nail and nail the horseshoe onto the bottom of the
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:36.400]   horse's hooves. This allows the horse to walk and to work on paved and rocky surfaces without
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.360]   wearing down their hooves so they don't go lame. It allows the horse to be more comfortable
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.680]   and allows them to do more work. It's a very important little piece of metal,
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.960]   but it's very insignificant. Now, of course, that famous proverb rings true,
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.920]   but here's my modern version of it. Here's a maxim that I made up that
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.880]   I think is worth your consideration today, and it's very simple.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.240]   It's always cheaper to feed the meter than to pay the ticket.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:17.120]   Again, it's always cheaper to feed the meter than to pay the ticket.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.800]   Probably about a decade ago now, I made a firm decision that I was always going to feed the meter
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:32.000]   rather than thinking about how I would battle the ticket. I can name the street and the city. It was
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.080]   right here in South Florida. I had parked my car outside an office building. I was running in to
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.000]   pick up some paperwork from a client of mine. I knew it would only be a minute, and I think there
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.120]   was a minute or two left on the parking meter. Well, a minute turned into 10, and I came back
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:55.520]   to find a ticket on my windshield due to the expired meter. Now, of course, you've probably
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.360]   thought this yourself. What are the chances of the meter attendant coming by exactly at the time?
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.880]   When I run out, and oh, by the way, I'll be fast enough that if I see them, I can come out and beg
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.280]   for mercy, and they'll probably show me mercy. You've probably thought that too. Well, unfortunately,
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.080]   your experience is probably like mine. If you don't feed the meter, you wind up with a ticket.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:26.000]   I, the office of parking tickets was a couple blocks away, so I just went and paid it right
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.280]   there, probably about 30 bucks, but I remember being really annoyed with myself that I had to
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:41.120]   spend 30 bucks when if I just spent 50 cents, I would have avoided the whole hassle. I would
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:48.960]   have saved the 30 bucks, and I would have saved the time and the frustration. Now, if you run the math,
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:58.480]   let's say it's 50 cents, how many times would you have to feed the meter in order to equal the total
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.720]   amount that you spend on the ticket? And what's the likelihood of your being able to park that
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.120]   many times without getting a ticket? If you think about it, I think you'll find that the math works
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.360]   out in favor of feeding the meter. It's always cheaper to feed the meter than to pay the ticket.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:28.480]   Now, since that time, I have imperfectly endeavored to feed the meter, to be proactive,
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:36.000]   and to be careful and cautious in all of my affairs. It'd really be a shame to have an injury
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:45.360]   to one of my family members because I ignored some basic thing. I didn't replace the tires on time,
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:52.400]   and then the car rolled while driving on the interstate with a blown out tire. I didn't
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.120]   purchase the insurance coverage that was cheap to buy that would have protected me from thousands
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:03.760]   of dollars of loss. I didn't leave 30 minutes early to give time for any problems with traffic
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:11.840]   to make it to the important appointment. The potential examples are legion. I encourage you
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.720]   to consider your own examples. Consider your life, or excuse me, I should say, consider a friend's
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.560]   life. Think of a friend of yours who seems to always be struggling, always be behind,
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.720]   always be scrambling, in trouble with the law, in trouble with the authorities, in trouble with
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.400]   somebody, a dollar late and a day late and a dollar short, no matter when it is,
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.000]   grabbing money from here, grabbing money from there, and I ask you,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.920]   does that person simply feed the meter, or do they try to take the risk and run the ticket?
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:54.240]   My experience has been most people who are always struggling and scrambling are that way
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.840]   because they don't ever stop and decide to feed the meter. But it doesn't have to be that way.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:10.240]   You can indeed feed the meter. You can fill up the gas tank when it's half full, not when it's
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:17.840]   at the bottom. You can put money in the bank, set it aside in savings. You can think proactively
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.560]   about the maintenance items that'll keep your house from falling apart. You can think proactively
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:29.760]   about your physical health. You can plan ahead with your money so that you have some to spend
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.320]   on the things that you want to spend it. And if you do that, what you find is that it's always
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.520]   cheaper because you avoid the big expensive problems and you get better deals because you
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:45.600]   have money. You've been proactive. The 25 or 50 cents into the parking meter really is a bargain
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:54.800]   when compared to paying the ticket. You say, "But I just don't carry change in my car. I
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:01.440]   didn't have the money." Well, whose fault is that? It's not the parking attendant's fault
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:10.080]   that you didn't have change. It's your fault. So plan ahead. Feed the meter.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:19.600]   Almost every major problem that people face can be traced back to a couple of small decisions,
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.960]   which at the time didn't seem so important.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:30.000]   But yet if you'd made a different choice at that time,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.360]   there may very well have been a different outcome down the road. Not everything,
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:44.720]   but most things are that way. You didn't go ahead and replace the tires
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:52.560]   and you suffered the catastrophic accident that resulted in physical injury to you and your loved
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:08:02.080]   ones. You didn't plan ahead and call a cab and you wound up in prison or you wound up losing your
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:11.120]   money. You didn't plan ahead to get ahead on time and so you were speeding. And then that speeding
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:16.480]   ticket turned into not only the cost of a ticket, but perhaps the loss of a bunch of stuff. I was
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.480]   thinking when it comes to speeding, I always think of that case a little over 10 years ago in the
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:29.600]   United States here. It was called United States versus $124,700 in US currency. It was one of the
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:35.040]   cases where the police stole the guy's money because they thought it was drug money. If memory,
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:40.720]   if my details are right, this Mexican guy was traveling from Chicago, I think back to Mexico,
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:46.080]   and was passing through the middle of the country somewhere and gets pulled over for speeding.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:52.000]   And poor guy, he doesn't speak English, the cop doesn't speak Spanish. They're going back and
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.320]   forth, but he consents to a search. Back to why do I spend so much time trying to teach about
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.480]   standing up for your rights? Never consent to searches. No, I don't consent to searches. No
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:07.600]   searches. So the guy consents to a search. Cops go through his vehicle, find in his back seat a
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:14.960]   cooler with money, $125,000 in it, in cash, and it's wrapped in foil, aluminum foil packages.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:21.200]   So they bring in a drug dog to sniff it. And of course, since all currency has drugs on it,
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:28.480]   then they say, "Okay, the drug dog signaled, hit to the money that it's drugs." So therefore,
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.680]   they impound the money and they steal the money. That's what the cops do. They do it down here in
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:37.600]   Florida. They steal the boats, the cars and whatnot from anybody who's supposedly involved
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:44.320]   in the drug trade. So they have no other evidence that this guy did anything wrong other than the
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.960]   fact that he's carrying cash, and the fact that he's carrying cash is suspicious. So the case goes
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:57.120]   to trial, and the Mexican guy testifies at the trial that he and several of his friends, they
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:02.720]   were planning to buy a refrigerated box truck in Chicago. And so he had flown up there to buy the
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:08.240]   truck with the money, and he had flown up there to take delivery of the truck, but the deal had
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.160]   fallen through and they weren't able to buy the truck. And so he was traveling back to Mexico,
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.600]   and I think he was driving because he had heard that you aren't supposed to fly with more than
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.560]   $10,000. Because of course, if you actually have money, you are by definition suspicious.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:29.920]   So he was driving instead. Well, the case went on to appeals, but the legal barrier of the cops
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.400]   stealing your money in the United States is very, very low. And so the cops kept the money and the
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:41.280]   Mexican guys were out, all because of speeding. Now, who knows why, just the point, I always think
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:47.280]   of that when it comes to speeding. Is this worth $125,000 for me to be speeding? The answer is
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:54.320]   usually no. I'm not going to tell you whether I carry $125,000 around on my backseat in a cooler
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:59.440]   wrapped in aluminum foil or not, that would be unwise. Point is that little decisions,
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:07.040]   little things often have a big set of consequences. Think through and study the stories of tragedy and
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:12.960]   disaster. Somebody loses their money, loses their house, the house burns down because you didn't
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:21.200]   check the wiring or didn't do it right, or whatever the circumstances are. Today, I challenge you with
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:28.560]   this one simple thing. Take my Maxim, steal it and burn it into your head. It's always cheaper
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:35.920]   to feed the meter than to pay the ticket. Again, it's always cheaper to feed the meter
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:45.920]   than to pay the ticket. What can you do today to feed the meter?
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:58.560]   What can you do today to be proactive? Whatever you know to do today, start doing it. Don't wait,
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:05.280]   start doing it. Thank you for listening. You've honored me with your time and attention,
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:11.040]   and I'm grateful for that. And I hope that I've effectively served you today with some ideas and
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:16.720]   strategies and tactics and techniques and tools that will help move you towards your goals.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:22.800]   Before you go, three simple requests. One, if there's an idea that's been helpful to you in
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:29.120]   today's show, make a plan to take action on it. Listening does lead to learning,
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:35.680]   but learning in and of itself doesn't automatically lead to a life change. It's action
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:43.440]   that leads to a life change. So take action. Two, take something that was helpful to you in
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:49.920]   today's show and share it with somebody that you care about. I'm depending on you to be a
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:56.160]   co-laborer with me in helping me to propagate the message that I'm seeking to share.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:03.440]   That helps the person that you are engaging with, and it also helps you because teaching
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:09.440]   others is one of the most effective ways for you to learn and for you to cement your learning.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.880]   Three, if there's an idea that's been specifically helpful to you, and if you're gaining
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:20.240]   financial benefit from Radical Personal Finance, I'd be grateful if you'd consider paying me for
