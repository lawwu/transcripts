[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.380]   I've had people on this podcast sit where you're sitting and basically paint a picture of sugar
[00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:15.900]   that it is not quite as bad as crack cocaine and meth, but not too far from that. Kind of
[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.640]   exaggerating. And I've had people who land in the more kind of tempered response to sugar.
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.860]   But let's define sugar. When I say sugar, I'm not talking about fructose.
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:37.400]   In fruit, because in fruit, you've got fructose, but you've got fiber and there's a high water content.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.320]   And some, sure, some fruits have higher fructose content than others. Mangos versus apples,
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.880]   for instance, or something of that sort. But when I'm talking about sugar, I'm talking about
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:56.380]   if one looks at a package or a label and sees added sugars, how bad are added sugars? Because those
[00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.500]   are really the ones that tend to fall into this bin of quote-unquote bad sugar in a lot of people's
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:13.960]   minds. Okay. So they dilute the nutritive value of the diet and they contribute to hyperpalatability.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:21.220]   If you're talking about extrinsic sugars added to the diet, you know, they're really only two sources
[00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:29.140]   of intrinsic sugars are in fruit and in milk. Everything else, you're pretty much adding it.
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:38.920]   With the exception of like maybe agave, but that's kind of a rare esoteric thing. But added sugars to the diet
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:49.900]   should be consumed judiciously. The working recommendation is to try to limit added sugars to the diet
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:57.200]   to 10% of total calories. So if you're somebody who likes to put maple syrup on whatever you might do or somebody
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.020]   who likes to put honey on whatever you might do, then you may want to limit that to typical, let's say,
[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.020]   2,000 calorie diet. You might want to limit it to like a maximum of 40, 50 grams a day.
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.680]   That still seems high.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.280]   It does.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.820]   40, 50 grams. Who's eating that much sugar?
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.580]   If that me.
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.580]   Oh, really? You have a sweet tooth?
[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.080]   No, no. I love honey and I, and I love maple syrup.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.660]   Oh, see, I have a savory tooth. Like if I, I have to try and not eat the entire block of Parmesan cheese.
[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:39.120]   I have both, man. I've, I've, I've, I always joke that I have an inner fat boy within me, but I actually have been technically obese by BMI standards, like, uh, 10 years ish back.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.880]   You're, uh, how old now?
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.880]   53.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:55.980]   Great. Well, you seem to be in great shape. No hormone augmentation. We clarified that earlier. I asked, this is what guys ask each other nowadays. You on, are you doing any hormone augmentation? No. So, um, Alan says no. And I believe him completely, but yeah, you're in great shape at 53.
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:56.480]   Thank you.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.680]   Um, and you have a sweet tooth and a savory tooth.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.480]   I do, man.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.340]   So how do you contend with it?
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.920]   I do. Oh, okay. So that's a great question. Cause I can dish out something practical here. Protein powder.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:20.800]   Protein powder satisfies the heck out of my sweet tooth. And, um, I, I actually don't have the full 50 grams of, uh, added sugar. I might add like a tablespoon of, um, maple syrup to my coffee.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.680]   To your coffee?
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.440]   In, in, in the day. Yeah. Yeah, dude, dude. Okay. So, you know, those mocha, mocha pot thingies?
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.120]   Oh yeah. Uh, mocha pots? Sorry.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.440]   It's called mocha pot. Um, it's like some, it's a piece of hardware?
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:41.840]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's the thing where you, it's this odd, like, oh, right. It's like an hourglass, uh, shaped, uh, coffee.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.200]   Yes. Yeah. Yes. Okay.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:52.640]   So I, I have that. And, um, what I'm trying to do, I'm trying to duplicate the, uh, the, the, the Thai coffee. Is it Thai?
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.200]   Mm-hmm. What is it? It's Thai iced tea.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.760]   Really fricking good coffee that either Vietnamese coffee. Vietnamese coffee. Vietnamese coffee. Yeah.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.960]   I love Vietnamese food. I don't drink the Vietnamese coffee. It's too sweet for me.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:10.160]   Dude, I'm trying to do a version of that with the mocha pot. And if I put maple syrup in that tablespoon,
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.320]   it's fricking awesome. And I have that with, uh, with half and half. It's really good.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.240]   So you got a, you got a fat sugar combination plus caffeine. You do this in the morning before you train?
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.920]   I've been doing it. I go through these phases, but I, I have that. And so the extent of added
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.800]   sugar in my diet is that tablespoon of, of maple syrup. So I, you know, I do agree with you. 50
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.600]   grams could, could be a little bit up there. Uh, listen, I'm, I'm not here to judge. I, like I said,
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:42.160]   if I had a sweet tooth, I, it's interesting. I used to have one. I lost it over the course of about a
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.640]   decade. I used to love like sour patch gummies and gummies. And I love gummy. I love fruity tastes
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.400]   and that kind of thing. I lost it by doing something that probably has no scientific basis.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.600]   But, uh, I heard years ago that if I took a teaspoon of L-glutamine and put it in high fat
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.440]   in half and half in cream, basically, and took a shot of that twice a day, that it would kill my
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:15.280]   sugar cravings. And I did that and it weaned me off sugar. And then I increased my protein intake.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.840]   So it could have been any combination of things or it could be total placebo. I mean, so I, I want
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:27.360]   to acknowledge that. Um, although I've recommended this to some self-professed sugar addicts. Okay. And
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.640]   they're like, yeah, it kills the sugar craving, but then they always add the, but I still miss my,
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.880]   you know, whatever. They long for the, the sugary thing. I don't any longer.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:45.200]   This is where I headed off the, the, the sweet stuff. I make protein smoothies and they're just,
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:52.080]   they're artificially sweetened. So it satisfies, um, that, you know, that dessert craving if you will.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:06:00.160]   Well, along the lines of artificial sweeteners, um, why, if you want something sweet, wouldn't you
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.560]   just replace the, the honey with like stevia? Cause it doesn't create the same, um, satiety that,
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:14.160]   that the maple syrup does for you. Oh man. Okay. So maple syrup aside, um, the,
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:20.800]   you get caloric savings, you know, if, if, if your protein powder is artificially sweetened,
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:27.840]   let's say with, with stevia or sucralose or monk fruit or whatever is being used in the product.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:34.800]   Um, you get caloric savings and you just kind of get the, the macro savings if you will as well.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:42.320]   And so protein powders are like, I mean, in my opinion, they're just such a breakthrough because
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.840]   they satisfy the protein requirements or they significantly augment the protein requirements
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:53.200]   and they take care of like essentially having something that, that is the experience of a dessert.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:59.280]   To me anyway, I, I make some really good fruit smoothies. I use frozen fruit, protein powder.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.920]   Um, sometimes I do like a mocha type of smoothie. Sometimes I do like a tropical fruit type of smoothie.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.720]   It's like a milkshake. Yeah, it, it is like a milkshake, right?
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:14.800]   So, let's see.
