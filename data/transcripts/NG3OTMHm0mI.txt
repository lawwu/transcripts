[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Paul's epistle to the Romans, chapter 11, reading verses 16 and 17.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Verses 16 and 17 in the 11th chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   "For if the first fruit be holy, the lump is also holy; and if the root be holy, so are the branches.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou being a wild olive tree, where graft in among them and with them,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   partakest of the root and hatness of the olive tree," and then he goes on with his argument,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   "burst not against the branches."
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   But we are concerned at the moment in considering this whole question which the apostle deals with in these two verses.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   We shall hope to proceed to the argument that he bases upon that later.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Now, last time we looked at the two verses in a more or less technical manner in order to decide and to determine
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   what exactly the apostle is saying, at any rate as far as words are concerned.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   And we found that what he really is dealing with here is the subject of the relationship of the Jews to the Gentiles
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   in the economy of God, and especially with regard to God's plan of redemption.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   He is concerned about their individual positions, and he is concerned about their relationship to one another,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   and as I say, as a whole, to God's great plan and purpose.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   In particular, he is concerned, of course, about the position of the Jews.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   That's the object of the, not only of this particular subsection, but of the whole of chapters 9, 10, and 11 of this great epistle.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   So that is the thing that he really has at the back of his mind, the peculiar relationship of the Jews to God's purpose of salvation,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   but that here, in particular, in terms of their relationship to the Gentiles.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Now, this subject has two great dangers.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   One is to claim too little for the Jews, the other is to claim too much.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   We tend to go, in this matter, as in most others, from one extreme to the other.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   That's why it's so important that we should be clear in our minds as to what the great apostle really is teaching us about this matter.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Now, we've seen that he argues with respect to the Jews in this way, that if the first fruit is holy, the lump is also holy.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   If the first portion of dough baked into a cake is offered to God, that, as it were, sanctifies the whole mass, the whole lump of the dough.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   And he will work out the most important argument with respect to the Jews from that particular picture.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   But then he takes up a second picture, in which he says, "If the root be holy, so are the branches."
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   He's thinking of a tree.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   And as he says, "The root, which was Abraham, is holy," well, there is something of that that passes into the whole tree.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   There is the picture in the 16th verse.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Then he comes to deal with what has actually happened historically, and says, "If some of the branches be broken off,"
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   and "thou," referring to the Gentiles, "being a wild olive tree, were graft in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree."
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   We went into that point that some people say that this is quite wrong horticulturally speaking,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   to which the answer was that the apostle himself says that it is unusual.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   This is the grace of God.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   God is doing something that is contrary to nature, as he puts it in verse 24.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   This is the whole glory of the gospel of salvation.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   It is God's action, it is miraculous, it is supernatural.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   It is above nature in that sense.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Very well. Now there we've dealt with the technicalities, as it were, and the important question before us is this.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   What then does he mean by this olive tree?
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   What is this olive tree to which he refers?
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   This is the most important subject.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   From the standpoint of the future of the Christian church and the future of the Jews as a nation,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   nothing is more important than this.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   And there has been a good deal of discussion inevitably, therefore, with respect to it.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   But I'm going to confine attention to two main views.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   They really come down to two main views as to what is meant by this olive tree.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   The picture is that here is an olive tree.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Certain branches are cut off and cast away, other branches are put in.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   And these others belong to a wild olive tree.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   But what is the olive tree?
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Well now, there are those who say that the olive tree is the Jewish nation.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Abram is the root, the tree is the Jewish nation.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   It's interesting to notice that Haldane belongs to this company.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Haldane says the Jewish nation was God's olive tree, quite specifically.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   This recent commentary, the Tyndale series by Professor F.F. Proust,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   I find difficult to decide exactly which view he takes.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   He puts it like this.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   He says the olive is Israel, the people of God.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   The wild olive tree, the wild olive, is the Gentile world.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   From which I take it that he tends to agree with Haldane that the olive is the children of Israel, the Jewish nation.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   But I'm not certain because he adds this other phrase, the people of God,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   which makes it doubtful in my mind as to which of the positions he really is in.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   But as he does contrast it with the Gentile world,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   I'm assuming that he also, like Haldane, believes that the olive tree is the Jewish nation.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Now then, I want to suggest to you that that is a wrong interpretation,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   and I want to give you the reasons which lead me to say that.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Incidentally, I find myself in agreement with the vast majority of the older commentators,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   like Elvin and Hodge and others, who reject this idea that the olive tree is the Jewish nation.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   What are the reasons? Well, here are some of them.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   If the olive tree is the Jewish nation,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   well then the teaching is beyond any question, it seems to me,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   that Gentile believers in Christ were grafted onto their tree,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   and therefore automatically become Jewish.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   It would mean that the Gentile believers are grafted into the Jewish nation,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   which seems to me sufficient in and of itself to put out that interpretation once and forever.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   You've got to work out the implications of a statement.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   And if the olive tree is the Jewish nation, and we as Gentiles are grafted into that,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   well then we are grafted into the Jewish nation.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   And of course I would argue that the whole of the New Testament is here to tell us that that is not what happens to us.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Very well, there's one reason.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Then there does seem to me to be a contradiction, even in the case of those who seem to espouse that view.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Take for instance Professor Bruce.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   He goes on later to say, "In such an unusual grafting, putting this wild into the good,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   the old stalk, he says, is reinvigorated by the new graft.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   And the new graft in turn, fed by the sap of the olive stalk,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   is able to bear much such fruit as the wild olive could never produce."
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   You see the argument?
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Well now then, if the olive tree itself is the Jewish nation,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   well then what we are told is that the coming in of the Gentiles has reinvigorated the Jewish nation.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   But the Apostle's whole argument is that the Jews as a nation have been cast out.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Far from being reinvigorated by the coming in of the Gentile believers,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   they've gone out that the Gentile believers may come in.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   In other words, it's a blank contradiction of the whole of the argument of the Apostle in this particular section,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   and indeed everywhere else at the same time.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   So there's a second objection.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   But come to a third.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   "Later on we shall find that the Apostle refers to the Jews as a nation, as branches.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Not as the tree, but as the branches."
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   You see, he's got a picture of a tree with branches.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Some branches cut off, other branches put in.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   There is a difference between the tree and the branches.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   And what he says about the Jews as a nation later, is that they are the natural branches.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Not the tree, but the natural branches.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   That again, it seems to me, is the most important and vital argument
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   against this identification of the olive tree with the Jewish nation.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   And then, lastly, these all follow one from another.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   He says that we as Gentile believers have been grafted in,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   and with them partake of the root and fatness of the olive tree.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   But the Jewish nation is not the root and fatness of which we receive.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Not in any sense at all.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   The Jewish nation is something that has stumbled,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   that has failed and has been cast out for that reason.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   So we receive no nutriment from the Jewish nation.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   The Jewish nation obviously therefore cannot be described as the root and the fatness.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   And so, I conclude in the fifth place,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   that this is an entirely wrong interpretation of the meaning of the olive tree
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   for this further reason.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   That the remainder of the argument doesn't fit in with that exposition at all.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   So we must of necessity seek a different one.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Now, how has this confusion arisen?
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Well, it seems to me that what we are up against at this point
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   is the difficulty with any analogy whatsoever.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   It is almost impossible to get an analogy, an illustration,
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   which rarely does convey perfectly the meaning that you want to convey.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   So, what the apostle has to do, like every preacher has to do,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   is he has to take on one aspect of an analogy.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   You see, the danger is in reading this, to look at it like this.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Now, here are two olive trees.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Here is a good one and here is a wild one.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   And then you proceed from that.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   And then you must say that, well of course,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   this is the contrast between the Jewish nation and the Gentiles.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   And so, you fall into that particular error.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   But that isn't what the apostle is saying at all.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   His meaning, it seems to me, is quite clear,
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   as long as we don't mechanically apply all the details of the illustration.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Very well then, that leads us to this question.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   What then, do I suggest, is the olive tree?
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   And my answer is, the olive tree means the people of God.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   The people of God.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Now, they are given many names.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   They are called the covenant people.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   They are called the redeemed.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   They are called God's nation.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   They are called the Israel of God,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   in chapter 6 of the epistle to the Galatians.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   But this is the best term, it seems to me,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   is to call them the people of God.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   God's redeemed people.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Now, there is the fundamental thing.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Let's work it out together.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   The key to the understanding of the olive tree, as I see it,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   is really given to us in the ninth chapter of this epistle,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   in that famous sixth verse.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   I remember saying many times over,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   that that sixth verse in the ninth chapter is the most important verse.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   It's the key to the understanding, really, of the whole of these three chapters.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Why? Well, now here's the answer.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   They are not all Israel which are of Israel.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   That's the thing.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   That's the key to the solution.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   In other words, as we were reminded there in the ninth chapter,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   and as indeed the whole of the Bible in a sense reminds us,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   two nations came out of Abraham.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Abraham as the father, Abraham as the root.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Abraham leads to two nations.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   One of them is a natural nation and people.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   The other is a spiritual nation and people.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   You remember that he goes on there in the ninth chapter to say,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   "Neither because they are of the seed of Abraham are they all children,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   but in Isaac shall thy seed be called."
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Ishmael was a child of Abraham, as Isaac was.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   And yet, you see, there is this vital difference.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   It is this spiritual seed.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   That is, they which are the children of the flesh,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   these are not the children of God.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   These are not God's people.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   But the children of the promise accounted for the seed.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   These are the people all along.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   And you remember how he went on working out that analogy and illustration.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   You get it in exactly the same way in the children of Isaac,
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   in Jacob and Esau.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Both are natural children, but only Jacob is the spiritual child.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   He therefore constitutes the seed.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Now, the whole difficulty arises when people forget that vital distinction.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   It is very easy to slip into this trouble because, after all,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   they all do come out of Abraham.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   And promises were made to Abraham,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   some of which were purely material, others purely spiritual.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   But there are points at which they coalesce and they seem to be one.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Hence the confusion.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   That, of course, was the ultimate reason why the Jews rejected our Lord and Saviour.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   And that is why they have continued in trouble.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   And that is why many people today, concerned about these prophetic questions,
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   get into equal trouble.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   They forget this vital distinction between the two nations, if you like,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   that came out of Abraham.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   And the fact, which complicates it still more,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   that at certain points they are both one.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Very well. Now there is the key to the understanding.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Now, I am putting it to you that the olive tree here
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   is nothing but the spiritual nation.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   That is what I mean by the people of God.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Not the natural nation, but the spiritual nation that came out of Abraham.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   These two, as I say, are related, and yet it is vital that we should realize that they are separate.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Now, in Abraham, of course, they were one.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   He is the father of both, the natural and the spiritual.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   The material, if you like, nation, and that which is purely spiritual.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   And in general, this is true also of all the descendants of Isaac.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   In Isaac again they are one. In Jacob again they are one.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   But you notice that in every one of these instances there is also a division.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   One of the sons of Isaac is natural only.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   The other one is spiritual. Spiritual and natural.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   And so it goes on as you follow out the working of this principle.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   You remember that Jacob was actually called Israel himself.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   And it is through his twelve sons that you really see the nation of Israel as it were fully grown.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   And you are able to look at this developed nation.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Now, the nation of Israel in general is regarded in the Old Testament as God's people.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   In that sense, they were the church at that time.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Or, as Paul puts it here, they were certainly the natural branches in this olive tree.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   They were the first to appear. They were the first on it.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   And so you often find them addressed as such.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   God addresses the whole of the nation of Israel as his people.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   You remember how in the book of Exodus, in connection with the giving of the law,
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   you have this great example of this at the beginning of the nineteenth chapter,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   where God addresses the whole nation.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   He turns to them and he reminds them that he is their God.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   And he makes certain promises to them.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   "You have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bear you on eagles' wings," and so on.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   "And if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people, for all the earth is mine."
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   And so God addresses them as his people and as his nation, and makes certain promises to them.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   You will find that he speaks to them in the same way in many other places.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   There's an example in Deuteronomy chapter 7 and verse 6.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   And you remember how Stephen, in his great address, recorded in the seventh chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   refers to the nation of Israel in general as "the church in the wilderness."
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   The church in the wilderness.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   So you are entitled therefore to look upon the children of Israel as if they were the church under the old dispensation.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   God is there as if we're looking at the whole nation as his people.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   But you must never forget that distinction which is drawn there in verse 6 of the ninth chapter.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   They are all of Israel, but they're not all Israel.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   There is this general view, there is this particular view.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   Very well then, the olive tree, the true people of God, are those to whom the apostle is really referring.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   There are others who belong to it or who seem to belong to it for a while, but they don't really belong to it.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   The olive tree constitutes only these true spiritual people of God.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   With them you always have these others.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   And at times you can't tell the difference between them, but all is known unto God.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   The Lord knoweth them that are his.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   But here there is this essential distinction.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Now then, what is the apostle's teaching then?
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Well, we can put it like this.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   The unbelieving Jews, though they are Abraham's seed,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   and though in a sense they are the natural branches upon this olive tree,
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   because it was all one in Abraham, and because they seem to grow together,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   because of their unbelief, they are cut off, and they don't really belong to the olive tree.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Now that is my justification for rejecting the first suggestion that the olive tree is the nation of Israel,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   and insisting rather that it is the people of God.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   These others appear to belong to the people of God, but they don't belong to the people of God.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   They are not all Israel, they are of Israel.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   They are, as it were, natural branches, but they are cut off, thrown away,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   just to show that they really have never truly belonged to this olive tree, this spiritual people of God.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   And that is what the apostle is saying here.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   That the unbelieving Jews were cast off at this time because of their unbelief.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   They no longer belong to the olive tree in any sense.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   But on the other hand, he says, the believing Gentiles are grafted in.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   They have come from the outside, they didn't belong to the nation of Israel,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   and therefore in a sense you can call them a wild olive tree.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   The only point of importance is that they don't belong to the visible nation of Israel.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   They are right outside, they are Gentiles.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   But, says the apostle, because you have believed, you have been brought in and you have been grafted in.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   You haven't been grafted into the Jewish nation, but you have been grafted into the people of God.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   Now that's the point.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   And that is why I say we must insist upon saying that the olive tree is the people of God.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   Now, the apostle tells us in many places, that when the Gentiles believe in the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   they are not only grafted into this olive tree, into the people of God,
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   but because of that they become Abraham's children.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   And they begin to share in all the blessings of this covenant people of God,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   that trace their origin and their beginning and their root back to our father Abraham.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   You remember the particularly clear statement of this, which is to be found in the epistle to the Galatians,
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   and in chapter 3, you remember that last verse which puts it like this.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   "And if you be Christ's, then are you Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise."
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   He is writing to Gentiles.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   And Gentile believers are not only Christ's, they are Abraham's seed.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   They are in this olive tree, this covenant people of God that come out of Abraham.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   And they are in that, they are grafted into that, so they become Abraham's seed.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   They are children of Abraham and heirs according to the promise.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Now there, as I would suggest to you, is the true explanation of what is meant by this olive tree.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   And you can see the importance of putting it like this and of rejecting the idea that it means the nation of Israel.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   But now having put that to you as an exposition, let us go on to draw the conclusions, or the lessons, if you like,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   the doctrinal lessons and conclusions that arise inevitably from all this.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   And they are most important.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   And I will divide them into two sections.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   First of all, certain conclusions about the Christian church.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   These come first, it seems to me.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   The apostle is dealing here with the Christian church and the relationship of Jew and Gentile to the church and to one another in the church.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   We'll start with that and the second lesson will be about the Jews in particular in this whole matter.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Those are the two main subjects.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   Now there are some very important things to be learned here about the Christian church.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Here is the first.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   The Christian church is not something entirely new.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Now many people make that false statement.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   They say the church is something absolutely new.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   There was no such thing at all until you come to the New Testament times.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   And then you get an entirely new beginning.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Something entirely new comes into being, the Christian church.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   The church, rather, I shouldn't say Christian church to make it clear.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   The church comes then into being.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   Now here I think we are shown very plainly and very clearly that that is quite wrong.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   It is quite an error to teach that.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   The peculiarly and specifically Christian church came into being then.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   But we mustn't say that the church came into being then.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   I have already quoted you Stephen's statement in which he refers to the church in the wilderness,
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   the children of Israel.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   We must get hold of this idea of the people of God.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   That's the fundamental thing in the Bible.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   The people of God, under the old dispensation, mainly, almost exclusively, the children of Israel.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   New Testament, almost exclusively Gentiles with but a few Jews.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   This remnant, according to the election of grace, about which the apostle has been speaking.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   But, the thing is, that the church is not something new, which only starts in the New Testament.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   There is a fundamental error.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   But let's go on and see how this works out.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   Secondly, I would say, therefore, that God's people are always one.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   They are one in the Old Testament and in the New Testament.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   The apostle proves that very clearly by this analogy of the olive tree.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   The olive tree didn't come into being in the New Testament.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   The olive tree has been there since Abraham.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   He is the root.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   The lump we saw were the patriarchs.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   So it's been going since then.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   You mustn't say that the people of God, the redeemed, start after Calvary or after our Lord's ascension or after Pentecost.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   You mustn't say that.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   The people of God are in the Old Testament as well as in the New.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   It's the whole point of this illustration.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   The apostle's entire argument is going to depend upon this great statement.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   It all goes back to Abraham.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   So you've got God's people in the Old Testament, God's people in the New Testament,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   and God's people are always one.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   They're always in this olive tree.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   There's only one olive tree.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   It's the same one always.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   The tree is always one.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   Some branches go off, some branches come in, but the tree remains one.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   And there is only one.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   So the Church, God's people, is one, always, Old Testament as well as New Testament.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   Now, there are certain differences.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   But they're not fundamental differences.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   There are differences in the degree of understanding.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   There are differences in the degree of blessing.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   There are many particular differences.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   But we mustn't allow these detailed differences in form to send us into the error of saying
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   that you finish with one thing in the Old Testament, start with something absolutely new in the New.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   Now, this has often troubled the Christian Church.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   Quite early on, there was a heresy which was guilty of this and which rejected the whole of the Old Testament.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   And there are many people today who tend to do that.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   One sometimes hears even evangelical Christians as if they're more or less dismissing the Old Testament.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   They don't see why we need it any longer and so on.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   They've never seen the continuity of the people of God,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   and that the people of God are one in the Old Testament and in the New Testament.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   But this is a vital part of the teaching here.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   It's the whole thing the apostles say.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   We've misunderstood the olive tree completely unless we are clear about that.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   Then I go on to say this.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   There is only one way of salvation, and it's always been the same one.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   Now, we've seen that at great length in this epistle.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   The apostle proves that in chapter 4.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   He says, "Your father Abraham was saved by faith."
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   There has never been a way of salvation except that by faith. Never.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   And here, of course, he puts it in the picture of the olive tree.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   It is only our relationship to this that saves us.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   It doesn't matter who we are.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   It is always by faith.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   It is always by supernatural action.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   It is God's supernatural action.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   What saves anybody is to be put into the olive tree.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Nothing else can save at all.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   What saves us is that we are brought into relationship with the root and fatness of this olive tree.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   This is eternal life, if you like.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   This is the life that God gives, and he gave it in the Old Testament as well as in the New.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Abraham, remember, is our father.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   We are the children of Abraham.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   Abraham was saved as much as we are.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   Now, people don't realize this.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   They think these Old Testament saints were not saved, but they were.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   They were in the kingdom.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   They are the children of God as much as we are.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   And we are the children of Abraham because we are the children of faith.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   They received of the root and fatness of the olive, and that is precisely what we receive.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   We are only Christians and we are only saved because we are born again,
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   because we have all the results of being born again.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   We have this life, this root and fatness of the olive tree.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   That is the only thing that saves.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   It is saved in the Old Testament.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   It saves in the New.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   It always will save.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Now, you know there are people who say that in some future time, the Jews are going to be saved by keeping the law.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   That is an absolute denial of this picture.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   There is only one way of salvation.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   There is only one olive tree, and it is being in this that saves and nothing else.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   It has always been God's only way of salvation.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   So, our fourth lesson is this one.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   That nationality and natural birth is in no sense the deciding factor.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   There is only one deciding factor, and that is our faith relationship to Abraham.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   In this olive tree, you may be a Jew by nature, you may be a Gentile by nature.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   It does not matter.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Now, that is the whole point that he is making here.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   The Jews tended to say that they alone were saved.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   The Gentiles, as the apostle is going on to tell them here, were in danger of saying, "We alone are saved."
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   They were bursting themselves as over against the Jews.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   They are both wrong.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Nationality does not come into it at all.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   There is neither Jew nor Gentile, barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free, male nor female.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   It does not matter at all.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   The only thing that does matter is, are you engrafted into this olive tree or are you not?
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   So, you see, he cuts the ground from people who tend to rely upon their nationality or their natural birth
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   or any of these things that are true of us by nature.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   That is all here. It is all brought out in this wonderful picture of the olive tree.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   It is the whole point that the apostle is arguing.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   And then I make my fifth point, and it follows, which is this.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   The blessings which all who belong to the olive tree are always the same blessings.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   That follows, does not it?
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   Root and fatness of the olive tree.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   That is what it all comes from.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   It rises there in the sap.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   There comes the life, the nutrient.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   Well, it is always the same.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   It was the same at the very beginning.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   It is the same now.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   It is the same for the natural branches.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   It is the same for these other branches that are grafted in contrary to nature.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   It is all the same.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   They receive exactly the same blessings.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   Now, this is, of course, the great point that is made by the apostle in that section of Scripture
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   which we read at the beginning, out of the epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   And it is astonishing how people seem to miss this most wonderful teaching
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   which the apostle gives not only here in Ephesians,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   but in the statement I have already quoted at the end of the third chapter of Galatians,
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   and which is, of course, a vital part of his whole teaching
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   about God's grand purpose of redemption in history.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   You see, what he says is this.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   Here he is writing to these Gentile Ephesians.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   He says, "Remember that you in time past were Gentiles in the flesh.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   You were called on circumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hens.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   But remember," he says, "at that time you were without Christ, outside Christ."
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   Well, what was true of them as such?
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Well, he says, "You were then aliens from the commonwealth of Israel,
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   and you were strangers from the covenants of promise.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   You had no hope, and you were without God in the world."
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   He said, "You as Gentiles, you have nothing to do with God's commonwealth."
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   There is another term, "God's people," "God's commonwealth."
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   "And you were strangers from all the covenants of promise that God had made with his covenant people.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   You had nothing to do with these. You were outsiders."
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   But immediately he adds, "But now, in Christ Jesus,
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   you who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ."
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   In what sense are they made nigh?
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   In the next verses he goes on to show how they have been made nigh by our Lord's work upon the cross,
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   where he has broken down the middle wall of partition and has reconciled them by the blood of his cross
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   and has made of twain one new man, has preached peace to you that were afar off
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   and to them that were nigh, to Gentiles and to Jews.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   Now then, he says in the 19th verse,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   "You, because you have become believers, are no more strangers and foreigners,
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   but fellow citizens with the saints and are of the household of God."
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   "You were," he says, "aliens from the commonwealth of Israel.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   You were strangers from the covenant of promise. You are no longer that.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   You are no longer strangers and foreigners."
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   Well, what are they? Well, they have become fellow citizens.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   They are of the household of God.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   In other words, it's another way of saying, "You were outside the olive tree,
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   but now you're inside the olive tree."
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Before, all these wonderful covenant promises had nothing to do with you.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   They have now got everything to do with you.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   You're inside. You belong to the olive tree.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   And now, therefore, you are heirs of the promises.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   You are heirs of all the blessings of salvation that God has promised to his covenant people.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   Then you see in the third chapter of Ephesians,
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   he goes on to explain this a little bit more in detail.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   He says, "I am, Paul, the prisoner of the Lord for you Gentiles."
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   He says, "You've heard about this dispensation of the grace of God
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   which has been given to me for you.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery,
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men,
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit."
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   By which he means, not that this was entirely unknown in the old dispensation,
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   because that isn't true.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   You have those wonderful prophecies of Isaiah and others
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   who see the Gentiles coming in, but it wasn't understood clearly.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   It hadn't been revealed in its fullness, as it has now been revealed, he says,
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   What is this mystery? Here it is.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   "That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel."
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   Could anything be clearer? Fellow heirs of the same body,
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   yes, in the same tree, the same olive tree.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   This is the way in which the blessings of salvation to Christian people are described.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   They're the old blessings promised to Abraham,
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   repeated so many times to David and to others.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   All that God has promised to his people, to the redeemed people,
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   these are the things that matter.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   And what is true of us as Christians, therefore,
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   is that we are now brought into the realm of these ancient promises.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   As I say, this isn't something absolutely new.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   What's happened to us is that we are allowed to share
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   in what had been received and experienced by the people of God
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   through the centuries of the Old Testament dispensation.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   That's how we are described in the New Testament.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   We mustn't cut this absolute division between Old Testament and New.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   No, no, it's the form that has changed.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   It's no longer one nation, it's now many nations, it's now the Church.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   But essentially it is exactly the same thing.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   And all the blessings that we enjoy are those blessings
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   which had been promised to Abraham, seed of old,
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   which until this point only the Jews had received,
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   but now the Gentiles also are made fellow heirs,
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   brought into the same position, put into the same tree,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   members of the one and the same body.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   Now that is the teaching of the Bible with regard to the relationship
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   of Jew and Gentile in the Christian Church.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   And it is on the basis of this that the apostle will be able to work out
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   the argument in the rest of this chapter.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   But let me just deal with this second great lesson,
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   the second conclusion which I mentioned just now about the Jews.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   Now, while all that I've been saying is true
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   and the teaching of the New Testament,
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   and while it is true to go on repeating that it doesn't matter
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   whether you're a Jew or a Gentile, in the matter of salvation,
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   the only thing that matters is faith, belief in the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   being related to this olive tree, the people of God,
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   receiving the life divine. Right? All that is absolutely true.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   But at the same time, the apostle is concerned to teach how
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   that the Jews, speaking in a national sense,
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   and of an earthly people,
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   the apostle is concerned to say that there is something special
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   and unique about their position.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   Now, we mustn't lose sight of this.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   As I've been pointing out, the danger is to make either too much or too little
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   of the position of the Jews.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   I'm now dealing with the danger of making too little of it.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   The Jews make too much of it, the Gentile danger is to make too little of it.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   Now, the apostle says that we must be clear, therefore,
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   that there is something special, after all,
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   about the relationship of the Jews, speaking of them as a whole, as a nation,
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   to this whole purpose of God with respect to his people.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   What is it? Well, it seems to me that we can tabulate these again like this.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   First, the Jews have a special position in this matter,
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   because, after all, they were the first of the natural branches.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   At first, the olive tree consisted of them and of them alone,
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   Abram and his own natural progeny.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   The Gentiles were right outside.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   The first branches, after all, in this olive tree were entirely and solely Jews.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   But, I hasten to add, in the second place,
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   they are in that special position, not inherently,
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   but because of God's choice of them, and his promises to them,
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   and because of what he has done in them and through them.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   Now, the apostle's way of putting that we have already seen in the ninth chapter,
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   and in verses four and five.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   Why does he have this continual heaviness and sorrow in his heart with regard to his kinsmen?
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   He says it is for this reason.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   They are Israelites, to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises,
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   whose are the fathers, and of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came,
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   who is over all God blessed forever.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   So, I say they have a special position,
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   not because there is something inherently good or exceptional about them.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   God didn't choose them because they were better than anybody else.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   He tells them that repeatedly in the Old Testament.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   But they are in a special position because God did choose them.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   They were the first that he chose,
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   and he chose them in general as the natural progeny and seed of Abraham.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   So, I come to the third lesson, which is this one,
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   that while I say they have a special position,
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   we must assert equally strongly that they haven't got a separate position,
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   special but not separate.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   Let me expound that.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   The Jews are only branches in the olive tree, exactly like the Gentiles.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   They are no more.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   They are only branches.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   They are no more branches than the Gentiles, nor no less.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   They are just branches.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   They belong to the same olive tree as the Gentiles,
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   but they are not the olive tree itself.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   They do not have and shall not have a separate or a different
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   or a special salvation or position in God's kingdom.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   This notion that the Jews in some future age
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   are going to come back and have some special position,
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   some carrying it even to the ridiculous extreme of saying
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   that the Jewish portion of the church will remain always on earth,
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   the Gentiles will be in heaven,
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   it's a blank contradiction of this teaching.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   I hope to elaborate this later as we go on with the apostles' argument.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   They are not going to have a separate position.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   All that is going to happen to them is that they are going to be grafted in again.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   They shall be grafted into this same olive tree that contains the Gentiles.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   Nothing more is going to happen to them.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   There is a great promise here, this is the apostles' argument,
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   that in a national sense they are going to be converted.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   Yes, but they will be converted like everybody else,
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   and they will be grafted into the same olive tree as Gentiles
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   and all others who are believers.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   And they will come in not because there is something inherently different
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   and exceptional about them, but simply because of the grace of God.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   The apostles' argument is that the grace which, contrary to nature, has put us in,
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   can surely put them in also.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   But nobody else can put them in.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   God can, and he says that God is going to do so.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   But the point I am emphasizing is this,
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   that when they are converted and come in,
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   they will come into the one olive tree.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   They will only come in as branches, like other branches.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   The only special thing about them is that they are going to be brought in
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   like that in a national sense.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   That is the only special thing about them.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   That is special, and the apostle will give us the reasons as to why even that is the case.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   But we must not drive this point of being special to the point of being separate.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   No, no, there is only one olive tree, and all the branches are the same,
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   because they are all a faith.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   He will work this out both positively and negatively.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   In other words, there are no two churches, there never will be two churches.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   There will never even be two divisions in the Christian church.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   The Christian church is one and one only.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   And as regards the church and our eternal destiny,
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   it does not matter at all whether we are Jews or whether we are Gentiles.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   I do trust this is clear.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   The thing to hold on to is that the olive tree is this people of God.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   That is the thing that matters, not nationality.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   The only place where nationality comes in is this,
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   that because the Jews were alone and exclusively the first branches of this olive tree,
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   they have this special regard in the sight of God,
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   and he will graft them in again.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   No more.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   They will not be superior to Gentile Christians, they will not even be different.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   All Christians will be the same.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   There is neither Jew nor Gentile, barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   The only thing that is different is that because of this peculiar relationship
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   as the first of the natural branches, they are going to be grafted in again.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   But remember that as regards the grafting,
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   there is no difference between their being grafted in and the Gentiles being grafted in.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   It takes the same grace of God to convert a Jew as a Gentile and a Gentile as a Jew,
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   and they will share the same blessings.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   They are all joint heirs of exactly the same promises and all the same blessed hopes.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   Well, there it seems to me is the meaning of this olive tree,
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   this picture that the Apostle puts before us here in this 17th chapter of this 11th,
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   17th verse of the 11th chapter of the mighty epistle to the Romans.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   Now then, having said that, he is in a position to address a certain appeal to the Gentiles,
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   and I trust that next week, God willing,
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   we shall see how it all now works out quite inevitably from this fundamental position.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   Let us pray.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   O Lord our God, we again thank Thee for the mystery and the marvel of Thy grace.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   O Lord, how can we as Gentiles thank Thee sufficiently
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   that Thou hast ever grafted us into this olive tree?
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   We thank Thee equally, O God, that Thou art going to deal with those first natural branches
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   that Thou hast cut off, that Thou wilt graft them in again.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   We thank Thee, O Lord, for the purposes of Thy grace and for the glory of Thy plan of redemption.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   O God, we pray Thee to increase our understanding.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   Help us to realize tonight, as we have never done before, that we are what we are by Thy grace.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   Thou hast done something contrary to nature to us to bring us into such a position.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   We thank Thee for the root and fatness of this blessed olive tree.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   We thank Thee that we belong to the household of God,
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   that we are Thy children, that we are fellow citizens with all the saints of all the centuries.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   We thank Thee that we have one blessed hope to which we look forward together.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   O God, we do indeed rejoice in our position as being among Thy people,
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   the covenant people of God.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   O Lord, grant that we may so realize it, that we shall ever be filled with a sense of wonder and of love and of praise.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   Hear us, O Lord, and grant us Thy blessing as we part from one another this night.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   And now, may the grace of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   and the love of God, and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit,
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   abide and continue with us now this night,
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   throughout the remainder of this hour short and certain,
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   earthly life and pilgrimage and evermore. Amen.
