[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:13.360]   - Hi, welcome back to another episode of Curious Mike.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.520]   I'm here with my friend Kat.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.960]   Really excited to have you on.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.320]   You know, this topic is something that I believe
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.200]   needs to be kind of like spoke about more,
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.600]   brought into the light a little bit more.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.700]   So I appreciate your bravery like in everything
[00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.680]   and sharing your story and being vulnerable.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.220]   So why don't we start like early childhood,
[00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.380]   like what was your first memories growing up?
[00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.020]   How was your childhood and all that?
[00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.820]   - My childhood was kind of spotty.
[00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.580]   My memories are a little spotty back then.
[00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.580]   My dad wasn't around much.
[00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.100]   So I think that's sort of what led me
[00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.620]   to what we're going to speak about.
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.060]   I was super emotional as a kid, very needy for affection.
[00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.020]   And my mom had went through like domestic violence situation
[00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.840]   while I was growing up.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.680]   I was like a baby.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.420]   My sister was a little older.
[00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.520]   My dad used to like abuse my mom and hit her.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.340]   And my mom had a daughter after my older sister.
[00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.860]   So my sister, Mary Kay, was a little bit older than me.
[00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.780]   My mom was pregnant with me when she passed away,
[00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.140]   which made my mom decide to finally leave my dad
[00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.780]   because he wasn't like supportive.
[00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.020]   And she was dealing with domestic violence.
[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.460]   So after that happened.
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.380]   - What age were you around this time?
[00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.060]   - My mom was pregnant with me.
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.900]   - Oh, around this time with her?
[00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.220]   - When she passed, yeah.
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.060]   So that's why everyone says I'm super emotional
[00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.320]   because my mom was so sad, her whole pregnancy.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.560]   But yeah, she passed and my mom left.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.180]   And then she was a single mom for a while.
[00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.080]   She got remarried a couple of times.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.300]   It just, it was a little inconsistent.
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.420]   We moved a lot.
[00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.980]   We didn't stay in one place for a long time.
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.060]   And she sent me to live with my aunt and uncle
[00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.740]   once or twice.
[00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.660]   And because they had like a nuclear family,
[00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.860]   like a traditional mom, dad.
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.620]   They were more well off than we were.
[00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.220]   So I had experiences there.
[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.420]   And then they told me that I had to go back to my mom's
[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.860]   because my cousin got pregnant at 15.
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.380]   So I went back to my mom's
[00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.500]   and that's kind of where everything started.
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.260]   - And you went back there around what age?
[00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.420]   What age is this?
[00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.900]   - 13, 14. - Around 13?
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.900]   - Yeah. - Gotcha.
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.960]   - Yeah.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.240]   So yeah, I moved back with my mom
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.700]   and she worked all the time.
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.140]   She was never home.
[00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.980]   So I wasn't getting the emotional support
[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.660]   that I needed at that age.
[00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.060]   Like I very much needed guidance
[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.780]   and she didn't have a choice but to work, obviously.
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.980]   So that's when everything kind of went left.
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.220]   - So, okay.
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.920]   So you said you were around 13 or so.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.620]   You know, mom's working and you're kind of independent
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.100]   at a very young age for the most part.
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.540]   - Yeah.
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.420]   - So like when was the first time
[00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.420]   you got approached by a man inappropriately?
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.340]   - I was young.
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.380]   I was like, that was up with my aunt and uncle.
[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.380]   It started happening. - Back in the day.
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.700]   - Like 11, 12.
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.220]   - So this is just something that like all of childhood
[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.900]   you were kind of exposed to a little bit.
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.300]   - Yeah, it was kind of like,
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.140]   I remember like construction workers
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.500]   like hitting on me and my friends
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.740]   when we were like 11.
[00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:19.900]   - Just 'cause you guys were,
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.740]   had so much freedom. - We were just out.
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.780]   - We were just out doing your thing.
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.620]   - Yeah, wearing shorts and like a tank top
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.460]   in the summertime.
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.400]   And it was very sexualized from a very young age.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.060]   I don't know if it's just where I'm from.
[00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.180]   Like, I don't know if it's like small town syndrome
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.660]   but it was crazy.
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.580]   So I think, and then not having a dad.
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.300]   - Right, just for the protection
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.940]   or brothers for their protection.
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.900]   - Yeah, like I just wanted acceptance, I think.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.740]   - Yeah.
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.460]   - So I started like running away from home
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.920]   because my mom wasn't around
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.260]   and she wouldn't listen to what I needed.
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.860]   So I started running away,
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.540]   like first started running away to Southwest Detroit
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.060]   with like friends that I'd met in school
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.820]   and skipped school all the time.
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.460]   And eventually ended up moving from Southwest Detroit
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.980]   out to the West side.
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:05.980]   - With your mom?
[00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.140]   - No, just running away.
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.980]   - Oh wow.
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.180]   - Like I would just hop on a bus
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.660]   and go into the city by myself.
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.540]   - And your mom, is she reaching out?
[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.840]   - She had no idea cause she was at work all the time.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.680]   - That's crazy.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.320]   Okay, so you're doing that,
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.160]   you're running away from home and things like that.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.000]   So now kind of you're in your teenage years,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.600]   get into kind of the whole story about everything.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.280]   - Yeah, running away to the West side,
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.760]   I suck out like a sore thumb.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.840]   So I made a friend there,
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.440]   me and her ended up like becoming friends
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.760]   and just like hanging out with people in the neighborhood.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.400]   I stayed with her and her boyfriend at the time.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.420]   And I thought it was just like, I'm free,
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.700]   like I have what I can do whatever I want.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.680]   Like I thought it was cool.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.620]   And in the neighborhood,
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.860]   like I think I started to see like the darkness.
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.220]   Like we would walk down the street
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.140]   and like guys would try to holler at us.
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.780]   And if we like didn't respond positively,
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.660]   they would squirt you with like pee.
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.940]   Like they would fill squirt guns with urine and spray you.
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.300]   - I heard that on one of your podcasts
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.440]   I was just thinking to myself, where does that happen?
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.720]   Like I've never, you said Southwest Detroit, right?
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.920]   - No, this was on the West side.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.000]   - West side, like I've never heard of that.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.480]   Guys just having water guns with pee.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.040]   - Premeditated, I don't know.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.080]   They're just trying to cause trouble, I guess.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.540]   But yeah, so that was like, okay,
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.320]   this isn't just like fun and games.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.480]   Like it's actually not okay.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.440]   And I went to Coney Island to get like chili cheese fries
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.560]   'cause they knew me and like, if I couldn't pay,
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.080]   they would just like hook me up anyway.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.080]   And this guy walks in and he introduces himself,
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.760]   buys my, pays for my food.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.400]   And he was like, I have somewhere you can stay.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.440]   You can come, you know, it's cool.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.720]   Like I'll take care of you.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.320]   And I'm like, okay, because I had no idea.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.520]   It was like a thing.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.240]   I didn't know it existed.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.280]   I didn't know like pimps were a thing.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.200]   - Random guy walks in the restaurant,
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.960]   random guy walks in and just pays for your food.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.000]   - I had known somebody was looking for me for a while
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.200]   because like I made friends with the guys
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.560]   in the neighborhood, but like they weren't really my friends.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.320]   They were just like scouting for him, I think.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.040]   And they were like, oh, James is looking for you.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.320]   Like he's like, you know, next time you come around.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.480]   Like, so I think they were just telling him
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.760]   where I was essentially.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.460]   So yeah, he ended up picking me up.
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.000]   I went to the house with him in Brightmoor and I walk in
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.520]   and there's like a bunch of girls my age that looks like me.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.800]   And I don't know, it was just like, what is going on?
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.560]   - Was it like, as soon as you walked in there,
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.920]   where you did your like alarm go off in your head
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.520]   or were you just kind of like, you had no idea?
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.360]   - No.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.200]   - You're just kind of naive to everything.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.680]   - Very naive, unfortunately.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.700]   So like the girls were really welcoming and nice
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.400]   and there was no like warnings.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.240]   There was no like bad feeling.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.160]   He didn't give me any bad vibes at all.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.760]   So I think when that part revealed itself,
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.800]   I was like shocked because I wasn't expecting it.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.840]   Like I thought this person just wanted to help.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.000]   But again, I'm naive.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.460]   I wasn't raised in like a bad neighborhood.
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.580]   I wasn't raised around people
[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.000]   that I needed to like figure out.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.840]   So things kind of like were cool for a couple of weeks.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.360]   He took me shopping, bought me clothes,
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.680]   like took me to get my tongue pierced.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.680]   Like I was doing all these things and I was just like,
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.220]   oh, this is so fun.
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.020]   Not realizing like that was a debt I was accruing.
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:44.180]   So that, like when I finally like saw him,
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.200]   like the real him, we were, I was going up,
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.380]   there's like an attic space.
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.220]   I was like going up there and he stopped me on the stairs
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.300]   and pushed me down on my back and was like,
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.300]   oh, I have to test you out before you start working.
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.620]   Like you have to pay off all the stuff that I got you.
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.540]   And I was like, what, what do you mean?
[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.180]   Like I have to pay it back.
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.580]   Like I'll give it back to you.
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.460]   Like I didn't realize that's not how it works.
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.380]   You can't just be like, here, take your clothes back.
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.680]   I'm gonna go home.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.660]   - Yeah.
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.900]   So that was the first time you saw him switch.
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.340]   - Like completely switch, yeah.
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.300]   Different person.
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.760]   Like the first time I saw in a man's eyes
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.500]   that he wasn't there.
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.340]   - Right.
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.600]   - Like it's like blink.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.020]   So it was like, if you're like crying
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.620]   and you're like begging them to not do
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.420]   what they're gonna do, like they don't hear you
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:33.580]   because they're just.
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.260]   - And how many months into the situation living with him?
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.380]   - It was a couple of weeks.
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.060]   - Okay, so he was nice those couple of weeks
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.700]   buying you things and then that first situation happens.
[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:43.540]   - Yep.
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:47.940]   And then, yeah, he sexually assaulted me on the stairs
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.240]   and I didn't fight back.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.580]   I was quiet because you're kind of like in shock.
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.860]   And I found out he had done that to all the girls.
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.180]   Like all the girls he would rotate.
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.180]   Later I figured that out.
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.460]   But like his son was around, he was like three or four.
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.820]   His baby mama was around.
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.340]   So she knew what was going on
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.580]   but nobody warned me or warned anyone.
[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.620]   So it was crazy.
[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.540]   - So these girls are living with you for two weeks
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.780]   and they never said a word about it.
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.180]   I wonder, did they feel like they were indebted to him
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.540]   or were they just scared or what are you thinking?
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.420]   - Probably scared.
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:28.340]   And some of them I think like kind of like accepted
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.900]   this was their life.
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:31.740]   - Just what they had gotten into.
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.060]   - So they were like making the most of it.
[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:34.900]   - Right.
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.860]   - Like we would goof off and like hang out
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.940]   and drink and smoke and like,
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.180]   it was just like our new normal, you know?
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.140]   - And how long did this kind of thing go on
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.220]   just in the house with him?
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.980]   - In the house, not long.
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:49.820]   - Okay.
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.460]   - So once he like kind of made that clear,
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.900]   he would start taking me with him, like out.
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.800]   So there was him and this other guy with dreads.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.220]   I don't remember his name.
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.580]   But he drove like a Bronco.
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.900]   I specifically remember the Bronco.
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.900]   And they would take us like outside of the city.
[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.980]   So we would do like in-calls with like people in suburbs,
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.400]   like my neighborhood.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.540]   We went to like neighborhoods right around my neighborhood
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.620]   where my mom was.
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.340]   And they would just send us in the house.
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.620]   Nobody would be with you.
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.880]   You'd go in like 13, 14 year old girls.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.180]   There'd be a guy there waiting.
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.420]   And then you would have to do whatever he asked you to do
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.060]   and then leave.
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.740]   - So at this point, you guys are 13 and 14 years old.
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:38.540]   See, I didn't realize you were that young.
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.100]   And so at this point, you know what it is
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.940]   and you're just like living his life.
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:47.140]   Was there like, did you come up with any...
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.240]   So you're going into these houses by yourself.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.980]   Are you trying to come up with any plans to escape
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.520]   or are you just kind of accepting it
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.180]   or how did that process go for you?
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.180]   - I think it was, there was one time
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.680]   me and a girl tried to get away.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.580]   There was like a neighbor who was,
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.100]   I think it was one house down, maybe two.
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.500]   But she was like an older lady.
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.700]   And we would always talk to her.
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.020]   Like she was cool with James.
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:14.860]   So I wasn't sure if it was like a safe place to go and talk.
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.380]   But she was like, yeah, like you guys need to come over here
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.640]   like four in the morning when everyone's sleeping
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.060]   and my son will come and pick you up
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.380]   and take you out of here.
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.820]   We're like, cool, like we're gonna do it.
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.180]   So the next morning we get up early,
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.180]   we're like sneaking out the door to go over there.
[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:36.140]   And she let us in, she's like smoking crack.
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.980]   She's like offering us crack.
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.580]   And then I was like, this is like not,
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.980]   this is not what I thought it was.
[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.220]   Like, this is not a safe place.
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.740]   Her son comes and picks us up and takes us to his house.
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.460]   And then essentially informs us
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.140]   that we are now going to be working for him.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.000]   So it was not like.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.140]   - Yeah, so she was on the same thing.
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.800]   - She was hustling me or hustling us basically
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:03.080]   to try to get her son doing what James was doing.
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:06.280]   - Okay, so did James ever find out and you guys.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.480]   - We ended up going back.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.840]   Like we ended up like leaving that guy's house
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.680]   because he wasn't as organized.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.320]   He wasn't organized.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.880]   James like had people circling the block all the time.
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.120]   So if we walked outside, we knew people were watching us.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.980]   Like they would just roll by all day, but this guy didn't.
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.740]   So we just took off and went back.
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.940]   - Okay, so during this time,
[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.820]   obviously you're not having a lot of communication
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.060]   like with your mom.
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.800]   Is she worried or is she at this point,
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.880]   you had gone away from the house so many times.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.340]   - She was looking for me.
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:39.180]   - The entire time?
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.580]   - In the beginning, well, the whole time.
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.280]   There was a lot that transpired before James.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.200]   Like when I was running away,
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.020]   like I was with this one guy that was in his thirties
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:52.000]   and we would like sleep outside in downtown Detroit
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.600]   in Hart Plaza, like wintertime.
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.680]   Because I just like, didn't want to be home.
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.460]   Like I had some sort of thing with my mom.
[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:00.320]   I don't know what it was.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.520]   I'm trying to figure that out in therapy now.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.760]   But there were so many instances where I ran away
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.900]   and was doing like stupid things.
[00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.280]   In this situation though, she was looking,
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.320]   she was telling the police, there were reports made
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.680]   and they wouldn't do anything.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.280]   Like they weren't like, she's a runaway.
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.120]   She's a runaway.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.040]   Like it's not like I was a missing person.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.500]   I was running away.
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.340]   - Right.
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:24.880]   - So they weren't taking it very seriously.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.920]   But she did end up finding me.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.040]   We can get to that, but.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:28.880]   - Right, okay.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.320]   So yeah, continue kind of with the story from there.
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.720]   So this is kind of becoming a thing.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.120]   James is taking you out with him
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.240]   and it's this whole system going on.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.960]   So then yeah, go from there.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:44.000]   - We went to, we were doing outcalls at houses
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.560]   and then we would do hotel stuff as well.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.960]   So he would get two hotel rooms.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.080]   He would take us all there.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.320]   We would all like mob into one room.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.240]   And then the other room was used for like clients,
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.480]   people that came to like see us or whatever.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.080]   I was in, I had like a bleeding disorder.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.180]   When I was a teenager, I was taking this birth control
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:04.700]   and I had an adverse reaction.
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.960]   So I was like heavily bleeding
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.080]   and it wouldn't stop for weeks.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.900]   Like I was like pale.
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.680]   And he ended up having me meet this,
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.600]   it was at the Knight's Inn, I believe,
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.140]   in Sterling Heights or something.
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:23.720]   He had me go in this room and there was this guy in there
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.160]   and he was a doctor, I found out,
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.880]   and I had to sleep with him.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.000]   And he ended up giving me a prescription
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.200]   for the birth control I needed to stop the bleeding.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.800]   So it was like--
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.200]   - Yeah, what type of messed up stuff is that?
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.360]   - Crazy, yeah.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.440]   And then downtown Detroit,
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.420]   I remember the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup that year.
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.000]   I don't remember what year it was,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.920]   but everybody was outside.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.200]   Like all these people wearing wings jerseys
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.120]   and we were in a hotel downtown
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.120]   and me and this girl, Camille,
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.040]   and these two guys walk in.
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:03.040]   They asked for two girls and they were like my uncle's age.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:07.480]   Like they just reminded me of my family members
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.460]   and they had wedding rings on and I was just,
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.640]   I think at that point, you're like nowhere is safe.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.480]   You can't trust anybody.
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.960]   Like if you have a doctor, you have married guys,
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.800]   you have anybody you could think of.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.520]   And I remember leaving some of the houses
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.540]   and being like that guy was so nice,
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:29.600]   but you wouldn't believe what he was doing.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.440]   - What he's doing on the side.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.600]   - Like low key, yeah.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.960]   So the trust issues were,
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.200]   at that point you're just accepting,
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.280]   you can't trust anyone at all.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.080]   And we were at this Red Roof Inn
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.840]   and it was a rule you can't leave the room
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.120]   or talk to anyone.
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.520]   And in the lobby,
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.120]   I'm sure he paid the hotel managers off or something.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.180]   Like they knew what was going on.
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.360]   And there was a family down there
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.820]   and I was talking to the dad.
[00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.800]   And I wasn't like telling on him or anything,
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.280]   but I walked back up in the room
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.400]   and Camille was in the room and she was like looking at me
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.240]   and she just kind of like does this,
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.660]   like letting me know something's up,
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.480]   but I didn't know what it was.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.640]   And I closed the door behind me
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.640]   and he popped out and like hit me in my face.
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.840]   Like cold cocked me in my face.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.600]   - This is James. - Yeah.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.760]   I think he was in like his late 30s or 40s at this time.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.200]   And he was like kind of a bigger dude,
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.340]   probably close to 200 pounds.
[00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:28.280]   And I was not prepared for getting hit in the face.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.940]   But that was the first time he like physically like hit me.
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.120]   But he did it to the other girls all the time.
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.040]   Like you would just see it.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.920]   - And it's not like this guy was bipolar.
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.560]   Like sometimes he was nice.
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.340]   Sometimes when he flipped a switch on the stairs
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.520]   that one day he never went back to like being.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.480]   - No, he did.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.760]   - He did it back and forth.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.320]   - It was like, he's nice unless he's not.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:54.840]   Like unless there's something that's triggering him
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:59.320]   or he wants you to know he's serious, like it would shift.
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.120]   So you would always try to like be good.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.760]   So you didn't have to see that
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.120]   because it was like terrifying.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:10.960]   So you had to just be like obedient and do what he asked.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.160]   - And his son was always with him.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.760]   And I remember from a very young age,
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:19.120]   always like thinking about his son.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.720]   So it'd be like, I can't say anything.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.560]   I can't do anything.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:25.920]   I can't act crazy or be like disobedient in front of his kid
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.400]   because then his kid would see him hitting a woman.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.040]   And then his kid is gonna grow up and do the same thing.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.060]   - I think it's very admirable
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.240]   that that was your thoughts during that time.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.080]   You know what I mean?
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.600]   Like actually thinking about this guy's kid
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.840]   instead of, you know, throwing a tantrum and.
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.560]   - There's no, yeah, there's no point in doing that.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.080]   - Okay, so that incident happened
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.080]   then did this become like a regular thing
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.840]   or what went on from there?
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:51.920]   - What do you mean like going?
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.380]   - From him hitting you.
[00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:57.120]   - No, I don't remember him hitting me again after that
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.360]   because there was no reason to.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.360]   It was just quiet.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.440]   - It was quiet the entire time.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.680]   - Didn't do anything, yeah.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:06.840]   And I was staying at his, we were back at the house.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.000]   I remember going out, I was with some guy.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.480]   He was dropping me off.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.760]   We had just like did stuff.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.120]   And my mom, like I didn't realize it was my mom,
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.000]   but we pulled up on this like side street
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.340]   and I see a blue Sunfire parked
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.800]   and the interior light is on.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.720]   And I see like a white lady and I was like, that's weird.
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.040]   And then I was like, that's my mom.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.360]   So as soon as I saw her and she saw me,
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:38.080]   she like locked in and like turned her mom voice on.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.280]   It was like, Catherine Michelle, get in this car right now.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.440]   So I got in the car and told her what,
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.600]   I didn't tell her what happened.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.640]   I didn't tell her actually until I was like in my late 20s,
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.240]   like the--
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.080]   - The extent of everything.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.400]   - The extent of it.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.560]   And she, anyway, she took me to the police station
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.340]   down the street and the cops were just very like dismissive
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.800]   and were like, well, you probably should just
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.800]   like leave it alone.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.640]   Like you don't know who he is.
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.240]   It's not safe.
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.160]   My mom's like, there's a house full of girls
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.120]   underage over there.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.700]   Like my daughter is telling you this
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:12.880]   and you're not doing anything.
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.240]   They're like, well, it's not that simple.
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.800]   And it was just not, I just wanted to go home.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.640]   - So that's one question I have for you.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:25.320]   So why do you think that like law enforcement
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.480]   and everything is so dismissive of the,
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.680]   and one of the reasons I wanted you to get on this podcast
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.840]   is 'cause I feel like this issue is so under talked about.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:36.080]   And I remember looking it up on Google or something,
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:40.160]   the amount of times this happens to kids underage,
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.640]   but you know, people in general is like crazy,
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.240]   but it's not a mainstream talked about thing.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.160]   And I feel like even, you know, you go to law enforcement,
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.600]   you tell them what's going on and they don't act on it.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.440]   Have you thought about why you think that is?
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.280]   - I don't know.
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:59.540]   I honestly, I'm sure it's like hard to develop a case,
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:03.560]   but the fact that he just got arrested and put in prison,
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.540]   I don't want to say for sure.
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:09.960]   I think it was like 2012 ish or 13, maybe.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:10.800]   I'll have to look it up,
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.680]   but he was locked up and he's still in prison.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.160]   He's eligible for parole in 2028.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.580]   But between the time this happened to me and that time,
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.920]   like how many girls did he affect?
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.160]   Like because the cops were dragging their feet
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.720]   or like, oh, we're building a case for how many years?
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.320]   Like how many girls are sacrificed
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.480]   so that you can get a case?
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.840]   Like, come on.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.040]   It just doesn't make sense.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.000]   - It doesn't make sense at all.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.400]   And the runaway aspect,
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.720]   like the human trafficking stuff
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:41.540]   is so focused on the very extreme cases,
[00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.560]   like three-year-olds, four-year-olds,
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:47.000]   like being trafficked across countries and like all that,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.460]   which is a huge issue, don't get me wrong.
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:52.200]   But domestically, like the teenage girls
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.320]   that are running away, that are at risk
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.600]   because they're rebelling or they don't have a dad
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.080]   or their parents are on drugs or whatever,
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.640]   but they just need a little bit more attention emotionally
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.380]   from their parents.
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:07.400]   They're being trafficked and nobody's talking about it
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.520]   because if they get picked up on the street,
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.840]   they get arrested and booked for prostitution.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:12.680]   - Right.
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.820]   - And they're 14 and 15.
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:17.800]   So it's just crazy to me.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.200]   - It's unbelievable.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:23.440]   So your mom sees you, she has you get in the car.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.000]   Did this guy come back after you at all
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   or did he just leave it completely alone once your mom got you?
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.800]   - Left it alone and I like dealt with like guilt
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.500]   because I left girls behind.
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.720]   - Yeah.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.000]   - Like, I don't know what happened to them.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.380]   I don't know where they are.
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:42.680]   Like he had another house where he kept older women
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.080]   that I don't know, I never met any of them.
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.520]   I just remember pulling up there,
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:50.600]   he would run drugs in and come back out and we would leave.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.440]   - Okay.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.480]   - But everyone, like it's hearsay,
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.920]   but everyone was like, that's where he keeps the girls
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.600]   that like were no longer teenagers.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.080]   They're addicted to substances
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.120]   because that's how he would get girls to like stay.
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.040]   Essentially, they would rely on him for drugs.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.000]   And then he just kind of hid them away.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.400]   And I think those women were working like the street
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.040]   where we were doing like private in-calls.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.680]   - Private, yeah, that makes sense.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:20.400]   So how many years after you get out of this situation
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.240]   is he finally, they build a case and they arrest him?
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.240]   - Year, like so long, like over a decade.
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.000]   - And what did they get him for?
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.480]   'Cause you just said he's out for parole, 2028.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.000]   - 2028 he's out for parole.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.720]   It was like prostitution solicitate,
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.480]   like all the, everything he got in trouble for
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:44.080]   was for like prostitution related crimes.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.400]   - And that's a...
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.120]   - Like I have all of his court transcripts
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.880]   that I'm sifting through right now, but that's it.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.480]   There was no rape on there, which really bothered me.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.320]   - Right.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.000]   - 'Cause I had reached out to a detective in Southfield
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.280]   'cause that's where he got caught up.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.680]   And I was like, "Hey, I had interactions with this man.
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.240]   He raped me when I was a young teen.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.540]   What is the statute of limitations?"
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.480]   And she was very, it's like,
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.280]   almost like they don't wanna deal with it
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.520]   'cause it's so much paperwork.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.860]   She's like, "Well, you need to write down
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.000]   every single thing that happened
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.360]   the whole time you were with him and send it to me."
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.320]   And I wasn't like at a place in my healing journey
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.000]   where I could sit down and write everything down
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.360]   step-by-step, like that's a lot, it takes a lot.
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.300]   I'd rather talk about it, but that's not really an option.
[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:32.600]   - So all this happens, you go back with your mom
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:33.680]   and you said you didn't really tell her
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.680]   the extent of things.
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:38.080]   Like what was your life like for those next,
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.040]   like how did you move on from this?
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.240]   Was there, like what happened after this?
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.000]   - I pretended it didn't happen.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.320]   - Really, and you're what age at the time?
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:53.320]   - I was like 15, 16, well, I met my son's dad
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:54.640]   when I was 16.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.260]   So when I came back with my mom,
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.480]   she sent me to alternative education,
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.720]   like an adult education with all the bad kids.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.440]   So I met this girl there and we used to go
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.680]   to River Rouge all the time,
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.000]   which is like on South of Detroit.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   And I met her cousin, he was 24, I was 16.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.240]   And I got pregnant like a month
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.720]   or two months after we met.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.180]   - Is this guy a good dude?
[00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.020]   - No.
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.280]   I raise my kids by myself, he's not involved.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.120]   - Really?
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:30.480]   - But yeah, he was like a good dad for a while.
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.560]   And then I left because he was emotionally abusive.
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.680]   So I left once I like grew up
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.020]   and like realized this is not okay.
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:43.280]   And after that, he is not involved.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.200]   He pays $46 a week in child support.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.920]   - This dude does?
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.040]   - For two kids, yeah.
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.680]   - Well, you are a warrior.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.940]   Yeah, I wanna like bring some attention to this
[00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:00.060]   because so I'm sure all these things that come out
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.940]   like the "Sound of Freedom" movie and all these things,
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.860]   I'm sure they hit a little different
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:08.120]   for you being kind of like in that situation.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.060]   The other day I was on a Zoom call
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:13.300]   with Child Rescue Coalition.
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:14.580]   I don't know if you know what that is.
[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.300]   They're a nonprofit for,
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.540]   but they were walking me through
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:21.360]   how they developed a software to like figure out these guys
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.760]   who are creating material and they're able to track them.
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.840]   They give all this information to law enforcement.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.280]   All law enforcement has to do is go
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.940]   and look at these cases.
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:35.360]   Look at the, and they can,
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.240]   all they gotta do is call the Comcast or whoever it is
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.600]   and get the physical address.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.880]   But they, so many cases are left like on--
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.000]   - They don't even follow through on it.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:44.840]   - They don't even like--
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.660]   - It's so frustrating.
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:49.920]   - To believe like how much this issue is like ignored.
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:53.400]   Like it's one of the most prevalent like crimes
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.080]   that is not really talked about.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.440]   And I was asking them the same question,
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.760]   like why do you think it's not more mainstream?
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.580]   Why do you think when "Sound of Freedom" comes out,
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:04.920]   some of the mainstream media outlets
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.960]   are kind of like pushing back on this movie?
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.360]   I just couldn't wrap my head around it.
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:14.240]   Do you have like any thoughts on why you think that is?
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.120]   - I haven't seen "Sound of Freedom."
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.120]   I just spoke about this actually last week.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.520]   I did a podcast with this man I met in prison
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.760]   doing a basketball program.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.160]   We went to prison and between the lines
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.720]   and played basketball with the inmates.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:32.320]   And he has a podcast and we spoke about "Sound of Freedom"
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:37.320]   and how there are certain undertones in the movie.
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:42.320]   Think that for me, these movies are great for awareness,
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.880]   but it very much like makes me feel
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.160]   like a wayfair type of situation.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.840]   I don't know if you remember that like media storm
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:53.260]   where they were like, "They're shipping kids in cabinets."
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:54.740]   It was crazy.
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:57.400]   - Do you not believe in that or do you think that happened?
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:01.640]   - No, I'm so, I just feel like it was such a conspiracy.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.400]   - So the conspiracy side of all this,
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:08.080]   you know, these rich white dudes that are, you know,
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.960]   getting these kids and doing this crazy stuff,
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.120]   you don't really believe in that side of it?
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:16.800]   - I do 'cause there were rich white dudes buying me, so yeah.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.800]   I mean, that's another huge problem.
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.520]   Why aren't the men who are purchasing children,
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.760]   why aren't they going to prison?
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:25.600]   - Yeah.
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:30.600]   - Why is my pimp in prison for all those years?
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.440]   I mean, he deserves it.
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.760]   But all the men that purchased me
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.720]   and the girls that were with me, like, where are they at?
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.800]   They're just out like living their life.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.920]   It's a supply and demand situation, so.
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.280]   - They may have a whole family, whole kids.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.120]   - They have no idea.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.200]   - And they have no idea
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.080]   that these guys are going to hotels.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:49.920]   - Yeah.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.600]   - Did you ever, in your mind, like,
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:56.760]   want to expose these individuals that you met
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:57.600]   or was there no--
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.220]   - If I knew who they were, I would put them on blast.
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:04.480]   If they have daughters and their daughters have sleepovers,
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.720]   like, these are the things I think about.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.640]   So you are married, I always pay attention
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.000]   to like rings or if they're putting something
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.040]   in their pocket when they come in.
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.280]   It's their ring, usually.
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.800]   And I'm like, I'm not stupid.
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:21.400]   Like, you start to like learn game really quickly
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.840]   'cause you have to.
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.040]   And I would just think about that.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.000]   Like, if you have a daughter at home
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.880]   or if you have a son or whatever,
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.880]   like, what are you doing at home?
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.400]   Does your wife know what's going on?
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.040]   Or you're not using protection
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.480]   with the children you're sleeping with
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.680]   and neither are 15 other men who are doing the same thing.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.920]   And then you're taking those things back to your family.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.840]   It's just crazy to me.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:49.280]   - It's really hard to talk about, honestly,
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:52.160]   just because it can happen to so many people.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.440]   So many people don't grow up in a stable household
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.800]   and I feel like those are the kind of the environments
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:58.640]   that it can happen.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.160]   But even like, you know, I've heard so many stories
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:06.160]   about even like kids at a park or something
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.080]   and their parent turns their head for a second
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:13.600]   and it just, I just don't understand
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:18.600]   why it's not like pushed more of it as an issue.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:22.920]   That's the thing that I kind of like,
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.520]   when we had the opportunity to speak about,
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.840]   that was the thing that I kind of wanted to get across
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.000]   is like, this is like a mainstream issue
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.320]   but it's getting pushed to the back burner.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.200]   And that's why I think like the conspiracy side of it,
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.680]   like why, is it the same people in power you think
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.120]   that are doing it?
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.120]   Or what do you think the police officers kind of like knew
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.840]   who this guy was and they just kind of were involved?
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.000]   - They knew who he was 'cause they warned my mom.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   But I don't know like how, as far as like,
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.800]   I think about like Jeffrey Epstein or whatever.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:57.640]   - I was gonna ask you about that.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.000]   - And like the documentaries about him
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.460]   and how, and the woman that was with him,
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.320]   how all of it is so focused on them
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:11.660]   and not what the damage they did has done
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:14.720]   to the people that were affected.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.040]   So we have to like live with it forever.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.520]   I have to get therapy.
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.460]   I have to figure out how to make my life work as a mom
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:24.520]   and business owner and how I interact with the public.
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.720]   You know, for years I couldn't go outside by myself
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.440]   at night, like I would have full on panic attack.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.160]   If a man was anywhere behind me,
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.280]   like full on fight or flight, like I'd be shaking.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.120]   - Yeah.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:40.040]   - And it's taken so long to get past it
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.120]   and it's not really fair.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:43.640]   - It's not, it's not fair at all.
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:47.480]   I mean, I think that part of the putting this kind of
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:50.720]   at least stopping it a little bit is kind of going after
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.840]   these guys who just think that because they have money
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:57.800]   or because they can do these things to these children,
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:01.640]   women in general, but obviously like it's so many people
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.000]   that are affected by it, even like there's so many people
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.040]   that don't talk about it 'til they're way older,
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:10.320]   but like it may have happened by an uncle
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.920]   or someone else when they're young.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:16.840]   How have you been able to find like any sort of healing
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.480]   like from this?
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:22.200]   - Well, the interview last year was a big step for me.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.900]   I didn't talk about that side of things ever.
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:28.780]   So there's like, well, I'm a single mom,
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:32.800]   obviously like starting to date and like carrying the weight
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:36.520]   of what I did as a teenager is hard because like,
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.280]   regardless of if it's my fault or not,
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.320]   or if it was consensual or not,
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:44.680]   I was like, I have like bodies like at 36,
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.680]   like between the age of like 13 and 15,
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:52.120]   like there were a lot of people like sexually.
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.620]   So I think the shame tied in with that,
[00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:56.900]   I didn't want to talk about, I didn't tell my mom,
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.020]   like I didn't want her to think about me
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:04.020]   as like being promiscuous or being a prostitute essentially.
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:08.320]   Like I don't want to be put into that category,
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.800]   not that there's anything wrong with it.
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.100]   People that consensually do it
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.520]   and want to do it on their own, that's their own thing.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.780]   But when you're a kid,
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:17.960]   I don't think it fits in the same category.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:21.440]   You're not working, it's not your job.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:26.200]   So I think in dating and like trying to build my confidence
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:30.180]   and like feel empowered when I'm interacting with men,
[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:33.060]   I kind of had to just be like, this is like me,
[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:34.660]   this is what happened.
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.460]   This is my history, it's part of who I am.
[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.820]   It's why I do a lot of things I do.
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.740]   So it's important that people know that.
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:45.680]   And yeah, I don't, that's just, it took a long time.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.240]   And when my mom finally saw the interview,
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.900]   she like lost her mind.
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:51.740]   - Yeah, I'm sure.
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:53.060]   - She was like, I had no idea.
[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.320]   And I'm just like, I didn't want you to think
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.160]   I was like dirty.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.840]   - How did she react to that interview?
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.000]   - She was hurt.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.080]   - Just, I'm sure she felt like, yeah.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.400]   - People came for her.
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:10.240]   - Yeah, I'm sure she felt guilty about things as well.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.360]   - But I ran it, like I don't blame her.
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.200]   She did the best she could with what she had.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.680]   She was severely abused, lost a child,
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.080]   never went to therapy.
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:22.160]   Wasn't, I feel like our parents' generation,
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.120]   they aren't as in touch with that.
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:27.320]   It's more of like a forget it and move on.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.560]   Don't live in the past kind of thing.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:32.120]   When you don't realize your past is always with you.
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.340]   It like affects everything that you do.
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:35.400]   - Right.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.880]   So there's a such thing as called like generational
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:41.260]   kind of like curses or generational traumas
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:45.840]   where maybe the parent of a child is doing something,
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.560]   but the child sees it and then they grow up
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.680]   and the same thing happens to them
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.960]   or they do the same thing.
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.840]   - Like obviously, you know, speaking about a healing
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:57.840]   from it and things like that, you've broken that.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:01.600]   But was that, do you think because of how your father
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:06.600]   treated your mom that in turn like affected you to,
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.420]   do you think, how do you think that all went together?
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.880]   - Yeah, I still deal with dad stuff.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:16.880]   So I'm not really great at relationships.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:20.400]   I'm just like always waiting for the person to bail
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.080]   at any given moment.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.360]   I'm never like comfortable and content.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.440]   I'm always on the edge of my seat
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.400]   waiting for the shoe to drop.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.040]   They'll be like, "Oh, I like you so much."
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:34.280]   And I'm like, "Just wait until you see like the trauma stuff
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.440]   or I talk about that."
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:38.280]   Like, and then they can't handle it and they dip.
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.600]   And then I'm like, "Oh, I was right."
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:40.740]   Like they left.
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:45.340]   So it's almost like this cycle of, I do self-sabotage.
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.420]   I've had like good relationships that I just,
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:50.840]   it's almost like you don't know how to act
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:54.200]   when somebody is like genuinely into you or being nice
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.600]   or treating you nicely.
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.960]   It's kind of like, why are you being nice to me?
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:02.800]   Because like James did that and look what happens.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.480]   So I'm just like, what's the motive?
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:10.200]   - Has any of this, 'cause I know like people go
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.760]   through trauma in different ways.
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:15.160]   A lot of people's trauma doesn't relate to yours at all.
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:17.720]   I feel like people react in like one of two ways.
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:20.840]   Sometimes it draws them kind of like,
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:24.640]   "Oh, I have to go to God with this and let him heal me
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.120]   or else I'll never be whole again.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.440]   I'll never feel whole."
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.060]   And then some people it's like,
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.040]   "Because such bad things happened to me
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:33.280]   and I see so much bad in the world.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.680]   I want nothing to do with God or anything."
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.280]   How did you kind of react to all this in terms of that?
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:43.040]   - Religion or God in general?
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.480]   - Just God in general, I would say.
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.440]   'Cause I think like people that have been through a lot,
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.360]   regardless of what it is,
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.360]   they either like lean on God
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.680]   and that's the only thing that kind of like helps them
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.360]   or they want nothing to do with God
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.480]   just 'cause they see all the bad in the world.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.300]   - That's hard for me.
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:03.280]   - I'm sure it is.
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.960]   - I definitely went through a spell
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:10.000]   where I was like trying to figure out what I was.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.240]   Like, am I like a Buddhist?
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.840]   Am I, I was vegan for so long.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.560]   I was sober for 10 years.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.760]   Like, I was so afraid I was gonna be like my dad
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.080]   so I didn't touch anything.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.560]   And I couldn't find anything that like aligned
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.440]   with how I feel about things.
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:31.760]   But I have like had moments where I'm curious about it
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.160]   or I want to know more.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:36.040]   But I haven't actually, like,
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.720]   since my grandfather passed away,
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:41.020]   I don't think I've like spoken to God
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:46.020]   or tried to get assistance in that way.
[00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:49.020]   Because like my life is very much like you,
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:51.180]   like I have to do it.
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:52.260]   That's just what it is.
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.900]   People are like, oh, you're a great mom.
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:55.700]   Like, you don't have to do that.
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:59.380]   Yeah, I do because my son's dad is not there.
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:00.580]   Like they're young men.
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:02.580]   I have to like try to show them
[00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.780]   how to like keep it moving
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:06.780]   regardless of what you're going through.
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:10.020]   And I don't feel like I can rely on anyone
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.860]   outside of myself.
[00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:13.540]   So when it comes to God,
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:18.540]   it's very hard for me to like put my trust in that source
[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:24.580]   because I don't see it or feel it in my life.
[00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:26.580]   - That's understandable.
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.380]   Do you feel like,
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:30.100]   what do you feel like your purpose is
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:30.940]   at this point in your life?
[00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:32.260]   Do you feel like your story,
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:34.380]   I mean, obviously you've touched so many people.
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:35.880]   I mean, all you gotta do is look in the comments
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.860]   of your interviews and see so many people
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.540]   that either relate to your story or, you know,
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:42.320]   want to help out.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:46.100]   Do you feel like through everything that's bad,
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:49.300]   it has shaped your purpose at all now in life or?
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:50.340]   - Yeah, I know what it is.
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:51.940]   I know what my purpose is.
[00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:55.380]   It's like crazy 'cause I've figured it out finally.
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:38:00.380]   And it involved going to prison, which was wild.
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:02.260]   So I was the only girl that went
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:05.420]   and I went with a really good friend of mine.
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:09.620]   And going into a place that is all men
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:13.220]   who have all done, I mean,
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:15.800]   bad things in some capacity, right?
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.300]   Things that are illegal or haven't
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.500]   and they're there, you know, not having to be.
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:25.500]   Like that was so big for me and so overwhelming emotionally
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:29.060]   because I wasn't prepared for how I was gonna feel.
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:30.300]   Everyone's like, you're crazy.
[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:31.940]   They're gonna like be inappropriate.
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:33.140]   They're gonna cross boundaries.
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:34.580]   And it was not like that at all.
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:38.120]   Like they were so respectful and I felt safe.
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:39.820]   And we were just out in the open,
[00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:41.900]   like hanging out, talking, learning about each other.
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:45.540]   I even had a pimp come up to me after our last game,
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:47.060]   like the last day.
[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:49.580]   It was like, hey, I'm here for pimping and pandering.
[00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:52.380]   Like I just wanted to introduce myself.
[00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:53.260]   And it was great.
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:56.020]   It was like a full circle moment for me.
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:39:00.860]   So my view on this issue is like very much
[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:03.940]   a like societal systemic issue.
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:08.540]   So my pimp, like I can only assume he grew up in Detroit.
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:11.420]   There's no opportunity in the city at that time.
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:14.560]   It is desolate, like despair.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.620]   There's not even like a target.
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:19.260]   You have to go outside the city to get like anything.
[00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:23.180]   So imagine just like being trapped in a city.
[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:25.060]   You have no means of like getting out
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.700]   or going to school.
[00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:28.280]   Like all the schools were closing down.
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:31.440]   There's no recreation centers for kids.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.820]   So you're growing up with this issue
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:35.140]   and you're seeing men in your community sell drugs
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.500]   or pimp or whatever they're doing.
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:40.060]   And that's just like what you do.
[00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:42.740]   Like it's a societal thing.
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:46.300]   So I don't view him as like a bad person
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:49.140]   because I'm like he, that's all he knew.
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:51.180]   He was surviving.
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:54.480]   - I think that takes incredible strength and compassion,
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:56.820]   but you are right.
[00:39:56.820 --> 00:40:00.900]   I mean, any, I feel like any community where, you know,
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:03.420]   the members of the community get into,
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.060]   I mean, this is kind of a separate issue.
[00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:08.740]   I feel like, you know, no matter how bad the community is,
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:12.620]   there's no really justification for that.
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:14.540]   But when it comes to like, you know,
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:16.760]   the violence in communities or selling drugs
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:18.700]   or some of these other things, you're right.
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.100]   It is very systemic.
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:21.940]   - It's environmental.
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.500]   It's like what you see, like nurture, nature.
[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.820]   Like did you, did he have a dad?
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.300]   Probably not.
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.700]   Like there's just so many elements that come into play.
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:32.780]   And yes, he was a grown man and continued to do it.
[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:35.380]   And he should be in prison, absolutely.
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:39.500]   I just tried to find the humanity in the situation
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.060]   and understand the psychology.
[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:42.660]   Like, why did it happen?
[00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:44.380]   So I'm not like, this person's just evil.
[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:45.780]   He's just bad.
[00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:47.500]   'Cause I don't think that he was born,
[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.500]   he wasn't born that way.
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:50.940]   - So you would say you in your heart
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:52.540]   are fully forgiving this individual?
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:53.940]   - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:57.500]   And I would like, I'm hoping to sit with him one day,
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:00.540]   like go before he gets paroled and sit and talk to him.
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:01.980]   That's the goal.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:03.820]   But that's also why I went to the prison
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:08.820]   because like these men are like, they're still human.
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:12.380]   And I think if more women that were survivors
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:16.180]   or people that have survived crime would like sit down
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:20.100]   and like build like some sort of human connection
[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:22.820]   with the other side, like there could be so much healing
[00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:24.260]   that can take place.
[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:25.100]   You know what I mean?
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:28.380]   - And just forgiveness in general and people see that
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:30.340]   and more people feel the courage to do that.
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:31.340]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:33.500]   - So that is what you view now as your purpose.
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.500]   - Yeah. - I think that's huge.
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:37.020]   - Yeah, and awareness, definitely.
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:40.740]   For teen girls, like that's my focus.
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:42.940]   - How do you think young girls can avoid?
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:46.020]   I mean, obviously some people, it just happens.
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:46.860]   They can't avoid it.
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:51.180]   How would you warn people or kind of like,
[00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:53.420]   how can they avoid it, you think?
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:56.500]   - It's hard because I don't put it on the teen girls.
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:57.620]   - Of course not.
[00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.940]   - I put it on the parents or the guardians.
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:04.140]   So I feel like it starts like much younger than that.
[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:07.180]   So if your daughters are like,
[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:08.740]   you're noticing they're like in their head
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:11.380]   or they're depressed or they're in their room all the time
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:12.900]   or they're always like on their device,
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:16.140]   like talking to God knows who, right?
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:18.700]   Like you have to find a way to connect with them
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:22.860]   and reach them in a way that's not like authoritative
[00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:26.460]   or you're not like telling them what to do.
[00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:28.700]   Like, it's hard for parents to do that.
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:30.820]   But like, if my daughter is throwing a tantrum
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:33.580]   and I'm getting like frustrated,
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:36.460]   I will just grab her up and hug her
[00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:38.700]   and it immediately diffuses the situation.
[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:41.220]   Like she's not throwing a tantrum anymore.
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:42.540]   It's crazy.
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:45.300]   Like, instead of like pushing your kids away
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:48.100]   and like telling them to like stop acting that way
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.300]   or you're grounded, I'm taking this, I'm taking that,
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:52.660]   like bring them in and give them affection
[00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.740]   and spend time with them and talk to them
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:57.940]   and like get to know them on like a human level because--
[00:42:57.940 --> 00:42:59.180]   - I think that's crazy you say that
[00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:01.660]   'cause even like my childhood,
[00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:04.980]   like my parents like talk about this now,
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:07.940]   like with me, like I was the rebel of all the children,
[00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:10.860]   like always getting my phone taken.
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:12.900]   I got my phone taken for a year one time.
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:16.620]   Like who gets their phone taken for a year?
[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:19.940]   But like I talked to my parents about it now,
[00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:24.580]   I was like, because you guys didn't let me like do stuff
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:25.620]   and instead I was always grounded,
[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:26.580]   you were taking my phone and this and that,
[00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:28.500]   it just made me want to rebel more.
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:30.780]   Like I never like ran away far,
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:32.100]   but I mean, Sierra will tell you,
[00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:33.620]   like there was a couple of times I did,
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:36.940]   like I was so mad that they were making me do,
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:38.660]   and they kind of recognize that now,
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:40.660]   but I think like for me and my kids,
[00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:42.060]   I think about how I parent my kids
[00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:44.220]   and it's yeah, it's more exactly what you say.
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:46.940]   It's like, instead of telling these kids,
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:49.460]   no, you can't do this, stay in line, this and that,
[00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.740]   all that's going to do is make them kind of rebel more,
[00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:52.580]   but when you can--
[00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:54.180]   - Also hide things.
[00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:55.020]   - Yeah.
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:56.700]   So if you're like taking their,
[00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.420]   like I don't take their devices.
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:43:59.580]   If I'm going to do something,
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:01.460]   like my son like backtalking me
[00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:03.180]   or not doing what he's supposed to be doing,
[00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:05.780]   I'll just like shut the internet off.
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:07.220]   I'm not going to like take something
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:09.220]   that like I bought him a PC for his 18th birthday,
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:11.820]   it was like $2,000 computer.
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:14.540]   And I wouldn't take that from him.
[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:17.100]   Like so many people, like his dad has taken so much from him
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:21.020]   like stolen money from him, like birthday money.
[00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.580]   And I would never do that.
[00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:23.660]   So I think as a parent,
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:25.460]   just like making sure you're aware
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:27.540]   of what's going on in your house.
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:30.020]   The internet is a dangerous place, straight up.
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:32.300]   Social media, crazy.
[00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:34.820]   I'm just monitoring all the time as much as I can
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:37.700]   without it being in a way that's like,
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.420]   I'm going to watch what you're doing.
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:40.940]   It's more like creating an environment
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:43.380]   where your kids are comfortable talking to you about things
[00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.100]   and not feeling like they're going to get in trouble
[00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:47.460]   or judged or whatever.
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:50.500]   Like if I mess up and I'm like snap at my kids
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:52.500]   or I'm my temper's short that day.
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:54.740]   And I say something like out of left field
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:56.140]   that I shouldn't have said,
[00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:57.380]   I will sit with them and be like,
[00:44:57.380 --> 00:44:59.820]   I'm sorry that I said that.
[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:00.780]   I'm having a rough day.
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:04.140]   I lost control of my emotions and I apologize.
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:06.300]   Like I didn't mean that.
[00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:08.980]   So they know like, okay, well she's taking accountability.
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:13.020]   So like, it feels more like a mutual relationship
[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:17.060]   instead of like you're on top all the time.
[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:17.900]   - Right.
[00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:19.180]   - Yeah.
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:20.740]   - Well, I mean, yeah,
[00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:24.380]   I feel like obviously through all the bad,
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:27.300]   you've come to a place where like this is,
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:30.740]   people like you is what this situation in the world needs
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:33.180]   and like people with your bravery and courage
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:37.060]   and vulnerability like for this kind of issue.
[00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:39.940]   And I don't know, I mean, obviously we live in a,
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:43.100]   this is an evil world and a lot of bad things go on,
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:45.900]   but I feel like you sharing your story
[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:49.780]   is just, it's important.
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:50.700]   Like it really is.
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:54.220]   And I just, I feel like you individually,
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:57.540]   like I really hope God makes himself real to you.
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:02.540]   I've never like prayed for anybody on a podcast
[00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:04.340]   and it's not because I would pray for you
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:06.140]   because I like feel, I mean,
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:08.260]   obviously I feel terrible about what happened to you,
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:10.660]   but it's more just all you went through,
[00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:12.740]   like God is gonna use your story
[00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:16.540]   in a way that is like really powerful for a lot of people
[00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:18.580]   that you save a lot of lives.
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:22.140]   You give people courage to talk up about their situation.
[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:24.820]   So I just wanted to ask you if I could pray for you.
[00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:27.020]   And then I wanted to invite you to church on Sunday
[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:28.460]   'cause you said you haven't been to church for a while.
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:30.860]   - I haven't been to church since I was like 12.
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:31.980]   - So let's go Sunday.
[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:34.540]   So yeah, if you're good with it,
[00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:35.660]   I just wanted to end this podcast
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:36.500]   just praying for you, if that's cool.
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.140]   - Yeah, that's totally fine.
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:39.740]   - All right.
[00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:41.380]   Dear Lord, thank you for Kat.
[00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:43.220]   I wanna thank you.
[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:44.900]   Just the woman she is, Lord,
[00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:46.340]   and I just wanna thank you for the healing
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:48.420]   that you've brought about in her life
[00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:49.860]   and giving her the vulnerability
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:51.660]   and the courage to share her story.
[00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:55.020]   Just thank you for the woman she is.
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:57.260]   I ask that you make yourself real to her.
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:01.500]   Heal her in ways that she didn't even know was possible.
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:05.580]   Show yourself to her, make her whole,
[00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:09.020]   give her complete confidence and wholeness in herself,
[00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:10.660]   and just help her realize that the things
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:13.620]   that happened to her are not her fault.
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:16.700]   There's no shame, there's no guilt there.
[00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.740]   You take that all on yourself,
[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:20.380]   and just please show her that.
[00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:23.780]   We love you and we appreciate you,
[00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:26.420]   and we thank you that even though terrible things happen
[00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:29.860]   to all of us, that you somehow can turn that
[00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:31.900]   into a beautiful story.
[00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:33.020]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:35.660]   Cool. - Thank you.
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:39.300]   - Well, I appreciate you being on this podcast so much.
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:41.020]   This was for sure one of my favorite episodes
[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:43.100]   just because this is just an issue
[00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:44.980]   that I've always been passionate about.
[00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:47.220]   I was always confused why I wasn't kind of brought
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:48.300]   to the light a little bit more,
[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:50.700]   so it means a lot to me that you were willing
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:51.540]   to get on here, and I thank you.
[00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:53.220]   - Yeah, thank you for having me.
[00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:54.060]   - Of course.

[00:47:57.980 --> 00:47:59.260]   That's all I can hope for.
[00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:00.540]   - 100%. - Yeah.
