[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:13.380]   - Hi, welcome back to another episode of Curious Mike.
[00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.560]   I'm here with my friend, Kat.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.000]   Really excited to have you on.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.360]   You know, this topic is something that I believe
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.240]   needs to be kind of like spoke about more,
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.640]   brought into the light a little bit more.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.740]   So I appreciate your bravery, like, and everything,
[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.700]   and sharing your story, and being vulnerable.
[00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.240]   So why don't we start, like, early childhood.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.380]   Like, what was your first memories growing up?
[00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.000]   How was your childhood, and all that?
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.840]   - My childhood was kind of spotty.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.600]   My memories are a little spotty back then.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.880]   My dad wasn't around much, so I think that's sort of
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.600]   what led me to what we're going to speak about.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.080]   I was super emotional as a kid, very needy for affection.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.860]   And my mom had went through, like,
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.820]   domestic violence situation while I was growing up.
[00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.660]   I was like a baby.
[00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.420]   My sister was a little older.
[00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.520]   My dad used to, like, abuse my mom, and hit her.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.340]   And my mom had a daughter after my older sister.
[00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.860]   So my sister, Mary Kay, was a little bit older than me.
[00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.780]   My mom was pregnant with me when she passed away,
[00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.140]   which made my mom decide to finally leave my dad,
[00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.780]   because he wasn't, like, supportive.
[00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.020]   And she was dealing with domestic violence.
[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.920]   So, after that happened--
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.400]   - And what age were you around this time?
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.040]   - My mom was pregnant with me.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.040]   - Oh, around this time with her?
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.220]   - When she passed, yeah.
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.040]   So, that's why everyone says I'm super emotional,
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.320]   because my mom was so sad, her whole pregnancy.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.560]   But yeah, she passed, and my mom left,
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.160]   and then she was a single mom for a while.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.080]   She got remarried a couple times.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.280]   It just, it was a little inconsistent.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.420]   We moved a lot.
[00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.960]   We didn't stay in one place for a long time.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.040]   And she sent me to live with my aunt and uncle,
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.640]   once or twice, because they had, like, a nuclear family,
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.800]   like a traditional mom-dad.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.600]   They were more well-off than we were.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.040]   So I had experiences there, and then they told me
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.400]   that I had to go back to my mom's,
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.820]   because my cousin got pregnant at 15.
[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.320]   So, I went back to my mom's,
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.440]   and that's kind of where everything started.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.200]   - And you went back there around what age?
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.380]   What age is this?
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.220]   - 13.
[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.460]   - Around 13? - 14, yeah.
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.940]   - Gotcha. - Yeah.
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.200]   So, yeah, I moved back with my mom,
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.660]   and she worked all the time.
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.100]   She was never home.
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.940]   So I wasn't getting the emotional support
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.620]   that I needed at that age.
[00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.020]   Like, I very much needed guidance,
[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.760]   and she didn't have a choice but to work, obviously.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.940]   So, that's when everything kind of went left.
[00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.880]   - So, okay, so you said you were around 13 or so.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.580]   You know, mom's working, and you're kind of independent
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.100]   at a very young age, for the most part.
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.500]   - Yeah.
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.380]   - So, like, when was the first time
[00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.380]   you got approached by a man inappropriately?
[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.300]   - I was young.
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.320]   I was, like, that was up with my aunt and uncle.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.160]   - Oh, that was back in the day.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.660]   - It started happening, like, 11, 12.
[00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.220]   - So, this is just something that, like,
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.860]   all of childhood, you were kind of exposed to a little bit?
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.260]   - Yeah, I was kind of, like,
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.340]   I remember, like, construction workers, like,
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.460]   hitting on me and my friends,
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.700]   and we were, like, 11.
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.860]   - Just 'cause you guys were,
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.740]   had so much freedom and was out doing your thing?
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.000]   - Yeah, wearing shorts and, like,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.300]   a tank top in the summertime,
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.360]   and it was very sexualized from a very young age.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.020]   I don't know if it's just where I'm from.
[00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.140]   Like, I don't know if it's, like, small town syndrome,
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.620]   but it was crazy.
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.520]   So, I think, and then not having a dad.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.260]   - Right, just for the protection,
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.900]   or brothers for the protection.
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.860]   - Yeah, like, I just wanted acceptance, I think.
[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.700]   - Yeah.
[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.420]   - So, I started, like, running away from home
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.880]   because my mom wasn't around,
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.240]   and she wouldn't listen to what I needed.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.100]   So, I started running away, like,
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.540]   first started running away to Southwest Detroit
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.060]   with, like, friends that I'd met in school,
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.820]   and skipped school all the time,
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.460]   and eventually ended up moving from Southwest Detroit
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.980]   out to the West Side.
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:05.980]   - With your mom?
[00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.140]   - No, just running away.
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.980]   - Oh, wow.
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.180]   - Like, I would just hop on a bus
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.660]   and go into the city by myself.
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.540]   - And your mom, is she reaching out?
[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.840]   - She had no idea, 'cause she was at work all the time.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.680]   - That's crazy.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.320]   Okay, so you're doing that.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.160]   You're running away from home and things like that.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.000]   So, now, kinda, you're in your teenage years.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.600]   Get into, kinda, the whole story about everything.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.280]   - Yeah, running away to the West Side.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.760]   I suck out like a sore thumb.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.840]   So, I made a friend there.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.440]   Me and her ended up, like, becoming friends,
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.760]   and just, like, hanging out with people in the neighborhood.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.400]   I stayed with her and her boyfriend at the time,
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.440]   and I thought it was just, like, I'm free,
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.680]   like, I have, I can do whatever I want.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.680]   Like, I thought it was cool.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.840]   And in the neighborhood, like,
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.860]   I think I started to see, like, the darkness.
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.220]   Like, we would walk down the street,
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.160]   and, like, guys would try to holler at us,
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.760]   and if we, like, didn't respond positively,
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.640]   they would squirt you with, like, pee.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.080]   Like, they would fill squirt guns with urine.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.920]   - Yeah.
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.920]   - And spray you.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.280]   - I heard that on one of your podcasts,
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.440]   and I was just thinking to myself, where does that happen?
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.720]   Like, I've never, you said Southwest Detroit, right?
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.920]   - No, this was on the West Side.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.760]   - West Side.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.600]   Like, I've never heard of that,
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.000]   of guys just having water guns with pee just red-hot.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.800]   - Premeditated, I don't know.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.640]   - Yeah, crazy.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.120]   - They're just trying to cause trouble, I guess.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.080]   But, yeah.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.560]   So, that was, like, oh, okay,
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.360]   this isn't just, like, fun and games.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.520]   Like, it's actually not okay.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.500]   And I went to Coney Island to get, like,
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.440]   chili cheese fries, 'cause they knew me,
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.600]   and, like, if I couldn't pay,
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.040]   they would just, like, hook me up anyway.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.040]   And this guy walks in, and he introduces himself,
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.720]   buys my, pays for my food.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.320]   And he was like, "I have it somewhere you can stay.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.360]   "You can come, you know, it's cool.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.680]   "Like, I'll take care of you."
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.320]   And I'm like, okay, because I had no idea.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.480]   It was, like, a thing.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.200]   I didn't know it existed.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.280]   I didn't know, like, pimps were a thing.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.200]   - Random guy walks in the restaurant.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.880]   Random guy walks in and just pays for your food.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.000]   - I had known somebody was looking for me for a while,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.640]   because, like, I made friends
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.800]   with the guys in the neighborhood,
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.560]   but, like, they weren't really my friends.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.300]   They were just, like, scouting for him, I think.
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.000]   And they were like, "Oh, James is looking for you.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.320]   "Like, he's, like, you know, next time you come around."
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.480]   Like, so I think they were just telling him
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.760]   where I was, essentially.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.460]   So, yeah, he ended up picking me up.
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.580]   I went to the house with him in Brightmoor.
[00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.760]   And I walk in, and there's, like, a bunch of girls my age
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.480]   that looked like me.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.800]   And I don't know, I was just like, "What is going on?"
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.560]   - Was it, like, as soon as you walked in there,
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.920]   where you did your, like, alarm go off in your head,
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.520]   or were you just kind of, like, you had no idea?
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.440]   - No. - You were just kind of naive
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.680]   to everything at that point? - Very naive, unfortunately.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.680]   So, like, the girls were really welcoming and nice,
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.400]   and there was no, like, warnings.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.240]   There was no, like, bad feeling.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.160]   He didn't give me any bad vibes at all.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.760]   So I think when that part revealed itself,
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.800]   I was, like, shocked, because I wasn't expecting it.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.840]   Like, I thought this person just wanted to help.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.000]   But again, I'm naive.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.460]   I wasn't raised in, like, a bad neighborhood.
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.580]   I wasn't raised around people
[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.980]   that I needed to, like, figure out.
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.840]   So things kind of, like, were cool for a couple weeks.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.360]   He took me shopping, bought me clothes,
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.680]   like, took me to get my tongue pierced.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.020]   Like, I was doing all these things,
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.240]   and I was just like, "Oh, this is so fun,"
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.040]   not realizing, like, that was a debt I was accruing.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:44.200]   So that, like, when I finally, like, saw him,
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.240]   like, the real him, we were, I was going up.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.420]   There's, like, an attic space.
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:49.760]   I was, like, going up there,
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.240]   and he stopped me on the stairs
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.160]   and pushed me down on my back,
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.160]   and was like, "Oh, I have to test you out
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.260]   "before you start working.
[00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.680]   "Like, you have to pay off all the stuff that I got you."
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.520]   And I was like, "What?
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.500]   "What do you mean?
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.120]   "Like, I have to pay it back.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.600]   "Like, I'll give it back to you."
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.480]   Like, I didn't realize that's not how it works.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.300]   You can't just be like, "Here, take your clothes back.
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.680]   "I'm gonna go home."
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.520]   - Yeah.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.640]   And this was the first time you saw him switch, like--
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.320]   - Just completely switch, yeah.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.280]   Different person.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.760]   Like, the first time I saw in a man's eyes
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.480]   that he wasn't there.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.320]   - Right.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.600]   - Like, it's, like, blink.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.000]   So it was like, if you're, like, crying
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.980]   and you're, like, begging them
[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.480]   to not do what they're gonna do,
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.400]   like, they don't hear you.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.580]   - Right. - Because they're just--
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.660]   - And how many months into the situation
[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.360]   living with him was-- - It was a couple weeks.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.020]   - Okay, so he was nice those couple weeks,
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.060]   buying you things, and then-- - Yeah.
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:42.660]   - That first situation happens.
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:43.500]   - Yep.
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.900]   And then, yeah, he sexually assaulted me on the stairs.
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.900]   And I didn't fight back, I was quiet,
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.540]   because you're kinda, like, in shock.
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.820]   And I found out he had done that to all the girls.
[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.180]   Like, all the girls he would rotate.
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.140]   Later, I figured that out.
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.780]   But, like, his son was around.
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.420]   He was, like, three or four.
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.780]   His baby mama was around.
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.300]   So she knew what was going on,
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.500]   but nobody warned me, or warned anyone.
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.580]   So it was crazy.
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.500]   - So these girls are living with you for two weeks,
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.740]   and they never said a word about it.
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.140]   I wonder, did they feel like they were indebted to him,
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:22.800]   or were they just scared?
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.640]   Or what are you thinking?
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.380]   - Probably scared.
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.280]   And some of them, I think, like, kind of, like, accepted
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.860]   this was their life.
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:31.780]   - Just what they had gotten into.
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.060]   - Yeah, so they were, like, making the most of it.
[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:34.900]   - Right.
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.260]   - Like, we would goof off, and, like,
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.220]   hang out, and drink, and smoke,
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.180]   and, like, it was just, like, our new normal, you know?
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.140]   - And how long did this kinda thing go on,
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.220]   just in the house with him?
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.980]   - In the house, not long.
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:49.820]   - Okay.
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.460]   - So once he, like, kinda made that clear,
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.900]   he would start taking me with him, like, out.
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.780]   So there was him and this other guy with dreads.
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.220]   I don't remember his name.
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.580]   But he drove, like, a Bronco.
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.900]   I specifically remember the Bronco.
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.880]   And they would take us, like, outside of the city.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.980]   So we would do, like, in-calls with, like,
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.380]   people in suburbs, like, my neighborhood.
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.520]   We went to, like, neighborhoods right around my neighborhood
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.620]   where my mom was.
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.340]   And they would just send us in the house.
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.600]   Nobody would be with you.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.860]   You'd go in, like, 13, 14-year-old girls.
[00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.180]   There'd be a guy there waiting,
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.420]   and then you would have to do whatever he asked you to do,
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.020]   and then leave.
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.620]   - So at this point, you guys are 13 and 14-year-old.
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:33.460]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:38.540]   - See, I didn't realize you were that young.
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.100]   And so, at this point, you know what it is,
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.940]   and you're just, like, living his life.
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:47.140]   Was there, like, did you come up with any,
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.240]   so you're going into these houses by yourself.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.980]   Are you trying to come up with any plans to escape,
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.540]   or are you just kind of accepting it,
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.180]   or how did that process go for you?
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.180]   - I think it was, there was one time,
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.660]   me and a girl tried to get away.
[00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.580]   There was, like, a neighbor who was,
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.100]   I think it was one house down, maybe two.
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.500]   But she was, like, an older lady,
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.700]   and we would always talk to her.
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.020]   Like, she was cool with James,
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.300]   so I wasn't sure if it was, like,
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.860]   a safe place to go and talk.
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:15.940]   But she was like, "Yeah, like,
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.300]   "you guys need to come over here,
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.560]   "like, four in the morning when everyone's sleeping,
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.980]   "and my son will come and pick you up
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.380]   "and take you out of here."
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.840]   Really cool, like, we're gonna do it.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.180]   So the next morning, we get up early,
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.180]   we're, like, sneaking out the door to go over there,
[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.880]   and she let us in.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.140]   She's, like, smoking crack.
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.980]   She's, like, offering us crack.
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.580]   And then I was like, this is, like, not,
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.980]   this is not what I thought it was.
[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.240]   Like, this is not a safe place.
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.300]   Her son comes and picks us up,
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.740]   takes us to his house,
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.460]   and then essentially informs us
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.140]   that we are now going to be working for him.
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.020]   So it was not, like--
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.120]   - Yeah, so she was on the same--
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.760]   - She was hustling me, or hustling us, basically,
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:03.040]   to try to get her son doing what James was doing.
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.220]   - Okay, so did James ever find out and you guys--
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.440]   - We ended up going back.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.800]   Like, we ended up, like, leaving that guy's house
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.280]   because he wasn't as organized, he wasn't organized.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.860]   James, like, had people circling the block all the time,
[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:19.080]   so if we walked outside, we knew people were watching us.
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.040]   Like, they would just roll by all day.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.480]   But this guy didn't, so we just took off
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.700]   and went back.
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.900]   - Okay, so during this time,
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.780]   obviously you're not having a lot of communication
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.020]   like with your mom.
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.780]   Is she worried, or is she, at this point,
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:36.840]   you know, you had gone away from the house so many times?
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.300]   - She was looking for me.
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.140]   - The entire time?
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.540]   - In the beginning, well, the whole time.
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.260]   There was a lot that transpired before James,
[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.180]   like, when I was running away.
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.980]   Like, I was with this one guy that was in his 30s,
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.620]   and we would, like, sleep outside
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:54.560]   in downtown Detroit in Hart Plaza, like, wintertime,
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.680]   because I just, like, didn't wanna be home.
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.440]   Like, I had some sort of thing with my mom.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.320]   I don't know what it was.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.500]   I'm trying to figure that out in therapy now.
[00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.760]   But there were so many instances where I ran away
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.880]   and was doing, like, stupid things.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.280]   In this situation, though, she was looking,
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.320]   she was telling the police, there were reports made,
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.680]   and they wouldn't do anything.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.200]   Like, they weren't, like, "She's a runaway.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.040]   "She's a runaway."
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.060]   Like, it's not like I was a missing person.
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.500]   I was running away.
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.340]   - Right.
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:24.900]   - So they weren't taking it very seriously.
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.940]   But she did end up finding me.
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.060]   We can get to that, but.
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:28.900]   - Right.
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.340]   Okay, so yeah, continue kind of with the story from there.
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.740]   So this is kind of becoming a thing.
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.140]   James is taking you out with him,
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:38.260]   and it's this whole system going on.
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.960]   So then, yeah, go from there.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:44.020]   - We went to, we were doing outcalls at houses,
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.580]   and then we would do hotel stuff as well.
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.020]   So he would get two hotel rooms.
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.100]   He would take us all there.
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.340]   We would all, like, mob into one room.
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:55.260]   And then the other room was used for, like, clients,
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.500]   people that came to, like, see us or whatever.
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.080]   I was in, I had, like, a bleeding disorder.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.180]   When I was a teenager, I was taking this birth control,
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:04.700]   and I had an adverse reaction.
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.960]   So I was, like, heavily bleeding,
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.080]   and it wouldn't stop for weeks.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.900]   Like, I was, like, pale.
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.700]   And he ended up having me meet this,
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.620]   it was at the Knight's Inn, I believe,
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.140]   in Sterling Heights or something.
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.860]   He had me go in this room,
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.700]   and there was this guy in there.
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.180]   And he was a doctor, I found out.
[00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.900]   And I had to sleep with him,
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.000]   and he ended up giving me a prescription
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.220]   for the birth control I needed to stop the bleeding.
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.820]   So it was, like, (laughs)
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.220]   - Yeah, what type of messed up stuff is that?
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.340]   - Crazy, yeah.
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.020]   And then downtown Detroit, I remember,
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.420]   the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup that year.
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.000]   I don't remember what year it was,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.940]   but everybody was outside.
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.180]   Like, all these people wearing wings jerseys.
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:53.100]   And we were in a hotel downtown,
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.100]   and me and this girl, Camille,
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.020]   and these two guys walk in.
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.020]   They asked for two girls.
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.580]   And they were, like, my uncle's age.
[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:07.500]   Like, they just reminded me of my family members.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:11.460]   And they had wedding rings on, and I was just,
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.660]   I think at that point, you're, like, nowhere is safe.
[00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.400]   You can't trust anybody.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.100]   Like, if you have a doctor. - Yeah, 'cause you married guys.
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.340]   - Married guys, you have.
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:21.740]   Anybody you could think of, like,
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.480]   and I remember leaving some of the houses
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.500]   and being, like, that guy was so nice.
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.580]   But, like, you wouldn't believe, like, what he was doing.
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.560]   - What he's doing on the side. - Like, low-key, yeah.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.900]   So the trust issues were,
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.580]   at that point, you're just, like, accepting.
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.620]   Like, you can't trust anyone.
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.220]   - Yeah. - At all.
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.060]   And we were at this, like, Red Roof Inn,
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:44.820]   and it was a rule, you can't leave the room
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.060]   or talk to anyone.
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.420]   In the lobby, I'm sure he paid the hotel managers off
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:50.260]   or something.
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.140]   Like, they knew what was going on.
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.300]   And there was a family down there,
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.780]   and I was talking to the dad.
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:58.780]   And I wasn't, like, telling on him or anything.
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:00.220]   But I walked back up in the room,
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.300]   and Camille was in the room,
[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.340]   and she was, like, looking at me.
[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.180]   And she just kinda, like, does this,
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.620]   like, letting me know something's up,
[00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.460]   but I didn't know what it was.
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.600]   And I closed the door behind me,
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.600]   and he popped out and, like, hit me in my face.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.760]   - James. - Like, cold-cocked me
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:14.800]   in my face.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.800]   - This is James. - Yeah.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.360]   - Okay. - I think he was in, like,
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.720]   his late 30s or 40s at this time,
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.160]   and he was, like, kind of a bigger dude,
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.300]   probably close to 200 pounds.
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:28.240]   And I was not prepared for getting hit in the face.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.200]   But that was the first time he, like, physically,
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.900]   like, hit me.
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.080]   But he did it to the other girls all the time.
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.020]   Like, he would, you would just see it.
[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.880]   - And it's not like this guy was bipolar.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.560]   Like, sometimes he was nice.
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.320]   Sometimes he, when he flipped a switch on the stairs
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.520]   that one day, he never went back to, like, being--
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.440]   - No, he did.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.720]   - He did, it was back and forth.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.320]   - It was like, he's nice, unless he's not.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:54.800]   Like, unless he's, there's something that's triggering him,
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.160]   or he wants you to know he's serious,
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.300]   like, it would shift.
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.640]   So you would always try to, like, be good.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.000]   - Right. - So you didn't have
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.600]   to see that, because it was, like, terrifying.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.440]   - Yeah. - So you had to just be,
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.940]   like, obedient, and do what he asked.
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:14.140]   And his son was always with him,
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.720]   and I remember from a very young age,
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.800]   always, like, thinking about his son.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.640]   - Yeah. - So it'd be like,
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.380]   I can't say anything, I can't do anything,
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:25.040]   I can't act crazy, or be, like, disobedient
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.640]   in front of his kid, because then his kid
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.360]   would see him hitting a woman.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.000]   And then his kid is gonna grow up and do the same thing.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.240]   - I think it's very admirable that that was your thoughts
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.720]   during that time, you know what I mean?
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.560]   - Yeah. - Like, actually thinking
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.080]   about this guy's kid, instead of, you know,
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.800]   throwing a tantrum, and--
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.560]   - There's no, yeah, there's no point in doing that.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.040]   - Okay, so that incident happened,
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.080]   and did this become, like, a regular thing,
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.840]   or what went on from there?
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:51.880]   - What do you mean, like, going--
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.380]   - From him hitting you.
[00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:57.100]   - No, I don't remember him hitting me again after that,
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.120]   because there was no reason to.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.360]   It was just quiet.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.200]   - It was quiet the entire time.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.640]   - Didn't do anything, yeah, and I was staying at his,
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.840]   we were back at the house.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.000]   I remember going out, I was with some guy.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.480]   He was dropping me off.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.760]   We had just, like, did stuff.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.120]   And my mom, like, I didn't realize it was my mom,
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.000]   but we pulled up on this, like, side street.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.340]   And I see a blue Sunfire parked,
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:27.000]   and the interior light is on, and I see, like, a white lady.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.720]   And I was like, that's weird.
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.040]   And then I was like, that's my mom.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.360]   So as soon as I saw her, and she saw me,
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:38.120]   she, like, locked in, and, like, turned her mom voice on.
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.280]   It was like, Catherine Michelle, get in this car right now.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.440]   So I got in the car and told her what,
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.600]   I didn't tell her what happened.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:47.600]   I didn't tell her, actually,
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.640]   until I was, like, in my late 20s.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.260]   Like, the--
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:52.100]   - The extent of everything.
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.420]   - The extent of it.
[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.440]   And she, anyway, she took me
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.760]   to the police station down the street.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.360]   And the cops were just very, like, dismissive,
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.440]   and were like, well, you probably
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.800]   should just, like, leave it alone.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.640]   Like, you don't know who he is.
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.240]   It's not safe.
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.640]   My mom's like, there's a house full
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.120]   of girls underage over there.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.680]   Like, my daughter is telling you this,
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:12.860]   and you're not doing anything.
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.240]   They're like, well, it's not that simple.
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.800]   And it was just not, I just wanted to go home.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.640]   - So that's one question I have for you.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.560]   So why do you think that, like,
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.480]   law enforcement and everything is so dismissive of the,
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.640]   and one of the reasons I wanted you to get on this podcast
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.840]   is 'cause I feel like this issue is so under-talked about.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:36.080]   And I remember looking it up on Google or something,
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:40.160]   the amount of times this happens to kids underage,
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.640]   but, you know, people in general is, like, crazy,
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.240]   but it's not a mainstream talked-about thing.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.160]   And I feel like even, you know, you go to law enforcement,
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.600]   you tell them what's going on, and they don't act on it.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.460]   Have you thought about why you think that is?
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:55.300]   - I don't know.
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:59.540]   I honestly, I'm sure it's, like, hard to develop a case,
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.580]   but the fact that he just got arrested
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.520]   and put in prison, I don't wanna say for sure.
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.960]   I think it was, like, 2012-ish, or '13 maybe.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:10.800]   I'll have to look it up.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.680]   But he was locked up, and he's still in prison.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.160]   He's eligible for parole in 2028.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.580]   But between the time this happened to me and that time,
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.920]   like, how many girls did he affect?
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.160]   Like, because the cops were dragging their feet,
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.720]   or, like, oh, we're building a case.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.720]   For how many years?
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.320]   Like, how many girls are sacrificed
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.480]   so that you can get a case?
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.840]   Like, come on. - Right.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.040]   - It just doesn't make sense.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.040]   - It doesn't make sense at all.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.840]   - And the runaway aspect, like,
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:38.180]   the human trafficking stuff is so focused
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.520]   on the very extreme cases.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.560]   Like, three-year-olds, four-year-olds,
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:47.000]   like, being trafficked across countries and, like, all that,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.440]   which is a huge issue, don't get me wrong.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.200]   But domestically, like, the teenage girls
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.320]   that are running away, that are at risk
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.600]   because they're rebelling, or they don't have a dad,
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.080]   or their parents are on drugs, or whatever,
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.640]   or they just need a little bit more attention emotionally
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.120]   from their parents, they're being trafficked,
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.320]   and nobody's talking about it because it's,
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.560]   if they get picked up on the street,
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.880]   they get arrested and booked for prostitution.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.880]   - Right. - And they're 14 and 15.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.520]   So it's just crazy to me.
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.240]   - It's unbelievable.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.480]   So your mom sees you, she has you get in the car.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.040]   Did this guy come back after you at all,
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.840]   or did he just leave it completely alone
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.040]   once your mom got you? - Left it.
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.800]   Left it alone, and I, like, dealt with, like, guilt
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.480]   because I left girls behind.
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.680]   - Yeah.
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:37.960]   - Like, I don't know what happened to them.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.360]   I don't know where they are.
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.680]   Like, he had another house where he kept older women,
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.040]   but I don't know, I never met any of them.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.400]   I just remember pulling up there, he would run drugs in,
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.600]   and come back out, and we would leave.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.600]   - Okay. - But everyone,
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.440]   like, it's hearsay, but everyone was like,
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.200]   that's where he keeps the girls that, like,
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.040]   were no longer teenagers, they're addicted to substances
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:02.080]   because that's how he would get girls to, like, stay,
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.000]   essentially, they would rely on him for drugs.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.960]   And then he just kind of hid them away,
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.360]   and I think those women were working, like, the street
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.000]   where we were doing, like, private in-calls.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.200]   - Private, you know. - Yeah.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.640]   - Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:20.360]   So how many years after you get out of this situation
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.200]   is he finally, they build a case, and they arrest him?
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.200]   - Year, like, so long, like, over a decade.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.960]   - And what did they get him for?
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.440]   'Cause you just said he's out for parole, 2028?
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.960]   - 2028, he's out for parole.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:37.960]   It was, like, prostitution, solicitate, like, all the,
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.440]   everything was, everything he got in trouble for
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:44.040]   was for, like, prostitution-related crimes.
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.360]   - And that's a--
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.080]   - Like, I have all of his court transcripts
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.840]   that I'm sifting through right now, but that's it.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.440]   There was no rape on there, which really bothered me.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.600]   - Right. - 'Cause I had reached out
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.960]   to a detective in Southfield,
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.240]   'cause that's where he got caught up.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.600]   And I was like, "Hey, I had interactions with this man.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.160]   "He raped me when I was a young teen.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.520]   "What is the statute of limitations?"
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.480]   And she was very, it's like,
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.280]   almost like they don't wanna deal with it,
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.500]   'cause it's so much paperwork.
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.780]   She's like, "Well, you need to write down
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:13.920]   "every single thing that happened
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.360]   "the whole time you were with him and send it to me."
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.320]   And I wasn't, like, at a place in my healing journey
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.000]   where I could sit down and write everything down,
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.360]   step-by-step, like, that's a lot, it takes a lot.
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.360]   I'd rather talk about it, but that's not really an option.
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:32.600]   - So, all this happens, you go back with your mom,
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:33.680]   and you said you didn't really tell her
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.700]   the extent of things.
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:38.080]   Like, what was your life like for those next,
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.040]   like, how did you move on from this?
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.240]   Was there, like, what happened after this?
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.000]   - I pretended it didn't happen.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.320]   - Really, and you're what age at the time?
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:53.320]   - I was, like, 15, 16, well, I met my son's dad
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.260]   when I was 16, so when I came back with my mom,
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.480]   she sent me to alternative education,
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.160]   like an adult education, with all the bad kids.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.000]   - Yeah.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.440]   - So, I met this girl there, and we used to go
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.680]   to River Rouge all the time,
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.000]   which is, like, on south of Detroit.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   And I met her cousin, he was 24, I was 16,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.800]   and I got pregnant, like, a month or two months
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.560]   after we met.
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.200]   - Is this guy a good dude?
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.040]   - No.
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.280]   I raise my kids by myself, he's not involved.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.120]   - Really?
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:30.480]   - But, yeah, he was, like, a good dad for a while,
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.080]   and then I left, because he was emotionally abusive.
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:34.920]   - Yeah.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.680]   - So, I left once I, like, grew up,
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.020]   and, like, realized this is not okay.
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:43.280]   And after that, he is not involved.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.200]   He pays $46 a week in child support.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.920]   - This dude does?
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.040]   - For two kids, yeah.
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.680]   - Well, you are a warrior.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.940]   Yeah, I wanna, like, bring some attention to this,
[00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:00.040]   because, so, I'm sure all these things that come out,
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.940]   like the Sound of Freedom movie and all these things,
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.860]   I'm sure they hit a little different
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:08.120]   for you being kinda, like, in that situation.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.060]   The other day, I was on a Zoom call
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:13.300]   with Child Rescue Coalition.
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:14.580]   I don't know if you know what that is.
[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:15.420]   - Yeah.
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:16.300]   - They're a non-profit for,
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.180]   but they were walking me through how they developed
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:21.360]   the software to, like, figure out these guys
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.200]   who are, you know, creating material,
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.760]   and they're able to track them.
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.840]   They give all this information to law enforcement.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.280]   All law enforcement has to do is go
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:34.480]   and look at these cases, look at the,
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.600]   and they can, all they gotta do is call the Comcast
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.600]   or whoever it is and get the physical address,
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.680]   but they, so many cases are left, like, on--
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.000]   - They don't even follow through on it.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:44.840]   - They don't even, like--
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.660]   - It's so frustrating.
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:49.920]   - To believe, like, how much this issue is, like, ignored.
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:53.400]   Like, it's one of the most prevalent, like, crimes
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.120]   that is not really talked about,
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.320]   and I was asking them the same question, like,
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.760]   why do you think it's not more mainstream?
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.580]   Why do you think when "Sound of Freedom" comes out,
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:04.920]   some of the mainstream media outlets
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.960]   are kinda, like, pushing back on this movie?
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.360]   I just couldn't wrap my head around it.
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:14.240]   Do you have, like, any thoughts on why you think that is?
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.120]   - I, this, I haven't seen "Sound of Freedom."
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.120]   I just spoke about this, actually, last week.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.520]   I did a podcast with this man I met in prison
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.760]   doing a basketball program.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.160]   We went to a prison between the lines
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.720]   and played basketball with the inmates,
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:32.320]   and he has a podcast, and we spoke about "Sound of Freedom"
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:37.320]   and how there are certain undertones in the movie.
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:42.320]   I think that, for me, these movies are great for awareness,
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.400]   but it very much, like, makes me feel, like,
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.160]   a Wayfair type of situation.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.860]   I don't know if you remember that, like, media storm
[00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:50.720]   where, like, they were, like,
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:53.280]   they're shipping kids in cabinets.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.040]   It was crazy, and--
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:55.880]   - Do you not believe in that,
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.040]   or do you think that happened, or not?
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:01.640]   - I, no, I'm so, I just feel like it was such a conspiracy.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.600]   - So the conspiracy side of all this, you know,
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:08.080]   these rich, white dudes that are, you know,
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.960]   getting these kids and doing this crazy stuff,
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.120]   you don't really believe in that side of it?
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:15.600]   - I do, 'cause there were rich, white dudes buying me.
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.800]   - Yeah. - So, yeah.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.800]   I mean, that's another huge problem.
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.520]   Why aren't the men who are purchasing children,
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.740]   why aren't they going to prison?
[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:25.580]   - Yeah.
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:30.580]   - Why is my pimp in prison for all those years?
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:34.760]   I mean, he deserves it, but all the men that purchased me
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.720]   and the girls that were with me, like, where are they at?
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.760]   They're just out, like, living their life.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.920]   - It's a supply and demand situation, so.
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.280]   - They may have a whole family, whole kids.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.120]   - They have no idea.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.160]   - And they're, no idea that these guys
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.800]   are going to hotels. - Yeah.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.580]   - Did you ever, in your mind, like,
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:56.760]   want to expose these individuals that you met,
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.440]   or was there no-- - If I knew who they were,
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.200]   I would put them on blast.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.480]   If they have daughters and their daughters have sleepovers,
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.720]   like, these are the things I think about.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.640]   So, you are married, I always pay attention
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.000]   to, like, rings, or if they're putting something
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.040]   in their pocket when they come in.
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.280]   It's their ring, usually.
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.800]   And I'm like, I'm not stupid.
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:21.400]   Like, you start to, like, learn game really quickly,
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.840]   'cause you have to.
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.600]   And I would just think about that, like,
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.000]   if you have a daughter at home,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   or if you have a son, or whatever, like,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.840]   what are you doing at home?
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.400]   Does your wife know what's going on?
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.040]   Or you're not using protection
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.480]   with the children you're sleeping with,
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.700]   and neither are 15 other men who are doing the same thing,
[00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.680]   and then you're taking those things back to your family,
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:44.800]   or, it's just crazy to me.
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:49.280]   - It's really hard to talk about, honestly,
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:52.180]   just because it can happen to so many people.
[00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.440]   So many people don't grow up in a stable household,
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.000]   and I feel like those are the, kind of,
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.520]   the environments that it can happen.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:01.180]   But even, like, you know, I've heard so many stories
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:06.180]   about even, like, kids at a park or something,
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:09.020]   and their parent turns their head for a second,
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:13.580]   and it just, I just don't understand
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:18.580]   why it's not, like, pushed more of it as an issue.
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:22.900]   That's the thing that I, kind of, like,
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:24.500]   when we had the opportunity to speak about,
[00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.820]   that was the thing that I, kind of, wanted to get across,
[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:30.980]   is, like, this is, like, a mainstream issue,
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.300]   but it's getting pushed to the back burner.
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:33.120]   And that's why I think, like,
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.140]   the conspiracy side of it,
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:37.220]   like, why, is it the same people in power,
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:39.100]   you think, that are doing it?
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:40.740]   Or what, do you think the police officers,
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.980]   kind of, like, knew who this guy was,
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.740]   and they just, kind of, were involved?
[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.940]   - They knew who he was, 'cause they warned my mom,
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:51.180]   but I don't know, like, how,
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:55.160]   as far as, like, I think about, like,
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.820]   Jeffrey Epstein or whatever.
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:57.660]   - I was gonna ask you about that.
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.960]   - And, like, the documentaries about him,
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:03.420]   and how, and the woman that was with him,
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:06.340]   how all of it is so focused on them,
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:10.960]   and not what the damage they did
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.660]   has done to the people that were affected.
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:16.980]   So, we have to, like, live with it forever.
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.480]   I have to get therapy.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.420]   I have to figure out how to make my life work as a mom,
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.460]   and business owner, and how I interact with the public.
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:25.300]   You know, for years,
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:27.060]   I couldn't go outside by myself at night.
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:29.420]   Like, I would have full-on panic attack.
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:32.120]   If a man was anywhere behind me,
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.940]   like, full-on fight or flight.
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:35.220]   Like, I'd be shaking.
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:36.100]   - Yeah.
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:40.020]   - And it's taken so long to get past it,
[00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:42.060]   and it's not really fair.
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:43.580]   - It's not fair at all.
[00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:47.460]   I mean, I think that part of the putting this kind of,
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.660]   at least stopping it a little bit,
[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.700]   is kind of going after these guys
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.820]   who just think that because they have money,
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:57.780]   or because they can do these things to these children,
[00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:59.700]   women in general.
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.600]   But obviously, like, it's so many people
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:02.440]   that are affected by it.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.000]   Even, like, there's so many people
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.040]   that don't talk about it 'til they're way older,
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:10.320]   but, like, it may have happened by an uncle,
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.880]   or someone else when they're young.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.560]   How have you been able to find, like,
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.480]   any sort of healing, like, from this?
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:22.200]   - Well, the interview last year was a big step for me.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.900]   I didn't talk about that side of things ever.
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:29.300]   So, there's, like, well, I'm a single mom, obviously,
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.520]   like, starting to date, and, like,
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:35.920]   carrying the weight of what I did as a teenager is hard,
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.300]   because, like, regardless of if it's my fault or not,
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.320]   or if it was consensual or not,
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:43.420]   I was like, I have, like, bodies.
[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:47.680]   Like, at 36, like, between the age of, like, 13 and 15,
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:52.120]   like, there were a lot of people, like, sexually.
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.640]   So, I think the shame tied in with that,
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:55.920]   I didn't wanna talk about.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.760]   I didn't tell my mom, like,
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.280]   I didn't want her to think about me as, like,
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:05.080]   being promiscuous or being a prostitute, essentially.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:08.340]   Like, I don't wanna be put into that category.
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:09.800]   Not that there's anything wrong with it.
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.100]   People that consensually do it
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.520]   and want to do it on their own, that's their own thing.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.780]   But when you're a kid,
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:17.940]   I don't think it fits in the same category.
[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:20.520]   You're not working. - No, of course not.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.440]   - It's not your job.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:24.800]   So, I think in dating and, like,
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.440]   trying to build my confidence and, like,
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:30.180]   feel empowered when I'm interacting with men,
[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:33.080]   I kind of had to just be like, this is, like, me.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.640]   This is what happened.
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.480]   This is my history.
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:36.440]   It's part of who I am.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.820]   It's why I do a lot of things I do.
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.740]   So, it's important that people know that.
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:45.680]   And yeah, I don't, that's just, it took a long time.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.240]   And when my mom finally saw the interview,
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.900]   she, like, lost her mind.
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:51.740]   - Yeah, I'm sure.
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:53.040]   - She was like, I had no idea.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:53.880]   And I'm just like,
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:56.200]   I didn't want you to think I was, like, dirty.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.880]   - How did she react to that interview?
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.040]   - She was hurt.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:04.120]   - Just, I'm sure she felt like, yeah.
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.440]   - People came for her.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.600]   - Yeah, I'm sure she felt, you know,
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.280]   guilty about things as well.
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.400]   - But I ran, like, I don't blame her.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.240]   She did the best she could with what she had.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.720]   She was severely abused, lost a child,
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.120]   never went to therapy.
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:22.200]   Wasn't, I feel like, our parents' generation,
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.160]   they aren't as in touch with that.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:27.320]   It's more of, like, a forget it and move on.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.560]   Don't live in the past kind of thing.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:32.120]   When you don't realize your past is always with you,
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.340]   it, like, affects everything that you do.
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:35.380]   - Right.
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.880]   So there's a such thing as called, like, generational,
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:41.260]   kind of, like, curses or generational, you know, traumas,
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:44.860]   where, you know, maybe the parent of a child
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.840]   is doing something, but the child sees it,
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.680]   and then they grow up, and the same thing happens to them,
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.980]   or they do the same thing.
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.680]   - Are you, like, obviously, you know,
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:56.300]   speaking about a healing from it and things like that,
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.780]   you've broken that, but was that, do you think,
[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.460]   because of how your father treated your mom,
[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:06.800]   that, in turn, like, affected you to,
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.420]   do you think, how do you think that all went together?
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.860]   - Yeah, I still deal with dad stuff.
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:16.860]   So, I am not really great at relationships.
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:20.400]   I am just, like, always waiting for the person to bail
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.100]   at any given moment.
[00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:24.380]   I'm never, like, comfortable and content.
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:26.460]   I'm always on the edge of my seat,
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.400]   waiting for the shoe to drop.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.900]   They'll be, like, oh, I like you so much,
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:33.280]   but, and I'm, like, just wait until you see, like,
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.720]   the trauma stuff, or I talk about that, like,
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:38.280]   and then they can't handle it, and they dip,
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:41.680]   and then I'm, like, oh, I was right, like, they left.
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:45.340]   So it's almost, like, this cycle of, I do self-sabotage.
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.420]   I've had, like, good relationships that I just,
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:50.860]   it's almost, like, you don't know how to act
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:52.800]   when somebody's, like, genuinely into you,
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.600]   or being nice, or treating you nicely.
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.940]   It's kind of, like, why are you being nice to me?
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.220]   Because, like, James did that.
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:02.820]   - Yeah, yeah. - And look what happens.
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:05.460]   So I'm just, like, what's the motive?
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:09.740]   - Has any of this, 'cause I know, like, you know,
[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.740]   people go through trauma in different ways.
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:15.140]   A lot of people's trauma doesn't relate to yours at all.
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:17.740]   I feel like people react in, like, one of two ways.
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:20.920]   Sometimes it draws them kind of, like,
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:24.660]   oh, I have to go to God with this, and let him heal me,
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.460]   or else I'll never be whole again, I'll never feel whole.
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:29.140]   And then some people, it's, like,
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.060]   because such bad things happened to me,
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.300]   and I see so much bad in the world,
[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:36.700]   I want nothing to do with God or anything.
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:40.300]   How did you kind of react to all this, in terms of that?
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:43.060]   - Religion, or God in general?
[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:44.500]   - Just God in general, I would say.
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.460]   'Cause I think, like, people that have been through a lot,
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:51.460]   regardless of what it is, they either, like, you know,
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:52.940]   lean on God, and that's the only thing
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:54.700]   that kind of, like, helps them,
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:57.380]   or they want nothing to do with God,
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:00.500]   just 'cause they see all the bad in the world.
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.300]   - That's hard for me.
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:03.300]   - I'm sure it is.
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.980]   - I definitely went through a spell
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:10.020]   where I was, like, trying to figure out what I was.
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:12.260]   Like, am I, like, a Buddhist?
[00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:15.580]   Am I, I was vegan for so long, I was sober for 10 years.
[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:17.340]   Like, I was so afraid I was gonna be, like,
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:20.100]   my dad, so I didn't touch anything.
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:22.780]   And I couldn't find anything that, like,
[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:26.420]   aligned with how I feel about things.
[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:31.740]   But I have, like, had moments where I'm curious about it,
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:36.060]   or I want to know more, but I haven't actually, like,
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.740]   since my grandfather passed away,
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:41.020]   I don't think I've, like, spoken to God,
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:46.020]   or tried to get assistance in that way.
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:49.020]   Because, like, my life is very much, like, you,
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.740]   like, I have to do it.
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:51.580]   - Yeah.
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:52.420]   - That's just what it is.
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:53.900]   People are like, "Oh, you're a great mom.
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:55.700]   Like, you don't have to do that."
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:59.380]   Yeah, I do, because my son's dad is not there.
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:00.580]   Like, they're young men.
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:02.580]   I have to, like, try to show them
[00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.780]   how to, like, keep it moving,
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:06.780]   regardless of what you're going through.
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:09.380]   And I don't feel like I can rely
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.860]   on anyone outside of myself.
[00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:13.540]   So when it comes to God,
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:17.100]   it's very hard for me to, like, put my trust
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.220]   in that source.
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:20.060]   - Yeah.
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:24.540]   - Because I don't see it or feel it in my life.
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.540]   - That's understandable.
[00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:28.340]   Do you feel like,
[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:30.060]   what do you feel like your purpose is
[00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:30.900]   at this point in your life?
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.220]   Do you feel like your story,
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.340]   I mean, obviously you've touched so many people.
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:35.860]   I mean, all you gotta do is look in the comments
[00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:37.820]   of your interviews and see so many people
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:40.500]   that either relate to your story or, you know,
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.260]   want to help out.
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:46.020]   Do you feel like through everything that's bad,
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:49.220]   it has shaped your purpose at all now in life, or?
[00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.260]   - Yeah, I know what it is.
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:51.860]   I know what my purpose is.
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:55.300]   It's, like, crazy, 'cause I've figured it out finally.
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:58.380]   And it involved going to prison,
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:00.580]   which was wild.
[00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:02.260]   So I was the only girl that went.
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:05.340]   And I went with a really good friend of mine.
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:09.620]   And going into a place that is all men,
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:12.020]   who have all done,
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:15.740]   I mean, bad things in some capacity, right?
[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.220]   Things that are illegal or haven't,
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:20.420]   and they're there, you know, not having to be.
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:22.980]   Like, that was so big for me,
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:25.700]   and so overwhelming emotionally,
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:28.980]   because I wasn't prepared for how I was gonna feel.
[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:30.140]   Everyone's like, "You're crazy.
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:31.780]   "They're gonna, like, be inappropriate.
[00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:33.060]   "They're gonna cross boundaries."
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:34.500]   And it was not like that at all.
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:38.060]   Like, they were so respectful, and I felt safe.
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:39.740]   And we were just out in the open,
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:41.820]   like, hanging out, talking, learning about each other.
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:45.500]   I even had a pimp come up to me after our last game,
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.020]   like, the last day.
[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:49.460]   It was like, "Hey, I'm here for pimping and pandering.
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:52.340]   "Like, I just wanted to introduce myself."
[00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:53.180]   And it was great.
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:55.140]   It was like a full circle moment for me.
[00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:55.980]   - Yeah.
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:59.820]   - So my view on this issue
[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:03.900]   is, like, very much a, like, societal, systemic issue.
[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:08.500]   So my pimp, like, I can only assume he grew up in Detroit.
[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:11.380]   There's no opportunity in the city at that time.
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:14.540]   It is desolate, like, despair.
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:16.580]   There's not even, like, a target.
[00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:20.140]   You have to go outside the city to get, like, anything.
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:23.140]   So imagine just, like, being trapped in a city.
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:25.020]   You have no means of, like, getting out
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.660]   or going to school.
[00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:28.260]   Like, all the schools were closing down.
[00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:31.420]   There's no recreation centers for kids.
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:32.780]   So you're growing up with this issue,
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:35.100]   and you're seeing men in your communities sell drugs
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:37.460]   or pimp or whatever they're doing.
[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:40.020]   And that's just, like, what you do.
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:42.700]   Like, it's a societal thing.
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:46.260]   So I don't view him as, like, a bad person,
[00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:49.100]   because I'm, like, he, that's all he knew.
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:51.140]   He was surviving.
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:54.420]   - I think that takes incredible strength and compassion.
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.780]   But you are right.
[00:39:56.780 --> 00:40:00.860]   I mean, any, I feel like any community where, you know,
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:03.380]   the members of the community get into,
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:05.020]   I mean, this is kind of a separate issue.
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:08.700]   I feel like, you know, no matter how bad the community is,
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:12.780]   there's no really justification for that.
[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.500]   But when it comes to, like, you know,
[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:16.700]   the violence in communities or selling drugs
[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:18.660]   or some of these other things, you're right.
[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:21.020]   It is very systemic.
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:21.860]   - It's environmental.
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:23.020]   It's, like, what you see.
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:24.460]   Like, nurture, nature.
[00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:26.780]   Like, did he have a dad?
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:27.700]   Probably not.
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:28.540]   - Right.
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:30.660]   - Like, there's just so many elements that come into play.
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:32.740]   And yes, he was a grown man and continued to do it.
[00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:35.340]   And he should be in prison, absolutely.
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:39.460]   I just tried to find the humanity in the situation
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:41.020]   and understand the psychology.
[00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:42.620]   Like, why did it happen?
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:44.340]   So I'm not like, this person's just evil.
[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:45.740]   He's just bad.
[00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:47.460]   'Cause I don't think that he was born,
[00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:49.460]   he wasn't born that way.
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:50.940]   - So you would say you in your heart
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:52.540]   are fully forgiving this individual?
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:53.900]   - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:57.460]   And I would like, I'm hoping to sit with him one day.
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:00.500]   Like, go before he gets paroled and sit and talk to him.
[00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:01.980]   That's the goal.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:03.820]   But that's why, also why I went to the prison.
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:08.820]   Because these men are like, they're still human.
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:12.380]   And I think if more women that were survivors
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:16.180]   or people that have survived crime would sit down
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:21.180]   and build some sort of human connection with the other side,
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:24.260]   like, there could be so much healing that can take place.
[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:25.100]   You know what I mean?
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.420]   - Just forgiveness in general.
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:29.300]   And people see that and more people
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:30.380]   feel the courage to do that.
[00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:31.340]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:33.500]   - So that is what you view now as your purpose?
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.500]   - Yeah. - I think that's huge.
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:37.020]   - Yeah, and awareness, definitely.
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:40.740]   For teen girls, like, that's my focus.
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:42.980]   - How do you think young girls can avoid,
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:46.020]   I mean, obviously some people, it just happens.
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:46.860]   They can't avoid it.
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:51.180]   How would you warn people or kind of like,
[00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:53.420]   how can they avoid it, you think?
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:56.500]   - It's hard because I don't put it on the teen girls.
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:57.620]   - Of course not.
[00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.940]   - I put it on the parents or the guardians.
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:04.180]   So I feel like it starts much younger than that.
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:07.180]   So if your daughters are like,
[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:08.780]   you're noticing they're like in their head
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:11.380]   or they're depressed or they're in their room all the time
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:12.900]   or they're always like on their device,
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:16.140]   like talking to God knows who, right?
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:18.740]   Like you have to find a way to connect with them
[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:22.900]   and reach them in a way that's not like authoritative
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:26.500]   or you're not like telling them what to do.
[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.740]   Like, it's hard for parents to do that.
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:30.860]   But like, if my daughter is throwing a tantrum
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:33.620]   and I'm getting like frustrated,
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:36.500]   I will just grab her up and hug her
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.740]   and it immediately diffuses the situation.
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:41.240]   Like she's not throwing a tantrum anymore.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.580]   It's crazy.
[00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:45.340]   Like, instead of like pushing your kids away
[00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:48.140]   and like telling them to like stop acting that way
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:50.340]   or you're grounded, I'm taking this, I'm taking that,
[00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:52.700]   like bring them in and give them affection
[00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:54.780]   and spend time with them and talk to them
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.980]   and like get to know them on like a human level because--
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:42:59.220]   - I think that's crazy you say that
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:01.700]   'cause even like my childhood,
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:05.020]   like my parents like talk about this now,
[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:08.000]   like with me, like I was the rebel of all the children,
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.900]   like always getting my phone taken.
[00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:13.740]   I got my phone taken for a year one time.
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:16.620]   Like who gets their phone taken for a year?
[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:19.980]   But like I talked to my parents about it now,
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:24.620]   I was like, because you guys didn't let me like do stuff
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:25.660]   and instead I was always grounded,
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:26.620]   you were taking my phone and this and that,
[00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:28.500]   it just made me want to rebel more.
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:30.780]   Like I never like ran away far,
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:32.100]   but I mean, Sierra will tell you,
[00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:33.620]   like there was a couple of times I did,
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:36.940]   like I was so mad that they were making me do,
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:38.660]   and they kind of recognize that now,
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:40.640]   but I think like for me and my kids,
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.040]   I think about how I parent my kids
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.200]   and it's yeah, it's more exactly what you say.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.940]   It's like instead of telling these kids,
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:49.460]   no, you can't do this, stay in line, this and that,
[00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.740]   all that's gonna do is make them kind of rebel more,
[00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:52.580]   but when you can--
[00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:54.180]   - Also hide things.
[00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:55.020]   - Yeah.
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:56.700]   So if you're like taking their,
[00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.420]   like I don't take their devices.
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:43:59.580]   If I'm gonna do something,
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:01.460]   like my son like backtalking me
[00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:03.220]   or not doing what he's supposed to be doing,
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:05.820]   I'll just like shut the internet off.
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:07.260]   I'm not gonna like take something
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:09.260]   that like I bought him a PC for his 18th birthday,
[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:11.840]   it was like $2,000 computer.
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:14.540]   And I wouldn't take that from him.
[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:17.140]   Like so many people, like his dad has taken so much from him
[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:21.060]   like stolen money from him, like birthday money,
[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:22.620]   and I would never do that.
[00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:23.700]   So I think as a parent,
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:25.500]   just like making sure you're aware
[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:27.580]   of what's going on in your house.
[00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:30.060]   The internet is a dangerous place, straight up.
[00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:32.340]   Social media, crazy.
[00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:34.860]   I'm just monitoring all the time as much as I can
[00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:37.740]   without it being in a way that's like,
[00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:39.460]   I'm gonna watch what you're doing.
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:40.980]   It's more like creating an environment
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:43.420]   where your kids are comfortable talking to you about things
[00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:45.140]   and not feeling like they're gonna get in trouble
[00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.500]   or judged or whatever.
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:50.540]   Like if I mess up and I'm like snap at my kids
[00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:52.540]   or I'm my temper's short that day,
[00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:54.820]   and I say something like out of left field
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:56.180]   that I shouldn't have said,
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:57.420]   I will sit with them and be like,
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.860]   I'm sorry that I said that.
[00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:00.820]   I'm having a rough day.
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:04.180]   I lost control of my emotions and I apologize.
[00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:06.340]   Like I didn't mean that.
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:09.000]   So they know like, okay, well, she's taking accountability.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.080]   So like, it feels more like a mutual relationship
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:17.100]   instead of like you're on top all the time.
[00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:18.300]   - Right. - Yeah.
[00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:23.300]   - Well, I mean, yeah, I feel like obviously
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.500]   through all the bad, you've come to a place
[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.940]   where like this is, people like you
[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:30.780]   is what this situation in the world needs
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.200]   and like people with your bravery and courage
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:37.060]   and vulnerability like for this kind of issue.
[00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:39.980]   And I don't know, I mean, obviously we live in a,
[00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:43.120]   this is an evil world and a lot of bad things go on,
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:45.940]   but I feel like you sharing your story
[00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:49.820]   is just, it's important.
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:50.760]   Like it really is.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:54.280]   And I just, I feel like you individually,
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:57.600]   like I really hope God makes himself real to you.
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:02.580]   I've never like prayed for anybody on a podcast
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:04.380]   and it's not because I would pray for you
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:07.180]   because I like feel, I mean, obviously I feel terrible
[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:08.300]   about what happened to you,
[00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:10.700]   but it's more just all you went through,
[00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.780]   like God is gonna use your story
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:16.580]   in a way that is like really powerful for a lot of people
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:18.580]   that you save a lot of lives.
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:22.180]   You give people courage to talk up about their situation.
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:24.860]   So I just wanted to ask you if I could pray for you
[00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:27.060]   and then I wanted to invite you to church on Sunday
[00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:28.500]   'cause you said you haven't been to church for a while.
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:30.900]   - I haven't been to church since I was like 12.
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:32.000]   - So let's go Sunday.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.580]   So yeah, if you're good with that,
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:35.700]   I just wanted to end this podcast
[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:36.620]   just praying for you, if that's cool.
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:38.180]   - Yeah, that's totally fine.
[00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:39.780]   - All right.
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:41.420]   Dear Lord, thank you for Kat.
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:43.260]   I wanna thank you.
[00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:44.920]   Just the woman she is, Lord,
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:46.380]   and I just wanna thank you for the healing
[00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:48.460]   that you've brought about in her life
[00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:49.900]   and giving her the vulnerability
[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:51.700]   and the courage to share her story.
[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:55.060]   Just thank you for the woman she is.
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:57.300]   I ask that you make yourself real to her.
[00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:01.520]   Heal her in ways that she didn't even know was possible.
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:05.620]   Show yourself to her, make her whole,
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:09.060]   give her complete confidence and wholeness in herself,
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:10.700]   and just help her realize that the things
[00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:13.660]   that happened to her are not her fault.
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:16.740]   There's no shame, there's no guilt there.
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:18.780]   You take that all on yourself,
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:20.380]   and just please show her that.
[00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:23.820]   We love you and we appreciate you,
[00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:26.460]   and we thank you that even though terrible things happen
[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:29.880]   to all of us, that you somehow can turn that
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:31.940]   into a beautiful story.
[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:33.080]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:35.700]   Cool. - Thank you.
[00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:39.340]   - Well, I appreciate you being on this podcast so much.
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:41.060]   This was for sure one of my favorite episodes
[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:43.140]   just because this is just an issue
[00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:45.020]   that I've always been passionate about.
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:47.240]   I was always confused why it wasn't kind of brought
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:48.340]   to the light a little bit more,
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:50.740]   so it means a lot to me that you were willing
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:51.580]   to get on here, and I thank you.
[00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:53.260]   - Yeah, thank you for having me.
[00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.100]   - Of course.
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:58.020]   - Hopefully lots of people see and behave differently.
[00:47:58.020 --> 00:47:59.300]   That's all I can hope for.
[00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:00.580]   - 100%. - Yeah.
[00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:03.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:05.740]   (upbeat music)
