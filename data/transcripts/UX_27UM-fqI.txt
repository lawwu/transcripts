[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200]   The words to which I should like to call your attention are to be found in the Gospel according
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:13.120]   to St. John in the first chapter, reading verses 12 and 13.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.120]   The twelfth and the thirteenth verses in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.120]   John.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:29.340]   "But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to
[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.240]   them that believe on his name, which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:43.240]   flesh, nor of the will of men, but of God."
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:51.400]   Now we are considering these two verses, this great and all important statement, from a
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.680]   particular angle and standpoint.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.560]   We have considered the proclamation itself, the truth itself, and we have seen that it
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.680]   has told us that the ultimate object of the coming of the Son of God into this world,
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.780]   the ultimate object of the incarnation in other words, was that those who believe on
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.200]   him might become the children of God.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.000]   It is ever necessary to repeat that, that our salvation does not consist only in being
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   forgiven.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.320]   Thank God for forgiveness of sins, but that is merely the beginning of our salvation.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.520]   To be reconciled to God is a thing which we can never overestimate, but we are actually
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:45.400]   offered something even greater than that, and that is that we become the children of
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.400]   God.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.040]   That is the statement.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.960]   And therefore we are arguing like this, that surely nothing is more important, therefore,
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.440]   from every standpoint, than that we should be quite certain and assured that we are the
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.920]   children of God.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.300]   This is necessary, of course, for our own personal spiritual well-being.
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.880]   We are meant to rejoice in the Lord always, and you cannot rejoice in him unless you are
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.320]   certain of your relationship to him.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:26.320]   So from the standpoint of our own happiness, peace, joy, it is essential that we should
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.680]   be clear about this.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.320]   But still more important is the fact that we can only truly function as instruments
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:41.720]   and channels and vehicles of the grace of God if, being delivered from all concern about
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:49.360]   ourselves and assured of our sonship, we can give ourselves to prayer and intercession
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.640]   and active work in the propagation of the gospel in various ways.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.640]   In other words, nothing is more important than assurance.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.720]   The joy of the Lord is your strength, says an Old Testament word.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.360]   And how true it is.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:12.680]   An uncertain, unhappy Christian is ineffective always and is a very poor recommendation for
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.680]   the gospel.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:21.000]   The joy of the Lord is your strength, and joy is only possible when there is an assurance
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   clear.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.800]   So we are trying to test ourselves to make sure that we have this assurance that we are
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.280]   the children of God.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.840]   Now, we have been adopting an obvious expedient.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.960]   We have been taking the human analogy.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.760]   How does one know that one is a member of an earthly human family?
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.120]   And we worked it out in this way, that there is a relationship to the Son, the Son of God,
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:04:00.160]   the Son, a consequent relation to the Father, and a relationship to the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.120]   And we have been working our way steadily through those three relationships.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.760]   And we have been testing ourselves in terms of what the Bible tells us about that triple
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.720]   relationship.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:22.320]   And in dealing with the Spirit, we came eventually to consider the manifestation of the fruit
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.920]   of the Spirit in our own personal lives.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.840]   If the Spirit of God dwells in us, well then, we proceed to manifest and to show something
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.200]   of the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:45.720]   And so we applied to ourselves the nine differentiating aspects of the fruit of the Spirit—love,
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:52.960]   joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, meekness, temperance, faith.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.160]   Now in doing that, in applying that particular test of the fruit of the Spirit, we were driven,
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.760]   of course, to consider ourselves in our relationship to other people.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.440]   And from that, it seems to me, there follows the next big test.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.600]   And the next big test, of course, is none other than this—our relationship to the
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.980]   family.
[00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:25.760]   You see how it works out—relationship to Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:33.300]   Then we look more at the earthly human level—others who are with us in this relationship.
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.440]   In other words, the family to which we belong.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:45.240]   Childhood immediately implies the whole notion of a family and of a family relationship.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.600]   And having looked, as it were, at our vertical relationships, we are now going to look at
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.560]   the horizontal relationship.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:01.080]   And this is something which I think I shall be able to show you again, which is a very
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.160]   practical, a very thorough, and a very subtle test.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:14.320]   Now this relationship to the family is something that arises, of course, of necessity.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.680]   And that is why there is such space and attention given to a consideration of this particular
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.400]   matter in the pages of the New Testament.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.240]   In the epistles in particular, one is constantly finding references to this.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.080]   They are epistles written to the members of the Church, and they are concerned, every
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.000]   one of them, somewhere or another, about the relationships of the members of the Churches
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   to one another.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.800]   It is quite inevitable.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:49.360]   And our Lord himself pointed this out, that this was the way in which the world might
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.840]   know that we are his disciples, if we love one another.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:59.720]   It is in his high priestly prayer, one of the last things that he said, one of the last
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:06.280]   things he prayed for, was that his people might be one and might be kept as one, because
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.400]   the world is looking on.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:14.700]   And it is only thus that the world can know who they are and who he is, and why God ever
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.920]   sent him into this world.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:24.000]   So you see, it is a subject, I say, which is dealt with very extensively in the various
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.640]   books of the New Testament.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.160]   Now, we must look at it like this.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.200]   This is why I say it is inevitable.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:40.000]   Though we are saved individually, though we are saved one by one, and that is a fundamental
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.600]   doctrine of the New Testament, we are all nevertheless saved in the same way.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.600]   I don't mean by that that all the details are going to be identical in every case.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:59.360]   But I do mean that there is only one way whereby one can become a Christian, and that is through
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.720]   being born again.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.400]   Nothing else makes one a Christian but that.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.440]   That of course leads to repentance and faith and so on.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.620]   These are the manifestations of new life and the new outlook.
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.960]   But that is essential.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.920]   We all must needs be born again.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:23.160]   "Except a man be born again, said our Lord to Nicodemus, he cannot see the kingdom of
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.160]   God.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.280]   Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.720]   That is the only way.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:37.160]   And it is in that way that we all become Christian.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.280]   It happens to us separately and individually.
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:45.880]   We are not saved as nations, we are not saved as families, not of blood, nor of the will
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.480]   of the flesh, nor of the will of men.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.000]   It is of God.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.320]   And it is a separate action in the case of every single one.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:02.160]   But because it happens to all of us, at once we are brought into a common position.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.280]   Now, the New Testament makes a great deal about this.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.400]   It points out this fundamental solidarity.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:16.400]   It points out our solidarity in sin and shame and failure and need.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.480]   It says that all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.960]   Not only some, all.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.480]   There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.680]   There is no difference between the Jew and the Greek, all are the same.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.400]   All have fallen short of the glory of God.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.600]   There is this oneness.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:43.520]   But then it also has a great deal to say about the common salvation.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.080]   That there is only one salvation.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.520]   That is the whole miracle of redeeming grace, as the apostle Paul in writing to the Ephesians
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:55.760]   and especially in chapter 2, that he has broken down the middle wall of partition.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.760]   He is made of twain one new man in Christ.
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:07.520]   Jew and Gentile, together, one in sin, one in salvation, believing in the same Saviour,
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.640]   having received the same birth.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:10.640]   Very well.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:18.200]   Therefore I say that though we are actually saved individually, and it is a separate experience,
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.440]   God does personal dealings with us, every one of us, one by one.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.920]   We can't be Christians without that.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:33.260]   Because it is nevertheless the same essential action, immediately we are brought together
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.480]   as a company of people.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.040]   But you see the scriptures go even further than that.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:49.320]   It has this great doctrine which teaches us that we are all made the children of God.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:53.480]   We are all adopted into the family of God.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:59.800]   Now, the apostle Paul, of course, pre-eminently teaches this particular doctrine.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:04.720]   He points out in the eighth chapter of the epistle to the Romans that so many of us are
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.560]   led by the Spirit of God, they are the children of God.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:16.760]   God he says has not given to us the spirit of fear again, or the spirit of bondage, but
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:22.120]   we have received, he says, the spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.080]   That's the position.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.440]   This adoption, spirit of adoption, we have the spirit of adoption because we have been
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:35.000]   adopted, or as he puts it still more clearly in Galatians 4, "Because we have become
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.560]   the sons of God, God hath sent the spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, 'Abba,
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.560]   Father.'"
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:49.280]   This is just indicative of the fact that we are, I say, over and above being forgiven
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:54.120]   and brought together as a company of people who have been saved in the same way, we have
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.200]   all been adopted in the same way into the children of God.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:03.960]   So the apostle is able to say at the end of Ephesians 2 something like this, "Now therefore
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:12.280]   here no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.160]   household of God."
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.160]   That's it.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:22.680]   We are more than just citizens in the same kingdom, though that is a wonderful thing.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:27.720]   From that God has adopted us right into his family.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.460]   Whether we are Jews or Gentiles by nature doesn't matter.
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:39.320]   We together have become members of the household of God, the family of God himself in him.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:44.800]   And in the same way, all the New Testament teaching with regard to the church as the
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.160]   body of Christ emphasizes the same thing.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:54.280]   The apostle says in 1 Corinthians 12, 13, "For by one Spirit, or in one Spirit, have
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:13:00.720]   we all been baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Greeks."
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.680]   Well, very well then.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:09.560]   The whole of the teaching then of the New Testament is to emphasize this particular
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:15.720]   relationship which we have to the members of the family.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:19.900]   And it's put in various pictures and analogies in that way.
[00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.820]   But the scripture goes even beyond that.
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:28.800]   And it puts it to us in the form of explicit and perfectly plain statements.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.520]   We have read some of them at the beginning.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:35.600]   The most notable of all, of course, is the first epistle of John, the third chapter,
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.400]   and the fourteenth verse.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:48.920]   We know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:49.960]   Nothing can be plainer.
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:54.920]   We know that we have passed from death to life because we love the brethren.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.720]   That's the thing we want to know.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.520]   How can I know that I'm a child of God?
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.080]   Here's the test.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.080]   I love the brethren.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.240]   If I love the brethren, I must be a child of God.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.000]   We know it in that way.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.240]   Then he puts it negatively to make it quite sure.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:13.280]   He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:18.920]   He then makes an equally explicit statement of it in the first verse of the fifth chapter
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.560]   of that same first epistle.
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:26.920]   Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God.
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:37.360]   And every one that loveth him that begat him also loveth him also that is begotten of him.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:42.640]   Every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:47.280]   Now his whole argument is that these two things are indeed solidly linked together.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:52.080]   If you love the one who has begotten us, you must love the ones that are begotten.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:59.160]   Now there it is in its positive form, but John is very careful to put it in negatives.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.360]   I've given you one already, but take another.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.840]   In the second chapter of his first epistle in the ninth verse, he says he that saith
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:16.080]   he is in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness even until now.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.000]   Doesn't matter what he says.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.280]   Doesn't matter what he says theoretically.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.320]   Doesn't matter though he may know his Bible from cover to cover.
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.760]   Doesn't matter though he be an expert theologian.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:30.160]   If he hates his brother, he is not in the light.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.160]   He is a liar.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.160]   He is still spiritually dead.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.880]   Or take it again in the fourth chapter in the twentieth verse.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:45.360]   If a man say I love God and hateth his brother, he is a liar.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:51.400]   For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.800]   not seen?
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.760]   And it is found in other places also.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:04.360]   Well now then, there is the New Testament setting for this particular test.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:10.820]   And again I would emphasize its practical nature and character.
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.100]   The Christian life is not a theoretical life.
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.040]   The Christian life is not for the head only.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:20.840]   The Christian life, thank God, is something so big and glorious it takes up the whole
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.840]   man.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.800]   It takes up the mind, it takes up the heart, it takes up the will.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:30.800]   And if the whole man is not involved, there is something radically wrong.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.880]   It can be just an intellectual ascent.
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.360]   The whole man must be involved.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:41.920]   The feelings, the emotions, and the will as well as the intellect and the understanding.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:47.920]   So you see this is in many ways of all tests the most thorough of all.
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:55.440]   Our relationship to the family, our relationship to the brethren, those with whom we come in
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.320]   most intimate contact.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:04.280]   The human analogy reminds us of the subtle nature of this test, doesn't it?
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.280]   Blood, we say, is thicker than water.
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.920]   Of course it is.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.520]   There is something between a family relationship that is deeper than all others.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.840]   It's there, and we know that.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.440]   Blood is thicker than water, exactly.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:23.040]   There is nothing, I say, that is deeper than this essential relationship.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:28.040]   Now all that is equally true in the spiritual realm.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:32.280]   It is equally true of the members of the family of God.
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:38.520]   And that is why we know and can know beyond any doubt or peradventure that we are the
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:42.720]   children of God because we love the brethren.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:47.400]   Very well, let's test ourselves by this particular test.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.920]   How does it work itself out?
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:53.920]   Well, here I think are some of the obvious ways.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.120]   How do I know that I love the brethren?
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:02.280]   Well the first thing is that I've got to be able to recognize them.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:06.000]   How do I know who are the brethren?
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:12.920]   How do I know when I meet a number of people who amongst them is a child of God?
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:19.640]   Well, this is something elemental, something almost instinctive, something that one can
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.440]   scarcely put into words at all.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:31.800]   But it's something that one knows, and knows, as I say, almost instinctively.
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:39.160]   There are certain marks about the children of God, and a child of God always knows them,
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.240]   always recognizes them.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:47.400]   There are many human analogies which show us the truth of this and by which we can work
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.720]   it out.
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:55.680]   There are certain signs which people give to one another, sometimes deliberately, sometimes
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.680]   unconsciously.
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:02.480]   People who have been brought up in the same atmosphere tend to do things in the same way.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:07.120]   There are certain things about them, you recognize them.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:13.160]   You can recognize people by speech, accent, dress, all sorts of things.
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.120]   We say a man gives himself away in certain respects.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.840]   Very well, that's it.
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:23.160]   There are certain marks, and this is very true, about the family of God.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.440]   There are certain special and peculiar things about us.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:32.520]   And a man who belongs to the family, he recognizes these things when he sees them.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.440]   He doesn't have to be told, he knows.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.800]   He recognizes it at once and instinctively.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:42.960]   Now, the apostle has got a statement which partially, at any rate, includes this very
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.360]   thing we are dealing with.
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:50.320]   In describing the difference between the natural man and the spiritual man, in the second chapter
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:57.280]   of his first epistle to the Corinthians, he says this, "He that is spiritual judgeth
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:05.000]   all things, yet he himself is judged of no man."
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.640]   What he means by that is this, that the spiritual man has got a faculty of discernment and of
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:17.760]   understanding which the natural man lacks.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:23.760]   And thus, at one and the same time, he has this extra understanding, but is not understood
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.880]   by those who haven't got it and who don't belong to the same family.
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.320]   There is a differentiation.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:35.280]   But the point is that the spiritual man has this power of discernment.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.960]   And it's a very wonderful thing, this.
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:43.280]   I used to feel during the war, and I've felt it since, as young men belonging to this
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:49.680]   church and other churches have told me, finding themselves suddenly going into the army and
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:54.440]   amongst men whom they'd never met before, the way in which they were able to find out
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:21:02.320]   fairly quickly the other men who were Christians in the same room, the same hut, the same regiment,
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.720]   and so on.
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:11.360]   By this kind of instinctive something that is implanted in us with the new life, one
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.200]   is able to recognize.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.000]   Birds of a feather flock together.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.240]   There is a kind of mutual attraction.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:22.080]   You can't always, I say, define it, but you know, and you are drawn to these people,
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.480]   and you approach them and you find that you are right.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:30.200]   Very well, we must be able to recognize them.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.960]   And the question we ask ourselves is, are we able to do so?
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:41.720]   Do we find that in practice we do this, when we find ourselves among strangers?
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:48.960]   Now, the second thing is, of course, the sense of belonging to them.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:52.280]   The moment you meet them, the moment you come into contact with them, you feel that you
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.960]   belong to them.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:58.800]   There is an immediate sense of unity.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.800]   You belong to them, and they belong to you.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:05.960]   There is a very beautiful expression of this in the Old Testament, in the book of Ruth.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.760]   You remember those two daughters-in-law of Naomi?
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:15.080]   They were both daughters-in-law, there were no blood relationships, either of them.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.680]   But you see the difference between the two.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:24.240]   Ruth feels that she belongs to her mother-in-law, who is going back to her own country, and
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:29.600]   she feels that she must leave her country and go with her mother-in-law.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.360]   Things happen that make her feel that this is the woman she belongs to.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:38.880]   So she says, "Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee; for
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:43.640]   whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge.
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:49.320]   Thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God."
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.320]   That's it.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.860]   She just knew it.
[00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:56.280]   She belonged to this woman, and she must go with her.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:01.080]   And she plays with her, not to prevent her or to stop her.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:06.840]   Now, this, you see, is something that is deeper than a mere sense of attraction.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:11.080]   It includes a sense of attraction, but it's stronger than that.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.000]   It's a very deep bond, this.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:21.120]   We are just aware of the fact that we are the same people, and that we belong to these
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:25.680]   people now, and that these have become our people.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:32.600]   Now let me put this still more plainly by proceeding to the third test, which will analyse
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:37.120]   that second general statement.
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:42.660]   And this is a very vital point, this.
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:48.160]   We know that we are the children of God, and that we are in this relationship to the members
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:55.400]   of the family, in the double sense that we are aware of the fact that we've been separated
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:02.240]   from others, and in addition we have been joined to these.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.780]   You see, here is a new family.
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.320]   This is not a natural family.
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:12.920]   Who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of men.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.960]   That's natural.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.280]   But of God.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.280]   Very well.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.920]   Now then, here is a new family.
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:28.000]   Here is a family that has been brought into being and into existence by the life and death
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.800]   and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the sending down of the Holy Spirit.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:39.440]   A new creation, a new family of God.
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.440]   Very well.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:47.640]   The teaching is, you see, that you can't belong to this without being separated and
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:51.200]   cut off from something else.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:55.960]   Now this is not only a delicate test, it can be a very painful one.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.480]   But you see, it's our Lord himself who has uttered these words.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:03.360]   Listen to what I'm going to read from the Gospel according to St. Matthew, chapter
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:07.160]   10.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:11.560]   And I'll begin to read at verse 31.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:16.400]   "Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows."
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:21.680]   He's dealing with Christians who are tending to be frightened of persecution and opposition.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.080]   And he says, "Don't fear, you are of more value than many sparrows."
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.080]   That is because the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:35.200]   Then he goes on to say, "Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:39.960]   also before my Father which is in heaven.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:46.560]   But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.560]   in heaven."
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:48.560]   Then listen.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:54.520]   "Think not that I am come to send peace on earth.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:26:00.560]   I came not to send peace, but a sword.
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:07.160]   For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother,
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.520]   and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.260]   And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.
[00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:18.960]   He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:24.440]   And he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:29.680]   And he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:36.600]   He that findeth his life shall lose it, and he that loseth his life for my sake shall
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:37.600]   find it."
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:44.640]   Now there is the statement of our Lord, and you'll find a parallel to it at the end
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:50.600]   of the fourteenth chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.120]   You see what he's saying.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:58.320]   He says now the effect of my coming is not just going to make you feel happy and make
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.680]   everybody else feel happy.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:04.680]   No, no, he says, you know the thing I'm doing and the thing I'm going to do to you
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:08.360]   is so radical that it becomes a sword.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.760]   It becomes a rock of offense.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.920]   It becomes something that causes men to hate you and to hate me.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.280]   He says, "Think not that I came to send peace on earth.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.640]   I came not to bring peace or send peace, but a sword."
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:26.560]   And it's a sword, he says, that's going to divide and cut you off at the most sensitive
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:30.800]   and delicate parts of the whole of your life.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:38.920]   I'm going to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:43.720]   And you will find in that passage in Luke that he even talks about husband and wife
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.920]   in this respect.
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:51.280]   But here it is, and the teaching is quite inevitable.
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.920]   This is a new relationship.
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:59.600]   It is a spiritual relationship, and you cannot enter into it without coming out of something
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:00.600]   else.
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:09.560]   So the gospel and the Holy Spirit applying the gospel becomes a sword.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:16.680]   And we are divided from old attachments, old relationships, things which we regarded as
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:22.480]   sacred, things which we regarded as the highest and the greatest and the most wonderful of
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.480]   all.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:31.560]   If those to whom we were thus attached are not also Christian, it means of necessity
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.880]   that we are separated from them.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.880]   That's his teaching.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:41.080]   And of course it is, I say, quite inevitably true.
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:48.440]   All those relationships belong to blood, the will of the flesh, and the will of man.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.320]   He's not depreciating them.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:54.040]   The Bible never depreciates the natural relationships.
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.440]   Indeed it enforces them.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.820]   It is God who ordained the family.
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:04.160]   It is God who has ordained that children should thus be born in wedlock and the result of
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:07.040]   wedlock and thus be brought up in the family.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.240]   This is God's own ordinance.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:16.600]   But this new kingdom transcends the natural.
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:21.160]   And in order to belong to this we have to undergo a new birth.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.640]   And that changes all our relationships.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:28.720]   If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.040]   Old things are passed away.
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:35.800]   Behold, all things have become new.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:40.440]   And it's a literal, actual fact.
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.240]   And then, you see, you put the other side.
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.880]   And there's the first part of the process.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:48.400]   We've got to be separated, cut off, set free.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:56.440]   But then in this new birth, which we share with all others, we come into the new family.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:02.600]   We are all together partakers of the divine nature, as it were the new blood is in us
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:07.680]   all, the new outlook, the new orientation, the new everything.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.600]   We've had new life and it's life from God.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:14.240]   And because it's in us all, we are one in the same family.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.840]   We are not what we were and we are not in the same relationship.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:25.720]   We are different and we are in an entirely new relationship.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:32.760]   And that is why our blessed Lord said that he would be a stone of stumbling and a rock
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:35.280]   of offense.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:42.560]   And what he taught, of course, very soon was made painfully evident in practice.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:46.800]   There are examples of it in the Bible and there are many more examples in subsequent
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:50.040]   church history.
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:55.720]   Try to understand these first Jews who became converts to Christianity.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.760]   You know something about the family life of the Jews?
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:05.240]   It's one of the most notable and best characteristics and features, the solidarity of the family.
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.880]   And it meant so much to them.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:11.040]   They were so careful and pentilious about these things.
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:16.760]   But here suddenly one of them becomes a Christian and they're aware that there's a difference,
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.520]   something's come between them, this Christ has come in.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:21.240]   And they hated him.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.480]   And in turn they would soon hate the one who'd got to believe in him.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.560]   They'd erase his name out of the book.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.600]   They'd have nothing to do with him.
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.280]   They'd ostracize him completely.
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.440]   They'd regard him as dead.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.440]   How painful it was for the early Christians.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.820]   And yet they were ready to face it.
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.760]   They were ready to go through with it.
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:44.840]   Now this worked out not only in terms of the family but in terms of the state.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:50.240]   So many of those early Roman Christians were in this awful predicament.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:55.000]   The state in which they'd formerly believed and to which they'd given a totalitarian
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.800]   allegiance was urging them to say Caesar is Lord.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.160]   But they couldn't say it any longer.
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:04.440]   They said, "No, there's only one Lord and that's Jesus.
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.560]   Caesar is not Lord.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.280]   Caesar's not a god."
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:13.280]   And they were threatened with extermination, massacre in the arena.
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:14.280]   Didn't matter.
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:22.440]   They were so certain of this new relationship that they were gladly ready to endure any
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:27.840]   consequences even laying down their very lives.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:31.120]   My dear friends, this is a very delicate matter.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.120]   This is still something that is true.
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:41.200]   And some of you may find this the most certain test that I've yet put before you.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:47.040]   Have you become aware that your most natural, tender relationships have been changed and
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.040]   affected?
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:58.520]   Has it happened to you that the Christ of God and the new life in him has been to you
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:09.560]   a sword that has separated you from someone whom you love more dearly than life itself?
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:15.200]   My dear friend, if you know that experience, you need have no doubt.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:22.000]   You are a child of God beyond any question.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:29.720]   If the Lord Jesus Christ to you comes first and for his sake your heart may be bleeding
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:38.720]   and breaking because of the severing of ties, you're a child of God.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:45.920]   You will have a sense of pity and of sorrow for these others, but you will know that you
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:52.520]   no longer belong to them in the sense you once did, that you are no longer a natural
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:58.520]   person bound by natural ties only.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:09.240]   You will know that you've become a spiritual person tied by the bonds of the love of God,
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.840]   cemented by the love of Christ.
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:19.720]   Oh, this I say is in many ways a terrible thing as well as a tremendous thing.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:23.960]   I can't recall whether I've ever told you just to illustrate this point before I leave
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:28.240]   it.
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:34.760]   One of the most poignant and at the time one of the most sad things I've ever had
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.800]   to witness and experience.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:46.200]   A man who got married, he and his wife were happy, but after a few months of married life
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:52.720]   this man was converted, born again, regenerated, became a child of God.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.440]   He didn't love his wife any less.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.440]   He loved her more.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.620]   He was a better husband.
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:01.640]   But because he'd become a child of God, he was anxious to have fellowship with the
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:06.080]   people of God, anxious to attend church services.
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:09.920]   And he came to the church not only on Sunday but to a prayer meeting on Monday night, a
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:17.120]   fellowship meeting on Wednesday night, a men's meeting on Saturday night.
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:20.160]   And I shall never forget that man coming to me once and telling me this.
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:27.780]   He was saying it in tears with his heart breaking that he'd gone home the previous Monday
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:30.580]   night from the prayer meeting.
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:33.180]   It had been a wonderful meeting.
[00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:39.580]   He went home and was met by his wife at the door, looking at him with hatred and with
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:45.500]   bitterness and saying, "I would sooner see you carried in dead drunk from the working
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:51.540]   men's club than coming home from this prayer meeting."
[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:55.540]   That's the work of the soul.
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:57.860]   He just had to go on.
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:02.180]   He couldn't give up these things, though he loved his wife.
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:04.180]   Christ came first.
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:06.140]   He didn't love her more than he loved Christ.
[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:09.740]   He didn't love her less, but he loved Christ more, and she knew that.
[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:10.740]   She detected it.
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:12.620]   Love is very sensitive.
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:16.780]   She had realized that though her husband's love to her was in a sense greater than ever
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:21.260]   before, that somebody else had come in, somebody else took priority over her.
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:25.460]   It was this Christ who came first, and she hated him with all her being and with great
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:26.460]   bitterness.
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:31.300]   That's the kind of thing I'm talking about.
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:37.420]   The sword had been operating, and there had been a new attachment and a new relationship.
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:42.860]   Thank God for what it's worth, the end of the story was that the wife was later converted
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:45.620]   and saw the horror of her old position.
[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:53.140]   Now they rejoiced as man and wife, both giving him the preeminence and rejoicing in him together.
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:55.460]   But that's the kind of thing to which I am referring.
[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:57.620]   Think not that I am come to send peace on earth.
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:00.980]   I came not to send peace, but a sword.
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:06.300]   A man and his father, a mother and a daughter.
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:08.740]   My dear friends, let's examine ourselves.
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:12.460]   Do we know anything about this?
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:21.500]   If you can say and say honestly that Christ has become so first to you that he's affected
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:26.140]   even these most delicate relationships in life, you need never have any doubt again
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:29.500]   as to whether you are a child of God or not you are.
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:33.940]   However, let's go on with our tests.
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:38.860]   The next is, of course, the fourth test is that we are conscious of the same family interests.
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:47.260]   Obvious, we have the same beliefs, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father
[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:52.260]   who is over all and above all and in us all.
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:58.700]   So you see it's inevitable, the members of the family always have the same interests.
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:03.660]   Then we have the same interest in the kingdom of God and in its success.
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.460]   So we are naturally at one with these people.
[00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:10.740]   They are interested, we are interested.
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:15.460]   We see now that the most important thing in the world is the kingdom of God and that one
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:18.700]   should belong to it and that it should be spread.
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:23.420]   And therefore we are interested in everybody who is interested in the same thing.
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:31.100]   And we are drawn together and attached to one another still yet more deeply.
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:37.020]   And then, of course, we've all got the same hope of glory.
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:44.460]   If children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.420]   We are going to the same eternal home.
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:50.380]   We are all away from home now.
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:55.220]   Heaven is our home, our citizenship is in heaven, not here.
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:39:00.180]   And therefore we are interested in the same hope of glory.
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:03.020]   We are looking forward to the same things.
[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:07.220]   We are looking to a crowning day that's coming.
[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:14.140]   We are realized that we are but in a pilgrimage here and that the realm of the reality is
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:21.340]   the unseen and the eternal and all the others realize exactly the same thing.
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:25.680]   So obviously we are bound to these in a way we are not bound to people who know nothing
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:30.260]   about that and who ridicule it and dismiss it all, who are bound only to this world and
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.580]   who live for this world.
[00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:36.080]   You see our whole interests have changed, but they're the same interests as these
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.860]   other people have.
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:42.660]   As Jude puts it, we have received the same common salvation and we are now concerned
[00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:47.460]   about the same common salvation and we are concerned about defending the same common
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:48.460]   salvation.
[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:50.340]   Everything brings us together.
[00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:54.660]   We see we are a dwindling company in an evil world and we feel that we must come still
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:58.500]   closer together as the members of a family draw together when there's a threat from
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:59.780]   the outside.
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:04.180]   Whatever the difference is, they all become one suddenly because of the common threat
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:09.260]   and because of the same common interests.
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:13.420]   Isn't it inevitable?
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:20.140]   And then I'd like to put it like this in the fifth place that we speak the same language.
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:22.020]   And this is a very interesting thing again.
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:25.220]   We speak the same language I say.
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:27.420]   Now language is a very interesting thing.
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:31.100]   There is such a thing as having the same idiom.
[00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:33.420]   People say today we're on the same wavelength they say.
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:34.420]   Quite right.
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:38.500]   You see in general they're speaking the same language and yet there is a particular
[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:40.340]   language in the common language.
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:42.220]   There is a terminology.
[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:44.060]   I don't mean by that that we use clichés.
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:45.060]   That's abominable.
[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:46.060]   That's terrible.
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.580]   It doesn't mean that we just address a man as brother every time we speak to him.
[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:50.580]   No, no.
[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:51.860]   That's not the thing at all.
[00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:52.860]   That's mechanics.
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.460]   That's not family feeling.
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:58.860]   I'm talking about this depth of something that gives us the same language.
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:04.340]   We read in Malachi 3.16, "Then they that feared the Lord spake often to one another."
[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:06.660]   Of course they did.
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:10.620]   They speak often to one another because they speak the same language, because they were
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:15.340]   concerned about the same things, and because they're on the same wavelength, because
[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.900]   they can make this contact.
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:22.140]   There's something here that's binding them together.
[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:26.900]   Now I'm interested in this question of language in the sense in which I'm using it.
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:31.140]   Let me give you a wonderful illustration of this.
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:37.180]   My point is that the Christian recognizes the language.
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:40.620]   He recognizes the accent, if you like, the idiom.
[00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:44.100]   He recognizes the manner of speech.
[00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:47.060]   And he can be very sensitive in his testing of this.
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:52.180]   Now here is the notable example of it at the end of the eighteenth chapter of the book
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:54.500]   of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:55.660]   Listen.
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:42:02.460]   "And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man and mighty in
[00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:05.820]   the Scriptures, came to Ephesus.
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:09.620]   This man was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in the Spirit, he
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:15.900]   spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.
[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.180]   And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue."
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:19.540]   Now then, listen.
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:26.780]   "When Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them and expounded unto him
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:30.820]   the way of God more perfectly."
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:32.540]   I think that's wonderful.
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:37.540]   Here, you see, was a very eloquent man and a mighty man in the Scriptures, a very able
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:39.540]   man, an academic man.
[00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:41.900]   Aquila and Priscilla were ordinary tentmakers.
[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:44.300]   They hadn't had the educational advantages.
[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:49.100]   And here comes this eloquent orator, this mighty man in the Scriptures.
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:52.020]   And the two simple believers listened to him.
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:57.140]   And you know, as they sat and listened to him, I can see them looking at one another.
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:58.900]   And what they said in their looks was this.
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:01.380]   There's something lacking here.
[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:03.420]   He doesn't understand it properly.
[00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:05.860]   He's all right as far as he goes.
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:08.860]   He's got something, and he can put it forth very eloquently.
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:10.540]   But there's a lack here, there's a need here.
[00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:12.220]   There's something this man doesn't know.
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:14.340]   Now that's the language.
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:18.100]   They were not carried away by the eloquence.
[00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:20.780]   You see, there's a language in the language.
[00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:23.180]   He was mighty in the Scriptures.
[00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:26.900]   He was instructed in the way of the Lord, and he was very fervent in spirit.
[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:27.900]   It didn't matter.
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:32.060]   They were missing this particular thing that they were waiting for.
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:34.140]   They didn't get it.
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:38.820]   So at the end of the service, they went on to him.
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:43.820]   And I'm sure in a very sensitive and delicate manner, they didn't attack him.
[00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:46.660]   They said, "Look here, can't we have a quiet talk?
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:47.660]   Can't we meet together?"
[00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:48.660]   And they did.
[00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:53.500]   And they just told him things that he hadn't heard before, for which he was very grateful.
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:56.980]   And he became a very much greater and better preacher.
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:00.660]   And then his language was the full language of the Gospel.
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:01.860]   Let me give you the second example.
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:06.620]   In the very next chapter, "And it came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul
[00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:10.500]   having passed through the upper coasts, came to Ephesus.
[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:15.580]   And finding certain disciples, he said unto them, 'Have you, did you receive the Holy
[00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:20.020]   Ghost when you believed?'
[00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:23.900]   And they said unto him, 'We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.'"
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:26.060]   Now, here's another case of it.
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:31.260]   The Apostle comes and he hears that there are some disciples in Ephesus.
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:33.420]   So he immediately makes for them.
[00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:34.580]   And he began to talk to them.
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:37.180]   But he immediately recognized that there was something lacking.
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:39.140]   He said, "What's the matter with these people?"
[00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:40.300]   So he puts his question to them.
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:44.220]   "Tell me," he said, "Did you receive the Holy Ghost when you believed?"
[00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:48.500]   They said, "We haven't so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost or not."
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:51.700]   "Ah," says Paul to himself, "I thought not."
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:53.140]   They seem to be disciples.
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:54.700]   They seem to have the language.
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:55.700]   But they haven't got the language.
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:45:01.980]   They haven't got the real thing.
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:06.260]   The child of God has a discriminating sense.
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:11.020]   He can't be misled by mere eloquence and oratory or mere show of learning or general
[00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:12.540]   statements about the Gospel.
[00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:15.060]   There is something particular he wants to hear.
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.540]   And he's not happy unless he hears it.
[00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:20.740]   Do you know anything about that, my friend?
[00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:26.260]   Very well, I say, the children of God have the same language, the same idiom.
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:29.540]   They've got the same sense of freedom and of understanding.
[00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:33.860]   They desire to know the same things and to increase in the knowledge of them.
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:38.380]   But let me go on to another test.
[00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:44.380]   We know that we have passed from death to life because we love the brethren, yes?
[00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:49.340]   And we love them above everybody else.
[00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:51.140]   We prefer them to everybody else.
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:53.700]   It's a very delicate test, this.
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:57.180]   We enjoy their company more than that of anybody else.
[00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:02.100]   If we were offered to spend our day today in the highest circles in the land which are
[00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:08.260]   not Christian, or given the alternative of spending our day with some humble Christians
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:15.420]   who speak the language, we would sooner be with the humble Christians.
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:22.060]   We would regard it as greater pleasure, a greater honour, a greater enjoyment.
[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:23.140]   David even felt it.
[00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:29.580]   He says in the 84th Psalm, "I would sooner be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:33.300]   to dwell in the tents of the ungodly.
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:38.140]   I'd prefer to be the merest underling in God's house," says David, "than to be
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:41.020]   at the very heart and centre of the life of the unbeliever."
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:46.420]   That's the thing.
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:53.580]   We know because we love the brethren.
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:54.580]   We like them.
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:55.580]   We like their company.
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:56.700]   We like their language.
[00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:57.700]   We like their outlook.
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:59.740]   We like everything about them.
[00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:06.300]   They are our people, and they come in our esteem before everybody else.
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:13.380]   So the last test is this, that we are concerned about them and concerned about their welfare.
[00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:15.220]   That means a number of things.
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:16.220]   Here are some of them.
[00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:24.460]   "Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one
[00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:29.460]   in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:38.260]   Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ."
[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:39.260]   That's it.
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:40.700]   We are ready to bear with them.
[00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:44.620]   We'll take more from them than from anybody else.
[00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:49.100]   Because they are brethren, and we are concerned about them—you get the same thing in Romans
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:54.100]   15—we then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:55.100]   ourselves.
[00:47:55.100 --> 00:48:01.100]   "Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification, as even Christ
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:06.060]   pleased not himself, but as it is written, 'The reproaches of them that reproach thee
[00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:07.060]   fell on me.'"
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:08.820]   We are ready to bear with them.
[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:11.620]   We are ready to help them.
[00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:17.300]   Obviously, if you are the older member of a family and have got a little brother or
[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:19.620]   a little sister, you are going to help them.
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:20.980]   You don't say, "Let them carry on themselves.
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:21.980]   I can't be bothered.
[00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:22.980]   I want to get on."
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:26.180]   No, you love that child, and you wait, and you help the child.
[00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:28.940]   It's instinctive, and it's true of the Christian.
[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:31.740]   We not only bear with their weaknesses, we are ready to help them.
[00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:34.020]   We'll go out of our way to help them.
[00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:38.500]   There's nothing we wouldn't do for them.
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:45.100]   And finally, when they suffer, we suffer with them.
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:50.880]   We bear the agony with them, and we are troubled and unhappy, and we give ourselves to praying
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:51.880]   for them.
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:52.880]   We are ready to bear with them.
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:53.880]   We are ready to help them.
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:54.880]   We are ready to bear with them.
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:55.880]   We are ready to help them.
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:56.880]   We are ready to bear with them.
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:57.880]   We are ready to bear with them.
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:58.880]   We are ready to bear with them.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:48:59.880]   We are ready to bear with them.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:00.880]   We are ready to bear with them.
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:01.880]   We are ready to bear with them.
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:02.880]   We are ready to bear with them.
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:03.880]   We are ready to bear with them.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:04.880]   We are ready to bear with them.
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:05.880]   We are ready to bear with them.
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:06.880]   We are ready to bear with them.
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:07.880]   We are ready to bear with them.
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:08.880]   We are ready to bear with them.
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:09.880]   We are ready to bear with them.
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:10.880]   We are ready to bear with them.
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:11.880]   We are ready to bear with them.
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:12.880]   We are ready to bear with them.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:13.880]   We are ready to bear with them.
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:38.880]   We are ready to bear with them.
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:45.960]   Prayer was therefore made without ceasing of the Church unto God for him.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:49.120]   It's a very wonderful test, this.
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:54.200]   Are we concerned about our brethren who are less fortunate than ourselves?
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:58.560]   How often do we think of the lonely, faithful Christians in hamlets and villages and little
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:00.800]   towns about this country?
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:05.320]   How often do we think of them in other countries and the lonely pioneer missionary?
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:09.420]   How often do we think of the sufferings of other Christians and do we feel it, do we
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:10.880]   bear with it?
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:12.480]   How much of our time does it take?
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.200]   Do we ever shed a tear about it?
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:17.920]   Do we pray for them?
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.520]   It's all involved.
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:23.520]   We are members of a family together.
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:28.880]   And if you think of the family in terms of one member of a body, think of it in terms
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:35.080]   of a body, Paul says, if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it.
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:37.920]   You can't say there's only something wrong with that index finger of mine.
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:40.880]   If there's trouble in your index finger, there's trouble in you.
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.080]   If you've got pain there, you'll be in pain.
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:46.240]   You'll have a headache and all the rest of it because of the unity, the organic unity
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:47.240]   of the body.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:48.940]   We are all one.
[00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:56.880]   And the Apostle Paul was able to say this about himself without any hesitation at all.
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:02.720]   He says if anybody is in trouble, he says I'm in trouble at the same time with them.
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:09.640]   Nothing could happen apart from his being involved in all the sufferings at the same
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:10.640]   time.
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:12.600]   He said is anybody weak?
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:13.840]   He says he is weak also.
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:14.960]   Who is weak?
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:15.960]   And I am not weak.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:17.640]   Who is offended?
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:20.280]   And I bear not.
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:24.800]   He is involved in the care of all the churches.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:28.440]   He couldn't get rid of it.
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:32.200]   And if anyone is weak, he's also weak.
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:39.280]   And if anyone is offended, he burns with a sense of righteous indignation and a desire
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:40.880]   and a longing to help them.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:42.520]   Well, my dear friends, there they are.
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:43.520]   There are other tests.
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:46.760]   Those are the most important ones, it seems to me.
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:55.760]   We know that we have passed from death to life because we love the brethren and we know
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:52:00.520]   that we love them in those ways.
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:07.920]   God grant that we all may know beyond any doubt or puradventure that we are the children
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:10.920]   of God.
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:19.520]   Now shall we join in singing our closing hymn, hymn number 504, 504.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:27.760]   Through the night of doubt and sorrow onward goes the pilgrim band, singing songs of expectation,
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:32.320]   marching to the promised land, 504.
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:44.920]   [Music]
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:53:10.960]   [Music]
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:14.960]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
