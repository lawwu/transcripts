[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.080]   - Well, some of the best questions you all send to us
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.960]   come from the tensions that you see directly in scripture
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.520]   as you read through the Bible.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.160]   And that leads to the question that we have today.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.820]   Do we pray for the salvation of unbelievers directly,
[00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.520]   or do we pray for the evangelists
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.660]   who bring the gospel to those unbelievers?
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.600]   It's an interesting Bible question on this Friday
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.320]   as we close out week number 489 on the podcast.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.520]   Wow.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.320]   The question today is from a listener named Tim.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.160]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.480]   Can you tell me if we are commanded to pray for unbelievers?
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.000]   It seems like the prayers and the instruction on prayer
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.440]   in the New Testament are focused on praying for believers
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.560]   in context of evangelism.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.160]   I'm thinking of Colossians 4, verses three to four,
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.700]   and Ephesians 6, verses 18 to 20.
[00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.340]   In those places, Paul is seeking prayer
[00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.040]   for his bold preaching,
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.440]   not prayers for unbelievers themselves.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.380]   Is this instructive for us?
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.120]   Are we to pray for unbelievers,
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.840]   or to pray for evangelists?
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.400]   How does the Bible instruct our priority here?
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.880]   Yes, the Bible teaches us to pray for unbelievers,
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.900]   and particularly to pray for their salvation,
[00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.600]   but not only for their salvation,
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.720]   but also lots of blessings
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.760]   of other kinds that flow from salvation
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.640]   or lead to their salvation.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.640]   But the question Tim asks is not uncommon,
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.580]   because Tim is right that ordinarily,
[00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.200]   Paul in particular, asks for prayer for his preaching
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.120]   more than he does ask prayer
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.280]   for those who are hearing his preaching.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.460]   Now, I'll come back at the end
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.320]   to why that might be the case, but that is the case,
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.920]   and that's why the question arises.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.720]   I can remember maybe 40 years ago at a conference
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.680]   at Wheaton College where a person stood up in the audience
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.600]   and asked J.I. Packer point blank,
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.900]   "Give me one text where we're told to pray for unbelievers."
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.440]   And I'll tell you what he said in a minute when I get there,
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.200]   but this is not an unusual question.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.800]   Now, my reason for saying that the Bible does teach
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.160]   that we should pray for unbelievers
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.760]   is that there are at least five lines of evidence
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.760]   pointing more or less explicitly in this direction.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.000]   So first, there's the Old Testament example.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.280]   It may be surprising to you, it was to me,
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.200]   that it turns up, this example turns up in a psalm
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.240]   where righteous indignation,
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.360]   the righteous indignation of the psalmist
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.560]   is calling on God to vindicate him against his enemies.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.400]   But listen to what brought him to this point
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.040]   in Psalm 35, 11 to 14.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.140]   "Malicious witnesses rise up.
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.900]   "They ask of me things I do not know.
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.320]   "They repay me evil for good.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.020]   "My soul is bereft.
[00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.400]   "But I, when they were sick, I wore sackcloth.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.880]   "I afflicted myself with fasting.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.880]   "I prayed with head bowed on my chest.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.760]   "I went about as though I grieved for my friend
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.800]   "or my brother as one who laments his mother.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.440]   "I bowed down in mourning."
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.040]   So the psalmist had prayed for his enemy
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.780]   until evidently God showed him
[00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.880]   that he's going to become an instrument of God's judgment.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.760]   That happens in the Psalms.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.840]   So we've got an Old Testament example
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.200]   of praying for our adversaries.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.440]   Second, there are Jesus' instructions.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.020]   Matthew 5, 43, "You have heard that it was said,
[00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.020]   "you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.000]   "But I say to you, love your enemies
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   "and pray for those who persecute you."
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.600]   Same thing in Luke 6, 38, "Pray for those who abuse you."
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.400]   Not pray against them.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.240]   (laughs)
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.680]   It's not in precaritory prayers.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.160]   This is pray for them.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.440]   Pray for what they need.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.960]   And what they need most is faith in Christ and eternal life.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.200]   I think this is what the command of Jesus
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.880]   to bless means as well.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.880]   Jesus said in Luke 6, 38, "Bless those who curse you."
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.680]   Well, what does bless mean?
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.220]   Well, what does bless mean?
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:51.080]   It means pronounce a God-word wish
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.800]   of well-being on someone.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.800]   Blessing is the hope that things will go well with someone.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.920]   And then that hope is directed to God in longing
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.440]   and expressed to our enemy in words.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.040]   That's the way blessings work,
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.880]   whether they're to believers or unbelievers.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.720]   You can see it in that famous blessing in number six.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.480]   The Lord bless you and keep you.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.080]   The Lord make his face shine on you.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.760]   So you're asking the Lord to do something,
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.000]   but you're speaking directly to a person.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.520]   So this command to bless our enemies
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.840]   became a watchword in the early church.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.080]   It's amazing how frequent it is.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.280]   So 1 Peter 3, 9, "Do not repay evil for evil
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.080]   "or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless."
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.920]   Romans 12, 14, "Bless those who persecute you.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.920]   "Bless and do not curse them."
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.000]   Paul set an example of this in 1 Corinthians 4, 12.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.420]   He said, "When reviled, we bless.
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.180]   "When persecuted, we endure."
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.920]   Now, these blessings are prayers.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.400]   They're prayers for unbelievers
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.600]   that God would cause things to go well for them,
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.720]   for their ultimate good, for their salvation.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.640]   Then there's another kind of instruction.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.480]   Jesus gave, and I think it indirectly tells us
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.140]   to pray for unbelievers.
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.000]   And this is the answer that J.I. Packer gave.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.520]   I remembered all these years later
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.500]   because I didn't expect him to go here at all.
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.760]   He went to the Lord's prayer.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.460]   Prayed then like this, "Our Father in heaven,
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.900]   "hallowed be your name, your kingdom come,
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.920]   "your will be done on earth as it is in heaven."
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.600]   Well, when it says, "Pray for the kingdom to come
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.080]   "and for God's will to be done as in heaven,"
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.720]   that phrase, "as in heaven," means not just
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.440]   that God's sovereign will be done the way Judas did it.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.580]   That's not the way it's done in heaven,
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.100]   but that it would be done the way angels do it.
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.600]   And the angels do it full of joy, full of faith.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:05.200]   So think of the Lord's prayer as a prayer
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.600]   for unbelievers to believe and obey and do the will of God
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.760]   the way the angels do it in heaven.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.880]   I thought that was a remarkable, insightful answer.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.480]   I mean, there are a lot more direct answers.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.520]   I'm not sure why he went there.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.900]   Maybe that was just all that came to his mind at the time,
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.680]   but I thought it was remarkable.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.520]   Here's the third line of evidence.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.600]   There's Jesus' example, not just the instructions
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.980]   that we just saw, but his example.
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.920]   While he's on the cross, he prays for his enemies.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.080]   And Jesus said, "Father, forgive them.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.960]   "They don't know what they do."
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.720]   And then Stephen continued that same dying prayer
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.440]   as he was being stoned, Acts 7, 60.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.820]   And falling on his knees, he cried out with a loud voice,
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:56.460]   "Lord, do not hold this sin against them."
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:57.420]   That's amazing.
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:01.880]   He prayed for his unbelieving killers.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.400]   Fourth, fourth line of evidence.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:10.280]   Paul's example, not only of blessing,
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.960]   which we just saw, those who persecute him,
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.680]   but also of explicitly praying for the salvation
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.720]   of his lost Jewish kinsmen in Romans 10.1.
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.960]   I think if somebody asked me in public,
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.200]   give me one example of the Bible teaching
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.560]   that we should pray for unbelievers, I'd say Romans 10.1.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.320]   Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.860]   is that they may be saved.
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:46.080]   So I take this to mean that this was his steady prayer
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.040]   as he ministered in the Lord's name.
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.080]   Lord, save my brothers in Israel
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.760]   and make them my brothers in Christ.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.880]   And the fifth line of evidence,
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.040]   Tim, when he asked the question,
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.960]   he pointed to Colossians 4 as a typical way
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.520]   that Paul asked for prayer,
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.600]   namely for the preachers and not the hearers.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.200]   And I commented that that is typical.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.240]   That's right.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.900]   Paul does that most often.
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:17.760]   He said this, this is Colossians 4.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.760]   "Pray also for us that God may open to us a door
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.260]   "for the word to declare the mystery of Christ
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.740]   "on account of which I am in prison,
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:34.600]   "that I may make it clear which is how I ought to speak."
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.040]   Same thing then in Ephesians 6.19,
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.760]   where he says, "Pray for me that words may be given to me
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.260]   "in the opening of my mouth boldly
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:48.840]   "to proclaim the mystery of the gospel."
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.000]   And we could add to this 2 Thessalonians 3.1,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.820]   "Pray for us that the word of the Lord may run
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:00.560]   "and be glorified as happened among you."
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.940]   Now, none of these texts says explicitly
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.320]   that we are praying for the unbelievers,
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.120]   none of those last three that I quoted.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.040]   But when you think it through,
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.120]   what they're asking for is that Paul's word
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:22.120]   would be bold and clear and unhindered
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.320]   and triumphant and glorified.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.240]   You can't avoid the fact this includes,
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.300]   Lord, grant converts to Paul's preaching.
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:38.280]   So I think Paul is indeed asking indirectly
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.500]   for prayer for unbelievers.
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:45.340]   And I suspect, this is my effort to answer the question
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.520]   why Paul spoke the way he did most often.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.260]   I suspect that one of the reasons
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.320]   Paul asks for prayer this way,
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.960]   namely for himself and his preaching,
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:02.960]   is that he is so keenly aware that faith comes by hearing
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:08.480]   and hearing by the word of Christ.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:13.480]   He knows that it is God who raises dead people spiritually
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.520]   and brings them to faith.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:21.520]   And God gives them life and faith and eyes to see
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:27.420]   the glory of Christ by causing them to hear the word of God.
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:33.380]   Paul really wants us to keep in mind
[00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:38.380]   that God does not move around through the world
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.820]   bringing people to faith
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.060]   apart from the hearing of the gospel.
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:50.060]   God has bound salvation to the news of Jesus Christ
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.180]   so that Christ gets glory for the faith.
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:58.900]   So let's always keep these things together,
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:03.900]   namely prayer for the salvation of unbelievers
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:09.120]   and prayer for the word to run and be glorified
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.260]   through more and more faith.
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.500]   - Amen, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.440]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.260]   As you try to wrestle to understand your Bible,
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.740]   send us the questions that you face.
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:20.920]   You can do that or search our growing archive
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.240]   of answers or subscribe to the podcast
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.000]   as we go along and hear episodes as we release them.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.200]   You can do all that through desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.340]   Well, how do I find my ministry calling?
[00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.740]   Will I find it internally like some impulse
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.140]   that will lead me to start a new thing
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.820]   or will my ministry calling come from the outside?
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.460]   Will it come from others telling me where I'm needed?
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.880]   This is a great question and it's up next time.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:48.720]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.400]   We'll see you back here on Monday for that.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.500]   Have a great weekend.
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.080]   (upbeat music)
