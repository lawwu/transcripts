[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.000]   So let's jump into some calls. Jesse, what is our first call about?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Hi, so our first call we have Nikola. He's going to ask you a question about the Serbian scientist Tesla.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   So here we go.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   You regard Serbian scientist Nikola Tesla as the ultimate deep pork thinker because he was 100% focused on his inventions
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   and that led him to become the greatest inventor of all time.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   I don't know if I would say... So it's a good question.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   So if I'm hearing it correctly, the question is, do I personally consider Tesla, Nikola Tesla, to be the greatest inventor of all time?
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   I'm not sure if I would say that. I mean, it depends how we want to actually define what makes you the greatest inventor of all time.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   I recently read a pretty dense Edison biography.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   And so something Edison had, for example, that Tesla didn't, was the ability to commercialize.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   So to take an idea but then actually push that idea through into something that could be mass produced, sold at mass.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Tesla was not interested in that. He was interested more in the technology.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   There's also some mythology around Tesla.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   I think the Tesla mythology has grown to the point where he's seen as basically inventing every technology ever in a 10 year period.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Like, well, Tesla thought about that and he thought about this.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   And I think that's a little exaggerated.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   All that being said, from what I know about Tesla, he was a good exemplar of deep work.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   He had social phobias. He did not like being around other people.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   He could focus intensely on a problem and made some really big breakthroughs,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   in particular breakthroughs about how to actually make alternating current practical,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   how you could actually build devices to run on alternating current.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   I mean, this is maybe getting a little bit in the weeds,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   but the advantage of direct current is that you can directly drive a motor.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And driving a motor is one of the most important early applications of electricity because it replaced steam engines and factories.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Alternating current, if you just hooked it up to a direct electromagnetic motor, would have the motor go back and forth, back and forth.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   So you actually had to invent a clever electrical apparatus that would allow the alternating current current to still drive a continuous motor forward.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   There's also some other work he did on transformers, etc.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Anyways, great inventor, great example of someone who focused on being so good they couldn't be ignored,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   pushing the technology, pushing the technology.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Clearly, he played a big role in Westinghouse's rise, the downfall of Edison, the rise of AC over DC current.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   So I like the question. Good example of Deep Ork.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Don't know if he is the greatest inventor of all time, but he does have a car named after him, so that's not so bad.
