[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.080]   Hello radicals, bienvenidos a Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.040]   with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.360]   now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.360]   My name is Josh Ruchites.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.400]   I am your host and today I'm going to share with you a story and some lessons.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:56.940]   The story is how I have taught my children to be fluent in Spanish in less than one year
[00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.720]   without being part of a Spanish speaking community, without enrolling them in a Spanish speaking
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.280]   school entirely at home as part of our overall homeschool curriculum.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.200]   And I'm going to share the story with you and share some of the lessons because I think
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.040]   these are lessons that are very applicable and helpful to your life.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.880]   This show will not contain any technical financial planning.
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.640]   This is one of those living a rich life.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.800]   I think that languages enrich your life.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.000]   I think there's a very good reason to teach yourself multiple foreign languages and to
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.840]   teach your children multiple foreign languages.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.400]   It opens up new cultures to you, new countries to you, new regions of the world, new employment
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.920]   opportunities that may relate to your financial life in a very strong way.
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.360]   It may help your children in a very strong way.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.760]   But I'm not going to be talking about financial planning.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.400]   I'm talking about language learning.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.640]   But I'm pretty excited with some of the results that I've achieved in the last year.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.400]   Including some methods that I made up and have since found out that other people are
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.520]   applying successfully as well.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.440]   And I'll share those with you because I think the results have been pretty astonishingly
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.940]   spectacular.
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:08.040]   And I want to share them with you now for one very specific reason.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:16.180]   I'm close enough to remember what I have done and what I am doing, but far enough along
[00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.880]   to have results.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.040]   I like very much to wait until I've either done something and really proven the results
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.880]   out for myself before I talk about it or to really exhaustively research something.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.620]   If I talk about something here on Radical Personal Finance, it's generally either something
[00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.820]   I have done and I know or it's something that I have researched extensively and I'm very
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.220]   confident in my opinions.
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.960]   You will usually hear me, you'll frequently hear me, if there's an area where I get into
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.780]   where I'm not quite sure, I will quickly acknowledge that publicly and I'll state, "Hey, this is
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.960]   an area where I'm a little shaky."
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.060]   And I think that's important to do just from simple personal honesty.
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.560]   But I don't want to wait until I have all of my results accomplished to share some of
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.240]   what I have been doing with you because what can happen is you forget.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.240]   I always tease my mother about this because you ask my mom, if I go and ask my mother,
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.960]   whose youngest child is in his mid-30s, she doesn't remember anything about the day-to-day
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.800]   of raising little children.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.680]   It's just blocked from her mind.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.580]   And so she'll see one of my children do something, she's like, "Wow, children do that?"
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.700]   And she's very sweet about it, but it's just funny because all of the day-to-day difficulties
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.640]   have been blocked from her mind now.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.840]   And her mind only remembers the positive things, not specifically the day-to-day, moment-by-moment
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.840]   stuff.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.200]   And it's not that she doesn't have a tremendous wealth of wisdom to share, she does.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:51.020]   But sometimes I wonder if she remembers things as accurately as she should.
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.760]   And so that's why I want to do this now while I'm still in the process.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.680]   So I want to begin with my results, then I'm going to tell you what I have done, then I'm
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.920]   going to talk about the academic research behind what I have done, which I didn't know
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.000]   about when I started doing it, but have since found, and then how I plan to continue to
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.680]   exercise my results.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.040]   So for context, I have four children.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:22.960]   The eldest is seven, recently turned seven, and the youngest is one, one and a half.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.680]   So at this stage, I have four very young children.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.400]   And when my eldest children were younger, my wife and I talked about the idea of teaching
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.720]   our children a foreign language, specifically Spanish.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:43.260]   Both she and I learned Spanish in high school, and both she and I were, I would say, advanced
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.320]   intermediate Spanish speakers.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.080]   Neither of us is truly expert.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:55.200]   I'm in both now advanced levels because we've been working on it, but earlier in our children's
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.920]   lives, we were advanced intermediate speakers.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.200]   And we talked about, should we try to teach our children a foreign language?
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.520]   But it seemed daunting.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.200]   The task seemed insurmountable.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.880]   I wasn't comfortable speaking Spanish to my children enough to actually do it.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.880]   It was difficult.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.880]   It was tiring.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.680]   It was hard work for me to do it.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.040]   I didn't know a lot of the daily vocabulary that you need with children, the common expressions.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.120]   I could understand basic communication and participate in basic conversations, and even
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:35.040]   advanced intellectual conversations, but the day-to-day phraseology of how do you say,
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.880]   get in the bathtub.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.600]   There were words in every language that I didn't know because I didn't grow up speaking
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.600]   Spanish.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.600]   I learned Spanish.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.240]   I had two years of high school Spanish.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.500]   That's it.
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.520]   And so all of my other studies have been independent studies.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.160]   And so we talked about it.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.160]   We thought about it.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.240]   And we just decided, you know what, we're not cut out for it.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.240]   We're not going to do it.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.560]   And so we decided not to try to teach our children Spanish.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.920]   Well, that was fine for a while.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.080]   But over the last couple of years, we have done quite a bit of traveling as a family,
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.160]   including some significant travel in a number of different Spanish-speaking countries.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.560]   And we thought, you know what, if we're going to be traveling in Spanish-speaking countries,
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.800]   wouldn't it be nice to actually teach our children some Spanish?
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.880]   So we talked about it, but we didn't know how to do it.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.880]   What could we do?
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.960]   Maybe we could enroll them in a school.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:28.960]   And we thought about it.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.960]   We talked about that.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.960]   Should we go somewhere to a Spanish-speaking country and enroll them in a Spanish-speaking
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.000]   school?
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.120]   Maybe that would be good.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.120]   Maybe it wouldn't.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.800]   But for us, for me especially, the opportunity cost of doing that would be too high.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:47.080]   I think that largely standardized schooling is so time inefficient, it's such a waste
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.120]   of time, that the cost, even though you might get some benefits like language immersion,
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.220]   the cost of doing that is just so high compared to what can be done in a really productive
[00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.280]   homeschool environment at home.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.400]   So we decided not to do that.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.040]   We thought about hiring a tutor, but what are we going to do?
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.480]   How are you going to teach children Spanish and put them in classes?
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.760]   None of my children had any interest in speaking Spanish.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.440]   None of them wanted to do it.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.560]   So finally I said, you know what, we're going to do this.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.040]   And a little under a year ago, I decided to commit.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.940]   And I said, I'm going to teach my children Spanish.
[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:26.600]   So the first thing I did was buy a bunch of books in Spanish.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:32.040]   And I started buying any book I could possibly find, any book I could get my hands on in
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.360]   Spanish.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.840]   And I started with lots of storybooks.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.160]   And I began reading the books to my children and translating them.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.560]   I found a number of different bilingual books, so I used those.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.080]   I quickly found out that I didn't like the bilingual translations, so I just focused
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.320]   on buying Spanish language storybooks and reading them to my children.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:56.480]   And I would read to them in Spanish, and then I would translate.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:01.840]   And I started with reading short phrases, three, four words at a time, and then translating
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.840]   into English.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.520]   And then I later moved on to reading longer sentences and then translating those into
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.520]   English.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.840]   And we just started reading for a significant amount of time.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.840]   Now here I want to insert a small sidebar.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.920]   Reading is a standard part of our family and what we do as a family.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:27.840]   I consider reading and the ability to read and the habit of extensive reading to be a
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:34.480]   basic meta skill that's part of a basic meta ability of learning how to learn.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:40.600]   And so it's a very significant focus for us in our family to not only teach our children
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:47.200]   to read, but also to help them to love to read and for reading to be a significant part
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.280]   of their life.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:53.600]   I consider reading to be the most effective way to acquire knowledge.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:09:00.680]   I consider reading to be the most effective way to acquire a broad, I'm going to use the
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:06.720]   word life experience, although I recognize its shortcomings in this case, I'll explain.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.040]   I consider reading to be one of the most effective ways of acquiring a broad life experience
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:18.080]   because you can, by consuming the opinions and experiences of others through reading,
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.880]   you can be exposed to many aspects of life.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:27.720]   It's not a genuine lived experience, but it's a vicarious experience that expands the brain
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.000]   and expands the mindset massively.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.240]   I consider reading to be a major part of language development.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.340]   When I was younger, because of extensive reading, I've always had a good vocabulary, I've always
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.600]   had excellent grammar, et cetera.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.240]   And so I consider it to be a major part of language development.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:52.240]   And I think that through reading, you have the chance to develop ideas, philosophies,
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.560]   et cetera, in a very powerful way.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:59.960]   And it's more powerful than almost any other input methodology.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.440]   There are some people who believe that you don't need to read to be successful, and I
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.320]   agree with them.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:11.480]   However, any person who is successful without reading, when I look at that person, I see
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:19.080]   how if they did read, they could be more successful or they could be more successful faster.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:25.440]   I've never found a situation or an argument in which I believe that reading was a disadvantage
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.400]   to somebody with the temperament and personality and other basic life skills where they were
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.560]   destined for success.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:37.480]   The only disadvantage of reading would be if someone stays stuck reading and doesn't
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.900]   proceed to action.
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.320]   That would be the big danger point of reading.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:45.660]   But I think that even through reading, you can become aware of that and then discipline
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:49.640]   yourself to make sure that you're implementing the knowledge that you acquire.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.760]   So for those reasons, reading is an important part of our family educational strategy.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:59.920]   And we have a strategy about how to help our children to be readers.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:05.960]   The basic component of that is from a very early age, we read to them a lot.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.440]   We read to them everything from a very, very early age.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.280]   We fill our house with books, which is an important component.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.900]   So we have lots of little baby books.
[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:17.400]   We have lots of story books.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:23.820]   We focus on buying the highest quality books that we can find.
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.260]   We try to focus on living books.
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.600]   That's a term that comes from the Charlotte Mason philosophy.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:33.760]   And as Charlotte Mason would teach, we try to put a delectable buffet in front of our
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:34.760]   children.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:39.160]   And so there are books all throughout the house of all different kinds of books.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.440]   And we actually physically put this in front of them in a funny way every night.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.400]   When the children go to bed, my wife goes around the house.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.400]   Of course, if the books, if their books still out, which with little children, of course,
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.060]   we have lots of books to pick up.
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:56.080]   We pick them up and then she will salt the house with books or seed the house with books.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.360]   So she'll go and choose five or six or eight books and we'll lay them out on the coffee
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.120]   table and they're different every day with all kinds of different things.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:09.360]   And so the child comes, you know, gambling along and they see the book there and they
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.760]   can't help it.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.200]   They reach down and they pick it up and all of a sudden they're exposed to a new different
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.320]   book.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.680]   And so these are part of our strategy.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:21.960]   I guess another important component is in our house we don't have any screens or any
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.080]   devices other than books for entertainment or education.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.440]   So we don't have a TV.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.220]   The children don't have digital devices.
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.600]   We don't let them use computers.
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.000]   Everything is just simply with books.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.760]   And so if they're going to entertain themselves, it's either go play in the yard or play with
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.800]   toys or read books.
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.680]   And if they're wandering around with nothing to do, then often we'll say, go read a book.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.000]   If we need them to sit down, sit down and read a book.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.120]   And so reading is just a basic component of their life.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.240]   Now we only have one reader at the moment.
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.880]   My seven year old is our only reader.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:02.040]   And he broke through in English reading to a very high level very quickly.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.360]   He wasn't a kind of superstar of doing it early.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.320]   We worked on the early reading stuff and failed miserably.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.620]   And so we just quit for quite a while.
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.480]   But then we came back to it at an age where he was more ready.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.640]   We worked through it again, taught him the sounds of the words.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:24.400]   And he broke through fairly quickly and then became a voracious reader in English.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:30.320]   My next child, who is currently five, has not yet learned how to read.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.040]   We're working on it, but it's not really taking.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.160]   And so now with our experience with the first one, we've learned not to sweat it.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.720]   Just take some time.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.040]   But we've been teaching our children to read in English first.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.840]   So less than a year ago, I had one reader who was reading in English, but we decided
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.840]   to go ahead and start reading to him and them in Spanish.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.840]   And so I read significantly and I just took a lot of our reading time and put it into
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.960]   Spanish and my wife did some as well.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:01.880]   For context, we probably read, what would I say?
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:08.120]   I would guess the average is we read an hour and a half to two hours a day to the children.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:13.800]   I read at the breakfast table, usually 20 minutes, sometimes 30 minutes.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.800]   Read all different books.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.520]   I read them books.
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:23.960]   Usually I choose books that teach character qualities, teaching virtue, generally story
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.740]   books, but story books with a lesson, with a parable.
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:31.480]   So I switched those books to Spanish and I translated them at the breakfast table.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:36.420]   I usually read to them for 30, 45 minutes before dinner.
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:41.000]   My wife will read to them during the day, the younger ones in the morning, during school
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.500]   time and in the afternoon.
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:47.160]   So probably another 30 to 45 minutes from her, I'll read 30 minutes before dinner.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.760]   And then at bedtime, I read to them for anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:57.280]   So I started to move that reading from English into Spanish, again, with simply translation.
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:01.920]   In addition to that, I made a point of trying to speak to the children more in Spanish.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:07.320]   I didn't do any kind of perfect 100% in Spanish, but I tried to speak to them more.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.640]   So give them a command in Spanish, translate to English.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.940]   Give them a command in Spanish, translate to English.
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.840]   And I tried to figure out a way to bring Spanish into the house.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:21.920]   Now this was kind of a failure, but I think it did make a difference for my eldest, who
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.480]   is the one who is truly fluent.
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.040]   The others are not truly fluent yet.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.760]   I'll describe their levels in a moment.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.240]   But this did make a difference to the eldest.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.640]   I couldn't figure out because we're not part of a Spanish speaking community.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.140]   Their children weren't exposed to Spanish, didn't have any Spanish speaking friends.
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.280]   And so it was basically just me, but I thought, how can I do it?
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:44.800]   So I decided to hire basically a babysitter, a nanny, to come into the house a couple days
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.480]   a week and spend the morning with the children.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:53.440]   And I found a Spanish speaking nanny who would come in and this was helpful just in terms
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.280]   of handling the homeschool duties, right?
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:00.720]   To play with the younger children when the olders were doing school and my wife was engaged
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.340]   with them.
[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:05.120]   But I made sure that the nanny came to play.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:11.820]   And the person who this made the biggest difference with was my eldest, my eldest son, who again
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.600]   was six at the time.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.160]   And I encouraged them to hang out.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.880]   They would draw pictures, they would play, they would play games, they would play outside.
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.040]   I encouraged them to cook together.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.640]   And again, I continued to buy just every book I could find in Spanish.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.280]   I bought Spanish cookbooks.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:33.800]   I bought Spanish all kinds of storybooks, et cetera, and I'd put them out.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:39.820]   One day, my eldest started picking up some of the Spanish books and reading them himself.
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.280]   And I never taught him to read in Spanish.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.800]   We did teach him to read in English, but never taught him to read in Spanish.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.200]   But reading in Spanish is one of the easiest things about the Spanish language because
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:53.760]   the vowel sounds, the consonant sounds all map, almost all map to English.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.160]   And the vowel sounds are very simple.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.800]   There are five very simple vowel sounds and they're very consistent.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.680]   So it's relatively easy to learn to read in Spanish.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.820]   And so he started picking it up.
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.800]   And so I kept on plying him with as many books as I could possibly find.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.520]   His levels started to get more and more and he started to just naturally start to speak
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:15.000]   with the Spanish speaking nanny when she would come.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:23.400]   And then it was like he broke through and he started to get to higher and higher levels.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:28.600]   So what I did was I stopped translating and I started reading more books to him without
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.480]   translation, reading more books without translation.
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.720]   And I worked really hard to get as many Spanish books that would engage him as I possibly
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:42.040]   could and then to move away from just picture books to more textbooks, meaning books with
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:47.400]   just text, not the kind of textbooks you get in class, but books with text and four or
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.960]   five pictures in it.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:56.800]   And what I was looking for is I spent a long time looking for, I've looked for lists of
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.880]   literature.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.460]   For some reason, these lists are not common in Spanish.
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.520]   If you're a parent and you're looking for books of lists of quality literature for your
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.280]   children, there are so many books written on this.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.920]   There's Honey for the Child's Heart and all kinds of lists everywhere of the classic books
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.440]   in the English language.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:16.200]   But I've looked everywhere and I can't find those lists in Spanish.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:23.120]   But what I did find, I was looking for something that would engage his attention and capture
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.640]   his imagination.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:29.720]   When I was a boy, what really made a big difference for me was when I discovered the Hardy Boys
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:34.480]   series, the classic Hardy Boys series, the 50 original Hardy Boys books written, I think,
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.920]   1940s probably, 1930s or 40s.
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.520]   And those books just engaged me and I would get them from the library and read them and
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.200]   read them and I loved them.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.760]   And I read so much because I found those.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.760]   Well, I went looking.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:52.080]   I couldn't find Hardy Boys in Spanish, although they were translated, many of them, into Spanish,
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.800]   but I couldn't find them anywhere.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.960]   And finally, I went to a bookstore and I found a series in a Spanish bookstore.
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:04.960]   I found a series by the English author Enid Blyton.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.920]   She wrote a series of books for adventure books for children called, they're written
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:14.160]   in English, called The Famous Five and then translated into Spanish called Los Cinco.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:21.160]   And so I grabbed that series and I grabbed the first one to check it out, figured, okay,
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.480]   venture stories about books.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.320]   They're of course wildly unrealistic.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.800]   They're not particularly, everything is not awesome.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:32.040]   You've got these 11 year old, a 12 year old, a 13 year old whose parents are either, they're
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:37.720]   just totally uninvolved, whether they're neglectful or just encouraging free range children, who
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.720]   knows?
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.000]   But the parents are totally wildly uninvolved.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.640]   Children do all these dangerous, crazy adventures.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.960]   But that author knows how to write for a child's imagination.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.680]   And then I started reading to him the first Los Cinco book.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.720]   I read him the first couple of chapters and then I just left the book and told him he
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.000]   had permission to pick it up and read it.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.560]   And when he finally picked it up, he did, he went ahead, he picked it up and he read
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.200]   it and he read it voraciously.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.960]   And then I went ahead and supplied him with the second one and he read it voraciously.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.440]   And then I supplied him with the third one and he just, he soaked it up to the point
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:16.480]   where he was finishing this 250 page book.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:20.720]   And one time he finished one of them in one day.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:25.360]   So basically about, it was a long day of reading, but one to two days of reading.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:31.680]   And that was like the capstone where I looked at my wife and I gave the yes sign and I said,
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.960]   all right, we've done it.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:33.960]   We have succeeded.
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:37.960]   That he is reading effectively in Spanish.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:42.280]   When a child can pick up one of these books, which has tons of words that I don't know,
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:45.920]   even though at this point I'm an advanced speaker, when a child can pick up this book
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.960]   and devour it like this, that will work.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.760]   And so I've continued to supply him with those books as well as other books.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:57.760]   I found a number of older, kind of similar genre of books for him.
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.480]   And I've continued to supply him with those books.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:06.880]   So at this point in time, I consider him to be functionally fluent, fully fluent in Spanish.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.200]   And he can understand what is being spoken and spoken Spanish.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:15.340]   He can pick up all kinds of, he can read in Spanish and he doesn't show a preference between
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.720]   reading in Spanish and English.
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.240]   I'll describe some of the other books.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.720]   I worked hard to find books that I thought would capture a young boy.
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:29.360]   So I found these really great Dorling Kindersley, DK books, these awesome about science and
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:36.080]   astronomy and space and the human body and history, just incredible, really vivid illustrations,
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.560]   all translated into Spanish, all written in Spanish.
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.880]   And so I supplied him with tons of those.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.040]   Let me recount actually one story though.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.680]   So the thing that's hard about this approach is you don't know what book is going to capture
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:53.040]   your child's attention.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:58.560]   The Fulcrum in my eldest in his Spanish journey, The Fulcrum was a book that I just randomly
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:21:59.560]   picked up.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:04.000]   I was at the store and I picked up this book that was for sale.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.160]   It was called El Mesías and it was the Messiah.
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.200]   And it was published by Zondervan, which is a Christian publisher.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:18.360]   And it was a manga book about the life of Jesus.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.480]   And I just picked it up and I grabbed it.
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.560]   I don't like manga.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.840]   Most manga, I know it's a big thing to some people if you're into manga, go for it.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.640]   But a lot of manga just strikes me as ugly.
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.180]   It's not attractive.
[00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.060]   It's not to me.
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:37.600]   And so I don't really want to supply my child with tons of manga, but I figured, "Meh, it
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.600]   was on sale.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.600]   I'll pick this thing up."
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:43.640]   And I grabbed it and I gave it to him.
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:48.280]   That book captured his attention like nothing I had ever seen.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:53.440]   He read nothing other than that book for about two weeks.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.100]   And just for context, that means probably read it for two and a half to three hours
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.600]   a day.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:04.840]   With my eldest, he has reading time during while the other children nap.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.640]   And so basically free afternoon, free reading time, and he would just devour it, read it
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.720]   for two and a half, three hours a day.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.000]   And he loved it.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.320]   He loved it.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.800]   And that was the book that was the fulcrum where everything kind of, the dam burst out
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:18.800]   open.
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.120]   I never would have predicted that that was the book.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.680]   It was just a random, "I'll pick this up and try this one out."
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.920]   But that was the book that made all the difference in the world for him.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.120]   And then from then on, he was reading.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.760]   And so at this point, he's functionally fluent.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:39.800]   He's reading novels, just picture Hardy Boyd's novels, kind of a similar thing, a 200 to
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.280]   220, 250 page child's novel written in Spanish.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:47.960]   And it's excellent Spanish, really high quality translations.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.960]   And he shows no preference between English and Spanish with his reading.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:56.460]   So when we salt the table and seat it with all these different books, he'll pick up the
[00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:59.400]   Spanish books and the English books without any preference.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:02.040]   Obviously, the books still need to be age appropriate.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:06.000]   I've put a few books and tried a few different books that just didn't, he wasn't ready for
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.440]   yet, which is common with all readers, right?
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.680]   You don't give Pride and Prejudice to a seven-year-old because they can't appreciate, even though
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:17.480]   if they can decode the words, they can't appreciate the subtlety of the human interaction.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:24.920]   But of books that are to his level, he doesn't show any preference between Spanish and English.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.480]   And the reading has made all the difference in the world.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:35.480]   So what's fascinating to me is I did this without much understanding of the academic
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.920]   research.
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:42.840]   I have since come to find that there is a whole school of language learning that is
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:47.440]   exclusively focused on this, on what's called extensive reading as a language acquisition
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.240]   methodology.
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:53.520]   And it makes all the sense in the world to me, and it maps to the good results that I've
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.660]   achieved.
[00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:59.840]   And what's fascinating to me is to watch a seven-year-old who is not in a Spanish-speaking
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:04.680]   school, doesn't have any Spanish-speaking friends, you know, I try to get some people
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:10.640]   to speak Spanish to speak to him, but it's very little other than my wife and me, but
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.860]   to watch that reading unlock the language, and then to see how effective it's been.
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:23.160]   So a year ago, spoke no Spanish, today, fully fluent, consuming 200 or 250-page novels voraciously,
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:27.560]   and loving them.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:34.840]   And what's amazing to me is to assess the level of his Spanish ability, where he speaks
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:44.960]   completely unconsciously with an advanced grammar.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:49.080]   You know, the other day he was telling me about something in the book, and he's using
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:55.280]   this, if you know anything about language and grammar, there's a form that we have in
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.360]   most languages, we have it in English, but most people are not aware of it, but it's
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.720]   very important in Spanish and French, called the subjunctive.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:08.480]   And here he is telling me this example with the perfect conditional subjunctive conjugation
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:14.080]   of the verb, and it's the kind of thing that generally a third or fourth year Spanish student
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:19.160]   doesn't get right in the traditional Spanish education system.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:25.260]   And yet, here he is, just unconsciously using the proper verb form in a really good way.
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.260]   He's not perfect.
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:32.800]   He messes up his noun selection sometimes, messes up his "la" and "el" just like I do,
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.160]   just like we all do.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:38.580]   Sometimes he messes up his conjugations, but he's totally unaware of them.
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:42.760]   He's totally unaware of the errors, and it just flows very naturally from him.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:47.920]   My wife says, "Man, I wish I could just speak as naturally as he does."
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.800]   And I feel the same way.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.600]   Now, let me just go through the process again.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.720]   I guess the other thing I need to say, what else did we do?
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.880]   We did a little bit of focused study.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.320]   I was able to find a book.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.600]   I think it was also a DK book.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.880]   It was written in English, but it was like your first Spanish book.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:10.000]   I found it at Barnes & Noble in Colorado.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.680]   I picked it up, and I gave that to him.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:19.520]   And what we had him do as part of his homeschool was each day he would learn a page of vocabulary
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.520]   from that.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:25.240]   So, it had probably 20 to 30 words of vocabulary, and since he could read, his job was to learn
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.240]   the vocabulary, and we'd quiz him.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:32.400]   Beyond that, he's done no formal grammar books, no drills, no anything.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:37.360]   I guess my wife sat with him and taught him and went over and explained to him how yo
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:46.440]   estoy, tu estas, el/ella, usted está, nosotros estamos, vosotros estáis, ustedes están.
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.520]   And did the same thing for ser, which means I am.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:54.320]   Sorry, those are the two I am verbs, to be verbs in Spanish.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:58.280]   And so, she went over that with him, but didn't go over future tense, past tense, anything,
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.800]   but we just read to him.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.520]   And really, really phenomenal results.
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.560]   That's the seven-year-old who's reading.
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:10.080]   The five-year-old who is reading has very much resisted this process.
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:14.920]   Sorry, the five-year-old who is not reading, not yet reading in English, nor in Spanish,
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:18.540]   but has very much resisted learning Spanish.
[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:21.920]   Didn't have any interest in it, didn't want to do it, didn't want to speak Spanish, didn't
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.280]   want to listen to anybody speak Spanish.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:28.120]   But I have held strong and continued to read.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.680]   And she's been on a similar timeline, but of course she was younger.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.200]   And so, I've continued to read.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.040]   I continue to do the reading now.
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:41.000]   At this point in time, she's not reading advanced, she's not listening to advanced texts, but
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.360]   I'm still reading storybooks.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.200]   One of the series that I found was Franklin the Turtle.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.680]   I was able to find Franklin the Turtle books translated into Spanish.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:54.360]   It's a Canadian children's book series that the original just had beautiful artwork, really
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.320]   lovely, short stories.
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:59.600]   And so, I bought tons of them in Spanish.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:07.440]   And I can read to her a Franklin the Tortuga book in Spanish without translating, and she'll
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.440]   understand it.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:13.560]   And I'm reading to her significant texts, and she's understanding significant amounts.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:16.400]   Now, she still asks and picks out, "Hey, what does such and such mean?"
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.840]   And I translate any word.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:23.360]   What I've stopped doing at this point with her is I've stopped translating the full book.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:28.200]   For a time, I used to translate all the book, but now I'll translate any particular word
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:32.360]   she wants to know, but I have stopped translating the full book.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:37.320]   Similar for my three-year-old, but neither my three-year-old nor my five-year-old are
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.920]   yet speaking.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.320]   Neither of them has been interested in speaking in Spanish, and I've just let it go.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:46.440]   I continue to read to them, and I know that in time it will come.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.840]   So that's my experience.
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:50.840]   That's what I have learned.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:58.200]   Now, what's exciting to me is there's a lot of academic research, independently done,
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:03.720]   actually researched, that would say that what I did kind of by accident, just making up
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.720]   in my head thinking, "How can I do this?"
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:11.800]   What I did is actually a really compelling learning methodology for anybody who wants
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.240]   to learn a foreign language.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:20.740]   And these theories have, for me, made a big difference in my own personal language acquisition.
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:25.480]   And I've seen the effectiveness in Spanish such to the point where my plan is I'm going
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.880]   to repeat this process probably next year.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:28.880]   We'll see.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:29.880]   I don't want to go prematurely.
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:35.000]   I could start another language now with my eldest, but I don't want to just single him
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   out.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.280]   But I'm going to repeat this process with a third language now, probably starting in
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:43.400]   2021, or at least when I think the children are ready.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:47.920]   Now, I should acknowledge, I'm going to tell you about some of these theories and explain
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.920]   them.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:53.480]   First of all, that Spanish is a fairly easy language for English speakers to learn.
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.620]   It's a tier one language.
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:31:03.360]   By tier one, I'm referring to the research done by the US American Foreign Service Institute
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.160]   on different tiers of languages.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:11.660]   The US Foreign Service Institute was tasked, obviously many decades ago, with teaching
[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:17.400]   Americans foreign languages so that they could be useful when they went abroad for diplomatic
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.400]   service.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:22.800]   They were in the US American diplomatic corps.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:27.400]   After many years of teaching, they came through with an analysis of how long it takes to learn
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.840]   a language.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:32.980]   This is specifically for a native English speaker.
[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:39.320]   They have five tiers of different languages.
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:44.800]   Tier one languages, which are languages that are closely related to English, they estimate
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:52.920]   that it takes about somewhere between 575 to 600 hours to teach a tier one language
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.280]   to an English speaker.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:00.120]   Tier one languages include Afrikaans, Danish, Dutch, French, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese,
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.400]   Romanian, Spanish, and Swedish.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:11.800]   The reason these are fairly easy for English speakers to learn is there are a lot of cognates.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.400]   There's a lot of similarity.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:19.440]   There are a lot of words that sound very similar between English and Spanish.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:26.160]   If you understand English and you speak English, then you can pick up a lot of the words that
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.880]   are cognates, that sound similar.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:34.440]   If you think about it, let's say their research is that it takes 600 hours.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.680]   Let me now map that to what I have done with my children.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:44.280]   If it takes 600 hours to teach a language to somebody, then if you divide 600 by 52
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:51.320]   weeks, so 600, calculator failed, 600 divided by 52 equals 11.5 hours a week.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:58.560]   If you divide that, let's divide the 600 by 365 to get a daily number, that's 1.64
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:59.560]   hours a day.
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:05.600]   Now reflect back on what I told you that we do, that we did, that I do with the children,
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:11.080]   that I told you that we read to the children probably something like an hour and a half
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:14.560]   a day to two hours, depending on the day.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:18.600]   Again, I read 20 to 30 minutes a day at the breakfast table.
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:23.960]   My wife will read to the children sometimes all together, and this ranges depending on
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.040]   what we're doing, but sometimes it's a couple of hours a day.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:32.640]   Sometimes it's an hour a day, but certainly not less than an hour a day during the normal
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:33.640]   day.
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:38.160]   I read to the children usually when I get off work at five o'clock, five to six o'clock,
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:41.440]   so usually 30 to 45 minutes of reading there.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:47.800]   Then I read to the children before bed for 30 to 45 minutes.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:54.680]   In that context, the idea that a child can learn a language in a year or so just with
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:34:00.320]   reading is a very realistic context for one of these easier languages for an English speaker,
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:04.640]   such as Spanish or any of those languages I said.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:10.760]   And then if you add to that what I described about my son just starting to read to himself,
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:16.960]   if you picture the fact that, let's say that he reads, I would estimate three hours a day,
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:21.560]   something maybe that's too little.
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:27.020]   So he does school, which of course is largely reading, but school is in English.
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:31.800]   So let's just say he reads to himself two to three hours a day, then you can understand
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:36.160]   that he's very quickly learning the language, a language like Spanish.
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:41.560]   Now category two for the Foreign Service Institute, they estimate German is a category two or
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:45.500]   tier two language requiring about 750 hours.
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:51.560]   So if you divide 750 by 365, that would come out to be about two hours a day.
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:59.180]   A category three language requires 900 hours where there are significant differences between,
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:04.020]   sorry, there are differences between English and these languages, Indonesian, Malaysian,
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:05.180]   and Swahili.
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:08.340]   Category four, they estimate takes 1,100 hours.
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:12.220]   These are languages with significant linguistic and cultural differences from English.
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:13.720]   I'll read you the list.
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:20.340]   It's Albanian, Amharic, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Bengali, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Burmese, Croatian,
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:23.980]   Czech, Estonian, Finnish, Georgian, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Khmer,
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:28.740]   Lao, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Mongolian, Nepali, Pashto, Persian, Polish, Russian,
[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:34.580]   Serbian, Sinhala, Slovak, Slovenian, Tagalog, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, Uzbek, Vietnamese,
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:36.500]   Xhosa, and Zulu.
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:41.820]   And then category five languages require, from their estimate, these are languages that
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:46.940]   are exceptionally difficult for native English speakers, require about 2,200 hours of input.
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:52.900]   So that would be Arabic, Cantonese, Chinese, Mandarin, Chinese, and Japanese, and Korean.
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:58.940]   So if we were to estimate 2,200 hours and divide that by two hours a day, that would
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:05.360]   now be 1,100 days of study, which would come out to be about three years versus one year.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:11.640]   So I don't think that we would have achieved these same results in one year if we had been
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.000]   doing this in Arabic.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.740]   But what we did get was dramatic results with Spanish, which is awesome.
[00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:23.800]   And I want to talk now about this particular methodology, because there are a couple of
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:31.280]   things that are very much that I see working really effectively with as I watch the children
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.280]   learn Spanish.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:39.000]   And I'm going to talk about some of these language theories, because they're really
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.800]   helpful to me, and they've changed how I have started studying languages.
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:49.680]   I've recently, my goal for this year was I was really, really studying Spanish, partly
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.560]   so I could do a better job with teaching my children.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.200]   But I decided, you know what, I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to try to see if I
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:00.360]   can get a C2 certificate in Spanish, which is advanced, near native speaker.
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.200]   And so I was working and working on that.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.160]   But I didn't really have a plan for how to do it.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:09.160]   I hired a tutor that I worked with, but the tutor could talk with me, but I didn't really
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:10.420]   have a plan.
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:12.840]   And I just didn't like a lot of the stuff that I did.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:16.520]   And I said, and then I came across some of these theories, and it totally changed my
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:18.560]   learning.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.720]   Because what I stopped doing was doing anything that I didn't like.
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.120]   I stopped doing anything I didn't like.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.240]   I stopped doing grammar exercises.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.240]   I stopped doing drills.
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:28.320]   I stopped studying vocabulary.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.500]   And what I started doing was reading.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:31.880]   And I just started reading extensively.
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:37.240]   And I've since learned that not only is this incredibly powerful, but it's proven that
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:44.840]   simply doing extensive reading will help you to learn a language very, very dramatically.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:49.960]   Now the leader in this space is a linguist named Stephen Krashen.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:59.280]   And years ago, he started studying the process and he came up with five different hypotheses
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.540]   that he identified that make all the difference in the world.
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:06.200]   Now his first hypothesis was called the input hypothesis.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:11.000]   The input hypothesis states that learners progress in their knowledge of the language
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.960]   when they comprehend language input that is slightly more advanced than their current
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.320]   level.
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:22.920]   Krashen called this level of input I plus one, where I is the learner's interlanguage
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:26.520]   and plus one is the next stage of language acquisition.
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:35.460]   So from my experience now over the last year teaching my children this language, I see
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.280]   that this is something I did really effectively.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:40.200]   I started with very simple children's books.
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:46.000]   And there's a whole world of what's called TPRS, where people will encourage us to tell
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.520]   stories and never to translate.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:49.440]   I don't know if that's the best theory or not.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:52.880]   All I know is that for me, I translated.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.680]   But there's a whole world of theory where people say you shouldn't even translate.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:00.640]   You should just start with books and point to the pictures and tell the children stories
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:03.480]   and repeat it with very, very simple stories.
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:06.680]   I just started with children's books and I did the translation.
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:10.600]   But the language was fairly simple.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:14.200]   Children's books are not a great way of learning language because the vocabulary doesn't repeat
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.800]   enough, I think.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:20.620]   But still, they listen enough that they started to get the basics.
[00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:24.980]   And that was really useful to them.
[00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:27.960]   Now there are three corollaries that Krashen teaches.
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:32.840]   And by the way, I'm pulling this outline directly from the Wikipedia page, which you can review,
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.480]   called the Input Hypothesis for Language Learning.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:36.480]   And there are three corollaries.
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:40.720]   Number one, that talking or output is not practicing.
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:45.800]   So Krashen stresses that speaking in the target language does not result in language acquisition.
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:50.040]   Although speaking can indirectly assist in language acquisition, the ability to speak
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:53.240]   is not the cause of language learning or acquisition.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:40:02.320]   Instead, comprehensible output is the effect of language acquisition.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.920]   So this is something that I did accidentally.
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:08.640]   Well, I didn't want to bother my younger ones were so resistant.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.320]   I didn't try to make them talk.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.880]   I didn't try to make them talk at all.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.200]   I just read to them.
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:16.600]   And it turns out that this has been very, very effective, that they're starting to speak.
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:21.880]   Again, my very resistant five-year-old is starting to speak a little bit naturally.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:28.640]   Just a couple of sentences, you know, "Yo quiero esto," and insert a noun here.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:34.200]   But it actually turned out that really effective, that just me talking to them was a good, was
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:37.720]   a very effective form of learning.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:40.740]   Now number two, the corollary of the Input Hypothesis.
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:45.220]   When enough comprehensible input is provided, I plus one is present.
[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:49.800]   If language models and teachers provide enough comprehensible input, then the structures
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:53.640]   that acquirers are ready to learn will be present in that input.
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:57.920]   And according to Krashen, this is a better method of developing grammatical accuracy
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:59.240]   than direct grammar teaching.
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.720]   And I've seen this happen.
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:08.720]   I see that I can, that my eldest child now understands and speaks using subjunctive and
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:16.920]   conditional and all of these more advanced forms, but that happened naturally at a natural
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:17.920]   pace.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.640]   And then number three, the teaching order is not based on the natural order.
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.720]   Instead, students will acquire the language in a natural order by receiving comprehensible
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:24.720]   input.
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:29.040]   And so what we did wound up being really effective, just providing lots and lots of comprehensible
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.040]   input.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:34.840]   Now, number two hypothesis is called the Acquisition Learning Hypothesis.
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:38.600]   The Acquisition Learning Hypothesis claims that there is a strict separation between
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.440]   acquisition and learning.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:46.840]   Krashen saw acquisition as a purely subconscious process and learning as a conscious process
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:52.520]   and claimed that improvement in language ability was only dependent upon acquisition and never
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:54.200]   on learning.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:42:00.320]   And so this particular feature is something that I have seen, that having, I've not taught
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.920]   my children anything related to the language.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:07.680]   I've simply had them listen to it and then hear what it meant by translating.
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:10.000]   I read in Spanish, then I translate.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.200]   I read a phrase, then I translate.
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.240]   I read a phrase, then I translate.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:18.320]   And simply through repetition, they have absorbed the words.
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:25.840]   And what's funny to me is hearing my five-year-old, so give you a picture, a typical scene.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:30.880]   I'm holding in my hands the Franklin book that I read to my children last night at bedtime
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:34.760]   called Franklin Quiere una Mascota, Franklin Wants a Pet.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.920]   And so here's a typical scene of how this works.
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.400]   I'm reading to the children, to all the children.
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:45.380]   The seven-year-old is listening and enjoys the story and enjoys the pictures because
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:47.700]   it's simple and fun and beautiful pictures.
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:49.920]   But he understands everything perfectly.
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:54.040]   The five-year-old on occasion asks a question, but the three-year-old has a much more limited
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:59.080]   vocabulary because a lot of the books that I've read to him, or read to all of them,
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:01.280]   he just is uninterested in.
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.680]   But I'll read a sentence like this.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:06.960]   Si yo tuviera una mascota, quisiera que fuera un pájaro, dijo Oso.
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:14.400]   So this is a, grammatically speaking, the translation is, if I had a pet, I would like
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:19.200]   that pet to be a bird, said bear, Oso.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:24.480]   So, but this is a fairly complex or advanced grammatical form.
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:29.960]   Si yo tuviera una mascota, quisiera que fuera un pájaro, dijo Oso.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:35.860]   It's a conditional and subjunctive form of grammar, which none of the children have any
[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:42.280]   clue what that means, but the three-year-old will hone in on the word, you know, mascota,
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.280]   right?
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:48.080]   He knows what pájaro is because we can point to, you know, birds outside of the window,
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:51.680]   but he'll hone in on mascota and he'll ask, what's a mascota?
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:56.160]   And the five-year-old has never been taught what mascota is, but she'll respond, oh, it's
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.160]   pet.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:03.020]   And now she's doing the translating for him after having acquired or absorbed the words.
[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:08.280]   And watching this process is fascinating to me because it really does work.
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:09.280]   Let's go on.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.800]   Number three, the monitor hypothesis.
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:16.120]   The monitor hypothesis states that consciously learned language can only be used to monitor
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:17.120]   language output.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.960]   It can never be the source of spontaneous speech.
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:26.600]   And so the idea here with the monitor hypothesis is that as adults, when we study a language,
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:31.240]   then we are trying to analyze if we're saying something right.
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:36.560]   So if I were going to say a Spanish sentence like this, si yo tuviera una mascota, quisiera
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:40.960]   que, and I have to stop and ask, you know, what do I say?
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:42.640]   Quisiera que ser?
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:43.640]   No.
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:46.920]   Quisiera que fuera or fuese?
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:49.440]   Quisiera que, I have to monitor that.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:52.520]   But when you're doing that, that slows you down.
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:58.240]   And so the monitor system where you're actually analyzing, okay, I'm using a conditional form.
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:04.720]   Si yo tuviera, if I had una mascota, quisiera, I would like.
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:06.680]   If I had, I would like.
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:16.000]   That's something that basically, it gives adults more progress in the beginning, but
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.760]   it actually slows everybody down.
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:24.960]   Because when Krashen talks about it, in order for you to actually analyze your speech, the
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:29.160]   acquirer or learner must know the rule, which is difficult condition to meet because it
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:32.880]   means that the speaker must have had explicit instruction on the language form.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:37.080]   You have to understand in English that if you were going to say, if I had, I would like,
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:39.840]   so you have to know the rule.
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:43.240]   You have to be focused on thinking about the rules and speaking it, and you have to have
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:48.000]   the time to use it, which requires you to slow down and think about it.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.600]   But if you can just simply get rid of the monitor and not use it when you're speaking,
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.080]   which is hard for adults, right?
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:46:00.700]   You can do that when you're writing, you can stop and think, if I had, I would like.
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:05.160]   But you can't do that very well when you're speaking, then you can learn more effectively.
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:08.160]   And so watching my son, he doesn't have a monitor.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.680]   He has no fear of speaking the language.
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:15.640]   He's never known that you're supposed to be embarrassed about speaking a language, which
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:17.880]   we'll come to in the fifth hypothesis.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.480]   He just simply speaks the language.
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:26.000]   And so he'll naturally use the proper forms unconsciously in many situations.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.960]   And so it's fascinating to see that.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:31.800]   Number four and five, the natural order hypothesis states that the language is acquired in a
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:36.120]   particular order and that this order does not change between learners and is not affected
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:37.520]   by explicit instruction.
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:42.640]   This basically means that all languages have an order that children learn them in.
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:47.480]   And this is unique to the language, but your child is going to use certain forms, certain
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:53.960]   conjugations, certain tenses, certain conditionals later after they use the present thing.
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:58.920]   Your child doesn't learn to say, "If I had, then I would like," at beginning.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:02.520]   Your child first learns, "I want."
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.320]   That's how the English language works.
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.560]   Now, that's that natural order hypothesis.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:14.200]   I have observed it in watching my children develop their language, but that's not particularly
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.200]   interesting to me.
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:19.960]   The most important is actually number five, the active filter hypothesis.
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:23.820]   This states that learners' ability to acquire language is constrained if they are experiencing
[00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:26.920]   negative emotions such as fear or embarrassment.
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:29.760]   At such times, the effective filter is said to be up.
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.880]   And this is a very big deal for me.
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:38.840]   This is very hard for me, especially if when learning a language, we focus on speaking
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:41.040]   because I want to speak properly.
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:44.600]   I want to speak with proper pronunciation.
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:48.080]   I want to speak with excellent grammar because my pride is involved.
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:51.920]   My self-image is related to how I speak a language.
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:56.480]   I take a great deal of pride in how I speak and wield the English language.
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:03.880]   I take pride in my vocabulary, in the way that I express words with interesting pictures
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:08.840]   associated with more interesting phraseology and construction.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:10.320]   It's important to me.
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:16.560]   And so that naturally goes over to foreign languages, but I'm not good at that.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.640]   And so it's difficult for me to do that.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:23.840]   And so here what I have seen is that in the home environment where I have never, we don't
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.860]   give our children tests of any kind.
[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:29.840]   I think tests are basically worthless for learning.
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:32.160]   They're worthwhile for placement.
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:36.160]   You know, a test, you know, the SAT, although this is of course a subject of much debate,
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:42.200]   a test like the SAT may be very useful for a college to place students and to assess
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:45.120]   them, but for learning, you don't learn anything from tests.
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:49.680]   So we don't give our children any tests of any kind as part of their schooling.
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:52.400]   And I don't intend to start anytime soon.
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:55.240]   When they reach a point where they need to start doing that, we'll practice some test-taking
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:58.280]   skills, but tests are not particularly useful for learning.
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:02.960]   And so because my children, especially my eldest, who again is the one, is the only
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:09.720]   one who is actually fully fluent at this point in time, because of just an exclusively positive
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:12.400]   environment, he's never gotten anything wrong.
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:15.900]   No one has ever told him that he said anything incorrect in Spanish.
[00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:17.880]   No one's ever said, "Oh, you did this wrong.
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:18.880]   You said this wrong."
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:20.460]   He has no filter.
[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:29.060]   He has no problem speaking and trying things out because he doesn't have any fear or any
[00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:30.540]   embarrassment.
[00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:35.920]   And watching how powerful that is to me has been a real light bulb, a real revelation,
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:40.440]   an epiphany as I've seen, "Wow, look at how powerful this is."
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:48.640]   When you have an environment of unconditional positivity and you have an environment where
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:54.580]   there's no fear of mistake, then the brain doesn't shut down and start to control output
[00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:58.280]   and make a person feel bad because they can't say something perfectly.
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:05.240]   It's fascinating to me to have seen it really effectively over the last year to just a really,
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.240]   really high level.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:11.640]   I want to talk for a moment about extensive reading, because what I have now researched
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:18.680]   and come to understand is that what I have done has, for the reasons stated, good anchoring
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:23.280]   in the academic literature, which I didn't know when I started, but I now do.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:28.760]   And more importantly, what I have done with my eldest, who's a reader, has tremendously
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:31.960]   strong anchoring in the academic literature.
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:39.800]   That extensive reading as a language acquisition process is very, very powerful, because what
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:43.440]   it does, if you get the material right at the right level, and so again, it needs to
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:48.640]   be comprehensible input, the reader needs to be able to understand the majority of what's
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:53.940]   on the page, which means that it needs to be simple, but just a few extra things.
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:59.920]   When you get that level right, though, the reader will automatically acquire the vocabulary.
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:01.560]   I'll mention the Los Cinco books.
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:06.720]   The Los Cinco books are fascinating to my son because of the stories, because of the
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:07.920]   adventures.
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:13.720]   They have a significant number of words that he doesn't know, but he knows enough to be
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:16.520]   able to capture the gist of the story.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:20.400]   And because he's reading them and then rereading them and then reading them and then rereading
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:26.000]   them, he picks up the words naturally, as I did with the English language, to the point
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.040]   where now his vocabulary in Spanish is probably not as extensive as mine, because he hasn't
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:40.680]   done, he hasn't done reading in as many areas as I have, so I would imagine that my vocabulary
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:46.960]   is clearly more extensive than his, but he knows lots of words that I have never taught
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:47.960]   him.
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:54.800]   Now, when he speaks to me in Spanish, he'll break out some word that I simply don't know,
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:59.920]   and I can understand what he's saying by the context of his speech, but it's a word that
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:07.000]   I'm sure he's never heard, I'm sure that he doesn't know, and that it's something that
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.320]   he picked up exclusively from his reading.
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:16.600]   And to me, that's exciting, because it means that if I can simply continue throughout his
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:25.880]   lifetime of plying him with enough books that are of interest to him on diverse subjects
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:30.280]   of all kinds of things, and I mean that, I do it with a very wide variety.
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:35.680]   The storybooks I love, because there's nothing more than a good story that captures your
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:41.440]   imagination to get you to read hundreds and hundreds of pages, but it can't just be storybooks.
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:46.560]   I've got books on all kinds of stuff, so there's a very diverse level of vocabulary, and he'll
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:50.960]   in time pick up a diverse vocabulary from the diversity of these books, but extensive
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:57.120]   reading as an, even as an exclusive strategy, it works.
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:02.960]   The last point I want to make on Spanish and this process is to briefly discuss accent.
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:11.960]   The place where my eldest, my seven-year-old, is still novice, not novice, the place where
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:18.200]   he's not advanced at this point in time is in his verbal accent, in his spoken accent.
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:25.560]   He doesn't speak with a horrible American accent, but he doesn't sound like a native
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:32.400]   Spanish speaker, and I think this is natural due to his limited exposure to Spanish speakers.
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:38.040]   I have not succeeded in exposing him to a lot of spoken Spanish.
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:39.080]   I could, right?
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:43.800]   I could go and find a Spanish school with native Spanish speakers and enroll him in
[00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:46.760]   that, but again, I think the cost of that is too high.
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:52.640]   But that's where he hasn't had enough exposure to the spoken language in order to really
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:54:01.800]   develop a native-like accent, although he may have a native-like level of vocabulary,
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:04.200]   which he does for his age, an age appropriate.
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:06.160]   He's beyond his age.
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:11.880]   He's reading books that are targeted to readers past his age in the Spanish language, when
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:15.680]   we need to look at degraded readers, degraded for children.
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:18.760]   And although he may have extensive vocabulary and good grammar instruction, what he doesn't
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:21.520]   have is a native-like accent.
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:25.560]   And I'm sure it'll come in time, but it's just going to be a matter of more listening.
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:30.920]   The only thing I've been able to find that for good audio consumption is I found the
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:36.600]   Boxcar Children series in Spanish on Audible, and so I got all of those and he loved those.
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:39.520]   And so that gives him exposure to a narrator.
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:43.320]   But I haven't been able to get enough audio books in Spanish for him because of number
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:48.280]   one, the subject matter of it's been hard to find high-quality audio books designed
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:49.280]   for children.
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:53.800]   And then number two, I have significant resistance still with my other children to listening
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:54.960]   to Spanish audio books.
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:57.200]   I force it, but not for too long.
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:01.520]   And so that'll be the big thing where he still needs to step up his game and listen to more
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:06.520]   spoken Spanish so that his accent will naturally correct and he'll acquire more of a native-like
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:08.200]   accent.
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:13.640]   But on all the other levels, I'm very, very pleased with the progress and I'm very pleased
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:15.720]   with the methodology.
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:17.800]   So what does this mean and where do we go from here?
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:19.400]   Well, where do we go from here?
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:28.200]   The first thing is that I'm very confident now that we've cracked the code for reading,
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:34.960]   I'm very confident that for as long as my son is in my home, I can keep his language
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:39.160]   ability up by simply buying him more books.
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:45.440]   I now consider this to be the most important benchmark in language learning is simply acquiring
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:51.200]   the ability to read in the foreign language that you're learning to the point where you
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:55.800]   can enjoy it and read whatever kind of books that you enjoy.
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:56:01.080]   In hindsight, I now realize that this was the biggest weakness for me in my own language
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:02.080]   journey.
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:06.920]   I practiced speaking when I was younger, but I had two years of high school Spanish,
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:11.640]   I practiced speaking, I learned, I spent time when I was in college in Costa Rica in a Spanish-speaking
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:15.880]   country living with a Spanish family, speaking in Spanish, that helped some.
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:21.760]   But then when I went back to the United States, I spoke virtually no Spanish for years and
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:26.920]   years and years and my Spanish language abilities atrophied because I didn't reach the point
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:29.560]   at which I was reading for pleasure in Spanish.
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:33.160]   I would pick up a book and it would just simply be too hard.
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:37.040]   I had to look up too many words and I was too much of a perfectionist to just let the
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:39.760]   words wash over me like a child does.
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:45.720]   And so I never read in Spanish and I couldn't listen to audio books that I enjoyed in Spanish
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:50.880]   because they had too much vocabulary that I didn't know and that I couldn't enjoy.
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:56.600]   And so for me, what I have done over the last year in my own Spanish journey is I've cracked
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:57:01.840]   this level for myself, is I got to the point, as I previously discussed, using the application
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:05.840]   that Steve Kaufman developed called LingQ, L-I-N-G-Q, which is phenomenal.
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:11.400]   I got to the point by reading in LingQ that I could just enjoy reading novels in Spanish.
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:14.040]   And so I picked the kind of books that I like to read.
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:18.760]   For me, I enjoy thrillers and I started reading them in Spanish.
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:24.320]   So I would buy a copy of a Tom Clancy book that was translated into Spanish.
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:31.440]   Then I would download it, I would strip the DRM from that, load it up into my app, into
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:36.360]   my LingQ app, and then read it in LingQ to the point where I could get enough vocabulary
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:42.800]   to where now I can read that same book without the crutch of LingQ and I can enjoy it.
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:52.240]   I've also worked hard enough on amplifying, now the Spanish is affecting my English, on
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:55.360]   broadening my English vocabulary.
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:58:01.440]   Sorry, I've been successful enough at broadening my Spanish vocabulary to also to the point
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:03.040]   where I can listen to audio books.
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:11.800]   And so the last year I've listened to what, eight, probably eight or 10 novels in Spanish.
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:17.280]   So I found the Michael Connelly crime novels, those translated into Spanish and a number
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:18.660]   of other ones as well.
[00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:22.940]   And so I can get those on Audible, I can download those and I can enjoy those stories.
[00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:28.820]   And so I'm at the point now where going forward, now that I'm reading, I'll be able to maintain
[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:29.820]   Spanish.
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:34.080]   So as long as I read a couple books a year, a couple of novels a year in Spanish, listen
[00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:39.060]   to perhaps a couple of audio books per year in Spanish, I'll be able to maintain my Spanish
[00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:41.740]   ability in a way that I couldn't before.
[00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:45.900]   And I think this is a big concern with children is if we can get them reading comfortably
[00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:50.020]   in Spanish, then they'll be able to maintain that language for life.
[00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:53.580]   Whereas if we don't, then it's very easy for them to lose a language.
[00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:58.460]   You can lose, you can learn a language to a very high level at seven years old and at
[00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:02.000]   45 years old, not be able to speak the language a bit.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:07.620]   And so I now see that with any language that we learn, I think the most practical goal
[00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:14.040]   should be get to the point where you can sit down with an adult level book of whatever
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:16.260]   genre you're interested in.
[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:18.940]   Could be self-help, I read self-help books in Spanish.
[00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:24.620]   Now it could be a novel, whatever, could be anything you're interested in, but an adult
[00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:28.980]   level book, the kind of book that you would read in your native language, get to the point
[00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:32.420]   where you can sit down, you can buy one of those off the shelf or order off the internet
[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:35.540]   and enjoy that book in the foreign language.
[00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:37.580]   You may not know every word, that's fine.
[00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:42.180]   But if you can do that, then all you need to do to maintain your language ability is
[00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:46.540]   simply read the book, read a couple of books a year in that language and or listen to a
[00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:49.640]   couple of audio books a year in that language.
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:51.780]   And that's not hard, that's not hard work.
[00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:55.940]   If you can get to the point where it's enjoyable for you to read the book in the foreign language
[00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:59.240]   and find something that you genuinely enjoy.
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:05.540]   So for language maintenance, I now believe this is the level.
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:09.300]   I've gotten my son to that, which is exciting to me because now we can possibly go on to
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:10.820]   another language.
[01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:12.460]   Let's talk about learning another language.
[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:19.220]   I have now decided for myself that this is going to be my primary language learning methodology
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:20.900]   going forward.
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:23.340]   Because over the years I've tried to learn other languages.
[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:25.580]   You know, for years I've tried to learn French.
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:26.820]   I've really tried.
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:29.860]   The problem is that I thought that because I was, this is how I learned a language in
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:34.260]   high school, I thought that if I was going to learn French, I needed to find either a
[01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:40.380]   French class or a French teacher or a French grammar, you know, exercise book.
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:42.780]   And I thought I needed to do exercises.
[01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:48.380]   I thought, well, if I learned in Spanish, "Oh, ah, ah, almost, on," I need to figure
[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:50.420]   out what that is in French and repeat the same thing.
[01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:54.300]   And so over the years I would buy a French language instruction book and I would usually
[01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:56.860]   do about 30 pages and I would get bored.
[01:00:56.860 --> 01:01:00.780]   I would buy a French audio book course and I would listen to about the first third of
[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:02.400]   it, then I would get bored.
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.020]   And I would just do this again and again and again.
[01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:06.500]   And I would buy something and then get bored.
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:10.820]   And I never made any progress with the language because I was bored.
[01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:15.700]   But once I realized and basically gave myself permission, one of the things I've done as
[01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:19.100]   an adult, I've stopped doing things I don't like, is I gave myself permission.
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:20.820]   I was like, "I'm not going to do that anymore."
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:25.980]   And once I realized that just simply reading and listening in a foreign language is a perfectly
[01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:37.020]   valid methodology of learning a language, then to me everything has become fun.
[01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:42.740]   And so what I've done is I've just started over the last week, I decided, because I can't
[01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:46.220]   take a Spanish exam because everything, all the test centers are shut down, I decided
[01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:47.880]   I was going to switch to French.
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:50.740]   And so now my strategy is I'm just reading.
[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:52.940]   I'm reading and listening in French.
[01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:56.740]   And I'm finding it to be very, very effective.
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:02:00.140]   Last week I finished my first ever book that I've read fully in French.
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:08.540]   I read Jules Verne's Around the World in 80 Days.
[01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:09.540]   And I read it in French.
[01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:10.540]   It's an open source book.
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:11.540]   So I was able to find it.
[01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:13.660]   I read it in LingQ, which helped me with the vocabulary.
[01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:19.500]   And then I listened to the audio recording of it that came with it.
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:24.060]   And so I could listen to a native speaker read it to me, which helped me with my pronunciation.
[01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:27.180]   One of the things with French is, unlike Spanish, I've never been able to understand the French
[01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:28.180]   pronunciation rules.
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:30.300]   And I've always felt like I need a teacher to teach me these rules.
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:34.380]   Well, just by reading the book and listening to the audio book at the same time, it's made
[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:35.860]   all the difference in the world.
[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:40.780]   And so now I'm studying French, but I'm studying it in a way that's really interesting to me
[01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:42.740]   of I'm exclusively reading.
[01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:44.540]   I'm reading and I'm listening.
[01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:46.100]   I've got several audio books.
[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:50.500]   I'm listening to Tim Ferriss's Four-Hour Workweek in French.
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:55.140]   I'm listening to a Michael Connolly novel in French.
[01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:58.380]   And I'm reading several books in French as well.
[01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:03.420]   And I'm reading the original Robert Ludlum, Jason Bourne book translated into French,
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:06.380]   the one that was published back in the 1970s.
[01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:11.220]   I'm reading a couple of another Jules Verne novel in French and just reading things.
[01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:15.500]   And the stories are good enough that they keep me interested, even if I don't know the
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.500]   language.
[01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:22.100]   And I'm seeing really, really awesome progress in my abilities.
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:25.460]   I'm not at all trying to create any output at this point in time.
[01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:26.700]   I'm not trying to speak in French.
[01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:31.060]   I'm not trying to write in French.
[01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:32.060]   I'm just listening.
[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:36.020]   And the reason for that is I always thought you needed to speak a language to learn a
[01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:37.020]   language.
[01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:40.340]   Certainly, at some point you need to speak.
[01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:46.420]   But Steve Kaufman has convinced me that you can speak much later and that your speaking
[01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:49.260]   will be better if you can understand broadly.
[01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:54.060]   I don't gain much pleasure out of sitting down and having a forced conversation with
[01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:58.340]   somebody and practicing a dialogue of how to check into a hotel.
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:00.820]   If I'm going to talk to somebody, I want to talk about something interesting.
[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:05.420]   And that's one of the theories that has been effective for him as a polyglot is simply
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:10.340]   getting yourself to a very high degree of understanding before you try to speak.
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:15.740]   So certainly you do need to speak, but I've come to be convinced that you can wait to
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:20.020]   speak until later and that if you can understand broadly, you can do it.
[01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:21.860]   I've also become...
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:28.580]   I'm persuaded, haven't proved it for myself yet, I'm persuaded to some degree on the activation
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:30.140]   hypothesis.
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:37.100]   There are some language learners and teachers who believe that if you focus exclusively
[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:43.600]   on input where you read and you listen and you develop a broad degree of understanding,
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:47.700]   what happens is the language is basically there in your head.
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:55.220]   And then once you go to a place where you need the language, one person's estimate is
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:58.660]   three days that if...
[01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:00.040]   What's his name?
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:03.340]   This is what Victor Huliganov says.
[01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:05.580]   I forget his English name.
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:11.780]   Huliganov is a persona that he plays, but he's an accomplished polyglot and he's established
[01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:13.220]   something called...
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:17.700]   Developed something he calls the Gold List Method, which is a method for vocabulary acquisition.
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:23.940]   And in his writings, he believes that once you learn the language, you need three days
[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:25.640]   where you're in...
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:29.260]   Whether you're in country or in a context where your brain says, "Oh, this guy needs
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:30.700]   this information."
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:32.060]   And then you'll...
[01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:33.060]   If you spend...
[01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:36.140]   So if you learn French and you go to France and spend three days in a French speaking
[01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:40.540]   environment, then after three days, everything that you know will be able to come out of
[01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:42.060]   your mouth in a very fluent way.
[01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:45.900]   Now, I don't know that that's true yet or not, but for me, it solves a big problem that
[01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:52.220]   I have with language learning, which is that I don't really want to make artificial appointments
[01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:53.580]   for language study.
[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:57.100]   I've done this a little bit, but I don't really want to sit down and say, "Okay, I got to
[01:05:57.100 --> 01:06:01.820]   do two hours a week to talk to some random person on italki where I don't know if we
[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:04.340]   actually have anything in common or if we actually want to be friends."
[01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:06.820]   I don't like talking to people in that context.
[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:07.820]   It's artificial.
[01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:08.820]   It's not fun.
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:09.900]   It feels like work.
[01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:14.260]   And so to have the permission basically to say, "I can just listen.
[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:15.940]   I can just listen and read."
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:21.380]   And then in time when there's a chance, then talking will be appropriate and it'll work.
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:22.380]   That's a pretty cool thing.
[01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:26.060]   I'm testing that right now with French because I have no intention of trying to talk or write
[01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:27.060]   right now.
[01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:32.300]   I'm just simply reading and listening and we'll see what happens.
[01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:33.760]   I'm going to try.
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:39.380]   My intention is if I can get my five-year-old to the point where she'll actually start speaking
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:46.380]   Spanish, then I'm going to see if I can repeat this process in 2021 with a new language because
[01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:54.260]   it's been so relatively easy for me to do it with Spanish that I want to see if I can
[01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:57.940]   repeat it with French because it hasn't been all that hard.
[01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:03.420]   All it required me to do was to buy a huge number of books and read to my children.
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:07.980]   And so if I can do that in one language, then why not in a second?
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:11.580]   And so that's one of the reasons why I've decided I need to get my French to the point
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:16.500]   where I actually can read to them effectively so I can do this again until I can get them
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.180]   to be independent learners.
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:23.020]   And so that may be kind of one of my family projects for 2021.
[01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:26.780]   I just got to get my hands on the literature and then figure out.
[01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:32.060]   So by the way, if any of you live in France, if any of you want to rent me a house next
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:34.780]   summer, if you have a house or if you have a guest house or something like that, reach
[01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:35.780]   out to me.
[01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:38.060]   Send me an email, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:42.900]   But I'd probably like to come and spend next summer in France, come for about three months.
[01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:52.500]   Because if we can, that would be a fun experiment to see if I can, if I can, if I start in January
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:57.860]   with reading to them, then what kind of progress would we make if I went ahead and brought
[01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:01.780]   them to an immersive environment, either in France or maybe Quebec or some other French
[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:04.360]   speaking countries is also adequate.
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:08.720]   And what would be the experience of that in terms of their language acquisition, I think
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:09.720]   it'd be an interesting scenario.
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:13.640]   And if I came in the summer, I could find some summer camps and do some interesting
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:16.860]   things and then test putting them into an immersive environment.
[01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:20.460]   So reach out to me if you've got a place that I can rent for a few months rather than just
[01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:22.560]   doing something on Airbnb.
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:25.940]   What I am convinced of, and here's where I want to close the show, is that if you have
[01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:34.740]   children who are learning languages in school, you know, I have nieces and nephews that are
[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:40.700]   learning Latin as part of their language study.
[01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:45.660]   And I've been sending my sister all these resources and saying, "Listen, look, if your
[01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:50.180]   children are going to learn Latin, at least make sure they actually learn Latin and not
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:55.680]   just learn how to do a couple of declensions artificially."
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:00.660]   And so I'm convinced that for any language, the secret is get the content, get the input,
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:02.260]   the comprehensible input.
[01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:05.980]   And so this is, there's a whole movement called the Living Latin Movement where people are
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:10.620]   translating modern books into Latin so that there's material to read in Latin.
[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:13.540]   And there's people where they're speaking in Latin and recording things in Latin.
[01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:17.580]   But if your children are going to learn Latin, don't just make it a classroom thing where
[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:20.460]   they're going to study it for three years, hate it, and then go on.
[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:22.620]   Give them books and get them reading it.
[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:26.380]   And do this with whatever they're interested in.
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:30.720]   So if your children are studying German, get them bunches of books and see if you can do
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.260]   this process.
[01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:34.380]   That's all I have to say right now.
[01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:41.500]   I've tried to give you a clear idea of the levels where my children are, and I wanted
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:49.180]   to do that, but to have an idea so that you would have an idea of what's possible.
[01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:53.660]   But from here, you just take it and apply it, and I'll keep you in the loop as I continue
[01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:58.960]   this experiment and see if I can bring my younger children up to fluent as well.
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:03.740]   And then we'll see if we can repeat this experiment in the years to come, and I'll report back
[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:06.700]   on that with you as well.
[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:08.460]   Now I'm going to do a little experiment.
[01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:12.100]   I just paused for a moment and I went downstairs and I got my son and I told him to come up
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:13.100]   here.
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:22.900]   Son, I've been saying and sharing with my audience a little bit about the progress
[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:26.900]   that you're making in Spanish.
[01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:30.740]   I told them that you've been learning a lot of Spanish.
[01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:31.740]   Is that true?
[01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:32.740]   Yes.
[01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:40.020]   And I was talking with them about some of your favorite books.
[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:42.980]   What do you like about this series of the five?
[01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:49.860]   What do you like the most?
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:11:01.700]   I can't decide, but this is the book that only has something under the ground, and all
[01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:05.540]   the others have something under the ground.
[01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:10.220]   This one doesn't, but it does have a cave.
[01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:12.580]   That's number three, that's your favorite, right?
[01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:13.580]   Yes.
[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:17.700]   But that doesn't mean that I don't like the others.
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:18.700]   I understand.
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:20.260]   I'm not saying that you don't like the others.
[01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:23.380]   I'm just saying that that's your favorite.
[01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:27.500]   It's called "The Five Escape."
[01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:33.780]   How many times have you read this?
[01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:42.860]   I don't remember, but I read almost all of them, but there are like two or three chapters
[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:57.220]   that I don't prefer to read because it's enough with us.
[01:11:57.220 --> 01:12:00.540]   And in this book, it's called "The Five Escape."
[01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:02.140]   What do they escape from?
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:03.140]   I haven't read this.
[01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:04.140]   They're called the Sticks.
[01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:05.140]   The Sticks?
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:06.140]   What is a Stick?
[01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:07.140]   Is that a name?
[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:08.140]   It's the Stick family.
[01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:09.140]   They're evil, they say.
[01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:10.140]   I understand.
[01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:11.140]   And look, here's Julian trying to stop Jorge from going with Tim to the island alone, in his boat.
[01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:12.140]   Does this story take place on Kirin Island?
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:13.140]   Yes.
[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:34.140]   So they went back to Kirin Island?
[01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:43.900]   Now, Julian said, while they were walking to where the boat was, we'll put all of these
[01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:46.140]   things inside the boat.
[01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:53.740]   We'll go home and make noise so the Sticks find out that we're there.
[01:12:53.740 --> 01:13:00.700]   Then we'll go to the platform so they think we're going to take the train.
[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:05.140]   And then they went to the island.
[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:06.140]   They all got in the boat.
[01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:11.140]   Tim didn't jump and he sat on the platform, which was his seat.
[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:15.540]   He was talking with his tongue out, very excited.
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:23.020]   He knew very well that something was happening and that he was also participating.
[01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:31.020]   It was no wonder that he was shaking his tail frantically.
[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:33.020]   We're leaving now.
[01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:47.020]   Wait, if you were comparing the Five and the Hollister series, which one would you prefer?
[01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:48.020]   The Five.
[01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:49.020]   Why?
[01:13:50.020 --> 01:14:00.020]   Because there are many more things happening in the Five than in the Hollister.
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:03.020]   There's a little more adventure?
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:06.020]   Yes, but what is this?
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:08.020]   That's my microphone.
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:12.020]   I'm recording this conversation to share it with my audience.
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:13.020]   Okay.
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:20.020]   Because I was sharing with them the story of your Spanish learning.
[01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:25.020]   I wanted them to listen to your life.
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:28.020]   Where is the little red one of these?
[01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:29.020]   I don't know.
[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:31.020]   There was a red one.
[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:33.020]   What is this toy?
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:34.020]   An airplane.
[01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:35.020]   An airplane?
[01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:36.020]   Yes.
[01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:38.020]   And where did you get it?
[01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:41.020]   You already know.
[01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:46.020]   Yes, but I'm trying to provoke you to talk about something.
[01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:50.020]   I got it at the dentist, right?
[01:14:50.020 --> 01:15:03.020]   And I took off the machine that made the wheels spin on their own.
[01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:09.020]   I just want them to do it under my hand.
[01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:11.020]   Like this.
[01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:14.020]   You took off the spring.
[01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:17.020]   We're looking for that word in Spanish.
[01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:22.020]   And I took off these too.
[01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:23.020]   Okay.
[01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:25.020]   Well, do you like Spanish?
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:26.020]   Do you like to speak Spanish?
[01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:28.020]   Yes.
[01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:30.020]   Especially with books, right?
[01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:31.020]   Yes.
[01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:34.020]   Okay, well, thank you for coming and thank you for...
[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:39.020]   They were running away from the horrible sticks.
[01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:45.020]   But it's true that the sticks are horrible.
[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:47.020]   Oh, how strong.
[01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:49.020]   Okay, thank you, son.
[01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:51.020]   So, there you go.
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:54.020]   For any of you Spanish speakers, you can make your own assessment.
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:57.020]   But one year ago, he didn't speak Spanish.
[01:15:57.020 --> 01:16:02.020]   And you can assess his own level of Spanish at the moment.
[01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:07.020]   The hardest part with children is getting them to talk.
[01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:11.020]   We try to do narration in our household, which means tell things about it.
[01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:18.020]   But he doesn't do narration very effectively in any language.
[01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:20.020]   So, figuring out how to provoke -- he's very talkative.
[01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:23.020]   But figuring out how to provoke a spontaneous conversation is not easy.
[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:24.020]   But there you go.
[01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:25.020]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:29.020]   As we go, I would remind you that I sell a course called
[01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:32.020]   "How to Survive and Thrive During the Coming Economic Crisis."
[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:39.020]   And that course was prepared last year in anticipation of the kind of crisis
[01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:44.020]   that we're living through right now.
[01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:46.020]   It's still just as valid now as it was then.
[01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:51.020]   And I would say it's borne the test of time very, very effectively.
[01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:57.020]   So, if you would like a plan for how to survive and thrive the coming economic crisis,
[01:16:57.020 --> 01:17:01.020]   it's coming, I would encourage you to go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/store.
[01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:05.020]   Check out that course, radicalpersonalfinance.com/store.
[01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:06.020]   I think that you'll be pleased.
[01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:12.020]   And the basic concept that I teach is how to be prepared at home, wherever that is,
[01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:15.020]   but also how to be prepared if you choose to relocate,
[01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:18.020]   especially the value of relocating to a foreign country.
[01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:24.020]   And right now, you can see what a big difference the country that you're in makes
[01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:29.020]   in terms of your experience of something even like a pandemic.
[01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:34.020]   You are having a very different experience of your life of your pandemic,
[01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:41.020]   whether you are in the United States or in Canada or in Germany or in Mexico
[01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:43.020]   or in Brazil or in the Bahamas.
[01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:46.020]   Every single one of these countries has different characteristics.
[01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:50.020]   Now, you feel free to insert what you think is good or bad about that.
[01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:58.020]   But what you'll see is that your country of residence during a crisis makes a dramatic difference
[01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:00.020]   in your experience of that crisis.
[01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:04.020]   But in order for you to be able to go elsewhere,
[01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:07.020]   you need to have done some prior planning and preparation.
[01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:12.020]   There are many people right now as we look forward to another presidential election,
[01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:17.020]   there are many people right now who are looking at Canada and they're saying,
[01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:21.020]   "You know what? If so and so wins, the person I don't like wins the election,
[01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:22.020]   I'm going to Canada."
[01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:30.020]   Well, the answer is no, you're not, unless you've done the hard work of actually sitting down
[01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:32.020]   and figuring out legally how to do it.
[01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:36.020]   If you're just an American passport holder and you want to be a tourist,
[01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:37.020]   you're not going to Canada.
[01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:39.020]   They're not going to accept you right now.
[01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:41.020]   You're not going to Spain.
[01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:43.020]   They're not going to accept you right now.
[01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:47.020]   And so you've got to do the advance work to have the necessary paperwork for you
[01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:50.020]   to be able to go to that country.
[01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:55.020]   I brought a couple of months ago Brandon Miller on from Canadian Immigration,
[01:18:55.020 --> 01:19:00.020]   Maple Immigration, and we did an extensive show on how to move to Canada,
[01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:02.020]   how to get a second passport in Canada.
[01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:05.020]   And I heard from Brandon, by the way, that a bunch of you reached out to him,
[01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:07.020]   which I think is awesome.
[01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:11.020]   You reached out to him, got a free copy of his book called "The Second Passport."
[01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:15.020]   Some of you have engaged his services, which I think is great.
[01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:17.020]   Brandon is a great guy.
[01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:19.020]   And so you've got to do that stuff in advance.
[01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:23.020]   So start with the course at radicalpersonalfinance.com/store called
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:26.020]   "How to Survive and Thrive During the Coming Economic Crisis."
[01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:30.020]   And if you have some ability in language learning,
[01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:34.020]   you'll be a whole lot more confident looking around the world.
[01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:38.020]   The great thing is that English speakers can live well in most countries of the world,
[01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:43.020]   but still if you only speak English, you're kind of stuck to the English--
[01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:47.020]   native English countries, which may or may not be what you're looking for.
[01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:51.020]   But if you're confident that in a year you can learn fluent Spanish,
[01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:53.020]   that opens up dozens of countries.
[01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:55.020]   If you're confident that in a year you can learn fluent French,
[01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:57.020]   that opens up dozens of countries.
[01:19:57.020 --> 01:19:59.020]   And we go on down the list.
[01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:00.020]   So thank you for listening to today's show.
[01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:02.020]   I hope you've enjoyed it, and I'll be back with you very soon.
[01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:04.020]   So go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/store.
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:07.020]   Don't just dream about paradise.
[01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:09.020]   Live it with Fiji Airways.
