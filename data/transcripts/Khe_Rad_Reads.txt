[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.480]   Hello, everybody, it's Sam from the Financial Samurai Podcast, where I try to help you achieve
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.500]   financial freedom sooner rather than later.
[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.720]   Today I have a special guest with me, Kay He, he went to Yale and he was a managing
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:28.120]   director at BlackRock when he decided to retire early, quit in 2015.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.200]   So welcome to the show, Kay.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.200]   Thanks Sam.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.880]   Great to reconnect and pleasure to be here.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.440]   Yeah, we've been connecting here and there for many, many years now, right?
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.400]   When did you start your whole journey post, is it 2015 after BlackRock?
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.600]   Yeah, I think I started my email newsletter, I left in May of 2015.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.640]   And I started my email newsletter kind of six months prior to that.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.640]   But it was very, really like hobbyist pursuit, Gmail, BCC, and I had an anonymous Twitter
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.960]   account for about a year before that, but it was kind of just a mishmash of things.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.880]   Okay, so it's been nine years since you left.
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.240]   And I still remember when you first started, I was thinking, wow, you left BlackRock because
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.960]   I used to cover BlackRock, it was a big money management firm.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.360]   And you had made managing director a level that I wanted to make on the sell side, but
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.040]   I could never quite get there.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.640]   I tried for one year at the age of 34, they said, no, it's not your time.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.640]   I was like, ah, screw it.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.640]   I'm out of here.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.920]   Let's figure out a way to get a service and leave because I didn't enjoy finance after
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.600]   the global financial crisis in 2008, 2009.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.920]   How was your experience during the global financial crisis?
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.720]   It was probably one of the best things that happened to me professionally.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.360]   And the reason why I say this is because I was old enough to get a lot of responsibilities
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.640]   from all the heads that rolled, like what they call battlefield promote.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.080]   In the industry, basically when they lay off your boss and they ask the junior person to
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.040]   take on as much of the responsibility as possible.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.800]   So I got some key battlefield promotes, but I was young enough that I didn't have a ton
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.160]   invested in like vested, unvested stock or just like my net worth wasn't that much.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.060]   So I actually had, I came into a lot of cash in those like three, four years after.
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.840]   So markets were still low and I hadn't lost a ton going into it.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.320]   And then it was just a phenomenal learning experience.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.000]   I mean, it was trial by fire, but you know, we were investing in hedge funds.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.800]   So I was a fund of funds analyst.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.540]   I managed a team of research analysts and I just got a front row seat of, you know,
[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.160]   you pick the biggest hedge funds that were having issues in 2008, which basically everyone.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.880]   And I was front row seat.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.880]   We were huge.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.360]   We had hundreds of millions of dollars with some of these funds.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.120]   I was talking to portfolio managers, talking to the risk managers, I was in their offices.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.740]   And so as someone who just very intellectually curious about markets, it was crazy.
[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.080]   What year did you graduate Yale and what was your career progression like after graduating?
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.400]   So I graduated Yale in 2001.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.680]   I was a, what I say, a very bad CS major, computer science.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.440]   So I got a bunch of C's.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.240]   I think my average, my GPA when I graduated was a B, B minus, which was a fall from grace
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.320]   for someone who was a valedictorian in high school.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.860]   But when you go to Yale, everyone there, literally everyone is a valedictorian from their high
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.860]   school.
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.280]   So I then didn't even think I would do banking or finance.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.940]   I thought I was going to go work as a software engineer.
[00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.340]   Keep in mind, this is before Google, like the hot companies who are Microsoft, I guess
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.420]   Microsoft's hot again, and Sun Microsystems and Oracle.
[00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.660]   I couldn't get a job at any of those companies because I wasn't a good enough software engineer.
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.140]   And so the banks came in and they were there like, they recruited everyone.
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.900]   I mean, this was before dot-com crash or dot-com was in the process of crashing, but no one
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.300]   knew it yet.
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.380]   And they just, they didn't care if you were an English major, history major, philosophy
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.380]   major, comp sci major.
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.260]   They just like, if you can learn this job, if you have half a brain, we'll take you.
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.620]   And then I kind of started to learn about investment banking.
[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.460]   I did investment banking for two years at a place called Broadview, which is now Jeffreys,
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.620]   I believe, part of their Jeffreys tech group, M&A.
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.500]   And then I was like, I hate this.
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.380]   I hate the hundred hour work weeks.
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.780]   I hate the lack of predictability of my schedule.
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.440]   It's killing my health.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.140]   And so I got a job in this kind of very niche market at the time, which was fund of hedge
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.140]   funds.
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.140]   And that was in 2003.
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.140]   And I did that.
[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.420]   I did fund of hedge funds for 12 years.
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.420]   Got it.
[00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:46.540]   Now, being a fund of fund managers, that sounds pretty attractive to me because it's like,
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.660]   okay, you just have to interview the right people who've got the good track record and
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.180]   get into those funds and hope they continuously do well, right?
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.980]   It's not like you're not picking stocks, you're picking the people.
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.040]   So if they do well, you do great.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.540]   And if they don't do well, I guess you don't do as great.
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.420]   I mean, what is the skill set involved there in being a fund of fund manager?
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:14.140]   Honestly, I mean, I'm sure some of my ex-colleagues are listening to this.
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.420]   I don't think it requires much skill.
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.000]   I think it's really a business development job.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   It's a sales job.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.080]   It's like, can you craft a narrative around why someone should invest with you?
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.580]   Can you craft a narrative around why you pick these funds?
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.940]   Obviously, you need to avoid the Bernie Madoffs and the frauds.
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:36.320]   Like, you invest in a fraud, you're hosed.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.640]   There's a lot of performance chasing, right?
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.680]   But just like stocks, past performance is not indicative of future returns.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.860]   And it's even worse at the hedge fund industry where the hedge funds grow so quickly.
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.200]   So they do really well when they have 500 million in assets under management.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.360]   And then everyone, they get on their radar and then everyone, all the big institutions
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.360]   give them money.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.800]   And they droop one size and then their performance drops by 50%.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.200]   So I'll give a funny story, Sam.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.520]   When I entered the industry in 2003, so I was 23 years old, I'm like, "This is kind
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.520]   of a BS industry."
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.020]   I'm like, "I don't think this is going to be around in 10 years."
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.060]   And so that's why I, like you, I kind of was always thinking, I'm like, "Where do I fit
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.160]   in the bigger picture of this?"
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.880]   I mean, the industry is still around.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.160]   My ex-colleagues are still getting paid pretty well from what I hear.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:32.000]   But the go-go days of the fund-to-funds industry was that like 2003 to the financial crisis
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   period.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Interesting.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.620]   I mean, so coming from BlackRock at the time, that was a big name, right?
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.280]   So could you say, "I'm coming from BlackRock, so I got a lot of money and a lot of money
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.280]   behind.
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.160]   Therefore, you want to take my money, Stephen A. Cohen or whatever superstar fund manager
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.160]   there is?"
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.160]   I mean, you're spot on.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.160]   Yeah.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.160]   Okay.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.360]   So in a way, half the battle of being a good salesperson, for example, is to have a good
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.360]   product.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.360]   Right?
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.840]   Because it almost can sell itself sometimes, right?
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:59.840]   Yeah.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.120]   I think that was a big part of it.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.200]   I think in the earlier days, the returns mattered more and the hedge fund industry was more like
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.780]   the wild west.
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.440]   So you actually had to be really careful about frauds and blow-ups and things like that,
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.760]   like kind of in the long-term capital management days.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.840]   So I think in the early days, you actually were adding a lot of value because it was
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.280]   the wild west.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.520]   I think probably after the financial crisis, the hedge fund industry really institutionalized
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.680]   by leading into it and then after.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:34.580]   I mean, now you have publicly traded hedge fund, Goldman Sachs equity research rights
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:39.720]   coverage reports on Oxif and Oak Tree and so on.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.320]   So it's just the industry matured.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:49.440]   And so I think we were a very scrappy middleman in the early days of the industry when there
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.400]   was still a lot of alpha in the market.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.960]   Both the hedge funds had a lot of alpha.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.840]   So we investing in them had a lot of alpha.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:01.160]   But as the market institutionalized, so much more money came in and just squeezed all of
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:07.120]   the juice out of the industry, which included fees, especially for middlemen like fund-to-fund.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.420]   Got it, got it.
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:14.280]   And so as you're ascending the ranks, corporate ranks, what is the path, the promotion path
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.280]   at BlackRock?
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.480]   What do you start off at and then where do you end up?
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:24.840]   So when I left, I was at a small fund-to-funds from age, let's see, 2003, so from age 23
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.420]   to 27.
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:31.120]   And so I just did everything, but they didn't really have titles because it was a four-person
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.640]   shop.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.880]   When I left that fund-to-funds in 2007, I parlayed that into a VP role.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:44.920]   So in 2007, when I was six years out of college, I was a VP.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.720]   So then I joined BlackRock.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.920]   This is where it gets crazy.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.140]   I think one year after, this is where luck plays a role in the story.
[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:59.300]   One year after I became a VP, so '28, BlackRock bought a fund-to-funds, a private fund-to-funds
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.720]   and merged them inside of BlackRock.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.740]   And they did this crazy, where they had different title systems, so they kind of re-equalized
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.000]   all the titles.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.720]   So I got a bump to director in that equalization, luck, all luck, in one year.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.720]   Okay.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.720]   Usually it takes like three years or something?
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.720]   It probably takes three or four years.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.720]   Okay.
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.580]   Three years probably, if you're good.
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:25.160]   So I got a one-year bump and already I was a young VP because I had parlayed that first
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.560]   switch from the small firm to the big firm.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.840]   They kind of seduced me.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.840]   That was the carrot.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.160]   They're like, "Hey, we'll make you a VP."
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.160]   I'm like, "Sweet.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.160]   27-year-old VP.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.160]   Amazing."
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.580]   Usually you're probably like 28, 29.
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:42.720]   Then I got the bump to director at 28 and then the financial crisis happened.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:48.360]   So like I said, the best part of my career, that 2008, 2009, 2010 period.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.680]   And at 31, I was a managing director in big part because of what they call battlefield
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:59.360]   promotes is they actually gutted a much more expensive layer above me.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.240]   And they're like, "Hey, can you step up?"
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.080]   And I was like, I ran right into it.
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.720]   I'm like, "I can do this."
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.680]   And again, better to be lucky than to be smart.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:14.440]   I think the year after I became MD at 31, they made a firm-wide cap, I believe, at 35
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.440]   years old.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.440]   Wow.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.440]   So double luck.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.440]   I had a lot of luck in my career.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.000]   Well, I mean, obviously you were doing a good job too, but yeah, wow.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.800]   Because I was amazed by the rise.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:30.600]   And so it sounds like luck, but also strategically looking at opportunities and taking that opportunity
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.000]   and executing and taking on those new challenges is important.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   But I'll add one thing.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.040]   I never took my ass off.
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:43.040]   I'll give you a few examples.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.640]   In that time period, I barely watched any TV.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.160]   I didn't watch any movies.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.880]   And I love reading fiction and I didn't read any fiction, but I probably read one book
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:56.440]   a week and they were like finance textbooks, like option theory.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:02.200]   So I read more finance books in that 12-year career than many people will read in their
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.400]   entire finance careers.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.780]   I would read research papers, things like that.
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:11.160]   And we could talk probably in some other conversation, I was a prolific networker.
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:16.200]   I would do five to seven networking meetings a week for 15 years.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.200]   Wow.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:22.040]   And so as your income grew, so you had the title, your income grew, at what age and at
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.520]   what point were you starting to think, "Well, this is no longer worth it," because you were
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.520]   still quite young.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.440]   Well, I grew up as a childhood immigrant, so my parents didn't really have a lot of
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.440]   money.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.000]   So having money, period.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.080]   I remember when I got my first investment banking signing bonus, it was $7,500.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:47.160]   I'd never seen that amount of money in one check and I was 21 years old and that's still
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.160]   a lot of money.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.160]   But back then, it wasn't.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.120]   In 2001, it was an insane amount of money.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:57.640]   You know, I didn't – I never was – look, I lived in New York.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:03.040]   So when you live in New York, you are a big spender in that you go out to dinner, dinners
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.840]   are expensive, rents are expensive, things like that.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:13.640]   But I would say that I probably lived off of my salary and I would invest 100% of my
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.880]   bonus.
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.240]   And so I don't remember.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:23.280]   I think at the peak, my salary might have been like 350, maybe like towards the end
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.960]   of my MD days.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:33.120]   And then in those 20s, late 20s years, they were probably like 250, 200, 175.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.440]   But I was getting 100%, 200% bonuses at the time.
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.260]   So I would just invest everything.
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.120]   And here is something you would appreciate, Sam.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:47.000]   I made my first investment in S&P 500 when I was 17 years old, a Vanguard account.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.840]   I have been long the S&P 500 with 80% to 100% of my net worth since I was 16 years old.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:57.720]   I am 45 this summer and I have never sold a share once.
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.720]   So a lot of my wealth is just compounding.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.960]   Oh, nice.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.880]   And so when was that inflection moment where you are like, I want to get out of here?
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.680]   Because I think most people listening are thinking, well, you are a young MD, you are
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.920]   making a lot of money.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.560]   Why not just continue the gravy train?
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.960]   I – honestly, it was less – I mean, we could talk about that.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.480]   I am very transparent about the numbers.
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:27.100]   But I think that there was a point probably like two years after I became a managing director.
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.380]   So I was 33.
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:32.720]   I think at that point, I had had two seven-figure paychecks.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.820]   Like I think 1.3 and 2.3.
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:40.560]   Like I think those were my – I had three seven-figure paychecks in my life basically.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:45.760]   So I had had one or two of those paychecks and then I was 33.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.720]   And I looked at the guys who were 50.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:55.000]   And they probably had had $10 million paychecks or seven or whatever.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.680]   And they had incredible lives.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.440]   Like they had houses in Sun Valley.
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.400]   They drove Porsches.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.400]   Their kids went to these like crazy summer camps.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.800]   Like everywhere – every time they vacation, they blew it out.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.840]   And I was just like – I looked at that and I was like, that's cool.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.300]   I don't want that.
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.920]   And it's not that I'm above it, but I just – my interests were very different.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.600]   So what were my interests?
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.600]   I love surfing.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.480]   I love being outdoors.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.640]   I didn't have kids at the time, but I knew – I watched like they'd never saw their
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.640]   kids.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.640]   And so I was like, I want to see my kids.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.080]   Like it was my dream to be a dad.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.520]   Like from like a teenager, I was like, I can't wait to be a dad.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.520]   I just love kids.
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.520]   Oh, that's good.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.580]   I was the oldest of like 14 cousins.
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:47.120]   So in some regards, I was like this like young uncle to like many of my little cousins.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.520]   I just love being around kids and I always wanted to have a family.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:55.640]   And so I'm just looking at these folks and I'm like, yeah, that could be me.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:01.800]   I was like, but – I mean, I have an Acura, a 2018 Acura RDX.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.960]   But like I was like, I don't want like a $100,000 car.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.400]   I don't want a $10,000 watch.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.160]   You know, the most expensive thing that I own is like all my computer equipment, which
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.960]   is basically to make my work more productive.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.360]   You know, my surfboards are a thousand.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.780]   I was like, there's nothing that I want, like I want to take nice trips.
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.880]   And I was like, I want time freedom.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.400]   I want to own my time.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:30.960]   And so then it became a calculus of like, how much money do I need to feel comfortable
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.480]   owning my time?
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.120]   And it's funny, you introduced me as retired.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.380]   I work 35 hours a week.
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.280]   To my finance friends, I'm retired.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:45.080]   To 98% of America, I have like a normal existence, like corporate, like I have a normal professional
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.080]   existence.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:50.600]   So I was like, the math started to be like, okay, when do I cash in these time freedom
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.600]   chips?
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:56.120]   And what was, did you have a net worth target before you left your day job?
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.120]   I didn't.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.120]   I mean.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.960]   Just kind of more on a feel?
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:04.200]   There's definitely a number where I felt, so I'm not a fire person.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.600]   Like I didn't, I don't want to, because I like working.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:14.160]   So like it was never about, I don't even know what is like the SWR, 4% rule?
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.160]   Safe withdrawal rate.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.160]   I never cared.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.300]   I don't even really fully understand that stuff.
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.160]   So like I never cared about that.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:28.440]   For me, it was more like, how can I basically earn less money and still live a lifestyle
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.440]   that we want to live?
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.720]   And so that's kind of like what the number was.
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.880]   I guess in my mind, it was, there never really was a number.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.640]   I left and I had 4.3.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:45.160]   And so I've kind of like, it was probably like around 3 million, if I think, where I
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.160]   would feel comfortable.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.960]   Our spending was about 200 grand a year.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.760]   So like kind of thinking of it that way.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:53.760]   And that's the thing.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:59.360]   Like the problem with the SWR is that like it's, it works well when you're 60, but when
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:03.160]   you're 30, there's a lot of like path dependency.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.600]   And like, I forget what shortfall risk or there's a lot of crash risk.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.600]   So I didn't, I didn't, I never, it was interesting.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.600]   Right.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:10.600]   Got it.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:11.600]   So there's a lot of shortfall risk.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.600]   Okay.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.640]   So you left with a net worth of about 4.3 million, is that what you said?
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.640]   Yep.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.640]   Got it.
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.640]   And, and how is that net worth structured?
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.440]   Did you say most of it is in the S&P 500?
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.880]   I mean, when I left, I probably had about a million in cash.
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.880]   Oh, okay.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:27.880]   Wow.
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:32.480]   So, and then the rest was in, cause I didn't know what, I didn't know how I was going to
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.480]   like make money.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.440]   And that was before, I run margin now, so that was before I was living, I live off of
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.440]   margin as well.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.440]   Wait, what does that mean?
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.440]   Living off of margin?
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:46.800]   Oh, I basically borrow, I fund part of my lifestyle by borrowing money against my portfolio.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.840]   Ah, so instead of selling, right, right, right.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:55.960]   Instead of liquidating or living off the dividends, it's, you borrow.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:56.960]   Yeah.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:57.960]   Okay.
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:58.960]   And what, what is that margin rate?
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.440]   Right now it's like six and a half percent, but for many, many years it was like two.
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.440]   Right.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.440]   Ah, interesting.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.440]   It's tied to SOFR.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.440]   Right, right, right, right, right.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.640]   And SOFR stands for what again?
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.840]   I don't even know.
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:10.840]   It's the old LIBOR.
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:11.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:12.840]   It's the something, something, something.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:13.840]   I'm with LIBOR guys.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:14.840]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:15.840]   London Interbank.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:16.840]   Yeah, right.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:17.840]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:22.080]   So, yeah, I actually have no idea what's, I said LIBOR on TikTok the other day and all
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.520]   these kids were like, "Do you mean SOFR?"
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.960]   I was like, "Oh yeah, I guess they do mean SOFR."
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.960]   Oh, that's fascinating.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:33.520]   So, yeah, I've, but at the same time, so once you left, you decided to build your newsletter.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.760]   Tell us what the newsletter is and a business.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:36.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:37.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.240]   So, I really do think I'm an accidental entrepreneur.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.360]   So, when I left, I think we were spending about, our spending was about $15,000 a month
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.400]   when we left.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.640]   We're living in Dumbo, Brooklyn.
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:54.440]   And part of me leaving, it was like, I don't want to change my lifestyle meaningfully.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.840]   And that was the advantage in that I didn't like to buy fancy stuff.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.640]   But we still like to live in, we like living in very nice places.
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:08.000]   Like I love living in big cities and so always going to be high cost of living considerations.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.960]   When I left, I was like, okay, let's take 15, we spent 15K a month and we had one kid
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:18.980]   at the time, it's more now, and let's give 18 months of runway.
[00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:26.400]   So whatever 15 times 18 is to whatever 220, basically put 220K aside and basically pay
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:32.160]   myself a $15,000 monthly salary and figure it out.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.360]   It was basically what I call a figure it out fund.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:40.480]   And my wife was cool if that 240 or 220, God, my mental math is so bad now.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.040]   If it went to zero, we're cool.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.040]   She's cool.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:49.040]   We have 4.3, the 4.3 goes to four, like no harm, no foul.
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.160]   And I just start doing stuff.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.440]   And I just was doing things that I found interesting.
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:58.600]   Like most of what I found interesting was writing this small email newsletter.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.640]   It had like 36 followers when I started.
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:07.600]   And in the newsletter, basically what I was saying, I'm like, look, I'm 35 years old.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.840]   I've had this really successful career.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.660]   I'm a dad now.
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:17.640]   I don't want that life anymore, but I'm not sure what life I do want.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.760]   Basically I'm just confused.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:27.560]   It was almost like a philosophical, like life philosophy applied to myself.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.760]   And so I read a bunch of books, I interviewed people, I tried stuff and I would just write
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.120]   about it in my newsletter.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.040]   And here's the thing, Sam, is that, I mean, you've been in this business long enough.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:41.960]   There's not that many people like us that talk transparently about how much money they
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:47.440]   have, how much money they spend, what their concerns are, what their struggles are.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:52.320]   And I tend to be very transparent about, I've written a post about how my wife and I talked
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.220]   about getting divorced.
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:21:01.440]   Most 40 year old men who have been successful would not just put that out into the internet.
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.680]   But I tell you, I know enough 40 year old men that if the thought of divorcing your
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.280]   wife hasn't crossed your mind, you're not human.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.800]   That's just part of relationships.
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:17.880]   And so when you say things like that, people really gravitate towards you.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.000]   They want to hear more.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.720]   And so that was always my anchor, was just, I love writing.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.480]   I don't write nearly as much as you, but I just love writing.
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:32.200]   And so I would write, and then from the writing, just all these opportunities came up.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:37.400]   A media company asked me to be an entrepreneur in residence and they paid me a little stipend.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.280]   A few Wall Street people saw, they're like, "Oh, you're doing some cool stuff.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.740]   Can you come speak at my partner retreat?"
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:48.460]   And then, so I got a little bit of speaking gigs, a little bit of consulting gigs, cobbling
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.460]   it together.
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:54.960]   But basically every time income came in, that 18 month window extended.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:22:00.520]   And so I'm basically still living in the extension of the 18 month window, nine years later.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:05.680]   I would say that there was a big turning point, and I'll pause here, but there was a big turning
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:17.080]   point in about 2018, 19, COVID, was where I learned online marketing.
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:22.920]   And so then I started, I went through a two to three year phase when I was selling information
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.000]   products, specifically productivity courses.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.760]   And that was a pretty lucrative business.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:33.240]   I think it made over $1.6 million over a three year period.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.960]   I had a lot of expenses, so I hired a bunch of people.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.440]   So that wasn't profit.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.440]   It's revenue.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.380]   I reinvested a lot of revenue.
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:46.400]   So I went through that phase and then I was like, "I hate this online marketing stuff.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.400]   It's like having a job."
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.320]   And so I kind of stopped doing that and that brings us to the season that I'm in right
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.320]   now.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.320]   Okay.
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.320]   Well, tell us more about the season you're in.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.840]   And the newsletter, Rad Reads, yeah?
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:00.640]   I'm going to link to it in the show notes, but tell us what exactly is inspiring you
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:06.720]   and motivating you now because a lot of people who leave their day jobs of 10, 20, whatever
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:12.880]   years, they tend to retire to something and it seemed like you kind of figured it out.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.560]   So what are you working on now?
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:23.900]   So what I feel really, really lucky about is I just have an amazing portfolio of activities
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.040]   in my life.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.980]   And some of those activities make me money and I'll start with those.
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.520]   And some of them don't make me money.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:36.200]   I guess most people would call them those hobbies, but I think of them as my portfolio.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:44.080]   The thing that I love most is I love thinking about the human condition, like what are insecurities?
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.080]   What do we fear?
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.760]   What do we desire?
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.800]   Why is it easy to love some people?
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.100]   Why is it hard to love people?
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.880]   Why do we beat ourselves up?
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.360]   I think I call a spade a spade.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:59.400]   A lot of this would kind of fall in the lens of self-improvement type material.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:02.840]   I just love thinking about that mostly because I just apply it to myself.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:06.680]   I'm like, "Oh, I beat myself up a lot when I make mistakes.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.040]   Why is that the case?
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.160]   How do you change that?"
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.360]   Or I tie so much of my self-worth to my bank account.
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:19.080]   When my net worth goes down by 20%, I feel 20% worse about myself.
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.080]   Why is that the case?
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.800]   What would a therapist say about this?
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.640]   What would a Greek Stoic say about this?
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:29.000]   What would a Hindu, what would a Buddhist say about this?
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.200]   I'm just fascinated by these questions, mostly because I just want to apply them to myself.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:40.400]   My goal, and we had this conversation years ago, my goal is to be fully at peace in my
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.560]   own head.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.280]   That's what I'm pursuing.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.280]   I don't want to be envious.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.780]   I don't want to judge people.
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.280]   I don't want to have resentment.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:53.200]   I just want to be at peace and live my life that way.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.600]   I just spend a lot of my time thinking about this.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:01.520]   From that, I write, I post about it on social media.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:06.680]   I really think of this as sharing information that I found helpful with others.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:10.960]   That's a fundamental life principle that I have, is if I know something that will be
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:15.960]   helpful to you, like let's say you told me you're going to Mexico City for a getaway
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:16.960]   with your spouse.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:20.040]   I'd be like, "These are my five favorite restaurants.
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:24.800]   Walk down this street, get a drink at this bar on the roof, and make sure you check out
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:25.800]   this taco stand."
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:29.860]   If you told me you're going to Mexico City, I would feel a deep sense of responsibility
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:32.200]   to communicate those ideas to you.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.200]   Got it.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.360]   Even if you didn't use them, I feel a real responsibility.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:44.740]   My creativity is built on that sense of responsibility.
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:48.200]   Then I create things, and then I put them out in the world, and then I have these really
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:53.440]   interesting conversations on social media, on YouTube, through my email newsletter.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.440]   It's just really fun.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.360]   It's very, very satisfying.
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:03.800]   Now, I am not, because I don't play the whole fire SWR game, because I live in Manhattan
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:10.000]   Beach, California, one of the most expensive zip codes in Southern California, I need income.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.760]   I don't want to burn through my principle.
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.600]   I also want to keep optionality open.
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:18.160]   Maybe when my kids go to college, I don't know, maybe I want to buy a house in the mountains.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.160]   Right?
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.160]   I don't know.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.200]   I want to keep some options open.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:29.600]   I don't want to shut all these doors and start bleeding my principle down at age 44, 45.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:35.400]   I find ways to make money, and I found a few interesting ways to make money.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.400]   The one that has been the most rewarding is people read my work, and they literally come
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:46.760]   to me, and they say, "Can you help me live a life similar to the life that you're living?"
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:47.760]   I can't leave.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.280]   I've got the golden handcuffs.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:54.240]   I've got $10 million in the bank, but I'm so scared of losing it all.
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.880]   The biggest question people come to me, it's like, "I don't know what makes me come alive."
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.040]   I've spent 20 years on Wall Street.
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:03.760]   I kick butt on it, but I don't have hobbies.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:04.940]   I don't have passions.
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:11.120]   I don't know what I would do if I had 10 hours of free time, and I know it's ... I mean,
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:17.760]   talk about 1% problems, but those 1% problems are someone's problems.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:21.480]   I have two basically coaching programs.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:26.360]   One is for, and we're going to talk about this term, post-achievement, post-financial
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.360]   folks.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:31.080]   Post-financial, in my mind, is like you don't need to work for five years without changing
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:37.280]   your lifestyle, and post-achievement would be like you hit some echelon, some milestone
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.280]   of success.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.960]   Let's say you were a partner at a law firm, you were an MD at BlackRock.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:42.960]   You sold a company.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:48.240]   Usually, it's actually exited founders come to me, and they come to me, and then they're
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.240]   like, "Okay."
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:50.840]   It's almost like they're starting their lives over.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.360]   They're like, "I haven't paid attention to my health.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.840]   I haven't paid attention to my hobbies.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.480]   I haven't paid attention to my friends.
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:01.200]   I haven't paid attention to my spirit, my soul, nothing for 25 years.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.200]   Help me."
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.200]   Wow.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.680]   We do an intensive one-year, six-month to 12-year program.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.240]   Together, we meet up.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.400]   We talk on the phone.
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.400]   We talk on Zoom.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.000]   I give you homework.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.680]   This is like five to seven clients in a year.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.680]   Oh, wow.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.760]   It's a very high price point type work.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:24.280]   Then there's another group, and I would say they are post-achievement pre-financial.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.240]   This is kind of you when you left, me when I left.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.320]   You're kind of in your mid-30s, early 30s, and you definitely need to work.
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:34.800]   You might not even have kids at that point, but you know you want to start a family.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:39.040]   They're like, "What's the off-ramp on this career?"
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.960]   Because they kind of like me, they're 35, and they're looking at the managing directors
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:46.000]   that are 50, and they're like, "I don't want that life, but I don't know how to get from
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   point A to point B, but I don't have as much pressure to leave this month, and I need the
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.400]   income too."
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:02.800]   That is a group program called the Next Chapter Accelerator, and we run those quarterly.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.360]   Oh, gosh.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.360]   That's awesome.
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:08.120]   It sounds like a lot of work, but that sounds awesome.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:13.640]   That problem of getting off the exit ramp was my biggest problem until I figured it
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.640]   out.
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:20.840]   I figured it out by figuring out how to negotiate a severance package, just getting laid off.
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:25.520]   With the severance, you get your deferred cash, your deferred stock, a severance check,
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:29.240]   and you can collect unemployment benefits because you got laid off.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:33.680]   Maybe you can let them know about that because that was the catalyst where I was like, "Okay."
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.880]   It's hard to leave those golden handcuffs, right?
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:36.880]   Yes.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:37.880]   It's like one more year.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:41.680]   I mean, I walked away from my deferred, so I left 900k of deferred on the table.
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:46.680]   I couldn't have done that even though I was dying physically.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.960]   That could be something to think about, that severance package.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:49.960]   Yes.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:50.960]   That's a good point.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:51.960]   Yes.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:52.960]   Wow.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:53.960]   Okay.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:54.960]   You say it's a lot of work.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:30:02.280]   I don't think of it as work because 98% of my marketing is that creative process that
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.280]   I described.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.720]   I'm going to do it anyway even if I didn't get paid.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:12.840]   I think this is the difference between me and a lot of "content creators" is that I
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:17.160]   create content because I enjoy it, and then money finds me.
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.600]   Most people do it the other way around.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:24.880]   They need money, and so then they go create content so that they get more money, right?
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.080]   More clients, more sales, whatever.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.080]   I'm like the opposite.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:33.840]   I was like, "I create stuff that I love," and thankfully, from that, people will find
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:39.640]   ways to give you money, but dude, I'll tell you, I have five clients.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.200]   We meet once or twice a month for 90 minutes.
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.360]   We talk on the phone from time to time.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:48.480]   These group coaching programs, there are six 90-minute sessions once a quarter.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.040]   That's all my work for the year.
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.040]   Wow.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.040]   I mean, I create a lot.
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.760]   I write a lot, but I don't view that as work.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:56.760]   Okay.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:57.760]   I know your newsletter.
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.120]   I think it's in one of your newsletters.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:04.760]   You highlighted an article about the grind of content creators.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.000]   Was that in your – it was like –
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   Yeah, that was mine.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   Yeah, and –
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   It was a Vox article.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   Yeah, it was a Vox.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.920]   It was like fascinating because even like very successful musicians, they're saying
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:18.840]   – like Nick Montgomery, he was saying something like, "I can't go in the woods and write
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:20.760]   my music or write a book or whatever.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.920]   I have to always post another TikTok the very next day."
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:24.920]   Yeah.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.240]   So, how much – because you have a YouTube channel now.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:31.920]   How much of that pressure or how do you think about that in terms of marketing?
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:35.360]   You just said, yeah, you do it because you enjoy it, but there has to be some of that
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.600]   pressure, right?
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:41.640]   Honestly, so I've written – I mean, I would flip the question back to you in some
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.640]   regards.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:46.520]   You've written three blog posts a week since 2009, right?
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:50.880]   Do you feel a lot of pressure to do that?
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.080]   I feel like writing to me is like breathing.
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:57.880]   If you can breathe forever or speaking, you can write forever.
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:01.840]   But I definitely have felt after the 10-year mark, because I made a commitment to write
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.920]   three posts a week for 10 years if I was going to start Financial Samurai.
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.920]   So, I did that in July 2009.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.640]   I made – I achieved that goal in July 2019.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:14.080]   So, afterwards, I was like, "Oh, I can do whatever I want because I achieved my goal."
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:20.400]   But I feel – I do sometimes feel the pressure to continue because I've done it for so long.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.280]   I feel that pressure too.
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.760]   I like streaks.
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:32.880]   And so – and I'm very – I can be hard on myself to keep things going.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.640]   One of my filters is like, "Is it fun?"
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:38.680]   And if things stop being fun, I just stop doing them.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:44.920]   And I'll be honest, like writing my weekly newsletter, the blog part of it is starting
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.960]   to feel a little bit tedious.
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.480]   And so, I'm actually thinking of like I might stop.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.960]   That being said, I make one or two TikToks a day.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.280]   I cap it at 10 minutes.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:01.480]   And I basically just answer 18 to 25-year-old's questions about working on Wall Street.
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:08.720]   No editing, nothing, you know, mediocre sound, whatever, no like content calendar.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.920]   I just make two of those a day.
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.840]   I love it right now.
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:15.720]   And so, it's actually getting a lot of traction.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:22.000]   My podcast and my YouTube channel, I have a rule like I interview a lot of authors,
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.720]   but I don't force myself to read their book before.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:32.640]   So, I basically have a no prep podcast where I just get on and I just talk with the person
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.160]   like we were having coffee.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:38.560]   Now, does that – I don't get 10 million views because of that format.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.060]   But I get, you know, 1,000 views.
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:46.560]   And that's the thing is like if you look at my two, my lowest priced product is 7,500
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.680]   and my highest priced product is 40,000.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.680]   Oh, wow.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:53.360]   So, I don't need many clients.
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.360]   Yeah.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.360]   Wow.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:59.720]   But if a few people resonate with my podcast and my podcast, even though the numbers objectively
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:05.440]   are pretty bad, you know, they barely crack 1,000 downloads, every single client I've
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:13.320]   had this year and we're on track for a 450,000-year revenue has been like I listen to your podcast
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.320]   regularly.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.320]   Got it.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:19.120]   And when you say we, who are the we?
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.120]   I have a chief of staff.
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.120]   Got it.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:24.600]   Who is a full-time employee who I give benefits and healthcare to.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:28.120]   And then she manages a team of four contractors.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.600]   I don't talk to any contractors.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.800]   I just talk to her.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:35.160]   And what do the contractors do?
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:38.040]   You know, like really simple stuff.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:44.640]   So we'll record a podcast and then one of the contractors will go listen to the podcast
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:48.520]   and find, and with the help of AI, this is actually going down, but they'll find the
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.480]   five best clips.
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:55.600]   And there's like a very specific rule, like the first sentence has to grab you, the whole
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:02.040]   point has to be communicated in under 20 seconds, there should be predominantly the guest speaking
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:06.680]   and not K, so there's like a bunch of rules and then they find those, so that's their
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.240]   only job is to just find the clips.
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:14.560]   And then they pass it over to an editor and then the editor has like a style guide and
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.240]   they're like, they edit it a certain way.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:21.280]   Just like make sure that you have like two B-rolls, captions look like this and they
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:25.960]   hand it off to a social media manager that's like, make sure we drop these clips on every
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:26.960]   platform.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.440]   So I don't touch any of the social media stuff.
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.640]   I just do Twitter because it's fun.
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:36.240]   I like being on Twitter, although that's another one that the fun factor has plummeted in the
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:37.240]   past couple of years.
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:42.520]   So I'm thinking of like, just not, I'm not naturally pulled to it anymore.
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.120]   So that will probably phase out over time.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:49.200]   And I'm feeling very pulled to TikTok because I'm actually having some incredible conversations
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:54.000]   with young people there who are not, by the way, my clients, the people who are asking,
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.040]   you know, how do I get an investment banking job or not?
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:59.240]   The people that are going to drop $40,000 on a coaching package.
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.240]   Got it.
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:02.240]   But I just love it.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.240]   Right.
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.240]   And their bosses.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.200]   I've actually seen this very strange thing where these young folks ask me and then they're
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.800]   like, well, what did you do?
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:13.480]   They go look at my story and then they share it with like their dads or their bosses.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:17.160]   They're like, I found this guy, like, look at like, he retired at this age.
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:21.760]   And I'm like, yeah, no, that's fascinating.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:27.000]   You know, it's interesting, the creator economy is so big and I'm curious to know, because
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.880]   you went obviously to one of the top universities, you're valedictorian, then you made a lot
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.760]   of money, you left and now you're a father.
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:40.520]   How do you see the arc of your children going in terms of their careers and the competition
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.840]   to get into schools and all that stuff?
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:45.200]   Do you have really high demands for them?
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:48.200]   Like, what do you fear for them and what do you hope for them?
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.580]   It's a phenomenal question.
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:52.720]   My daughter just turned 10 and my youngest is seven.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:57.320]   If I'm brutally honest, like, I feel good about their prospects just because we're going
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:01.480]   to, like, they're going to have access to money, some of our money.
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:03.680]   Like, I'm not going to spend all the money that we have.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:06.880]   I'm not going to give them a big inheritance, but, you know, like, they're going to graduate
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.880]   college debt-free.
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:12.700]   If they want to go to grad school, they're going to graduate grad school debt-free, right?
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:16.280]   So I mean, right there, that is a huge, huge freaking advantage.
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:20.740]   You know, my youngest daughter is struggling with math and she has a tutor, right?
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:29.780]   So, you know, we're going to spend our money on education, which is good, which is great.
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:34.300]   I don't have a strong view, like, I don't want my kids to take my path.
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:39.260]   My path was, I mean, I told you, right, I only read textbooks and finance books up until
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:40.260]   age 35, right?
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:47.120]   Like, I just, that's a way to live and look, I'm reaping the dividends now, surfing every
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:51.280]   day and, you know, financial independence, quasi-financial independence.
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:57.120]   I don't, that's not a happy path for a lot of people, right?
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.880]   And again, it worked for me.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.640]   It is a very happy path for me.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:05.480]   I mean, I don't want to say very, but it was definitely a good path for me.
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:10.300]   I basically learned, it's like the things that work for me just aren't going to, some
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:14.100]   of them will work for others, but you know, what I would say, Sam, is like, there's just
[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:19.380]   been a lot of like internal suffering in my own head for many, many years.
[00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:24.180]   Like I just have never been at peace, either I've always beat myself up or I was always
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:28.300]   envious of other people or I didn't like the way I looked or I was scared of being alone
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:32.940]   or I feared people would die, you know, like, just like the human condition, right?
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:39.400]   I think I felt that, I felt that really hard and you know, that has impacted my marriage
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:45.000]   and like, I'm a very emotionally closed, for as vulnerable as I am in my public platforms,
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.280]   my wife's biggest complaint about me is I'm emotionally sealed off from her.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:55.340]   So it's just, I just want people to see that like, yeah, there's all these successful things
[00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:59.680]   that I did, but there were a lot of trade-offs on the other side of it that I want to be
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:05.680]   like, I've been an act, I've grinded my teeth, like the enamels off my teeth since I've been
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:10.300]   a tooth grinder, like at night, since I was eight.
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:16.660]   It took me eight years after leaving finance for my teeth grinding to stop, eight years.
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:20.600]   So that's how much the stress like lives in your body, right?
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:25.440]   And I'm going through therapy and going through some things that happen, like, I won't bore
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:29.060]   you with the details, but like, I never felt safe as a child, even though my parents were
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:33.480]   lower middle class, is because on my route to school, kids would get jumped.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:34.480]   And I got jumped.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:35.480]   Wow.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:41.000]   So like, I lived in a perpetual fear of like, I'm going to get jumped on my walk to or from
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   school.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.760]   And I did get jumped three times in 18 years.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:47.080]   And so that's, that messed me up.
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:53.160]   Like, if you're walking in a fight, a highly elevated fight or flight reflex mode for your
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:58.200]   entire childhood, and my parents, they're like, sorry, there's nothing, we don't have
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.200]   any money.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.200]   There's nothing we can do.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.360]   Like, this is just reality.
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.600]   So I'm not blaming them at all.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:08.360]   But if you like that stuff sticks with you.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:11.080]   No, absolutely.
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:15.640]   And so I guess in a way, would you say that as a father, you can provide and shelter your
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.040]   children from these, this type of trauma.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:22.680]   So in it of itself is a great win, a great satisfaction.
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:28.200]   And honestly, so the other day, one of my proudest dad moments, not proudest, but a
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:33.480]   proud dad moment, my 10 year old, she had saved her money, she'd bought this like nice,
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:38.560]   it was like this Hello Kitty lotion, like she loved she wanted the lotion, but she also
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:46.000]   wanted the she also wanted the can the container said Hello Kitty on it.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.400]   And she just saved up her money, and then she dropped it and the whole thing.
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:57.880]   And she was this size, she's also starting to get some of the hormonal kind of emotional
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:58.880]   volatility.
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:04.200]   She was besides herself, wailing, pounding the floor.
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:10.320]   And you know, I think an older, less mature version of me would have been like, suck it
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.320]   up.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:14.320]   You know, it's only like an $8 thing or or I could have just been like, I'll buy you
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.320]   a new one tomorrow.
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.320]   Stop crying.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.320]   Right?
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:22.120]   And I was like, No, like she needs to feel like, how can I support her to feel what she's
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:27.400]   feeling now, which is like sadness, frustration, anger, while still knowing that I'm there
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.120]   for her to support her.
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:33.000]   And so I was just I just literally sat with her and held her and didn't say anything for
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   like 10 minutes.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.080]   That's wonderful.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:38.480]   I didn't say like, I'll make this go away or anything.
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:44.160]   I'm just like, I just told her I'm here for you without using words.
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:48.080]   And then when she calmed down, I'm like, Hey, you know, when dad gets real upset by things,
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:52.800]   I do this thing called a box breath, which is like you hold it's like a way to like regulate
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.600]   your nervous system by just changing your breathing.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:56.600]   Right?
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.600]   I'm like, Would you be?
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.040]   Would you be okay to do like a few blocks box press with me?
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:02.400]   She's like, Yeah, sure, I will.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.400]   And she did it.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.960]   And she you could see her just call.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:05.960]   That's great.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.280]   That's wonderful.
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.280]   And then I just gave her a kiss.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:09.280]   It was at nighttime.
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.280]   I gave her a kiss.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.280]   I'm like, Good night.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:12.280]   I love you.
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.440]   And I was like, Hey, thanks for showing me that breathing technique.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:19.200]   And I was like, I was like, Honestly, sweetheart, I only learned about this five years ago.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:26.120]   If I had learned this at your age, my like, I would have had such a helpful tool in situations
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:27.120]   like this.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:28.120]   Yeah.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.120]   And then just left it.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:33.600]   So like, that's what I want for my kids.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:36.640]   Like I want them to know that they are taken care of and safe.
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:40.840]   But I don't want to remove the, I didn't like, I didn't want to be like, I'll go buy a new
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:41.840]   one tomorrow.
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:46.120]   Like, I wanted, she needed to experience that loss in that moment.
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:47.120]   Yeah.
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:48.120]   Right.
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:49.120]   But I wanted to know that she was there.
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:50.400]   And then I want to like, give her tools.
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:54.560]   You know, I'm a very avid meditator, I meditate 40 minutes a day for a decade.
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:55.560]   Oh, wow.
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:59.720]   Like, I want to give her these tools to find peace inside of her.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:03.320]   And then I think she'll be, then she's got the foundation.
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.320]   Right.
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.320]   If she wants to go to Yale, great.
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:09.280]   If she wants to, I could see my daughter, my daughter already knows how to edit videos
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:15.360]   and use like Photoshop when she's 10, just from watching me do it.
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:19.320]   And I could see my daughter just like being a social media manager when she's like 15
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.840]   years old, making like 75K a year.
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:23.240]   And like not going to college.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.240]   Interesting.
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.240]   She likes that stuff.
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:29.720]   Well, let me ask you this, because, you know, you talked about getting jumped.
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:30.880]   Where were you getting jumped by the way?
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:31.880]   What city was this?
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.320]   New York City.
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:36.080]   So I grew up in Stuyvesantown in the 90s.
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.080]   Okay.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:42.440]   So in New York City, if you were a boy in the 90s, it didn't matter where, like you
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:44.240]   probably got jumped.
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:45.240]   Wow.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.240]   Like at least once.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:47.240]   Wow.
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:56.000]   And so these very interesting, tough experiences, I think helped probably drive you to succeed
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.480]   in school and make money so you had more options, correct?
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:00.920]   They did.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:01.920]   And absolutely.
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:05.960]   Like, I remember getting jumped, I'm like, I'm getting the heck out of here.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.400]   I will never put myself in this situation again.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.400]   I would never put my family.
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.400]   And I did.
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:12.400]   Right.
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:14.680]   I live in one of the safest parts of LA.
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:15.680]   But there's also a trade-off.
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.160]   Sure.
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:20.920]   And the trade-off is like my wife turning to me, she's like, "Why are you emotionally
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:21.920]   sealed off?
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:22.920]   Why am I emotionally sealed off?
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:23.920]   I'm learning."
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:29.160]   Because when I would be scared and I would go to my parents and be like, "I'm scared
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.160]   to walk to school."
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.960]   They'd be like, "Get over it."
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:38.720]   And I'd be like, "What can I do to make this feeling go away?"
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.960]   And then when I got older, it was alcohol.
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:46.240]   I was borderline alcoholic because a lot of – anytime I felt stressed, I would just
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:47.240]   drink.
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:51.280]   I was a very high-functioning alcoholic as you could tell by the results.
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:57.080]   But I coped hard with alcohol because anytime there was an uncomfortable feeling to feel,
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:00.000]   I didn't want to feel it because that little kid was like, "Shut it down.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   Shut it down.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   Shut it down."
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.960]   And that little kid can't go, you know, pounds a few stiff drinks.
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:08.280]   You know, when you're 21, you're like, "Oh, I don't want to feel this thing."
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:12.040]   Like I got a lot of things that can make this feeling go away.
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:18.000]   Is there any kind of concern though that providing a really comfortable, safe life for your children
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.200]   might make them less hungry?
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:29.160]   I used to think so, but what's hunger in service do I think that making them feel safe will
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:34.440]   make them not want to like have a roof over their head?
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.440]   No.
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:39.480]   Do I feel that not making them feel safe would make them not want to become a managing director
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:40.480]   of BlackRock?
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:41.480]   Maybe.
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:48.080]   I think that we confound hunger with high status.
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:53.720]   So right, like the hungrier you are, the more high status you can become.
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:56.580]   I don't disagree with that.
[00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:59.360]   But then the question is like, what does high status bring you?
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.360]   Right.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.360]   Right.
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:02.360]   It's like, okay.
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:03.360]   Yes.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.400]   Like will my daughter ever have the drive of Michael Jordan?
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.400]   Like no.
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.640]   But look at Michael Jordan today.
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:10.200]   The guy has demons.
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.360]   Like the guy is not at peace with himself.
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:13.360]   No?
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:14.360]   Okay.
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:18.440]   If you watch The Last Dance, he's still replaying mistakes that he made.
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:19.440]   Right.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:22.720]   Like he's not, you know, he's not at peace with himself.
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:29.480]   So I think that I don't want my kids to be entitled.
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:31.520]   I don't want my kids to be brats.
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:38.720]   I don't want my kids to not be resourceful and creative.
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:44.320]   But I don't think that they need to get jumped to have a drive to be good at school.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:52.140]   I play with that dilemma a lot, you know, because as you build more wealth, you're present,
[00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:55.760]   you know, you might basically be providing all the things that your parents might not
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:57.420]   have been able to.
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:03.680]   But because of that suffering or whatever it is, it's driven you to be who you are and
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:05.400]   to make those changes.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:06.400]   And I just wonder, right?
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:09.160]   Because we don't know exactly the future of our children.
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:11.720]   So I constantly wonder.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.840]   I used to wonder that a lot.
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:16.840]   And look, I'll be honest.
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.200]   In my case, it was very egoic.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:22.580]   I'm like, I want them to have the suffering that I had so that they can have the skills
[00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:23.580]   that I have.
[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:27.020]   Because I think of the skills that I have are very good skills.
[00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:31.480]   But now what I'm realizing is that there's a lot of tradeoffs to a lot of the skills
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:32.480]   that I have.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:36.460]   And I'm really starting to realize them in my mid 40s.
[00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:43.220]   You know, my incapacity to really like love myself, like so much of my self worth is still
[00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:45.500]   tied to like things that I achieve.
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.340]   Like, God, I don't want that for my kids.
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:52.880]   I don't want them to be in their mid 40s and still struggling to love themselves.
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:54.580]   Like that, I don't want.
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:57.900]   And if that means that they're not going to be a partner at a law firm, good, right?
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:01.060]   And even better, like they might find a way to love themselves and be a partner at a law
[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:02.060]   firm.
[00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:03.060]   Right?
[00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:04.380]   Like, I think we forget that, right?
[00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:09.620]   Because folks like you and I just saw this one path of like, you know, being second guessed
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:12.780]   and being slighted and feeling unsafe.
[00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:14.100]   And we're like, that's the path.
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:21.500]   And we're like, look, there, I would say half of my clients grew up upper, upper class.
[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:26.740]   And like, and they are exited founders and they are MDs at firms.
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:30.620]   Like, we only see our story because we're like, oh, we had to grind.
[00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:34.420]   Our parents didn't give us like, there's a lot of people who are really successful who
[00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:35.580]   grew up with wealthy parents.
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:36.580]   Yeah.
[00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:37.580]   Right.
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:41.660]   So, I think that, I don't think the wealth is, the wealth or not, obviously, once you
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:48.340]   cover Maslow's like basic needs, I don't think the wealth is the thing that is going to separate
[00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:49.340]   it.
[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:54.700]   I do think it is, I'm using the category of like emotional resilience.
[00:48:54.700 --> 00:49:04.500]   So, like, can you be at peace with, like, can you stay with uncomfortable emotions,
[00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:09.200]   like sadness, anger, grief, nostalgia without coping?
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:11.180]   That's the big thing, without coping.
[00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:17.660]   I think the type A folks that listen to this podcast, they, we struggle, I'll speak for
[00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:20.420]   myself, I struggle to sit with those feelings.
[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:22.740]   And so, I go straight to my coping mechanisms.
[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:28.780]   For a long time, that was alcohol, work, video game, all you name, anything distracting.
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:33.100]   And I think that if you can sit with those uncomfortable, think about it, like if you
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:38.000]   could sit with those uncomfortable emotions while you're a trader and the market's melting
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.720]   down against you, like you might make some great effing decisions, right?
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:47.900]   So, I don't think it's, I think that that is kind of the "toolkit" that I want to give
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:48.900]   them.
[00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:51.900]   Because then, by the way, they'll have way more clarity.
[00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:55.700]   I think a lot of people listening to this, a lot of people read my stuff, they're like,
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:56.700]   what is happiness?
[00:49:56.700 --> 00:50:03.220]   Like I've seen so many of these posts on fire, fat fire, it's like, I have 8 million, miserable,
[00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:06.380]   I have 10 million, dead inside, right?
[00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:11.660]   Really just solving that problem doesn't make you come alive, but I do think that if you
[00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:16.060]   give them the range to deal with the emotions, the good ones too, right?
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:20.940]   Managing their ego and so on, then like you're not going to have this person that's like,
[00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:22.860]   I have X million, dead inside.
[00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:24.260]   Right, right.
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:26.140]   No, so true.
[00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:27.140]   Okay.
