[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380]   So, all right, those are all of the updates.
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.480]   One other update I guess I will add is that,
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.640]   as I told Jesse today, earlier today,
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.100]   I've returned to the Tim Ferriss podcast.
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.720]   So, you know, whatever it was a month or two ago,
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.620]   I was on the show, Tim interviewed me for the show.
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.300]   This week, so actually the week before this will come out,
[00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.360]   so the week immediately preceding when this episode airs,
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.120]   there's another episode that Tim just published
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.840]   where it's me interviewing Tim.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.440]   It's an episode of me interviewing Tim in particular
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.520]   about the rise of the four-hour work week.
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.240]   What went into that?
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.840]   What that moment was like?
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.320]   What was happening right before?
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.260]   What was the event that sparked it?
[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.020]   Now, this was an interview I actually did,
[00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.880]   this would have been last year.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.400]   I was interviewing Tim for a New Yorker article
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.800]   I was writing about the four-hour work week.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.560]   And that article came out last fall.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.280]   And as we're getting closer to do that interview,
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.640]   Tim had this idea, he said, "Well, why don't we record it?
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.840]   Because maybe if it's interesting,"
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.520]   you know, he interviews everyone else
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.480]   who gets to interview him.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.120]   He doesn't go on other people's shows, right?
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.540]   So he's not interviewed that often.
[00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.440]   He's like, "Why don't we record it
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.440]   just in case it's interesting?"
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.520]   So actually this episode that was just released
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.960]   on Tim's feed is a recording of an interview
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.960]   I was doing of him for a New Yorker article I was writing.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.560]   About him and his book.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.480]   So that is the origin story.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.420]   Now, of course, once I knew that we were recording it,
[00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.440]   I did the interview more in podcast style.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.200]   So I don't wanna give those who listened to that episode
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.840]   the idea that this is what magazine interviews sound like.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.960]   It's more scripted and polished.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.240]   Real magazine interviews are way less formal.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.080]   But that's the origin of that Ferris episode.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.360]   So I thought what would be interesting, Jesse, today
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.160]   is to go back to that article that I wrote about him.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.400]   So for those of you who've listened to the interview
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.640]   on Tim's feed and are curious about the article it led to,
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.120]   I wanna revisit that article and talk about
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.120]   the three big points I extracted from talking to Tim.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.560]   So the three big points are gonna be number one,
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.480]   the unlikely circumstances under which
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.960]   the four-hour workweek broke out and became a big hit.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.360]   Number two, the subsequent dismissal of that book
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.120]   by the broader cultural conversation.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.360]   And number three, why I think it's Tim's
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.360]   most radical work to date and that we underestimate today
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.840]   the radicalness of what he was actually claiming
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.680]   in that book.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.880]   Those were three big points from the article.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.920]   I wanna go through those briefly today.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.540]   For those who are watching this on the video
[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.000]   instead of listening to it, I'm actually gonna pull up
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.200]   the article here on our new fancy pants Telestrator.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.840]   So you can actually see the parts of the article
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.480]   I'm talking about as I talk about it.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.240]   For those who are just listening, don't worry,
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.080]   you'll still get the gist of what I mean.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.640]   All right, so let's start with this first point.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.080]   Here's the article, "Revisiting the Four-Hour Workweek."
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.780]   I wanna start with this context of why it was unlikely
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.760]   the way that Tim's book broke out.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.260]   So let's talk about timing.
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.720]   So the big event that broke out Tim's book
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.680]   came in March of 2007.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.840]   It was South by Southwest.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.880]   Tim gave a talk at South by Southwest
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.200]   which blew the book into the stratosphere.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.540]   It was the spark that ignited the engine
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.040]   that blew this book into the stratosphere.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.060]   Now what I wanna argue, what I argue in this article
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.600]   is that this was actually a very unlikely crowd
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.600]   to be receptive to the message Tim had to share with them.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.880]   And a lot of this has to do with the context of that time.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.720]   So I just said that South by Southwest was in 2007.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.320]   Let's look at what else was happening in tech culture
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.120]   around this period.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.640]   So in 2004, just three years earlier,
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.600]   Google had its $23 billion IPO.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.720]   2006, that's just the year before,
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.560]   Facebook opened beyond university students
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.600]   and quickly got its first 100 million followers.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.020]   That same year, Twitter went live.
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.080]   So we have that happening at the same time.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.080]   Earlier the same year, we also had the iPhone launched.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.360]   Steve Jobs stood on that stage
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.360]   in the Mascone Convention Center in San Francisco
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.760]   and introduced iPhone.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.360]   So this was a period of huge enthusiasm
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.160]   for the tech industry.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.440]   There was a lot going on.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.760]   There was a lot of changes going on.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.160]   And the culture emerging during this period
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.560]   was definitely one of moving fast, breaking stuff,
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.640]   hustling, getting things done, not sleeping.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.800]   This was a period of we are changing the world,
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.000]   the culture is changing,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.040]   and you're gonna get there by working very hard.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.680]   I mentioned in that article how during this period,
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.040]   I was at MIT and there was a notion going around
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.000]   at MIT at that time of hardcore culture.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.560]   So it was a term that you would hear around MIT a lot
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.480]   at the time where they would say, I'm hardcore.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.800]   And that meant I'm staying up late, I'm doing triple major.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.100]   So this was the context in which Tim Ferriss took to stage
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.380]   at a tech conference.
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.240]   So everything was about working hard, staying up,
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.880]   moving fast, hustling, and by doing so, changing the world.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.880]   He stood up on a stage and basically told people, work less.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.800]   What you were doing is unsustainable.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.160]   And you can look at the actual terminology.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.160]   He talked about checking email like a rat
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.600]   with a cocaine pellet dispenser, send, receive, send, receive.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.200]   He talked about just flatly the unsustainability
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.280]   of what's happening.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.920]   Is your business scalable, he said,
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.940]   is your career scalable?
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.940]   And most important, is your lifestyle scalable?
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.840]   These are big, big claims to make to a crowd
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.440]   that was celebrating working very hard.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.360]   He was saying what you're doing is not working.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.880]   So this was incredibly counter-cultural.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.880]   You could imagine that this would lead to a backlash.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.760]   The audience would say, what are you talking about?
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.040]   We are doing what is cool.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.260]   We are doing what the culture is saying.
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.960]   We are building these companies
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.800]   that are producing billion dollar IPOs,
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.120]   but it's not what happened.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.540]   Instead, the talk was a huge hit.
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.620]   So I went back and talked to Tim about this,
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.320]   but he went in there saying,
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.960]   I don't know what's gonna happen.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.100]   If it goes good, good.
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.120]   If it doesn't, it doesn't.
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.160]   Instead, the temporary room they found the slot him in
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.680]   because he was a last minute replacement
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.380]   was overfilled capacity.
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:15.600]   Almost immediately, he began to hear from participants
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.880]   who were saying, I've changed major things
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.120]   about how I work to embrace your ideas.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.760]   A bunch of the tech bloggers, influential tech bloggers
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.160]   who were there by South by Southwest
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.040]   began interviewing Tim.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.260]   This is what really sparked the growth of his book.
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.640]   These interviews with influential tech bloggers
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.120]   spread the idea throughout Silicon Valley.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.960]   He quickly expanded to take over that market segment
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.800]   with his book.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.120]   Once he had that imprinter of Silicon Valley
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.800]   is all about this new guru,
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.760]   that is what gave it the foundation to expand
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.400]   to the culture much wider, to much wider audiences
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.480]   and made that book a perennial bestseller.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.080]   It was on the New York Times bestseller list
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.040]   more or less continually with some exceptions
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.520]   for seven years to follow after that.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.060]   So it was unlikely that speech would do well, but it did.
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.360]   So here's the, I'm gonna highlight this in the article,
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.500]   but here's the big observation about that.
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.640]   Here I stumble with my pen.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.760]   Okay.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.160]   In retrospect, an overflow crowd of tech sector enthusiast
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.180]   embracing Ferris's message was a warning shot,
[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.320]   an early indication that the mode of work emerging
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.080]   in a hyper-connected, always on,
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.620]   hustling modern office had flaws.
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.440]   So it was a big deal, I think,
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.560]   that that audience received his talks so well.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.200]   What it told us is there's a problem.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.060]   There's a problem with the way we work.
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.880]   If even these people at the core of Overwork Celebration
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.680]   are embracing Ferris, there's something beginning to spread.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.120]   There is a cancer in our work culture
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.920]   that we have to be careful about.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.760]   So I think that was really telling.
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.560]   Now, the interesting thing that happened
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.980]   is the book of course did very well.
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.160]   It sold a lot of copies.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.240]   It was, I found a reference where it was featured
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.600]   on the NBC hit show, "The Office"
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.640]   where the, what's his name?
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.900]   Daryl, the Daryl Philbin character said at some point,
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.760]   "Four-hour work week."
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.640]   So he was referencing it.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.300]   So the book became very popular,
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.280]   but the underlying cultural message,
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.780]   the way we're working is not working.
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.340]   It is not sustainable.
[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.380]   This idea that we should be so locked
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.840]   into this frantic scrambling from the age of 22
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.680]   till the age of 65 doesn't work.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.960]   We could completely rethink the role work plays
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.500]   in a deeper, more fulfilling life.
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.720]   That radical part of the message was rather quickly
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.920]   stripped out of the cultural reception of Ferris's book.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.680]   And I get into this into the article,
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.200]   but I said, there's really two reasons
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.480]   why I think this happened.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:51.040]   One, Ferris was quickly reassociated with hacks,
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.520]   optimizing productivity.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.600]   And this book quickly became categorized
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.520]   in the minds of people who encountered it
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.880]   or heard about it as a book
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:02.120]   about extreme productivity hackery.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:07.380]   Now, I don't wanna imply that this is a unfair assessment
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.140]   of Ferris's work because Ferris himself,
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.120]   as he told me when I interviewed him,
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.520]   was interested in hacks.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.960]   Now, he doesn't use that terminology.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.560]   He talks about minimal viable inputs
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.080]   to get a desired output,
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.880]   but he was really interested in that.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.840]   And after the four-hour work week,
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.000]   he went on to write books like "The Four-Hour Body,"
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.720]   which was much more specifically targeting
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.080]   optimization and hacks.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.520]   You wanna get bigger arm muscles
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.320]   in a minimal amount of time,
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.520]   do this exercise, eat this food.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.600]   So he is really interested in hacks.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.400]   The intro to his podcast
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.280]   is all about optimizing performance.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.920]   So he quickly got recategorized
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.600]   as a productivity hack optimization type guy.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:51.360]   That's different than a challenging
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.940]   the very nature of work type guy.
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.480]   Rethinking what is a sustainable life
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.900]   in a world of digital knowledge work.
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.440]   That idea got pushed aside
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.760]   and he was seen as the guy doing hacks.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.700]   As I point out in the article,
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.760]   by the time Daryl Philbin on the NBC show "The Office"
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.840]   held up the four-hour work week and said four-hour work week,
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.940]   at that point, that plot in "The Office"
[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.960]   was actually Daryl trying to do more work
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.100]   so he could get a promotion to a more grueling manager job.
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.360]   So by the time we got to 2011,
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.260]   what we would say is the peak of the influence
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.540]   of the four-hour work week,
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.340]   the way it showed up on that NBC show
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.140]   was actually in direct contradiction
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.740]   to the underlying message of the book,
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.800]   which is to work less,
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.540]   to change the role of work in your life,
[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.140]   to make it smaller, more autonomous,
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:42.960]   something you control,
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.980]   something you deploy towards making your life happier.
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.660]   By the time we get to 2011,
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:50.060]   it's, oh, this book must be about how I get more done.
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.820]   The exact opposite.
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.540]   The exact opposite about what the book is about.
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.840]   I thought that was a very telling example.
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.380]   The other explanation I give
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:03.380]   for why I think we lost the main message
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.440]   is that we weren't ready for it.
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.500]   We weren't ready for it at that time.
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:15.100]   So if we think about 2007, 2008, what's going on right then,
[00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.360]   we are in that pre-Great Recession moment
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.600]   when everybody's making money,
[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:25.180]   that you buy mortgages, you buy stocks,
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.260]   whatever you're doing,
[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:27.840]   what seemed to any type of activity
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.680]   seemed to be alchemizing in the money.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.980]   Everyone had cash.
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.580]   This was this bubble period
[00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.780]   before the big recessionary crash.
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.860]   That was not a period where people were really open
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.020]   to a message of work less.
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.220]   Activity was generating money.
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.420]   Everyone was doing well.
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:44.540]   No one wanted to hear it then.
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:45.700]   And then we had the big crash.
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:46.780]   Well, after you have a huge crash
[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:49.180]   and everyone's scrambling just to find a job,
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.060]   just to make employment,
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.020]   they also did not wanna be rethinking works.
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.940]   That timing was such that our culture wasn't ready for it.
[00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:59.940]   So Ferris got recategorized as the hack optimization guy.
[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:03.260]   His underlying subversive message
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.100]   about rethinking the role of work got ignored.
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.460]   So that brings me to why I wrote the article
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.300]   for "The New Yorker,"
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.800]   which is I had just spent months
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.900]   writing this column for the magazine
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.140]   that was all about the impacts of the pandemic
[00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.340]   on the world of work and how we think about work.
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.820]   And I was categorizing the various ways
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.500]   that people were rethinking the role of work in their lives
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.940]   and trying to make it something
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.500]   that supported a life well-lived, a deep life,
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.220]   not just something you do for the sake of doing it.
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:33.500]   In that context, you would assume
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.460]   that Ferris's book would be a major text.
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.100]   It sold millions of copies.
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.380]   It gets at exactly that point,
[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.020]   but it was never brought up in the discussions
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.180]   that I was involved in.
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.820]   And I think that is why.
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:49.220]   'Cause by the time we get to 2021, 2022,
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:53.420]   Ferris's subversive message had been largely eliminated
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.900]   from the cultural understanding of his book.
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.180]   So I wanna bring it back now and just make this point,
[00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.780]   give credit where credit is due.
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.980]   The underlying point that Ferris had
[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:06.100]   that using new technologies, the internet, automation,
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:10.220]   et cetera, that you can find a way to make a good living
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.180]   with work that happens on your terms
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.140]   and well south of a typical 40-hour work week,
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:20.860]   that you do not have to work for 40 years and then retire.
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.300]   You can actually go back and forth
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.780]   between adventures and retirement
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.460]   and then make it enough money to survive.
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.780]   This type of subversive counter-cultural message is radical.
[00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.860]   And he was making a radical point.
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.260]   It got forgotten, but I wanna bring it back.
[00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.700]   He was, of that generation,
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.700]   probably the first at this argument
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.380]   that a lot of people are making now,
[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.860]   that maybe the role of work in our lives
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:45.020]   can be something different than it actually is.
[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.260]   So that article in some sense was a hat tip to Tim
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.100]   because I thought he was being unfairly ignored.
[00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:54.220]   He actually was way ahead of the game on a problem
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:58.580]   that everyone now seems like now agrees exist.
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:03.260]   I mean, did you read it, Jesse, four-hour work week?
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.500]   Was this something you came across at the time?
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.140]   Or is this something that,
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.900]   do you know Tim through that book
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.140]   or do you know Tim through the podcast
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.340]   or a more recent incarnation?
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.480]   I'm always curious now that I've read this article
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.320]   how various people encounter him.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.860]   - I knew about him before the podcast.
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.460]   I think I read some of the book.
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.760]   - You had read some of it.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:29.380]   - I read some of the book before the podcast,
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.260]   but then I started listening to his podcast
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.340]   pretty early on.
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.400]   - Yeah, right.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.900]   So I think there's a lot of people now
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.220]   who know him primarily through the podcast.
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:39.700]   - Yeah.
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:40.820]   - Yeah, because I remember,
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:41.940]   I mean, so the four-hour work week
[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.500]   was a phenomenon at the time,
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.220]   but again, I think that the pivot
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.580]   towards hacks and optimizations
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.420]   and four-hour body and four-hour chef
[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:51.500]   really, I don't know what you would call it,
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.260]   but kind of corralled his audience
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.840]   into a big stream of people,
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.100]   but put up pretty thick walls
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.060]   on either side of that audience.
[00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.740]   And it sort of insulated him
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.900]   from the more mainstream awareness.
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.740]   My memory of four-hour work week was Ramit Sethi.
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.020]   He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of Tim.
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.100]   So it's sort of a shared connection.
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.540]   I remember Ramit calling me in 2007
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.540]   and saying, "I have this friend, Tim,
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:22.020]   and he wrote this book and you have to read it."
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:22.860]   I remember that.
[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.060]   I remember getting on audio.
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:25.180]   And for some back then,
[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:27.880]   they weren't really well-synced audio books
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.300]   and print books, they weren't really well-synced.
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.940]   So I was able to get the book early
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.340]   just because it was available earlier on audio
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.140]   than it was on print.
[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.640]   And I remember listening to that
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.620]   in Harvard Square where I lived at the time.
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:44.100]   And I remember at the time, it was like a lightning bolt.
[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.300]   And a lot of people have forgotten that reaction.
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.180]   It was like a lightning bolt
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.940]   because of this subversive idea
[00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.060]   that you could craft this incredibly alternative lifestyle
[00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.420]   in which you're on the road adventuring
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:57.900]   and through aggressive use of automation and tools,
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.060]   you sort of do a little bit of work,
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.060]   but it generates enough money
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.700]   that you can live in Buenos Aires
[00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.140]   where the dollar is strong and I'll be fine.
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:06.820]   It was like an incredibly counter-cultural subversive book.
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:07.660]   I remember at the time,
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.540]   a lot of people had that same reaction.
[00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:13.580]   But again, we should be talking about it today
[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:16.100]   in all of these think piece articles
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.980]   about we work too much and we have to rethink the office
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.940]   and get remote and cut down on our number of days.
[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.820]   Like all of these articles should be thinking
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.180]   about the four-hour work week, but they don't.
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.620]   So there you go, Tim.
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.140]   Your book should be considered more.
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.100]   (upbeat music)
