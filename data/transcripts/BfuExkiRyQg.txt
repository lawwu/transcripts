[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.840]   Well, are non-Christian marriages, the marriages of two non-Christians, are these unions legit
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.840]   in God's eyes?
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.480]   It's a question today from a listener named Steve.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.720]   "Pastor John, thank you so much for your ministry," he writes.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.240]   "This podcast and a number of your books have had a large impact on my spiritual walk.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.840]   Here's my question.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.680]   A co-worker asked me if I thought God honored secular marriages.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.000]   My gut reaction was yes.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.800]   My co-worker said no.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.780]   He believes that if two parties don't believe in God, then God is not in that marriage and
[00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.400]   therefore God does not recognize the marriage.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.960]   He went further to state that God does not even hear non-Christian prayers.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.600]   I'll be honest, I didn't know how to respond or defend my opposition to his stance.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.480]   Is there biblical backing for the legitimacy of secular marriages?"
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:05.760]   This is one of those classic instances where disagreement precedes definition, or where
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.540]   conflict precedes clarification.
[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:17.080]   So it's an opportunity for me to get on my soapbox and plead with all Christians that
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:25.220]   we not engage in conflict or in debates where the terms of the conflict and the definitions
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.680]   in the debate are not clear.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:39.200]   Arguing about words or phrases that are undefined is like a watchdog barking at shadows.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.640]   It might scare away a burglar, but he also might scare away the fireman who's here to
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.480]   save your house from burning down.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:55.900]   An argument without clear definitions is like playing tennis with the net down and all the
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.260]   lines erased on the court.
[00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.700]   You can argue until doomsday, "The serve was in!
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.700]   No it wasn't!
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.700]   What good does it do to—?"
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.700]   That's just crazy.
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:14.780]   Insist—this is my plea—insist on definition and clarification before you disagree.
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.140]   For example, what does this person mean by saying, "God is not in the marriage"?
[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.480]   What in the world does "in" mean?
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.620]   What does it mean when he says, "God does not recognize" or he uses the word "honor"
[00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.620]   the marriage?
[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.060]   What does "recognize" mean?
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.060]   Honor?
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.100]   So what often happens when we insist on clear definitions is that problems begin to solve
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.100]   themselves.
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.700]   I've seen it over and over again.
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.180]   Often, the definitions themselves answer the questions you were debating.
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.460]   So I would encourage all Christians not to waste your time playing tennis without any
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.500]   lines on the court.
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.220]   So let me guess the way this person's mind might have been working who asked this question
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.020]   about the validity of marriages between unbelievers.
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:14.340]   My guess is that he starts something like this, Romans 14.23, which says, "Whatever
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.580]   is not from faith is sin."
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.100]   That's pretty radical.
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.100]   "Therefore, if faithless people marry, they are sinning.
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.240]   And since God disapproves of sin, he therefore disapproves of this marriage."
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.420]   And then the leap is made, "And therefore it's not a marriage."
[00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.420]   Well, maybe.
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.400]   I mean, you've got to get a little bit of argument in there first.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.500]   So whether that's the train of thought or there's another one that I don't know about,
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.260]   let me give several biblical reasons for why I think marriages between a man and a woman
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.940]   who make a promise of lifetime faithfulness to each other as husband and wife are in fact
[00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:59.940]   married.
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:06.860]   They have real marriages, even though they are not ideal, they're not believing, they're
[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.340]   not rooted consciously in God's purposes for marriage, and so they are disobedient and
[00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.020]   Christ-denying and fall short.
[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.020]   Those are all the languages.
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.180]   I think that's the way we should talk about these marriages, not that they're not marriages.
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:26.820]   So I don't say they're not marriage, which by the way, I do say about so-called marriages
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.940]   between two men or two women or a person and an animal.
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.940]   That's not marriage.
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.860]   It's not marriage.
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.100]   There is no such thing as a marriage between two people of the same sex.
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.820]   Whatever the world calls those relationships, they're not marriage.
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.100]   But marriages between an unbelieving man and an unbelieving woman are real marriages that
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.100]   fall short of God's highest purpose for marriage.
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.020]   Now why do I say that?
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.860]   First, going back to Romans 14, 23, which is a very radical text, it is, "Whatever
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.780]   is not from faith is sin."
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:12.380]   It does not follow that if something is sinful, it's not real and shouldn't happen.
[00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.820]   For example, in the context, the point is that eating certain things—in Romans 14,
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:25.500]   that's the context—eating certain things, even innocent things, will be sinful if they're
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.100]   not done in faith.
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:33.220]   So if an unbeliever eats God's good gift of meat or drinks God's good gift of wine
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:41.780]   or orange juice, that act not done in faith is a sinning act.
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.820]   God intended food to be eaten, drinks to be drunk, with thankfulness and faith in him.
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.380]   All other uses of his gifts are sinful.
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.980]   They are failures to live up to God's design for meat and drink.
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:03.380]   Now the question is, should we conclude that unbelievers therefore should not eat since
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.100]   their eating is sinning?
[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:11.140]   Or should we conclude that unbelievers should have faith when they eat?
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:17.380]   And the answer is, God does not require of unbelievers that they stop eating.
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.620]   He requires that they trust him and thank him when they eat.
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.980]   And if they don't, they're going to be in big trouble.
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.900]   Same thing is true of marriage.
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:35.620]   Since marrying without trusting Jesus and thanking Jesus is sinful, yes, what does God
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.940]   require?
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.580]   Does he require that unbelievers not marry?
[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:47.260]   Or does he require that unbelievers believe and trust him and thank him for the gift of
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.740]   marriage?
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:57.140]   Second, God ordained that there be human institutions, like government.
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:03.460]   He explains in Romans 13, 1 Peter 2, and he teaches that governments are real.
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.900]   They're real governments and they accomplish many of his good purposes even when the emperor
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.580]   and the governors are unbelieving.
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:17.020]   So everything these governors and emperors do is sin in their unbelief because they don't
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.740]   do it from faith.
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.260]   And yet, that doesn't stop God from recognizing the governments as real.
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:28.500]   God ordained institutions of government, accomplishing his purposes.
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.740]   In the same way, God ordained the institution of marriage.
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.740]   And it too accomplishes many of God's purposes, even when the husband and wife are unbelievers,
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:44.940]   like providing replenishment for the earth, some measure of stability against chaos, some
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:52.540]   semblance of the covenant love that God intended marriage to portray.
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.380]   Now let me underline that last point.
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:08:00.940]   The ultimate purpose of marriage, according to Genesis 224 and Ephesians 532, is to portray
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:04.780]   the covenant love between Christ and his church.
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:11.460]   This is done most clearly in an obedient, faithful Christian marriage.
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:19.940]   But it is done obscurely, even in a lifelong, promise-keeping, adultery-avoiding, unbelieving
[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:20.940]   marriage.
[00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:30.260]   So marriages accomplish some of God's purposes imperfectly, even when the spouses are unbelieving.
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:40.340]   Third, in 1 Corinthians 7.12-16, Paul addresses Christian spouses who are converted while
[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.820]   they are in an unbelieving marriage.
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:49.220]   So that one spouse is now a believer, and one is not.
[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:54.620]   And he tells them not to divorce, unless they think, "Oh, I've got to do that, because now
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.460]   this is a wrecked marriage, because one of us is an unbeliever."
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:04.440]   He does not tell them that they are now in a half-marriage or an illegitimate marriage,
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:09.500]   and he doesn't tell them that they need to have a new wedding ceremony because they were
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.600]   in a non-marriage.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.600]   They weren't.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.600]   They were in a marriage.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.740]   It was a marriage, and it is a marriage, imperfect to be sure, but still marriage.
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:28.900]   Fourth, when Jesus speaks of divorce, and he describes remarriage after divorce as adulterous,
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.820]   he still calls those marriages marriages.
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:41.780]   For example, in Luke 16.18, he says, "Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:49.300]   commits adultery, and he who marries a divorced woman commits adultery."
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:58.020]   Well, that's very strong language, and there's no escaping that Jesus uses the word "marry"
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.260]   for what ought not to happen.
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.260]   But it does happen.
[00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.720]   And when it happens, it is what it is.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:11.500]   If Jesus treats wrongfully entered marriages as real marriages, then it's not a stretch
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:15.700]   to treat the marriages of unbelievers as real marriage.
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:21.600]   Now, lots more could be said here, but let me end with this.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:29.900]   Marriage is rooted in God's design for creation at the beginning and is a valid institution
[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.220]   for all his human creatures.
[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:38.580]   Where there is a covenant made between a man and a woman for a lifetime of faithfulness
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:42.220]   as husband and wife, we have a marriage.
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:51.340]   It will become God-honoring, Christ-exalting, truth-based when the couple believes.
[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:59.620]   What we say to an unbelieving couple is not, "Don't marry," but rather, "Believe on the
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:03.060]   Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved."
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.060]   Very good.
[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.060]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.060]   And thank you, Steve, for the question.
[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.980]   If you have a question, send it in to us.
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.540]   You can do that through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:18.020]   Well, next up, we're going to look at how pastors fail.
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:22.380]   We are blessed with many, countless faithful men who lead churches.
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.460]   Praise God for them.
[00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.500]   But some pastors do fail, and fail in big ways.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.860]   It's not a topic we want to address, but it's a topic we need to address on occasion, and
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.060]   we will next time on Wednesday.
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.180]   I am your host, Tony Reinke, and we will see you back here for that.
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:41.060]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime author and pastor, John
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.060]   Piper.
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:42.560]   We'll see you next time.
