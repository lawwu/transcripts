[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080]   One hack that I recently learned that I haven't thought about how it would apply to awards,
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.000]   but it definitely applies to traveling with children, the cost of four business class
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.200]   tickets, whether it's points or miles, is way more than the cost of six economy tickets.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.280]   And so they often book six tickets. And depending on the airline, you may or may not be able to book
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.920]   a ticket without a person. But what they do is they book oftentimes on a flight where there's
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.800]   three and three, they book all six, they couldn't find the business class availability, or it was
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.920]   way too expensive, but they book six seats in economy, and then the kids can lie down, it's a
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.440]   little bit more space to move around. Oftentimes, I can tell you that finding six economy seats on
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.160]   some flights might be difficult, but it might be easier than finding four business class seats on
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.400]   that same flight. Oh, yeah, no, that that is a very good hack. And like you said, I think you're
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.960]   fine. You can book an extra seat. That's a legitimate thing that people do. And, and yeah,
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.920]   that would be a far more economical way to do it. That's a great example of thinking outside the
