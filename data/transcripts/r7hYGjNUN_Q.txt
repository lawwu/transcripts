[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.820]   There are a lot of countries where whether it's immigration or security, if you're with a family,
[00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.640]   they treat you much better. Yes, unfortunately, they definitely don't do that in the U.S. because
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.140]   they don't want to. Everyone here is equal. But yeah, in other countries, I've seen it where
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.280]   there's actually separate immigration lines. Now, this can play to your disadvantage sometimes too
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.300]   when you fly into the Rome airport, right? If you're a U.S. citizen with a U.S. passport that
[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.820]   has one of those little chips in it, you can go through basically a biometric entry gate and get
[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.060]   into the country faster. But if you're with children 18 and younger, you can't. So families
[00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.040]   are actually penalized in that case when you're arriving in Italy. In Mexico, we've often been
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.200]   pulled out of the line and said, hey, you have kids. Don't wait in this line. Go this way.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.560]   I'm right through. Yes. Excellent. And it helps to sort of get the eye of somebody who's minding the
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.420]   security line or the immigration line and make sure that they're aware that you have children with you
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.840]   and they're crying maybe or, you know, you nudge them a little bit, right? Now, there are family lanes
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.600]   that offer security and sometimes immigration as well in certain countries. Again, I would be on the
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.560]   lookout for them the moment you get to the airport. They're not always well signposted,
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.180]   but they'll usually have a little family icon with a stroller and a couple parents and children in tow.
