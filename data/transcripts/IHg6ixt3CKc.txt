[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400]   The following is a conversation with Anthony Pompliano,
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.760]   entrepreneur, technology investor, prolific writer,
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.500]   podcaster, and Twitter user on topics of finance,
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.580]   cryptocurrency, technology, and economics.
[00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.180]   I highly recommend his popular podcast and daily letter
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.500]   called "The Pomp Podcast" and "The Pomp Letter."
[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.300]   Quick thank you to our sponsors,

[00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.660]   As a side note, let me say that I'll be having
[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.260]   many conversations in the coming months
[00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.180]   about cryptocurrency with people
[00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.980]   of all kinds of backgrounds and worldviews.
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.300]   Those who are proponents of Bitcoin,
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.980]   like Anthony, Nick Carter, Robert Breedlove,
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.540]   Alex Glassstein, and many others.
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.700]   And those who are proponents
[00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.020]   of other cryptocurrency technologies,
[00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.180]   like Vitalik Buterin, Charles Hoskinson,
[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.460]   Richard Hart, Sergey Nazarov,
[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.420]   Sylvia McCauley, and many others as well.
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.660]   I'm not framing this as a debate.
[00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.180]   I'm simply looking to explore exciting ideas
[00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.980]   in the space of technologies
[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.800]   that could very well change human civilization
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.620]   and AGI civilization as well.
[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.260]   I appreciate that some communities are a bit more intense
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.140]   in their style of communication than others,
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.380]   but I personally am only interested in open-minded,
[00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.940]   respectful collaboration in exploring ideas.
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.640]   I personally try to, like to approach conversations
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.860]   by considering that I may be wrong about everything
[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.980]   and I'm looking to learn.
[00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.420]   I won't engage in groupthink, social signaling,
[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.340]   outrage mobs, mocking, and derision.
[00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.700]   If you do, I understand.
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.380]   It's just not my thing.
[00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.600]   I send you my love either way
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.420]   and hope to meet you in person over some drinks,
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.060]   some good laughs, and a good conversation one day.
[00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.060]   No matter the difference in style or substance,
[00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.980]   we're all just human after all.
[00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.220]   This is an amazing ride we're all on together.
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.820]   Buy the ticket, take the ride, as Hunter S. Thompson said.
[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.540]   Whether you pay for that ticket with Bitcoin, Ethereum,
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.180]   the dollar, gold, seashells, a beer,
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.940]   or just a good old smile,
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.280]   this is the Lex Friedman Podcast
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.460]   and here is my conversation with Anthony Pompliano.
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.180]   You served in the US Army for six years
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.180]   and spent 13 months in Iraq in 2008 and '09.
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.100]   Can you tell the story of why you joined the Army
[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.180]   and what were some of the moving, difficult,
[00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.140]   and maybe lasting experiences from the time you served?
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.060]   - Sure, I joined when I was 17 years old.
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.020]   I needed my parents to basically sign in order to join.
[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.780]   And I'd graduated a semester early from high school
[00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.780]   and thought I was gonna go play football in college
[00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.300]   and kind of enroll in the spring semester.
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.900]   And when that didn't happen,
[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.620]   basically was working at Chick-fil-A in Quiznos
[00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.580]   and had in my mind,
[00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.740]   "Look, this is probably not the path in life that I want."
[00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.420]   And so I knew I was gonna go to college.
[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.860]   I knew I was gonna go play football in the fall,
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.380]   but I had this window of time.
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.180]   And so I walked into a recruiting office
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.740]   and just basically was like,
[00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.620]   "I'm assuming you guys need some help."
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.780]   And they gave me the whole pitch
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.460]   and give you a signing bonus.
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.740]   You can go jump out of planes
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.540]   and go do all this crazy stuff.
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.860]   I just said, "Okay, let's do it."
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.700]   - This was close to 9/11.
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.740]   - This was in 2006, about five years after.
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.660]   - So what impact, I mean, do you remember 9/11?
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.140]   What impact did that have on your thinking about this?
[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.060]   - So I was in eighth grade, if I remember correctly.
[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.340]   And I remember being in school when it happened
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.940]   and I walked into a classroom and the entire class,
[00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.040]   it was somebody else's class,
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.380]   they were all talking to the teacher about something.
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.260]   The second that me and a couple other kids walked in,
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.660]   everyone got real quiet and the teacher was like,
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.740]   "Hey, go back to your home room."
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.260]   And so it was just kind of a weird, like what's going on.
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.700]   And then next thing I know,
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.780]   they called all of the students into the cafeteria.
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.180]   And this is back before every classroom
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.700]   really had a television in it
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.860]   and cable and all that kind of stuff.
[00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.100]   And so when we were there, they basically just said,
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.860]   "Listen, there's been this event that's occurred.
[00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.940]   All of your parents are gonna come pick you guys up
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.100]   and they'll explain it to you."
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.580]   And so to a kid in eighth grade,
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.940]   you're basically like, "What happened?"
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.180]   And so I got home and I remember talking to my dad about it.
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.700]   And my dad basically gave me
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.620]   the core American kind of talking points, right?
[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.940]   Look, somebody from another country came here
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.940]   and tried to kill Americans
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.600]   and was successful in doing that.
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.740]   And to some extent, he just said,
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.220]   "And I'm willing to bet we're gonna go back after them."
[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.300]   - Did that wake you up a little bit
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.220]   to the idea that there's evil out there,
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.540]   that even just the idea of terrorism,
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.860]   for many people that was,
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.500]   when it hits you on your own land,
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.980]   it really shakes up your mind.
[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.020]   In some sense, World War II,
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.900]   that's why World War II was fundamentally different
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.300]   for Americans than it is for the people like in Russia,
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.940]   in England, in France, in Europe in general,
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.340]   there's something about when there's families,
[00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.300]   women, children dying on your own land, that's different.
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.980]   And that was one of the first times in America
[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.340]   where like on your, of course, it's Pearl Harbor,
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.480]   but like this is like in recent history,
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.820]   it's like they hit us here.
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.580]   That was like a profound idea.
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.100]   I think America was very, very good
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.780]   at exporting the violence elsewhere for a long time.
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.240]   And there was this element of complacency,
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.940]   but also this element of really just American superiority,
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.660]   that doesn't happen here.
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.500]   And I think that that woke people up,
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.340]   not only to kind of the idea
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.940]   that other places around the world
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.680]   may not like the American ideals,
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.580]   may not like democracy and capitalism and that,
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.300]   but also maybe we aren't as big, tough,
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.380]   and secure as we thought we were.
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.740]   And so obviously I think you see the kind of the over-rotation
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.800]   with a lot of the kind of security theater
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.260]   that came after that of almost psychologically,
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.700]   let's make our citizens feel like they're safe,
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.300]   even if the things that we're doing don't necessarily
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.020]   kind of change that apparatus.
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.860]   But on top of that,
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.780]   I think that it really woke people up
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.860]   to extremism around the world.
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.860]   And I don't know if necessarily
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.020]   there was a change in the extremism
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.660]   as much as it just was an awareness thing.
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.660]   How many people kind of drew a line from,
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.980]   was it '92 or '93 with the World Trade Center bombing
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.540]   to deep levels of extremism
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.840]   and hatred of kind of the American industrial complex?
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.100]   Probably not that many.
[00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.100]   2001, a lot of people.
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.940]   And so I think that was, again, as a young kid,
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.340]   you don't understand a lot of this stuff.
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.620]   You basically just, hey, somebody came here
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.540]   and tried to kill Americans.
[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.340]   And so we should go fight back, right,
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.900]   was kind of the response I think that I had.
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.940]   - What role did that have psychologically for you
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.300]   when you then in 2006 joined the Army?
[00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.560]   I mean, this is a very different joining the Army
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.620]   than in the time when like it's more peaceful.
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.020]   Here you're essentially facing,
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.320]   I mean, I don't know if you see it that way,
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.100]   but there is a war on terror.
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.980]   And I know that people kind of criticize
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.380]   that whole formulation framework of thinking,
[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.140]   but nevertheless, you are going to Iraq,
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.860]   you are going to Afghanistan,
[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.780]   you're going to these places
[00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.700]   and are fighting these complicated,
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.620]   I mean, it's not even clear what you're fighting.
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.540]   - Yeah, well, I think that there's a couple of key pieces.
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.820]   So one, like one of the actual most impactful data points,
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.020]   if you were, or kind of stories for me
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.260]   was the Pat Tillman story.
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.500]   So I played football in high school
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.700]   and I was gonna go play in college
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.260]   and seeing this NFL player who basically just one day said,
[00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.980]   hey, I'm gonna go and do this instead and walk away.
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.060]   I don't know necessarily if it was a,
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.420]   I wanna pursue the same story, right?
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.860]   And obviously he ended up dying
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.380]   and so not exactly the end result that you want,
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.600]   but I think it was almost like he made it okay
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.340]   if you were on a certain trajectory in life
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.780]   to go take this detour and to go do it.
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.900]   But the second thing is I was 17.
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.060]   You're pretty stupid when you're 17,
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.940]   you're pretty naive when you're 17, right?
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:28.300]   And so I almost kind of backed into the deployment
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:32.100]   because I signed up as a reserve member.
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.940]   And so basically the plan was to sign up for the reserves,
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.060]   I was gonna go to basic training,
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.940]   get all the kind of education and qualification.
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.380]   I was gonna go to college and then after college,
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.700]   maybe there's a chance that you will go and serve
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.180]   or do whatever.
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.860]   For me, I ended up getting deployed
[00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.500]   when I was a junior in college,
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.300]   literally got pulled out of school.
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.820]   And so at 20 years old,
[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.900]   it's not exactly what you thought you were signing up for,
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.820]   right, especially to kind of leave school to go do it.
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.260]   And then on top of that,
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.580]   I probably had an advantage over most people
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.900]   both on the entry to combat and the exit
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:08.380]   to kind of a combat situation, which was football.
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.900]   So I always explain that in hindsight,
[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.900]   you're in a male dominated, testosterone driven
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.820]   kind of combative sport where it's us first them
[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.220]   and there's training and injuries
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:22.820]   and just kind of all of the things that go into
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.900]   playing a combat sport like football
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.500]   to now they give you guns,
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.980]   but you still have a uniform on still male dominated.
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.060]   It's just a little bit more serious
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.460]   in terms of the injuries and potential death
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.620]   and things like that.
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.420]   But also on the exit from that deployment,
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.860]   most guys I was there with,
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.900]   they're going back to being prison guards,
[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:45.580]   police officers working at the lumber yard,
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.580]   just kind of everyday Americans.
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.700]   And so I had the fortunate ability to go back
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.740]   into kind of that combative environment,
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:54.980]   go back to play football.
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.420]   And so it was almost this like deescalation on the way out
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.660]   where they take your guns away,
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.100]   we still got a uniform still male dominated,
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.500]   still combative and then eventually
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.140]   you're just a normal citizen.
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.860]   And so I think that in some weird way,
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.860]   I was very fortunate to kind of on the entry and exit
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.140]   have that experience where other guys didn't.
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.340]   - So what you were deployed to Iraq,
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:19.980]   were there any memories, experiences that changed you
[00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.940]   or in general, like you're probably a different man
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.260]   on the other side of it.
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.300]   How did that time change you?
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.900]   - I think there was two main takeaways that I took, right?
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.860]   So one was not a specific moment, but on multiple occasions,
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.780]   I remember we were driving down the road and I would look
[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:39.060]   and there would be a 10, 12, 14 year old kid.
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.420]   And if you've never seen somebody who literally has hate
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.820]   and disdain in their eyes.
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.140]   - Towards you?
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.940]   - Just not necessarily to you personally,
[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:48.900]   just to the uniform, to what you stand for,
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.380]   to all this stuff.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.940]   When you see it, you see it, right?
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.500]   And I always think of, if you've ever watched the movie,
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.820]   A 12 Strong and in it, they've got this Afghanistan warlord
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.580]   and he's talking to a bunch of soldiers and he says,
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.620]   "You don't have killer eyes, you do, you do."
[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.940]   And he's just like, he can just tell, right?
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.020]   He's seen so many soldiers.
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.780]   And so I think that that was a memory
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.860]   on a number of occasions where I just saw a young kid
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.020]   and I just said, "They hate us."
[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:16.860]   Right?
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.460]   And it's not you personally, it's what you stand for.
[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.300]   - But the really big event was when you first get
[00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.740]   to these combat zones, a lot of times what will happen is,
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.900]   you basically, your unit teams up
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.020]   with a unit that's leaving and there's a handoff
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.220]   and it happens over a couple of weeks.
[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.180]   And so you can imagine almost 1% of our team goes out
[00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:37.580]   with 99% of their team, then 5, 95, 10, 90,
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.940]   all the way till it's 50, 50,
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:39.940]   and then eventually it rotates
[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.140]   and then it's majority of our team
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.380]   and a small number of their team.
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.140]   And so what a lot of people will explain
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:47.380]   is the two most dangerous times in war
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.500]   are actually the first two or three weeks
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.100]   and the last two or three weeks.
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:51.940]   When you first get there,
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:52.940]   you don't know who the people are,
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:53.980]   you don't know the terrain,
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.380]   you don't know kind of the local cultures
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.180]   and who to look out for, what signs, all that kind of stuff.
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.420]   And the last two or three weeks
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.740]   is you basically think you've survived the deployment,
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.660]   you're looking forward to going home,
[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.820]   so you become complacent, things like that.
[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:08.180]   And so we made it through that transition period
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:12.100]   with no issues, but the literally the very first mission
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.820]   that we went out as a team ourselves, 100%,
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.700]   there was two separate incidents.
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.380]   One was we were driving in the middle of the night
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:23.380]   and what we think was a sniper shot at a truck
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.420]   that I was in, I was standing up outside of it,
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.500]   along with another guy.
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.100]   And that was kind of just a wake up call again
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.940]   of never been shot at before.
[00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:32.780]   - Right.
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.500]   - And so I'll never forget,
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.020]   you kind of heard this whiz go by
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.020]   and the guy next to me was from rural Pennsylvania
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.460]   and he just said, "Look, I never been shot at before either
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.220]   but I've done a lot of hunting, get the fuck down."
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.900]   (both laughing)
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.020]   - Okay.
[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.940]   And so we kept driving that night
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:52.860]   and later on in the night, an IED went off.
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:56.260]   A guy ran over an IED who was at the front of the convoy.
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.060]   And when that IED went off again,
[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.980]   I'd never been in a convoy that had been blown up before,
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:03.340]   but the training kicks in.
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.380]   And so immediately every single person starts screaming out,
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:06.300]   "IED, IED."
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.060]   And they started looking and trying to figure it out.
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.580]   And you realize the United States military
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.520]   did a fantastic job training us before we went,
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.000]   because in that moment, nobody thought about anything.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.920]   You just did what you had been programmed to do.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.120]   And so ultimately kind of through the end of that event,
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.420]   there was a US soldier that ended up dying.
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.020]   He was shot in the head.
[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:28.360]   And when we got back to the base
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.980]   kind of after that entire event, I think it just hit us.
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.960]   We are at war and if we make mistakes here,
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.380]   that is the cost of kind of those mistakes.
[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.080]   And this was somebody who I didn't know.
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.940]   It was somebody who literally showed up
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:46.160]   kind of as secondary support for our unit
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.460]   and basically was there to help us.
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.500]   And so it was one of those weird situations
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.880]   where you have this emotional connection
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.460]   because it's somebody who shared an event with you,
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.860]   but you didn't know them.
[00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.240]   And you learn their name later
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.940]   and you understand that they have a family
[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.540]   and they have young kids and all this stuff.
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.300]   And so again, as a 20 year old kid,
[00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.580]   you're kind of processing all this.
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.300]   And you just realize like,
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:11.200]   the gun I have in my hands, it's real for a reason.
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.460]   And we better take this seriously.
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.340]   This is not, you know,
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.340]   let's joking around in kind of the barracks
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.780]   and all the things that you would expect
[00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:21.200]   guys are doing in the army.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.640]   So I think that was like the moment where I said,
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.700]   hey, I'm gonna learn a lot here
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.100]   and I gotta make sure I get home.
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.900]   - And you snap it into the training, but nevertheless,
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.700]   I mean, you're somebody who thinks philosophically
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:32.980]   about this world now, right?
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:37.740]   You're very intelligent and thinks deeply about the world.
[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.140]   So looking back, you mentioned hatred
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:44.020]   in the 14 year old kid's eyes, there's death.
[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.740]   So the way you kind of describe this whole story
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:51.060]   is like training kicks in, this shit is serious.
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:52.980]   Like this is, you know,
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.820]   there's a reason there's a gun in your hand.
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.460]   So there's a strategic element.
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.060]   There's like, you have to get the job done.
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.580]   There's a task at hand.
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.020]   But at the same time, if you zoom out,
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.980]   there's a kid who has hate for you.
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.620]   Some of those kids would probably, if they could,
[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:13.940]   would kill you for the thing you stand for in the uniform.
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.480]   And then there's bullets flying at you.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.620]   And then there's people that some of them
[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:24.380]   you might already care for deeply are dying.
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.400]   What the hell do you make of that?
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.700]   Do you think about that?
[00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.260]   Does any of that haunt you?
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:34.260]   How do you think about the world having witnessed that?
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.180]   - Yeah, a lot of times when we would talk about it,
[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.300]   we were there.
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.140]   If I was that kid,
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.300]   I would wanna kill that person too, right?
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.020]   I would have hatred as well, right?
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.220]   Imagine if in the United States tomorrow,
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.420]   you and I woke up and there was tanks rolling down the street
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:50.940]   from another country,
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.380]   and they were basically imposing their rules on us,
[00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.820]   whether they thought it was the right thing to do or not,
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.780]   the soldiers were there, they were doing this.
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.500]   We would probably feel not so great about it, right?
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.660]   At kind of a minimum and at a maximum,
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.940]   we'd be really, really pissed off, we would fight back.
[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.780]   And so what you don't understand
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:09.460]   when you're in the heat of the moment is,
[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.180]   why does this person feel this way?
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.420]   And so what's very weird is,
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.260]   well, what happens if a year ago,
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.100]   US soldiers came through, they got shot at,
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.740]   they returned fire and they killed that kid's uncle?
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.420]   You'd be pissed off, right?
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.180]   And so you just start to understand,
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.480]   like we look at war very black and white.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.340]   We look at it very much from a clinical perspective.
[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.660]   We're gonna go, we're gonna go kind of invade somewhere.
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.740]   We are the most dominant military in the world.
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.700]   We're very good at invading
[00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.780]   and we will crush wherever we invade.
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:42.880]   But when you're actually on the ground,
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.460]   what you understand is the humanity of it all, right?
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.280]   And so what becomes very interesting is,
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.900]   pretty much every veteran I know that comes back,
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.060]   they're some of the largest pacifists in the world.
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.860]   And I always revert back to Marcus Luttrell,
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.680]   who's a famous Navy SEAL,
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.380]   and there's a movie made about him and his story.
[00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.940]   He gave a speech one time that I saw,
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.240]   and he basically said, listen, if you're a politician,
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.140]   your job is to be the diplomat,
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.420]   do everything you possibly can
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.100]   not to send me and my friends anywhere.
[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:11.980]   'Cause when you send us,
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.700]   we're gonna bring hell with us, right?
[00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.300]   And understand that is the business that we are in.
[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.060]   But every single other person up until we get sent
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.540]   has a job to do to prevent having to send us.
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.900]   And I think that ultimately that's where you see a lot of
[00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.940]   kind of this generation that has fought in Iraq
[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.420]   and Afghanistan that says, listen,
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.620]   maybe we shouldn't be running around the world
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:32.740]   being the police.
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:34.420]   Maybe we shouldn't be going and invading
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.820]   all these different countries.
[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:39.660]   Because when you actually get to see firsthand what happens,
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.140]   it's just something that we should avoid at all costs.
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.480]   But if we have to go,
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.560]   or we have to actually send soldiers somewhere,
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.900]   understand what happens when that occurs.
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:52.060]   And the United States is the best in the world at doing it.
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:55.460]   - Do you think, I'm thinking about that kid with the hatred,
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.900]   do you think there will always be hatred in the world?
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.760]   Do you think from another perspective,
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.540]   do you think there'll be war always?
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.060]   Is that a fundamental aspect of human nature
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:08.420]   or is that something we can escape?
[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.540]   - Yeah, so war I think has like very negative connotations
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:13.660]   in terms of bullets and bombs and death
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:18.660]   and kind of just very morbid type understanding.
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.120]   Conflict on the other hand,
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.340]   I think people look at and say,
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:23.820]   of course there will always be conflict, right?
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.980]   You just can't have billions of people
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.820]   all on the same planet without some level of disagreement.
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.680]   Whether that's a disagreement of ideas,
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:34.480]   disagreement over physical geography or something else.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.140]   And so I think conflict will always exist.
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.560]   The question is what form does war take moving forward?
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.660]   And so in my mind,
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.240]   it's starting to look a lot more clinical, right?
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.980]   A lot more drones, a lot less soldiers on the ground,
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:49.880]   a lot more use of special forces
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.080]   and kind of these small highly specialized teams
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.200]   rather than kind of big mechanical armies.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.760]   And then you get into like the information warfare
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.200]   and kind of cyber warfare.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.080]   And you start to understand that
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.480]   we're at war with a lot of people right now, right?
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.480]   Doesn't mean we're necessarily dropping bombs
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.560]   on their countries.
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.800]   Doesn't necessarily mean we're sending soldiers there,
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.200]   but on a daily basis,
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.320]   we are engaged in these kind of cyber battlefields.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.000]   And so if that's where war starts to play out,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.600]   one changes the tools and tactics and techniques
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.960]   that we need to arm our country
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.840]   and other countries will arm themselves with.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.520]   But it also changes the way that we think about war, right?
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.160]   It sounds a lot less worrisome if I say,
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.360]   hey, we're gonna go to war with a country,
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.880]   but by the way, there's gonna be no death, right?
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.760]   Okay, like that doesn't sound nearly as bad as,
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.600]   hey, we're gonna go send 10,000 soldiers
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.040]   and some percentage of them are gonna die on the battlefield
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.800]   and then we're gonna basically pipe back videos
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.520]   and articles saying that American soldiers are dying.
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.080]   - Yeah, there does seem to be a fundamental difference
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.920]   between the Genghis Khan style.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:54.360]   Like if I would feel differently
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:57.960]   if somebody like hand to hand
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.480]   with a knife murdered my family
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.240]   versus cybersecurity where I stole all their data,
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.880]   stole all their money,
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.280]   stole everything they own,
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.360]   falsified their identity, all that kind of stuff.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.800]   Those are both traumatic events,
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.840]   but they do seem to be fundamentally different,
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:20.520]   but maybe that's actually very narrow style thinking
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:24.080]   because ultimately you have to think about what is life
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.760]   and what's happiness.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.800]   And it's like the samurai thinking,
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.560]   I'm not sure what's more painful.
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.080]   If I take it to myself,
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:38.020]   like I'm not sure what I would rather live through,
[00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.920]   being stabbed like to death
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:46.840]   or having my identity stolen, all my money stolen
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:52.380]   or maybe reputation destroyed,
[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.500]   like with lies or something like that.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.120]   That's very interesting to think about
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.520]   if you think about quality of life
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.680]   and all those kinds of things.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.360]   - Well, one's finite, right?
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.800]   One's the pain ends
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.480]   and the other is kind of a long, prolonged, almost torture.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.280]   - So it's physical pain versus psychological pain.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.920]   It's really interesting to think about.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.900]   - And I think another key piece to this,
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.080]   which I don't have answers to,
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.860]   but there is an element of emotion and rage
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.760]   in the physical violence versus,
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.680]   again, more of that clinical information warfare.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:28.680]   And so it's really easy to show a battlefield
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.040]   where there's death on both sides
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:34.100]   and bombs being dropped and buildings destroyed.
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.680]   It fits very well into propaganda for everyone involved,
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.200]   right, regardless of what side they're on.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.680]   When you start talking about cyber warfare,
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.600]   how many times have we seen a big company
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.680]   get data hacked or information hacked
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.040]   and we all read the headlines, maybe throw a tweet out
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.600]   and then move on with our day and don't remember it anymore.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.400]   And so it's just very, very different, I think,
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.480]   in the emotion and response that it invokes in people
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.440]   when they hear about it as well.
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:01.640]   - Given the conflict,
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.680]   do you think people are fundamentally good
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:07.020]   or are we all sort of like blank slates
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:10.000]   that could be evil given the environment
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.760]   or good given the environment?
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.800]   Or can we kind of, is there some base
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.040]   that we can rely on that people,
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:19.960]   if left to their own devices,
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:24.240]   will be good and trustworthy and honest?
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.360]   - I think you have to separate out intention from action.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.320]   So if you talk to some of the most heinous criminals
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.840]   in the world, they've rationalized their actions.
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.880]   And so you've got to ask yourself,
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.520]   what is the level of which they understood
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:40.600]   what they were doing,
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.700]   that they intended to be malicious, nefarious,
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:46.300]   and kind of do bad things
[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.320]   versus the actual actions themselves?
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.800]   And so even as a society,
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.200]   if let's say, for example,
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.520]   you were to walk down the street
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.160]   and you were to murder somebody on the sidewalk,
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.880]   completely unprovoked,
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.960]   we would look at you and say, you are a sociopath,
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.760]   you have everything wrong with you
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.000]   and that is somebody that we do not want in our society.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.120]   And therefore we will levy the extent of rule of law
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:14.040]   against you in order to protect society from you, right?
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.580]   And you become that monster, that beast.
[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:17.740]   If in the same situation,
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.020]   somebody walks in your house with a knife
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.020]   and you murder them or you kill them,
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:25.580]   now we put you up on a pedestal as a hero.
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.280]   And those are two very, very different responses.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.240]   They may be just as morbid,
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:34.440]   they may be just as violent in terms of the actual actions,
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.120]   the intentions, the way it's perceived
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.040]   is very, very different.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.720]   And so I think that as a world,
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:43.320]   we like a very black and white, clean cut, good, bad.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.240]   I think the world's a lot more messy than that.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.200]   And I think that a lot of times
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.360]   when you look at intention,
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.920]   it's hard for us to tell what somebody's intention is.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:55.000]   But I've looked at a lot of people
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.720]   who are both considered very good
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.100]   and also a lot of people are considered very bad.
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.320]   And they sound very similar
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:03.220]   in terms of the motivations for their actions.
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.680]   And so I think that it's just a really hard problem
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.360]   that probably doesn't have a perfect solution or an answer.
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.440]   - Do you give much value to the intention
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.520]   or do you think it's better to look
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.760]   at the results of the behavior
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:18.800]   as opposed to the underlying ideology,
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.300]   the underlying intention of the behavior?
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.360]   - I think that intention gets at the question
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.360]   of like, are people inherently good or bad?
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.500]   I think that they're generally inherently good
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.140]   and the intention is driving towards the thing
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.520]   that they believe is the best outcome
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.000]   or the best thing for them to pursue.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.700]   The action I think is where we spend
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.960]   most of our time focused on.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.120]   And frankly, we actually may be a better society
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.440]   or kind of kinder as a humanity to each other
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.100]   if we spent more time looking at intention
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.760]   rather than action.
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.040]   But again, if somebody walks down the street
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.700]   and murders somebody, it's really hard
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.960]   to have a conversation and it may be inappropriate
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.280]   for us to have a conversation about intention
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:03.160]   versus any level of action.
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:08.200]   - So you're one of the prominent,
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:12.680]   I would say even the faces of the world of cryptocurrency,
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:15.240]   Bitcoin, that whole entire world.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.680]   Let's dive straight in and ask,
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:22.680]   do you think, do you consider yourself a Bitcoin maximalist?
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:26.080]   - I think that the way I really look at it is
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.480]   I work backwards off of what is the maximalism
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.640]   that I believe in.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:35.260]   And the world that I believe in is kind of an automated world
[00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:40.260]   that is run on these open decentralized protocols.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:44.900]   And what we ultimately do is we return sovereignty
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:48.520]   and individualism and kind of personal responsibility
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:52.000]   and liberty to people over institutions.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.800]   And what we end up doing is we end up kind of taking
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.640]   what has historically been a very analog
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.480]   or physical world economy and geographic rule.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.740]   And we then kind of put it in the cloud
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:07.440]   and this digital economy becomes the prevalent way
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:11.880]   that we all conduct commerce, communicate, et cetera.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:16.040]   And so it's less about any one single technology to me.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:19.440]   I think that it's pretty stupid for people to almost
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:23.880]   in a way put an inanimate object up for
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.920]   some sort of obsession.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.480]   To me, it's much more about the ideals, the ethos,
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.320]   and the most rational and likely path
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.120]   to that kind of end result or that world that I think
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.840]   is at this point just a foregone conclusion.
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.160]   - So the distinction there,
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.960]   and maybe people don't know the terminology,
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.100]   maximalism is basically saying,
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:48.540]   I really think this is a good idea.
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:52.980]   Like, you know, if you prefer a certain kind of diet,
[00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.980]   you could be a keto maximalist saying like,
[00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:58.360]   this is probably, maybe it's not 100%,
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.420]   but probably the diet that's healthiest for humans
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:02.340]   kind of thing.
[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:05.440]   In the same sense, Bitcoin maximalism is saying,
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.080]   you know, of course we don't know,
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.200]   there's a lot of uncertainty,
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.480]   but this particular technology seems to be
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.840]   the best representations of some set of ideals
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.400]   that defines progress in the future.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.760]   But you're drawing a distinction between sort of
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:24.520]   cult-like obsession about an object of any kind,
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:28.640]   whether it's keto or Bitcoin,
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:32.240]   and just sort of believing that a technology
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:35.720]   is the best representation of a particular set of ideals.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:40.720]   And you believe that sort of this moving into the cloud,
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:44.240]   both the distributed nature of it,
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.800]   but also just the digital nature of it
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.960]   is something that's going to be a positive step
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.000]   for humanity.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.080]   - Yeah, I would even take maximalism a step further,
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.920]   and it's not just the kind of singular viewpoint
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.680]   of this is the best,
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:02.200]   it's also an element of it's anti-everything else, right?
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.040]   - Yeah.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.720]   - So, you know, take keto for example,
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.840]   the keto diet is not only the best diet,
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.280]   all the other diets are bad.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.120]   - Yeah.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:09.960]   - Right?
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.040]   And so it's a very binary view of the world.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:15.280]   I think that what's probably most misunderstood about,
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.960]   let's take Bitcoin as a specific example,
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.500]   is that most of the people
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.080]   who are labeled Bitcoin maximalist,
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.160]   they would be open-minded if they believed
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:27.440]   that something else came along that was a superior technology
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.840]   or had a better kind of probability of achieving,
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.640]   again, that ultimate vision.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.840]   I think where there's this controversy
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.200]   and kind of clashing of ideas
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.520]   is that the Bitcoin community believes
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.760]   Bitcoin is the best way to do that,
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.000]   and has very specific arguments
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.600]   as to why the other things are not, right?
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.040]   And so what ultimately ends up happening,
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.880]   which is very weird in the investing world, right?
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:54.000]   It's unlikely that you and I are gonna sit down
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.600]   and you're gonna be like, "Apple stock is the best stock,
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.200]   "and there's no other stock that's worth anything."
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.040]   - Yeah.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:58.880]   - Right?
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.920]   And then also it's very weird if you said to me,
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.420]   "This stock is worth zero,
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:05.900]   "and that's where everything that I own,
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.320]   "I've put on a short on one single company."
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.160]   Right?
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:09.980]   There's diversification,
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.440]   there's much more kind of probabilistic thinking
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.200]   in finance in general.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.640]   When it comes to this specific world of cryptocurrency
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.960]   and kind of digital assets, if you will,
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.000]   is there's two main groups of people
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.080]   who are trying to build two very, very different things
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:27.560]   at the onset, but when you unpack it
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.040]   and you start to spend more and more time on it,
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.640]   you realize they're actually trying to accomplish
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.520]   the same thing in two different ways.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.760]   So Bitcoin is seen, I think, as a digital currency, right?
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.800]   Kind of the idea that this is going to ascend
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.720]   to become the next global reserve currency.
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:43.260]   It's a programmatic kind of transparent money,
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:46.120]   and it's essentially just 180 degrees difference
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:50.320]   than the inflationary, non-transparent fiat currencies
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.960]   that exist in the world.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.960]   You then look at kind of everything else, right?
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.180]   And you have a lot of smart contract platforms
[00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.280]   and various things that they're all going after, right?
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.780]   Ethereum with kind of the world computer approach,
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:01.800]   and you can kind of go down the line
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.080]   with all their other arguments
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.640]   as to what they're trying to build.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.480]   I think the big difference just comes down
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:10.080]   to innovation versus security.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:14.000]   And when you simplistically look at it via that lens,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.240]   you actually understand where both people are coming from.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.000]   - When you say security, sorry to interrupt,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.360]   do you mean financial security
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.560]   or do you mean like literally the security
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:26.260]   of the particular cryptocurrency?
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.460]   - The technical security of a blockchain.
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.300]   So when you look at, let's say Bitcoin versus Ethereum,
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.460]   right, Bitcoin has decided,
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.340]   and that community has decided security
[00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:37.060]   is the number one thing that you have to optimize for.
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:40.180]   So decentralization over everything else
[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:43.940]   in terms of transaction speeds, cost,
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:45.460]   anything that you could come up with
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.560]   that is something that would be important for a currency,
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.740]   the number one thing to optimize for is security.
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:53.960]   And as we have seen with a lot of technologies, right,
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.160]   Facebook's Libra, or now what's known as Diem
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:00.200]   is a great example, not having decentralization
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.100]   is susceptible to the nation state.
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:07.700]   And so a lot of these other platforms and blockchains,
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.560]   they say security is important,
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:11.200]   but it's not the most important thing.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.120]   We believe there's a trade-off between, you know,
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.960]   a little less security and transaction speed
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.600]   or composability or whatever it is.
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:23.420]   And so take Ethereum as kind of the second largest community
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:25.540]   in blockchain by market cap.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:27.700]   It was created because somebody wanted to,
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:29.460]   or a group of people wanted to do something on Bitcoin.
[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:30.460]   They felt like they couldn't do it.
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.140]   And so they said, "Hey, we're gonna go create something
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:35.100]   that has these smart contracts that we can then go do here."
[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.420]   Again, this is technology, right?
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:39.220]   So the tribalism of like, you're right, you're wrong,
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.540]   to me is a little childish,
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.660]   just in the sense of like the market is going to decide
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.100]   what is most valuable.
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:46.020]   And then when you go inside of that community,
[00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:47.300]   like there's a lot of dumb ideas
[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:48.900]   people are trying to build around Bitcoin.
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:50.900]   There's also a lot of really, really great ideas
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.660]   that people are trying to build around Bitcoin.
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.500]   Same thing in the Ethereum world.
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.140]   And so what you end up getting, I think,
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.980]   is the tribalism really comes out of the idea
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:59.700]   that there's a ticker price
[00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:01.860]   that is attached to all of this, right?
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:05.380]   If you go back in history of technology,
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.020]   venture capitalists didn't sit around the table
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:09.340]   and yell and scream at each other
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:11.700]   in this like religious zealot way, right?
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.600]   Because you bet on one type of cloud computing platform
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.380]   and I bet on another one, right?
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:17.460]   Just the market's going to decide
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:18.300]   we're both going to work on
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.500]   and try to make ours successful.
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:22.380]   Here, I think that the sensitivity,
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:24.260]   and mainly it comes out of the Bitcoin community,
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.660]   is that a lot of this is being funded
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.620]   not only by venture capitalists
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:32.140]   and kind of professional money managers and asset allocators.
[00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:35.100]   There's also this element of including the retail investor
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:36.380]   and the public.
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.580]   And so whether it's through ICOs
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:41.140]   or some other forms of capital raising,
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:42.740]   there's arguments for it saying,
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:45.980]   "Hey, look, this now gives kind of the little guy
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:48.660]   some sort of access and ability to do it."
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:50.220]   But there's also arguments against it.
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:51.860]   Some people say, "Hey, it's easier to dupe them
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.100]   and it's easier to run scams and kind of all this stuff."
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.860]   And so ultimately I think that crypto
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:59.140]   is this like arena of ideas.
[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.220]   It is literally the war of attrition.
[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.500]   And what will end up happening is 10 years from now,
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.420]   you and I will talk and we're going to say,
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:09.540]   "Well, the market said X was valuable and Y wasn't."
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:13.980]   And so all of the tribalism from between here and there,
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:15.900]   it's fun, it's engaging, whatever,
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:17.180]   but ultimately it doesn't really matter.
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.580]   - Yeah, because the public is involved
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:19.940]   so there's a lot of personalities.
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:24.340]   And so a lot of times we focus on the extreme personalities
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:28.020]   that do a lot of maybe, pardon the French, shit talking.
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.420]   And so we kind of focus on that,
[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:32.060]   but that's not necessarily representative
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:33.740]   of the communities involved.
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:34.900]   - Let's talk about Bitcoin first
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:37.060]   and then it'll help us use as a kind of comparison
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:39.460]   to Ethereum or whatever else.
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.620]   So when you think about what is money, right?
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:42.500]   That's kind of the first question
[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.300]   people really kind of go down the rabbit hole on.
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:47.740]   And ultimately today it's a belief system, right?
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.340]   And you may believe that one currency
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:50.780]   has more value over another
[00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:52.540]   because it's backed by a certain military
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:55.740]   or a certain government has a monetary policy
[00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.900]   that you believe in or don't believe in,
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.100]   but ultimately it's a belief system.
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:00.980]   There's nothing backing this
[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:04.020]   other than a government asks you to pay your taxes in it.
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:04.860]   Right?
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.700]   And they can have a monopoly on violence
[00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:07.740]   in terms of they can put you in jail
[00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:09.140]   if you don't pay your taxes.
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:10.520]   They can go to other countries
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.420]   and they can invade and do all this stuff.
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:15.660]   It wasn't always like that, right?
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:19.540]   It was historically a layer one technology was gold.
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:22.780]   And so gold was a fantastic store of value.
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:24.140]   You knew that if you held gold,
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:25.420]   it wasn't gonna be inflated away.
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:26.260]   It was sound money.
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:27.180]   It was outside the system
[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:29.180]   and no one could create more of it.
[00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:30.500]   The reason why that's important
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:33.260]   is because that optimization for store of value
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:38.260]   served as the bedrock of the entire stack of money
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:39.780]   for 5,000 years.
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.860]   And so the problem with that, though, again,
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.420]   trade-off between store of value
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:45.420]   is it was really hard to transact with, right?
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:47.300]   If I came in here and you said,
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.020]   "Hey, I want a couple of ounces of gold."
[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:49.860]   And I had a whole bar,
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:52.860]   I'd have to literally shave off the ounces of gold.
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.100]   It's heavy to carry around.
[00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:56.340]   If you said to me, "Hey, you're in one city,
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:57.180]   mail it to me."
[00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:58.260]   It's really expensive.
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.820]   You know, there's all these issues with it.
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:01.620]   And so ultimately what people said was,
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:04.380]   "Well, let's create a second layer on top of that gold
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:06.460]   in order to make it easier to transact."
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:08.460]   And so we created paper claims on the gold.
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:10.500]   So, hey, don't carry around the gold in your pocket anymore.
[00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.000]   Put it in a vault or a bank.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.960]   They're gonna issue a paper claim.
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.260]   Now you and I can trade these paper claims around.
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:17.380]   And at any point, if you want the gold,
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:18.340]   you just show up and you say,
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.580]   "Hey, give me three ounces of gold or two bars or whatever."
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:24.380]   And so that actually made the store of value,
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:26.220]   it allowed that to be the anchor
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:27.420]   and kind of the most important part,
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:29.540]   the security of your purchasing power.
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:31.140]   But now it became easier to transact.
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:32.980]   And then eventually we built layers even on top of that.
[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:35.100]   So everything from electronic money,
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.140]   kind of electronic Q-SIPs,
[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:39.180]   all the way to credit and other systems on top of that gold.
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:41.620]   1971 comes around and obviously we de-peg
[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:42.980]   from that gold, right?
[00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:44.460]   And it was a temporary measure at the time.
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:45.780]   We ended up not going back to it.
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:48.120]   And so what you moved or transitioned from
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.940]   was sound money, which was outside the system.
[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.240]   No one could create more.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.760]   To now the government had full control.
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.660]   They could create as much as they wanted to.
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:56.340]   They tried to be responsible and disciplined,
[00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:57.500]   but obviously hard to do.
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:58.660]   Sometimes we've been really good at it.
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:35:59.940]   Sometimes we've been less good at it.
[00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:00.900]   And then you go around the world
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:02.820]   and some countries have absolutely sucked at it
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:04.300]   and some have been good at it.
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:06.920]   And so when you look into the Bitcoin world,
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.860]   I think that when you look at the optimization for security,
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.780]   it's similar to gold, store value.
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.500]   People hold it, purchasing power has gone up a lot
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:15.340]   year over year.
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:18.780]   It's like a 200% year over year compound annual growth
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:19.900]   for over a decade, right?
[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:22.300]   And so you measure this in kind of the US dollar exchange
[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:23.540]   price, et cetera.
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:25.300]   But there's still a lot of people who will yell
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:28.260]   and scream about it's slow, it's costly, right?
[00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.380]   All the things around those transactions
[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.820]   that are obstacles or challenges.
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:34.980]   And so there's basically two schools of thought,
[00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:37.380]   and this is where we kind of get into the bifurcation.
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:38.200]   Some people just said,
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:41.260]   "Hey, this technology is antiquated, we can't use it.
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:43.060]   It doesn't make sense."
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:44.180]   And so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:45.260]   build something new.
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:48.820]   And so you go get kind of all of the various versions there.
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:49.860]   The Bitcoin community says,
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:52.380]   "No, just like gold had paper claims
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:54.300]   and other things built on top in layer two, three, four,
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:55.980]   five, we're gonna do that here."
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.260]   And so they've already started to build
[00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.900]   kind of this layer two where it's easier to transact,
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.360]   it's cheaper, it's faster, et cetera.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.940]   And so I actually think that both of those worlds
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:07.780]   are gonna coexist in the future.
[00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:10.940]   The big question is just which one has more importance?
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:13.240]   Right, so again, get out of binary,
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:15.020]   it's just probabilistically.
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:18.300]   And so my personal belief is that the security,
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:21.260]   that the store of value component as the bedrock
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:23.980]   for a monetary system is essential, right?
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:26.460]   Like that is the most important thing
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:29.460]   'cause you can always improve the other components,
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:32.840]   but you can't go back and fix that kind of core piece.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:36.700]   - So if money is an idea that we all,
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.260]   it's like an emergent idea that we believe in,
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:40.940]   you're saying that security
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:44.700]   is one of the most fundamental catalysts or fuels
[00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:48.960]   for that idea to sort of take hold and be stable
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.340]   and sort of take over the world.
[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:53.760]   The other stuff is really nice to have,
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.340]   but if you don't have the security,
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:56.540]   you're not going to,
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.980]   like it's not going to spread in a viral sense
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.660]   in our human brains.
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:03.340]   - Well, and especially in light
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:05.440]   of the kind of the macro economy, right?
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:08.460]   So like what's so fascinating about the last 12 months
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:12.740]   is in investing in general, the best returns,
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.420]   right, I kind of put that in air quotes a little bit,
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:17.500]   is something that is different than everything else
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:18.800]   and right.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.300]   So being different and wrong just means you're an idiot,
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.140]   right?
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:23.340]   Being different and right means that
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:25.700]   that's where kind of the outsized returns are.
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:28.180]   And so if you look around the world at currencies today,
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:29.320]   they're all the same.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.620]   They're all inflationary, unlimited supply,
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:32.980]   controlled by a government,
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:37.000]   and decisions made in a very non-transparent process.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.840]   And what we've watched is the manipulation
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.600]   of all of those currencies over the last 12 months.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.720]   In direct contrast to that is this thing, Bitcoin,
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:48.240]   which is outside of the system, has a finite supply,
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.840]   transparent and programmatic monetary policy.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.800]   And so when you see those two systems
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.360]   kind of in comparison to each other,
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.100]   in the United States,
[00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:57.940]   there's a lot of people who say
[00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:59.480]   the dollar works great for me.
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:01.800]   I can go to the ATM, I can get out physical cash.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:02.880]   If I want to swipe a card,
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.160]   I could do that.
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:07.480]   My money in my bank doesn't lose 50% of its value in a day
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.840]   in terms of purchasing power.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.800]   Like the dollar's pretty good.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.360]   When you go to other countries,
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:13.960]   that might not be the case.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:17.240]   And so I do think that there's kind of a relative analysis
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:18.080]   that goes on here.
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.880]   If you compare Bitcoin to the dollar,
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:22.080]   there's all kinds of arguments to make that the dollar
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.560]   is better as a medium of exchange today.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.600]   But if I go and I tell you,
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.540]   well, what about in these kind of extreme examples
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:32.160]   of Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Turkey, et cetera.
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.440]   And so I think that that's kind of one perspective
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.800]   to view this through is security
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.000]   versus all of the innovative components
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.800]   of a medium of exchange, et cetera.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:41.840]   The second thing though,
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.560]   that I think is really, really important
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:45.480]   is around censorship.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.240]   And so when you look at, again,
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:48.960]   every currency in the world today,
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.900]   every single financial service,
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:53.280]   they're highly susceptible to censorship.
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.560]   And actually I would argue the United States
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.440]   is in the business of censorship
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.080]   in terms of how many countries around the world
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:04.160]   do we sanction and cut them off in either a minimal
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.480]   or a very material way from the global financial system.
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.600]   - So when you talk about censorship,
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:13.600]   do you mean just the censoring your ability
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.560]   to operate freely in the world?
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:17.240]   - Well, look at it a little bit differently,
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:19.120]   which is that the United States
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.400]   has kind of the American superiority
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.560]   because we have the bombs, the bullets, the soldiers,
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:25.660]   and that military might,
[00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:29.720]   we basically impose our will around the world.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:33.800]   And so there's a very strong argument to be made
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.920]   that there are certain countries around the world
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:37.400]   that are being sanctioned,
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.760]   that the people of those countries did nothing wrong.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:42.560]   Now, the governments are bad, right?
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.200]   In terms of the way that you and I would look
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:48.760]   at democratic rule or communism or whatever it is,
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.800]   but the people are being hurt as well.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.080]   So there's a whole group of people
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:52.920]   who would have just argued,
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.160]   listen, we shouldn't hurt anyone
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:59.040]   at the expense of punishing one person or a group of people.
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.560]   There's other people who argue against that.
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.800]   But I do think that if you really kind of zoom out
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.000]   and you say, I'm gonna take myself
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.160]   out of the Western worldview,
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.320]   and I'm simply gonna look at this
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:12.040]   as we're all part of the human race, it's censorship.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:14.320]   And there might be an argument for censorship,
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:16.720]   but there also might be an argument against the censorship.
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:19.080]   And so what Bitcoin does
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:21.600]   as that specific kind of payment network
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:24.160]   is it says anyone in the world with an internet connection,
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.720]   I don't care where you were born,
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.680]   what language you speak, what religion you are,
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:30.160]   your wealth status, your education status,
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.440]   none of it matters.
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.200]   If you have an internet connection,
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.480]   you can plug into this monetary system
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.400]   and you can move value around the world
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:40.640]   to anyone else without asking for permission.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.680]   And in the United States,
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:45.120]   we basically have that ability in the US dollar
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.440]   kind of traditional banking system.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:48.280]   I can pretty much send money to almost anyone I want
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.320]   unless they're a really bad person
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:51.680]   that's on some list or something.
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:54.280]   Most people in the world don't have that capability.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.520]   And so what you're essentially doing
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:00.520]   is you're democratizing access to a true store value
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:03.720]   and a medium of exchange, right?
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:06.520]   And so what you see in many of these countries
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:09.200]   is that when their currency starts to fail,
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.200]   the first thing that a government
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:14.520]   or a group of people in power and influence do
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.760]   is they lock the citizens into the currency
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:17.900]   with capital controls.
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:19.680]   Why?
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:23.520]   'Cause if you let them out, it exasperates the problem.
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:26.000]   And so now what we're seeing is
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.320]   we basically are giving a tool
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.160]   to billions of people around the world
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.520]   that is a peaceful protest, right?
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:35.360]   You and I had no say at all
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.400]   when not only the Federal Reserve
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.080]   and elected officials here in the United States,
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:41.120]   but central banks around the world over the last 12 months
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.520]   decided to create trillions of dollars
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:46.200]   and inject it into the monetary system, right?
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.040]   They have arguments,
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.040]   and some of them are very good arguments
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.200]   as to why they should do that.
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.920]   They're trying to mitigate short-term pain,
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.720]   long-term they'll figure out the other issues, right?
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:55.760]   They have very kind of elaborate
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.160]   and well-articulated kind of viewpoint
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.600]   as to why they're doing it,
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.600]   but you and I had no say.
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:03.480]   And so when you start to look at,
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:06.120]   we have a very small group of people in this world,
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:08.280]   both in our country and in countries around the world
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:09.740]   that make these decisions
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:13.280]   that have very, very far-reaching kind of impact.
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:15.320]   And on top of that, in many cases,
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:18.880]   there's actually not that much kind of accountability
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.960]   because usually these are not elected officials
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:22.440]   who are making some of these decisions.
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:23.760]   These are appointed.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:24.600]   And you can argue that,
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.560]   hey, we elected somebody who appointed them,
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:27.960]   but at the same time,
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.560]   that accountability isn't quite there.
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.360]   And so I think ultimately when you just back out,
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.720]   you say, what is Bitcoin,
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.720]   and why is it important to the world?
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.320]   It is giving access to anyone in the world
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:39.400]   with an internet connection
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:41.900]   to a store of value and a monetary network
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:44.080]   that allows them to peacefully protest
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.600]   and to opt out of a system
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:49.320]   that pretty much is not working
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:51.320]   for majority of people in the world.
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:54.000]   - So it's moving the power from these centralized places,
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   sometimes unelected, to the individuals and to the people.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.640]   So the dollar does seem to work for Americans
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:06.120]   and for many people in the world,
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.800]   but you kind of have a vision.
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.600]   You paint a picture of a future
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:12.080]   where potentially we move to cryptocurrency.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:15.460]   So what kind of trajectory do you see
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:19.040]   where Bitcoin can become the main currency in the world,
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.280]   or at least cryptocurrency become the main,
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:23.640]   way of storing value in the world
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.640]   and basically overtake the dollar?
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:28.160]   - Yeah, so I always go first to,
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:30.240]   we don't need to have competition
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:32.240]   in terms of like a direct competition
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:35.480]   between the dollar and Bitcoin, right?
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:38.160]   If you look at most technologies in the world,
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:39.200]   the really valuable ones
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:41.320]   are actually market expanding technologies
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:42.920]   rather than simply just
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.680]   market share stealing technologies, right?
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:47.220]   So if you look at Uber, for example,
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:48.160]   Uber didn't just say,
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.360]   hey, I'm gonna go take out all the taxis, right?
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.920]   It actually drastically expanded the market for people.
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.440]   Now there's literally millions of people
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:55.720]   in the United States who don't have cars
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:57.440]   'cause they use Uber, right?
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:59.320]   And so I think that Bitcoin is very similar
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:03.760]   in that, yes, there is a component of medium of exchange
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:04.940]   in terms of the dollar,
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:06.640]   but also there is this component
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.840]   of just store of value assets in general.
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:11.560]   And so when you start to look at Bitcoin specifically,
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:12.660]   I think that what you're seeing
[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:14.960]   is you're seeing a generational gap
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.520]   where young people say,
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:18.960]   I grew up with a phone in my hand, I'm digitally native.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:22.280]   The whole idea of going to the bank and sending a wire
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.720]   or going to an ATM and getting physical cash
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.760]   is an antiquated idea in their mind, right?
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.040]   I one time asked my brother, he's 24 years old,
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:31.720]   and I said, hey, how do you send money to your friends?
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.440]   And he gave me one answer, which I expected,
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:34.480]   which was Venmo.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.400]   And the second answer I didn't expect, he said, Uber.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:38.840]   I said, how do you send money via Uber?
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:40.160]   He said, well, we get in a car together
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:42.640]   and at the end we split the ride.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:45.360]   And so again, you and I have probably both done that,
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.200]   but I never thought of it
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.600]   as a way to send money to each other.
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:51.560]   And so it is a psychological difference between even me,
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:54.760]   who's only a decade older than him or so,
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.400]   and his peer group.
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.600]   And so I think as we're watching kind of Bitcoin
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:00.440]   continue this ascent,
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:01.760]   ultimately what we're seeing
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:04.080]   is an entire generation of kids are saying,
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:08.000]   listen, if I look at financial assets across the board,
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.760]   I have stocks, I have bonds, I have currencies,
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:11.160]   and I have commodities.
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:15.640]   I know that bonds from a real rate return perspective
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:17.200]   is flat to negative, right?
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:18.520]   I'm gonna make no money on this
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:22.600]   because I have a belief that my dollar is being devalued.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.640]   And actually what we're starting to see is again,
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:27.920]   the internet has broken down these walled gardens
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:31.080]   and kind of these centralized hubs of information
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:34.000]   in that if you were to look at, let's say the stock market,
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   from 1971 to today in dollar terms,
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.520]   it's a 45 degree angle right up into the right, right?
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:42.960]   You know, it's kind of seven, eight, 10% growth every year.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:43.800]   And it's amazing.
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:44.880]   Just get invested in the stock market
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:46.240]   and you'll make money over a long period of time,
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.600]   regardless of the dips along the way.
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:51.200]   If you denominate that same stock market in gold,
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.600]   the stock market is down since 1971.
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:56.560]   And so is it so much that the stock market
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:58.040]   is accruing true value,
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:46:59.720]   or is it that the underlying currency
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:03.360]   in which it is denominated in is being devalued, right?
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:06.200]   And now it's being devalued in a very disciplined way,
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:09.040]   right, in terms of it's not like it went 50% devaluation
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:11.600]   in a short period of time, but it's still being devalued.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.960]   And so I think that people are waking up to this idea
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:16.880]   that a traditional 60/40 type global portfolio
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:18.240]   doesn't work anymore, right?
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:22.640]   40% of it in bonds is just not going to get it done.
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.520]   And so when you start to look at this,
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.280]   people first look at Bitcoin
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.760]   via two main ways in my opinion.
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.280]   They look at it one as a store value.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.400]   Should I actually go and put some of my wealth there,
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.360]   use it as a savings technology, right?
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.480]   We ask people in the traditional world,
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:39.160]   if you're a teacher, a fireman, an accounting,
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:42.240]   you know, mid-level manager, we say, hey, go do your job,
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:43.880]   be the best in class as a fireman,
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:45.040]   or as a teacher.
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:45.880]   And then, oh, by the way,
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:47.360]   you have to be a professional investor as well,
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:49.680]   because if you just put your dollars in your bank account,
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.240]   you're literally going to have your wealth
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.160]   devalued away over time.
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.320]   So you can't just save, you have to invest.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:58.400]   That is a really tall task for people.
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.560]   They have a hard enough time just doing their job right,
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.040]   taking care of their family, right?
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:03.600]   Now they gotta go be an investor.
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.920]   So I think savings technology from a Bitcoin standpoint
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:09.280]   is if you buy Satoshi's or Bitcoin,
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:11.440]   over time it will increase
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:12.640]   from a purchasing power standpoint,
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.520]   because there's a fixed supply and demand continues to rise.
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:17.320]   But then you start to look at, well,
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:20.080]   what other assets do people put in their portfolios?
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:22.600]   Whether it's art, it's real estate,
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.120]   it's precious metals, or something else.
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:28.000]   Most of those assets are not because people actually think
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.600]   that they're gonna go up in value over time,
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:32.800]   they're using them to store value, right?
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.200]   The reason why somebody buys gold
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:36.720]   is 'cause it's a store of value, right, historically.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:40.440]   That's a narrative-driven type asset though, right?
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.040]   We tell people it's scarce.
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:44.680]   We tell people that it is a store of value.
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:45.880]   When you look at it though,
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:47.760]   we don't know how much gold exists in the world.
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.000]   We have a good estimate, right,
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.800]   but we don't actually, we can't prove how much there is.
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.800]   We don't know how much is coming out of the ground every day.
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:57.600]   Again, great, fantastic estimate, but we can't prove it.
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:58.800]   And we don't know what the total supply is.
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.160]   - And that's what you mean by narrative-driven,
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.560]   we can't really prove it, like mathematically.
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:04.120]   - You, I, and everyone else in the world
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:06.160]   has lived in a narrative-driven world
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.240]   for the last couple of decades, right?
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:10.880]   And what the internet and digital technologies have done
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:15.120]   is it opened up the possibility and the desire from people
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:18.880]   to have a world now where I can validate things.
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.160]   So when I see that headline,
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:24.520]   I want to see you say whatever happened in the news,
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:25.840]   if you're the subject of the news,
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:28.120]   rather than have somebody else tell me the story.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.400]   If I see that you say something is scarce,
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:33.040]   prove to me that it is scarce.
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:35.440]   And so I think that's kind of a psychological shift
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.240]   the younger generation is starting to understand
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:39.600]   because ultimately, you and I probably grew up
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.320]   in a world where our parents could tell us a story
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:42.800]   and we just believed it.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.240]   You know, dad or mom says it, it must be true.
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:47.080]   If my brother heard a story, what does he do?
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:49.280]   He goes to Google and he looks it up, right?
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.520]   He comes back and usually tells my parents,
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.080]   oh, you got the story wrong, right?
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:55.840]   And so I think that that provability or that validation
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:57.400]   ends up becoming really, really important.
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:59.160]   And so, you know, look at something like gold.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:02.040]   I think that people are drastically underestimating
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.920]   the shift that's underway right now.
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:08.160]   Gold is one, down in value since April,
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:10.040]   or I'm sorry, August of 2020.
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:13.400]   And so in a timeframe where central banks
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:15.360]   have had historic quantitative easing,
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:17.880]   literally $6 trillion in the United States,
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:19.680]   the one asset that historically has been
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:21.880]   the best store of value and has, you know,
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:24.480]   in 2008 financial crisis hit an all time high
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:26.560]   based on the government response,
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:30.200]   has actually suffered for a main part
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:32.560]   of this financial crisis.
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:34.360]   You then look at central banks around the world
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:36.880]   who have been very large holders of gold for a long time
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:39.200]   and net buyers on a monthly basis.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:42.160]   For multiple months over the last six months,
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:44.760]   they've been net sellers of gold.
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:47.040]   And then you start to look at jewelry demand.
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:50.120]   So the actual non-monetary value of gold
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:54.240]   and that demand for gold jewelry peaked in 2013
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:56.840]   and has continued to fall since.
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:58.000]   And so what you start to say to yourself
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.760]   is take just the asset of gold,
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:02.200]   which about $10 trillion market cap,
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.120]   and you say, okay, well,
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:04.640]   if jewelry demand continues to fall,
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:05.840]   even if it's at a slight rate,
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:07.680]   but it's continues to contract,
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:09.800]   you have central banks that now at sometimes
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.120]   are net sellers and sometimes net buyers, right?
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:14.200]   So, okay, again, contraction there.
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.480]   And then from the investment standpoint,
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:20.160]   the actual price, the daily price of this continues to fall,
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:23.280]   which is a signal that there's a contracting demand
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.000]   from an investment perspective.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.800]   That's 93% of all use of gold.
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:29.920]   Only 7% of it's used for actual technology
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.200]   and metal conduction and things like that.
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:35.440]   And so you have a $10 trillion asset that it appears,
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:38.040]   and again, maybe data changes and I'll change my mind
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:38.880]   and other people change their mind,
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:40.800]   but it appears is on the decline.
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:41.760]   And so if that happens,
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:44.680]   you're gonna get the contraction of a $10 trillion asset.
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:46.760]   Where's all that value go?
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.120]   And what you're seeing is at the same time
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:49.980]   that that asset is contracting,
[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:53.320]   you're also seeing a massive influx
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:55.240]   from not only retail investors,
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:58.160]   not only kind of the wealthy and the elite,
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.920]   but also from financial institutions, corporations,
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:02.480]   pension funds, et cetera,
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:04.600]   into this kind of digital sound money.
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:06.480]   - So you're saying that there's a kind of shift
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:08.760]   from gold to Bitcoin
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:10.480]   because they have a lot of the same properties,
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:12.640]   except one is in the physical space,
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:14.640]   the other is in the digital space.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.600]   So do you see like central banks
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:20.160]   quietly potentially switching out
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:24.360]   from sort of gold to Bitcoin?
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:27.040]   Like naturally it's just doing,
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:29.560]   seeing the pattern that you're referring to now,
[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:31.400]   but more drastically into the future
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:32.840]   where there's a complete shift.
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.720]   - If you line up the gold community
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:36.680]   and the Bitcoin community next to each other,
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:38.240]   they'll agree on all the problems
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:41.120]   that they see in the world, right?
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:42.480]   They'll actually agree on the solution
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:44.900]   that sound money is the solution.
[00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:48.200]   Where they differentiate is the gold communities
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:51.040]   believes that it's the analog application of sound money.
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:53.680]   Right, the physical gold, that is the solution.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:54.800]   The Bitcoin community believes
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.560]   the digital application of sound money.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:58.120]   Bitcoin-- - Can you define sound money
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:52:58.960]   by the way?
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:00.040]   - Sound money is just outside the system
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:01.320]   and no one can create more of it.
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:02.480]   So nobody controls it.
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.160]   - This is scarcity is fundamental.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.000]   - Exactly.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.240]   - Why is scarcity important in money?
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:10.360]   - I think scarcity just has this very high correlation
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:12.720]   to value across all assets, not just money, right?
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:14.640]   Money happens to be the unit of account
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:17.800]   that we use in terms of daily commerce.
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:21.400]   But whether it is, as we're seeing now,
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:24.240]   sneakers, art, whatever it is,
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:27.360]   scarcity ultimately is that signal of value, I think.
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:31.160]   And that's just been the way that humans derive value
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:33.200]   for literally thousands and thousands of years.
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.400]   - Yeah, I gotta say, that's my view on life
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:39.880]   and love in general, is scarcity is what makes it valuable.
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:41.520]   People talk about immortality.
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.400]   I would like to be immortal,
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:48.560]   but it does seem that when you let go
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:50.380]   of the finite-ness of life,
[00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:56.460]   I feel like that meals and the experiences you have
[00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:59.320]   get devalued significantly.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:01.440]   Like the longer you live,
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:06.000]   the less value there are in infinity if you live forever.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.120]   I worry that all the meaning will dissipate.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:10.600]   And the same thing with love,
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:12.640]   a quick criticism of sort of dating culture
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:14.080]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:17.320]   Like I haven't, a shocking revelation
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.800]   that I've never been on a tinder date
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.160]   or any of those things.
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:24.560]   I believe that scarcity in dating and interaction
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:27.280]   is like intensifies the value
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:29.120]   of when the interactions do happen.
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:32.120]   So when love does happen.
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:33.880]   And so in that sense,
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:35.760]   there's something magical about scarcity
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:39.760]   in the more subjective psychological social world as well.
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:42.480]   And perhaps money is just another version of that.
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:45.560]   It's all about the stories and ideas we tell ourselves.
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:47.320]   - I think they're actually more interconnected
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:49.120]   than you're giving it credit for,
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:51.120]   which is what is money?
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.400]   Money is time, ultimately.
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:59.560]   The pursuit of the acquisition of money, right?
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:02.400]   Of whether it's a currency or true money
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:05.720]   is because that should give you more time.
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:08.440]   And so one of my favorite movies ever is,
[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:11.280]   and it's funny because Justin Timberlake is in it,
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:12.840]   is this movie, "In Time." - You lost me.
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:13.840]   (laughing)
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:15.400]   - I lose most people at that part.
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:16.720]   - "In Time." - "In Time."
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:18.200]   And basically the premise of the movie
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:20.080]   is that everyone has a clock
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:21.840]   that's embedded into their arm.
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:24.280]   And so if you go to work,
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:27.120]   you basically put your arm underneath when you leave,
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:29.360]   and there's time that's deposited into your clock.
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:33.000]   And if your clock ever hits all zeros, you're dead.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.440]   You die on the spot.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.920]   And so there's a number of scenes
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:38.560]   where people are basically running to get to you,
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:39.920]   and I give you a little bit more time
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.280]   so that you can get to work on Monday,
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:43.440]   and then you work to acquire time.
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:46.000]   And so basically time becomes this currency.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.880]   But what becomes very fascinating about it
[00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:50.560]   is there are sections in society
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:52.840]   where literally there's physical places.
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:56.200]   If you only have, let's say, 72 hours or less,
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:58.200]   you're allowed to go to section one.
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:00.320]   Section five, though, is 'cause you have years
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:02.680]   and years and years on your clock.
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:05.480]   And in this movie, everyone at the age of 25
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:09.800]   freezes from a biological aging standpoint.
[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:10.920]   So everyone stays the same,
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:13.920]   but you may have lived for 1,000 years.
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:16.280]   And so what becomes so fascinating about it
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:19.080]   is that rich people have time,
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:20.840]   poor people do not have time.
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:22.600]   And so in it, Justin Timberlake,
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:24.760]   the main character, at one point,
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:27.200]   essentially acquires a bunch of time,
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:30.640]   and he's able to go to one of the higher levels.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:32.840]   And now he's attending all of these galas
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:35.040]   and poker nights and all that stuff.
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:37.280]   And one of the first things that he learns
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:40.240]   is that in the lower end of society,
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:43.840]   everyone is running everywhere at all times in the movie
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:46.720]   because time is so finite and it is so scarce.
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:48.920]   And so therefore, why would I walk down the street?
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:50.280]   I must run down the street.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:55.240]   In the highest level of society, no one runs anywhere.
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:59.160]   And in fact, if you run, you are seen as lower class
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:01.800]   because wealth is time.
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:05.000]   And so that movie, it's got a ton of things
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:05.920]   that you can pull out of it,
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:09.720]   but to me, is the perfect epitome of money is time.
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:11.280]   And so when you start to think about
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:14.720]   the acquisition of money,
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:16.280]   it goes to this whole idea of time billionaire.
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:18.680]   And I know that there's probably a lot of people
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:20.240]   who have heard about this already,
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:23.480]   but if you think of a million seconds,
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:28.480]   it's about 11 days, a billion seconds is 31 years.
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:31.520]   And so if I said to somebody,
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:34.800]   "You have to switch lives with Warren Buffett,
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:35.760]   would you do it?"
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:37.840]   Some people would say, "Sure."
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:39.360]   That'd be their initial reaction.
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:42.560]   But you gotta have to be 92 years old.
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:45.520]   Is the money worth the lack of time?
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:46.800]   Most people would say no.
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:48.600]   Right, and there's this guy Graham Duncan
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:51.160]   who really articulated this well.
[00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:53.080]   And ultimately what ends up happening
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:55.360]   is you realize time is more valuable than the money,
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:59.440]   but you acquire the money to gain more time.
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:00.960]   - And the reason it's valuable
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:03.000]   is because of the scarcity of time.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   We currently have the biology, the physics,
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   it means that this is not just the narrative
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.280]   we tell ourselves, it may be this, I don't know,
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:17.960]   but it feels like pretty sure we're mortal.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:21.840]   And in that sense, the scarcity there gives value to time.
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:23.080]   It's fascinating to think about
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:25.000]   all the thought experiments here
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.120]   of if that could actually be in the economy,
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:30.560]   if you could actually convert time
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:33.160]   in a frictionless way to money.
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:35.440]   - Well, and if you start to pull on this a little bit
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:37.360]   and say, "Okay, a young person today,
[00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:39.120]   let's say somebody in their 20s,
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:41.680]   has about 2 billion seconds left in their life, right?
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:46.440]   Kind of 60 years, give or take, based on life expectancy."
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:51.240]   They usually, until they start to understand this concept,
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:55.120]   think of wealth in dollar terms,
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:57.360]   but dollars are being devalued.
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:59.520]   And so, a million dollars doesn't get you
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:00.560]   what it used to get, right?
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:02.560]   It's kind of an old adage.
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:04.720]   And so what you're doing is you're pursuing
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:07.320]   something that ends up losing value.
[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:09.880]   And so it's the constant rat race.
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:11.640]   It's how do I constantly try to get more?
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:12.560]   How do I get more dollars?
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:13.720]   How do I get more dollars?
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:15.560]   Because even if I say to myself,
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:18.640]   I'm gonna retire when I get $100,000,
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:21.240]   when I get the $100,000,
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:22.720]   the $100,000 five years from now
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:24.040]   doesn't buy me what I thought it did.
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:26.920]   So now I need 500,000 or 200,000 or a million
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:28.520]   or whatever the number is.
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:30.720]   And so ultimately what ends up occurring
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:33.400]   is that the Bitcoin community and many people
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:35.680]   in kind of this idea of sound money
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:38.760]   is you want to be able to acquire an asset
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:41.480]   that not only will hold the value, right?
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:43.120]   The store of value over time,
[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:46.520]   but it will actually appreciate over time.
[00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:48.680]   And so when you look at something like Bitcoin
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:51.160]   against the dollar, against other types of assets,
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:54.280]   all of these assets are down compared to Bitcoin, right?
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:56.320]   Now, some of that's just in the early days
[00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:58.360]   of kind of the pricing of an asset,
[00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:01.080]   you go from very small to something much larger.
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.360]   But now what you start to look at is,
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:05.280]   well, if you have a finite supply of something,
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:09.360]   what ends up happening is people begin to value it more.
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:12.840]   And so in a world where dollars are infinite
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:15.360]   and other fiat currencies are infinite,
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:19.480]   Bitcoin becomes very, very interesting, very special,
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.760]   and something that is very aspirational.
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.360]   And so I think that's where you're starting to see people
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.640]   say, wait a second, this is something where
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:30.640]   that finite, secure store of value is essential
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.600]   to wealth generation and preservation
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.200]   over a long period of time.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:37.600]   - And if Sam Harris is right, that free will is an illusion,
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.560]   this is really interesting to think about.
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:43.840]   Maybe time is a kind of blockchain
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.760]   'cause you can't change anything.
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:50.760]   And then the physical space-time of the universe
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:52.200]   is a ledger.
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:57.640]   So maybe it won't be Bitcoin that replaces gold,
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:00.160]   maybe it'll be time.
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.200]   Once we crack open that, in fact,
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.080]   the universe is fully deterministic.
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.600]   So maybe that's what like Eric Weinstein is afraid of
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:10.960]   once you figure out the theories of everything, of physics,
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:14.360]   we'll be able to then start trading,
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:18.560]   create a market out of like the very fabric of reality.
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.040]   And that way break it.
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:23.120]   - Well, if you look at infinite,
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:26.760]   inflationary type currencies, you can't do that, right?
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.960]   Because it constantly is losing value.
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.880]   When you look at a finite asset,
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:33.160]   again, that has the provability
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:36.160]   of the actual finite element to it,
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:40.680]   ultimately the wealth is that marketplace.
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:45.320]   And so, I always kind of try to highlight for people,
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:48.560]   the top 55% of Americans understand something
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:52.440]   that the bottom 45% don't, they invest, right?
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:56.560]   The bottom 45% consume, the top 55% invest.
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:58.920]   And that's why we have a wealth inequality gap
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.540]   and it continues to get wider and wider and wider
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:04.900]   is because the people who are holding the devaluing assets
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:08.240]   and saving are watching their wealth be devalued away.
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.120]   And there's arguments and controversy
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:13.480]   over how fast that's happening, but it's happening.
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.000]   The people who are holding the assets
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.820]   that have any level of scarcity, right?
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:20.160]   Real estate may not be finite, but it's scarce, right?
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.640]   Art may not be finite, but it's scarce.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:25.240]   Gold may not be finite, but it's scarce.
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.880]   Those assets continue to appreciate
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.980]   against the devaluing currency.
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:31.240]   And so when you then say,
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:36.240]   no, I have complete finite supply with provability
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.420]   and this transparency around it,
[01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:40.300]   where everyone knows how much is there
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:42.300]   and where it's going.
[01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:44.620]   Now, all of a sudden, you and I can transact
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:46.700]   back and forth that value.
[01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:48.580]   And it is a representation of time
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:51.020]   because what I can essentially do is if I gather
[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:53.300]   or acquire more of that wealth,
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:56.620]   I then can apply leverage to my life.
[01:02:56.620 --> 01:03:01.620]   I can use machines, humans, or some other resources
[01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:05.440]   and basically now free up my time.
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:08.000]   - Yeah, and it's not fun about the way you are trading time.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.920]   Maybe it's a little bit indirect, but maybe not.
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:15.400]   So just 'cause I brought up Eric and you're on Twitter,
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:17.520]   I'd love to hear your opinions.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.040]   I talk to him a lot.
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:22.480]   He seems to have stepped into the beautiful dance
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:25.040]   of human communication and the social dynamics
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.440]   that is the Bitcoin cryptocurrency community.
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:32.440]   Do you have thoughts on gauge theoretic conceptualization
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:37.720]   of the world or just Eric in general?
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:39.840]   He's got a lot of love in his heart
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:42.340]   and he's got a grace in the way he communicates,
[01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:46.880]   but he's also loves to play with ideas
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:49.120]   and seems to have touched a sensitive point
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:50.080]   with the Bitcoin community.
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:53.240]   Is there anything you could say that's hopeful,
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:57.040]   inspiring about that whole dynamic that went down?
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:59.080]   - So I don't know all of the details,
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:00.640]   but what I will say is I've listened
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:03.880]   to a number of his podcasts and him,
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:06.320]   and there's a whole bunch of people like him.
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:08.000]   I basically put them in the bucket
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.720]   of they're an independent thinker
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:13.520]   who are courageous enough to speak their truth,
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.440]   whatever that may be.
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:19.560]   They are humble enough to revisit their ideas
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.840]   and say, I got this right, I got this wrong,
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:23.800]   information changed, I'll change my mind.
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.640]   It's obviously a sign of intelligence
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.680]   to be able to do that type of stuff.
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:29.320]   And I actually think that one of the most scarce things
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:31.480]   in our society are those independent thinkers
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:33.440]   who are able to do all this, right?
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.720]   - Speaking of scarcity, yeah.
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:37.760]   - And so to me, I put Eric
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.840]   and the whole host of other people,
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:41.560]   if you look at the intellectual dark web
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:44.560]   as kind of a label that's been used,
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.520]   they're actually some of the most important people
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:48.760]   in our society because they're the people
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:50.320]   who are willing to stand up against
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:53.040]   the mass kind of thought process.
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:55.080]   They're willing to talk about things
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:57.240]   that others may think are taboo, right?
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:59.520]   They're willing to change their mind,
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.500]   which all of a sudden has become a bad thing
[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:02.960]   rather than a good thing.
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:07.200]   And so when I see the exploration of ideas in public,
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:09.120]   I actually think that those are the people
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:13.760]   who are most open to the kind of vehement blowback as well,
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.700]   right, because that's part of what they're doing
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:17.360]   is that they're eliciting, hey,
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:19.120]   I'm gonna throw an idea into the arena.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.320]   If it doesn't get attacked,
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:21.800]   they actually may be more nervous
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:24.720]   than if there is some level of kind of war of attrition,
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.760]   if you will.
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.640]   And so what I've seen with a number of the people
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:29.920]   who have done this, everyone from some of the best
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:32.220]   hedge fund managers and kind of money managers in the world,
[01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:33.400]   all the way to what I'll consider
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:36.320]   some of the most intellectual people in the world
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:38.880]   is they play with these ideas
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.360]   and they play with the ideas and they play with them
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:41.200]   and they play with them
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.320]   and they all arrive at the same conclusion.
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:46.560]   And sometimes it takes a month, sometimes it takes years,
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:49.000]   but they arrive at this Bitcoin thesis.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.800]   And what's so interesting about it
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:55.460]   is it highlights something that many people view as a bug,
[01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:57.760]   but I think people in the Bitcoin community view as a feature
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.720]   which is that community.
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:01.440]   And so what ends up happening is
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.960]   when you have something that is as ambitious
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:07.640]   as creating a global reserve currency,
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:09.760]   doesn't mean it needs to unseat any of the existing ones,
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:12.040]   but become the global reserve currency of the internet,
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:15.760]   right, this digital economy, you need shepherds of it.
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:17.440]   And so just like a technology company
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.240]   wants to find those loyal fans
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:22.080]   that are willing to go out and market and word of mouth
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:26.220]   and kind of not only promote it, but also protect it,
[01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:30.120]   this technology that is this decentralized thing,
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:32.400]   which uses a financial incentive
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.920]   in order to elicit the buy-in,
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.080]   not from a financial perspective,
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:38.760]   but from a mental energy standpoint,
[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:42.960]   has built one of the most rabid, powerful,
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:45.760]   and engaged communities on the internet.
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:47.680]   And what ends up happening is
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:50.960]   those people have thought more about these ideas
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:53.580]   and actually challenged those ideas
[01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:55.280]   more than anyone else in the world.
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:58.160]   And so I've got a lot of folks who will just say,
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:01.200]   there's this guy Marty Bent who we'll talk all the time about
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:02.400]   the Bitcoin critics
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:04.460]   haven't done their homework in a lot of cases.
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:05.760]   So they show up and sometimes
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.760]   it's super intellectual, lazy arguments.
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:10.400]   Sometimes it's actually very well thought out arguments
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:12.880]   on the counter to the Bitcoin thesis.
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:14.720]   But ultimately what ends up happening is
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:16.720]   you're talking to somebody who's an expert.
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:17.760]   They've been thinking about this for five,
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.480]   seven, eight, 10 years, right?
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:21.800]   They've gone through every simulation you possibly can.
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:26.040]   And they show up with data examples and responses.
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:28.840]   Now they're not always right, but they've just done the work.
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:32.400]   And so what I actually like about folks like Eric and others
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.460]   is as they're kind of going through this journey,
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:36.240]   they're incredibly smart, right?
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:40.840]   And they provide or they apply a lot of intellectual rigor
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:42.280]   to some of these arguments.
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:43.560]   And so what it does is what does it do?
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:44.480]   It's a marketplace.
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.580]   It keeps people honest.
[01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:46.420]   - Yeah.
[01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:48.800]   So let me sort of make a few comments.
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:49.920]   It's kind of interesting.
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.340]   So you're exactly right.
[01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:54.920]   Maybe the blowback is part of the mechanism
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:57.000]   that actually develops these ideas and so on.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.680]   I do want to kind of speak to a little bit of the toxicity
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.660]   that I've experienced in the Bitcoin community.
[01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:04.940]   I kind of see it, the Bitcoin community,
[01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:06.700]   I think you paint a really nice picture,
[01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:09.520]   which I kind of see it as an immune system
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:13.520]   that protects against sort of the viruses
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:15.240]   that are bad ideas.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:20.400]   That said, the immune system can destroy a body, right?
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:22.840]   And the thing you mentioned about Eric
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.920]   and maybe about myself and in general,
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.780]   just people exploring ideas,
[01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:30.520]   is there is a Dunning-Kruger effect,
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:34.680]   which is when you first start exploring ideas deeply,
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:38.620]   you have an overblown level of confidence
[01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:40.800]   about how much you understand.
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:42.440]   And that's actually the process about learning,
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:44.340]   then you realize you don't understand much.
[01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:46.240]   What I've noticed with the Bitcoin community
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:51.240]   is they're not as patient with the basics
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:52.720]   of the Dunning-Kruger effect.
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:57.720]   If I step in and make declarative statements about Bitcoin,
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:02.800]   I read a long time ago, the white paper,
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:05.200]   at the cursory level,
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:09.340]   I felt that I understand the technology,
[01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:10.940]   this is basic intuitions.
[01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:12.740]   You know, I didn't think about the social dynamics,
[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:15.340]   I didn't think about any financial implications
[01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:16.740]   and a lot of the deep,
[01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:19.860]   actually the ongoing innovations and all that kind of stuff,
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:21.580]   but I thought I understood that technology.
[01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:23.620]   And so I step in and make declarative statements.
[01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:26.260]   I think those are the first time you say,
[01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:28.140]   "Okay, what's the role of Bitcoin in the world?"
[01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:30.140]   You start thinking about it deeply,
[01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:31.760]   and then you make statements.
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:35.740]   The toxicity that you get in those first few statements
[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:37.100]   is really up-putting to me.
[01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:38.980]   I'm somebody that tries to communicate love
[01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:42.260]   and live that with everything I do.
[01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:47.260]   And there is a level of disrespect that I've experienced,
[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:49.020]   not directly, just observing others.
[01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:52.320]   People have been mostly kind to me, and I appreciate that.
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:55.180]   But if you're going to criticize me
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:58.660]   about my exploration of ideas in Bitcoin,
[01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:01.380]   you have to also acknowledge that I'm a human being
[01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:03.680]   that got a PhD in stuff.
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:05.680]   I did some hard shit.
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:08.560]   It could be in farming, or it could be in whatever.
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:10.800]   I've lived life, and I've really thought deeply,
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:11.840]   and I really care.
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.880]   I know a lot of shit.
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:17.640]   And it's possible that I actually have a lot of ideas
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:19.640]   that you can learn from.
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:21.840]   Now, if it's agriculture, fine,
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.560]   or if it's artificial intelligence, fine.
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:27.200]   I know what I'm talking about about certain things,
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.840]   and I could be wrong about a lot of things.
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:30.440]   And there's an exchange of ideas
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:34.400]   that makes that mechanism that you talked about
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.660]   more efficient.
[01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:40.000]   Sometimes when the blowback is too strong too early on,
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.640]   the development of ideas is just inefficient.
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:45.040]   And I'm not sure if there's a,
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:49.820]   the way it was explained to me is that for so long,
[01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:53.980]   that community was bombarded
[01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:56.940]   with just bad ideas, criticisms.
[01:10:56.940 --> 01:11:01.940]   They're just overly sensitive now to bullshit.
[01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:05.360]   They're triggered by statements.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.060]   They've heard it all before, and they're like,
[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:10.460]   "Oh, there they go again with the same old arguments."
[01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:14.340]   But that doesn't mean that you have to, I guess,
[01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:16.020]   develop patience and so on,
[01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:18.580]   especially when you feel, like in my case,
[01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:20.780]   that the person is coming from a good place.
[01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:22.820]   I don't know if there's something you could say
[01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:24.660]   that's positive about the future
[01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:26.780]   of this kind of overcoming this toxicity.
[01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:28.220]   - I think there's a couple of trends
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:30.660]   that are all kind of coalescing here
[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:31.780]   in these types of experiences.
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:33.740]   So one is when you look at a community,
[01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:36.860]   there's always a spectrum in terms of,
[01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:39.460]   there's some people who over-index on kindness
[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:41.140]   and stupidity, and there's some people
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:42.580]   who over-index on intelligence
[01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:44.980]   and basically just being an asshole.
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:46.380]   And then you get everyone in between.
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:48.680]   And so naturally, as we know,
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.940]   the extremist ends of any community
[01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:54.380]   end up being the loudest usually.
[01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:59.380]   The second thing is there is from the outsider view,
[01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:02.580]   like at the beginning of the exploration of ideas,
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:04.700]   it's very much a learning process, right?
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:07.500]   I don't know if I understand this or not,
[01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:09.860]   but here's ideas A, B, and C.
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:12.380]   From the internal perspective,
[01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:14.780]   there's a trillion dollars of value at stake
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:18.020]   and we must protect it with our lives, right?
[01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:20.140]   The truth is probably somewhere in between there, right?
[01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:22.460]   And again, the world's not black and white.
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:24.020]   There's this kind of more gray area
[01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:27.500]   that I think actually is where most people exist.
[01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:29.680]   The other thing that's at play here is,
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:33.220]   I think the Bitcoin community understands the internet
[01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:35.880]   and internet culture and narratives
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:37.300]   better than almost anyone.
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:39.420]   And so you see this with kind of the,
[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:43.140]   the just complete destruction of narratives with memes
[01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:46.260]   and just the visceral reaction
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:48.700]   and the use of things like Reddit and Twitter
[01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:53.700]   and YouTube, podcasts, just areas where I think a lot about
[01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:56.940]   if you are an upstart, right?
[01:12:56.940 --> 01:13:01.220]   And you are gonna go challenge the most well-respected,
[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:05.620]   elite kind of establishment institutions in the world.
[01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:09.100]   If you walk in in a suit and tie and you say,
[01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:12.060]   "I'm here to debate you with ideas,"
[01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:14.500]   you're gonna get your clock cleaned, right?
[01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:16.420]   'Cause they're gonna try to help their lawyers,
[01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:18.340]   their regulators, their lobbyists, right?
[01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:19.540]   Like all this stuff.
[01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:21.880]   If you instead say,
[01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:23.900]   "I'm gonna meme you to death on the internet
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.900]   "and I'm gonna control the public narrative."
[01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:28.100]   - You've shifted the power,
[01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:30.100]   the asymmetry of power is more symmetrical now.
[01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:32.700]   - It's the ultimate insurgency, right?
[01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:34.740]   If you bring it back to the battlefield.
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:35.580]   Yes.
[01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:37.780]   And so when you think about this,
[01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:40.860]   you have to lean into the advantage that you have.
[01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:43.540]   And so what ends up happening is you and I
[01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:47.700]   would absolutely lose it if we saw JP Morgan
[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:50.060]   or Goldman Sachs or the Federal Reserve
[01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:51.960]   start tweeting memes, right?
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:55.820]   It would almost, the validation it would give to the medium
[01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:59.880]   and the even playing field that it would provide
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:03.040]   would pull these establishments down
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:05.380]   to the level of what is this upstart?
[01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:07.760]   But now what you're starting to see
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:09.800]   is that the Bitcoin community,
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:13.920]   even though there's some level of toxicity at times,
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:16.120]   even though there's this visceral reaction,
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:20.180]   sometimes there's even what I would call bullying
[01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:23.220]   or kind of outward projection of things, right?
[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:24.660]   Even though it may be a small percentage,
[01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:26.940]   it'll happen every once in a while.
[01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:30.140]   What they do understand though is that these establishments
[01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:32.040]   are made up of humans.
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:33.140]   And what you can actually do,
[01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:35.980]   one of the best ways to pick apart an institution
[01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:39.660]   is to recruit from inside of them one by one.
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:40.640]   - Yes.
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:42.880]   - And so what you're starting to see now is,
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:45.820]   I get the messages on Twitter and LinkedIn all the time.
[01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:49.300]   Hey, I'm a banker by trade, but I'm a Bitcoiner at heart.
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:50.140]   (laughs)
[01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:50.960]   Right?
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:52.180]   And so what you're doing is you're essentially
[01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:54.460]   infiltrating the organizations,
[01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:58.860]   not in physical population,
[01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:01.980]   but with the ideas and with the philosophies.
[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:04.820]   - Banker in the streets, Bitcoiner in the sheets.
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:07.020]   (laughs)
[01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:07.860]   I like it.
[01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:11.700]   That said, in terms of shit posting and memes,
[01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:15.660]   I gotta say, like bring it on
[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:20.660]   because I believe in terms of asymmetry of power,
[01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:25.020]   I believe in that love will save the world, not memes,
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:30.020]   or at least good vibe memes as opposed to shit posting.
[01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:33.100]   It's an interesting battleground though.
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:35.100]   It's an interesting battleground to think about.
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:37.140]   - The other thing I would say too is,
[01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:40.720]   one of the elements that's always kind of funny to me
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:44.960]   is how much of the entertainment is love, right?
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:47.020]   So when you start to think about how many of the memes
[01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:48.540]   that are posted, for example,
[01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:50.620]   are for outsiders versus insiders.
[01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:51.460]   - Yes.
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:52.740]   - Laser eyes, right?
[01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:55.580]   Which seems absolutely ridiculous, elementary,
[01:15:55.580 --> 01:16:00.100]   and frankly, beneath anyone in any level of power
[01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:01.680]   or influence in the world.
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:05.180]   Somehow has congressmen and senators who have done it.
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:08.540]   They're not trying to convince their colleagues
[01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:11.620]   in elected positions to become Bitcoiners.
[01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:13.140]   They're speaking directly internally
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:14.180]   to the Bitcoin community.
[01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:16.480]   - Yeah, there's some sense in which, yes,
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:21.220]   memes is love, even, I keep hearing Bitcoin is love.
[01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:22.620]   They're trying to convert me.
[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:23.820]   (laughing)
[01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:26.540]   - The one that you have to laugh at, right?
[01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:27.860]   Probably my favorite one out of all of it
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:29.660]   is I've seen on multiple occasions,
[01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:33.500]   Mark Cuban a couple of years ago, Kevin O'Leary,
[01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:36.780]   whoever, wealthy people, billionaires, et cetera.
[01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:38.700]   And you have people on anonymous accounts
[01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:39.820]   who who knows who they are,
[01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:42.260]   telling them have fun staying poor, right?
[01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:43.540]   (laughing)
[01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:46.460]   It's just, again, part of a community,
[01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:48.820]   and I think it's a feature, not a bug.
[01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:51.100]   There's bad aspects to it at times,
[01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:53.140]   but I do think it's a net positive.
[01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:54.580]   - Yeah, just like the immune system.
[01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:55.700]   (laughing)
[01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:57.020]   It does a lot of crappy stuff,
[01:16:57.020 --> 01:17:01.260]   but overall, it's a major net positive.
[01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:03.380]   Maybe this is a bit of a personal question for me,
[01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:04.980]   just out of my own curiosity,
[01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:08.380]   but I've talked to Ray Dalio a few times.
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:10.860]   So Ray Dalio, I think, was one of those people
[01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:15.300]   that took that journey, the Bitcoin journey.
[01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:18.220]   Do you have thoughts about him specifically,
[01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:20.580]   about that whole world, and about the journey,
[01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:23.200]   maybe of others that are going through the same process?
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:26.620]   Because Ray is, at least from my perspective,
[01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:27.780]   I'm a bit of an outsider.
[01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:32.780]   He's one of the most insightful and deep thinkers
[01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:36.100]   about investment, about finance,
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:40.140]   about economics in general, actually about life.
[01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:43.500]   So it's interesting to see him go on that journey.
[01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:44.980]   Do you have something to comment about Ray,
[01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:47.100]   or just those kinds of people in general?
[01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:49.220]   - So if we look at what I'll just consider
[01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:52.220]   the legends of Wall Street in general, right?
[01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:54.740]   There's no denying that they're incredibly intelligent.
[01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:56.300]   There's no denying that actually,
[01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:57.580]   especially in the hedge fund world,
[01:17:57.580 --> 01:18:00.220]   they're some of the most open-minded people
[01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:01.860]   in terms of they're willing to change their mind
[01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:03.660]   when they get new information.
[01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:06.100]   There's no doubt that they are historians
[01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:08.460]   in the sense of having studied financial markets
[01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:10.460]   in cycles over time.
[01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:12.900]   And also, one of the things that I really respect
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:15.140]   about all those guys is almost all of them
[01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:18.260]   are willing to put ideas out via various writings
[01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:21.380]   that they do, and accept the public criticism, right?
[01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:23.500]   Whether it's Howard Marks, Ray, or others,
[01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:25.080]   they will put this stuff out in public.
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:29.020]   And sure, there's a lot of people who are supportive
[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:31.860]   and kind of are part of a fan base, if you will.
[01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:33.100]   But there's a lot of people who also think
[01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:34.700]   that sometimes they say stupid things.
[01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:37.400]   And so putting that out takes kind of courage, right?
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.480]   I think Ray's actually the most fascinating though
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:42.800]   out of all of these kind of legends of Wall Street
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:46.280]   in that he understands debt cycles,
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:47.800]   he understands currencies,
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:51.660]   he, for a while now, has been all over
[01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:55.560]   and famously said, "Cash is trash, investable assets," right?
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:57.880]   He just kind of like just knew all of it.
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:59.200]   And for a long time, Bitcoiners have said,
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:00.920]   "Ray, you understand the Bitcoin argument,
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:01.920]   you're just missing the last part,
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:03.960]   which is Bitcoin's the solution," right?
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:06.560]   And so he was gold and some other ideas.
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:09.400]   But I think that he's a perfect example
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:13.360]   of when you are part of the establishment,
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:15.640]   people view you in a very static way
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:18.920]   as the leader of a part of establishment.
[01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:22.260]   But whether it's Bill Gates, Ray Dalio, or somebody else,
[01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:24.080]   each one of these people were innovators
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.480]   and challengers to a system.
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:27.240]   They were upstarts at one point.
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:28.560]   And so it's kind of this idea that like,
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:31.280]   if you live long enough, you eventually become the man,
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:32.120]   right? - Yeah.
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.640]   - And so Gates is a good example, right?
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:36.160]   Warren Buffett is a good example.
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:37.760]   Ray Dalio is a good example, et cetera.
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:39.920]   And so you have to give credit, I think,
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:43.320]   to Dalio in the sense of he kept an open mind
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:46.440]   about all of this, and more so than many of his peers
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:50.400]   has continued to do the work and come around to this idea.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:52.920]   And now, I don't wanna know if I wanted to say
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:54.600]   that he's a Bitcoin proponent,
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:58.900]   as much as he believes it is one of a portion of assets
[01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:00.560]   that can be a solution.
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:03.040]   And so to me, when you start to convince
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:05.760]   those types of people, when it's Paul Tudor Jones,
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:08.120]   or Stanley Druckenmiller, or Ray Dalio,
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:09.880]   Howard Marks now even writing about it saying,
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:12.440]   "Hey, I was anti-Bitcoin,
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.600]   I didn't put a ton of intellectual rigor into it,
[01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:17.560]   but thank God my son bought a bunch for our family, right?
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:20.680]   And kind of we've had exposure to it."
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:22.840]   I think what it does is more than anything,
[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:24.960]   it's not gonna convince somebody to go and,
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:29.800]   take it seriously or go ahead and make an allocation.
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:32.120]   It reduces career risk.
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:34.400]   And so if all of a sudden when Paul Tudor Jones
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:35.600]   and Stanley Druckenmiller come out and say,
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:38.360]   "Hey, I own Bitcoin and here's why."
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:40.160]   Every other investor on Wall Street now
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:42.120]   can say to an investment committee,
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:44.400]   "Well, it's good enough for Paul Tudor Jones,
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:46.440]   it's good enough for Stanley Druckenmiller."
[01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:48.600]   And so I think that it's very interesting
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:51.320]   'cause Ray doesn't just represent Wall Street.
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:54.360]   I think Ray in some weird way represents
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:57.640]   this like macro economic investor.
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:20:58.960]   And so some of those are in hedge funds
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:02.520]   and some of those people would be like CIOs at organizations,
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.200]   some of them would be at corporations
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:06.720]   and some of them are just kind of retail investors.
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:10.320]   And so you can see this kind of inflection point
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:12.560]   throughout the adoption of Bitcoin, right?
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:14.480]   There was infrastructure that got built,
[01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:16.560]   okay, that kind of led to more adoption.
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:18.920]   There was certain individuals, right?
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:21.840]   Usually they were kind of technology oriented,
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:23.760]   entrepreneurial billionaires.
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.120]   They would buy it and come out and say it,
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:27.440]   "Okay, that led to inflection points."
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.440]   You started to have some of these
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:32.400]   kind of Wall Street legends come out,
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:34.280]   started to have financial institutions,
[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:36.200]   started to now you're seeing corporations
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:37.780]   start to do it, right?
[01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:40.000]   Eventually there's gonna be a central bank that does it.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.600]   And so you kind of walk through that line
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:43.120]   and what you understand is like,
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:44.440]   it's the same thing every time,
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:46.560]   it's just somebody new, right?
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:47.600]   That path, right?
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:50.040]   That Bitcoiners journey, if you will.
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:53.780]   And I think that that is almost the beauty of it
[01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:57.560]   is if you short circuit the journey,
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:00.040]   it's almost like somebody doesn't appreciate it, right?
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:02.600]   If you take, let's say, somebody who's a young kid
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:03.720]   and you just give them a bunch of money
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:05.680]   and they didn't have to work hard for it,
[01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:07.520]   they don't really appreciate it.
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:10.800]   - Well, and Ray actually has a book, "Principles," right?
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:12.320]   And he talks about the hero's journey.
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:14.880]   So he's like living it in some sense
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:19.320]   in terms of thinking about digital currency in general,
[01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:21.840]   like digital finance.
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:24.800]   It's one of the big transitions,
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:28.720]   transformations of our world in some sense.
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:30.020]   It's not just about money.
[01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:32.520]   Or you could argue that money is everything.
[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:34.720]   I mean, it's like, money isn't just
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:36.960]   the narrow definition of money.
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:38.160]   Money is really everything.
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:42.720]   And so where you could argue that sort of cryptocurrency
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:45.800]   is like the base layer of this transformation
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:47.520]   to the digital space and everything else
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:49.960]   would just be built on top of it.
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:52.760]   - I use a different word that I think
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:54.840]   is kind of closer to your world,
[01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:57.720]   which is it's ultimately automation.
[01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:00.040]   And what I mean by that is,
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:03.600]   before 1970 or 1980, all the assets were analog.
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:04.840]   And so when you have analog assets,
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:07.160]   physical stock certificates, physical bonds, right?
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:09.800]   Physical deed to a home,
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:11.600]   you had to physically exchange them.
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:12.520]   - Yeah.
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:16.040]   - When we wanted to increase transactions
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:19.280]   and increase kind of global finance and access,
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:20.720]   we took those physical assets
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.920]   and we created electronic Q-SIP assets.
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:24.680]   So now we have in centralized databases,
[01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:27.400]   kind of a file represents the asset
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:29.120]   that's sitting somewhere in custody.
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:31.080]   And you and I can transact them a little bit easier,
[01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:32.200]   but still centralized.
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:34.400]   There's still some bureaucracy and, you know,
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:35.880]   maybe it takes two days to transact
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:38.520]   rather than actually mailing it across the world.
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:42.200]   Now, what we're seeing is a transition
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:45.280]   from those electronic Q-SIPs to these digital assets.
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:46.640]   And so if you look at, again,
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:49.440]   just let's say money or currency,
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:51.520]   every currency in the world is gonna be digital.
[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:52.720]   You're gonna have a digital dollar,
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:55.280]   a digital Euro, yen, RMB.
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:57.320]   You're gonna have decentralized
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:24:00.520]   kind of open source money like Bitcoin.
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:02.440]   You're also gonna have private currencies
[01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:04.480]   like Facebook's attempt at Diem,
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:07.160]   and there will be others that will try to do this.
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:09.640]   And so when you get everything digital, right?
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:10.880]   And I think that's the kind of the first step
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:12.160]   that everyone focuses on.
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:14.080]   The competition at the technology layer
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:15.360]   essentially goes away.
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:16.880]   You get some level of feature parity.
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:18.000]   And sure, there's bells and whistles
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.720]   on each kind of implementation of a digital currency,
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:21.560]   but at the end of the day,
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:23.720]   the technology is relatively the same.
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:24.680]   And ultimately what it will do
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:28.160]   is it will facilitate the adoption of digital wallets.
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.280]   So you have to have a digital wallet
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:30.840]   regardless of what digital currency you have.
[01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:33.480]   Same with me, same with everybody else in the world.
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:36.680]   But what it does do is when you kind of push away
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:38.400]   and reduce the friction of competition
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.600]   at the technology layer,
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:44.120]   it moves the competition to the monetary policy layer.
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:45.440]   And so when you get to that layer,
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:46.520]   now all of a sudden it becomes interesting
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:48.760]   because all of the currencies are the same
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:50.400]   except for this one right now.
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:52.240]   And maybe there'll be others in the future.
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:53.840]   But for sure, Bitcoin today,
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:55.080]   and people may try to replicate
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:56.360]   in a private manner or something,
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:58.240]   but Bitcoin is kind of the only
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:00.760]   finite scarce digital sum money.
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:04.760]   And so when you then have that pretty big difference
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:06.960]   in that competition at the monetary policy layer,
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:09.840]   it's actually not gonna matter where you get paid.
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:12.600]   And what I mean by that is like you and I
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:15.680]   both live in a single currency environment.
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:17.760]   I get paid in dollars.
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:20.440]   I historically have saved in dollars.
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:23.720]   All of the assets in my life are denominated in dollars.
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:26.240]   And I owe my debts in dollars,
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:28.520]   whether it's taxes or in the private market.
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:31.080]   And I don't have to worry about foreign currencies.
[01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:32.520]   I don't exchange anything.
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:34.160]   The only time I would ever think about another currency
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:35.480]   is if I'm going to another country
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:37.560]   in their single currency environment.
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:42.000]   And in order to change or exchange my currency,
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.600]   I go to the bank or I go get ripped off at the airport.
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:45.440]   (both laughing)
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:46.280]   Like those are my two options.
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:49.360]   So it's high friction to change between currencies.
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:54.360]   When the competition of technology is kind of innovated away,
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:57.120]   now I can get paid in dollars, the digital dollars,
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:58.080]   and with a click of a button,
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:00.360]   switch into any other currency in the world.
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:03.360]   And so what ultimately happens is value and liquidity
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:07.440]   is going to coalesce around the best monetary policy.
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:08.720]   And so you get in this very weird world
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:09.680]   where even if the United States says,
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:11.000]   "Hey, you're gonna get paid in dollars,
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.720]   "you have to pay your taxes in dollars,"
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:14.200]   you're gonna start to see people operate
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:16.100]   in a multi-currency environment where they say,
[01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:17.360]   "Okay, I got paid in my digital dollar.
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:19.200]   "Click a button, I save in Bitcoin.
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:21.800]   "It stays there, protects or grows my purchasing power.
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:22.840]   "Oh, I need to pay my taxes.
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:24.120]   "Let me switch back into dollars
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:26.240]   "with a click of a button and pay."
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:28.760]   When you go to a multi-currency world,
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:32.040]   it's not just about currency, it's now multi-asset world.
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:35.960]   Because not only is the currency digitized,
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:39.120]   but that same technology is used to digitize stocks,
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:41.280]   bonds, and commodities as well.
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:43.760]   And so today we live in a very fragmented financial world
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:45.600]   where basically I have a brokerage account,
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:46.600]   I have a bank account,
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:49.640]   I may have an alternative asset account, et cetera.
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:50.920]   When I can put all of those assets
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:53.040]   in a single digital wallet,
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:55.840]   and I can then go from asset to asset
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:58.320]   without having to go back to a single unit of account.
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:01.600]   - Like frictionless going from asset to asset, yeah.
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:02.900]   - So now what you end up doing
[01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:04.740]   is you start to open up the possibility
[01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:07.100]   for machine to machine transactions.
[01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:10.160]   So today, if you and I write software code
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:12.760]   for two machines to transact with each other,
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:15.120]   they can't transact physical currency,
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:16.960]   and in many cases they can't actually transact
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:19.680]   the electronic Q-SIP currencies or assets either
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:21.400]   'cause there's too long of a settlement time.
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:23.100]   So you can't get true automation, right?
[01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:25.320]   So the whole idea of like the car's gonna drive
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:28.880]   over a strip in the road and it's gonna pay the toll, right?
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:29.800]   Well that can't happen right now
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:32.560]   because literally the transaction won't go through, right?
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:35.520]   And so I always joke that like in an automated world,
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:37.120]   it's like a CD-ROM,
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:39.120]   but we're trying to take cassette tape player assets
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:40.160]   and put it in the CD-ROM.
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:41.560]   It's just incompatible technology.
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:44.840]   - References nobody understands at this point.
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:46.480]   By the way, you need to update your references.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:47.320]   - I probably do.
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:48.140]   It's like taking a CD-ROM
[01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:51.280]   and trying to put an MP3 player into a streaming.
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:52.880]   But I think that the reason why
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:53.720]   that becomes really interesting
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:56.720]   is when you start to create these digital assets,
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:58.840]   now you open up the world of possibilities.
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:00.760]   So when new technology is created, you can do two things.
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:02.260]   You can either create new things
[01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:03.640]   the world's never seen before,
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:05.760]   or you can use it to improve the old world.
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:09.000]   Most people, because it's the easiest thing to think about,
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.280]   wanna improve the old world.
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:12.960]   So an equivalent of this would be
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:14.480]   when the internet came along,
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:16.640]   a media company that had newspapers would say,
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:18.680]   "Hey, we should take a PDF of the newspaper
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:20.200]   and we should put it on a website.
[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:21.880]   And now anyone in the world can go to this website
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:23.760]   and they can read the newspaper today."
[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:24.840]   That was valuable,
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:28.260]   but it missed out on the ability to change headlines,
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:31.600]   to test, to put multimedia, to distribute it differently,
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:33.840]   to do all kinds of things that today
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:36.120]   we understand the internet really empowered.
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:38.000]   And so what I think we're about to watch happen
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.720]   is we're gonna digitize the assets.
[01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:42.640]   We're gonna put them all into these digital wallets.
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:44.600]   You're gonna get automated technologies
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:46.600]   where machines can now transact with each other.
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:48.240]   And we're gonna do simple things.
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:52.180]   Like, why do we pay people once every two weeks?
[01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:55.000]   Why don't we just pay them at the end of every day?
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.780]   Or why don't I literally stream payments to you
[01:28:57.780 --> 01:29:00.480]   on an hour by hour basis based on the work you do?
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:03.480]   It would solve incredible economic issues
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:05.680]   in our country and in countries around the world.
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:08.080]   But historically, businesses can't do this
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:09.680]   because of the technology problem.
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:10.600]   They can't keep track of it all.
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:11.700]   How do they pay everyone every day?
[01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:12.760]   How do they pay everyone every hour?
[01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:14.240]   Like, you just can't do it.
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:15.160]   - Yeah, it's funny.
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:18.320]   The vision of the future you're painting,
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:20.160]   it's kind of an exciting one.
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:23.600]   And it almost makes me sad looking into the future
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:25.120]   when we'll look back at this time.
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:29.320]   It's like, how incredibly inefficient
[01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:31.160]   our financial transactions were,
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:35.200]   like the transaction of value of any kind.
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:37.520]   Like how, like, what to pay each other.
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:39.200]   Like, there has to, like, processes.
[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:42.580]   There's like payroll and all this kind of,
[01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:47.140]   just the entirety of the transactions is just like painful.
[01:29:47.140 --> 01:29:49.580]   Almost all transactions are painful.
[01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:52.060]   And even, and the companies that innovate
[01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:56.340]   to make the transactions a little bit more frictionless,
[01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:58.820]   like Amazon with the one-click purchase button,
[01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:00.140]   like went out huge.
[01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:02.220]   But even that's really painful.
[01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:03.600]   There's actually a really interesting,
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.180]   especially then you start to move that
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:06.880]   into the space of data.
[01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:09.140]   There's a lot of people thinking about privacy and data
[01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:10.200]   and like, can we put,
[01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:15.900]   can we like convert data into like money
[01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:18.500]   so that you can pay for how much you reveal
[01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:20.640]   to the companies about your own private data
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:24.340]   that can then be used to assign value to you.
[01:30:24.340 --> 01:30:26.020]   So you can use the service for free
[01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:27.300]   if you hand over the data,
[01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:30.040]   but there's like explicit transaction going on.
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:32.860]   So you can empower all those kinds of things
[01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:36.500]   that will just like fundamentally change our world.
[01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:38.100]   That's really, really, really exciting.
[01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:40.540]   - One of the most interesting things to me
[01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:42.540]   is I invested in a company called Bridget.
[01:30:42.540 --> 01:30:45.540]   And what they told me was they said $8 billion
[01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:50.440]   was paid to the top four banks last year on overdraft fees.
[01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:53.140]   So literally they took $8 billion
[01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:56.180]   from people who didn't have money in their bank account.
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:57.860]   And so when you dig into why is that,
[01:30:57.860 --> 01:31:00.620]   a lot of times it's not that the people don't have the money,
[01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:03.500]   it's actually a mismatch of the payments.
[01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:04.900]   So what ends up happening is you get paid
[01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:06.060]   on the 1st and the 15th,
[01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:08.380]   but on the 12th, your Netflix bill hits,
[01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:10.620]   on the 13th, you went grocery shopping,
[01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:13.540]   and on the 14th, your car payments hit, you overdraft,
[01:31:13.540 --> 01:31:14.940]   and then on the 15th, you actually get the check,
[01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:16.460]   and then you're able to pay not only the overdraft,
[01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:19.020]   but for the expenses that you have.
[01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:21.220]   And so something as simple as just getting paid
[01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:22.540]   at the end of every day,
[01:31:22.540 --> 01:31:25.580]   immediately would eliminate some big percentage
[01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:27.860]   of those $8 billion of value that flows
[01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:30.420]   to large institutions on overdraft fees.
[01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:31.740]   - Yeah, and also, I mean,
[01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:34.340]   this whole process with overdraft fees,
[01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:36.740]   and just many of the financial transactions
[01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:38.420]   we have to live through today,
[01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:42.620]   forces many of us to be like accountants,
[01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:45.980]   like to understand the different mechanism
[01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:48.340]   of financial movement of money,
[01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:49.620]   as opposed to you,
[01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:51.580]   which is what we wanna do as human beings,
[01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:56.580]   operating in higher layers of providing services for others,
[01:31:56.580 --> 01:31:59.020]   of following your passions,
[01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:02.020]   and working for others, doing cool shit,
[01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:06.220]   or basically providing value,
[01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:07.660]   exchanging value in the world,
[01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:09.420]   and not thinking about the money.
[01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:11.180]   The money takes care of itself,
[01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:12.620]   and then you see the results of it.
[01:32:12.620 --> 01:32:17.620]   So you're able to think in terms of money,
[01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:23.140]   but not have to know how the accounting works.
[01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:25.620]   - Automation simply frees humans up
[01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:26.860]   to do more creative work.
[01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:28.500]   - Yeah, yeah. - Right?
[01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:29.860]   Like that's it.
[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:30.900]   And what we-- - Which is why
[01:32:30.900 --> 01:32:33.620]   you use the term automation,
[01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:35.420]   which I think is kind of brilliant,
[01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:36.860]   reframing of all of this.
[01:32:36.860 --> 01:32:38.260]   - Yeah, 'cause ultimately,
[01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:41.100]   digital technologies are merely the conduit
[01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:43.060]   to usher us into that world.
[01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:46.180]   And I think the most fascinating part
[01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:48.500]   of this entire industry
[01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:52.180]   is people who are trying to figure out,
[01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:54.580]   now that we're gonna have these digital technologies,
[01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:57.860]   how do we usher in that automated world faster?
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:32:59.460]   And so there's people who are building
[01:32:59.460 --> 01:33:01.260]   all kinds of incredible things, right?
[01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:04.500]   There's literally some technologies
[01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:07.900]   where you can stream for paying
[01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:09.420]   for consumption of content.
[01:33:09.420 --> 01:33:11.060]   - Yeah. - Right?
[01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:13.340]   I saw somebody recently who they basically said,
[01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:16.060]   "Hey, I have created something,
[01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:17.540]   "but it's not gonna be released
[01:33:17.540 --> 01:33:18.980]   "until everyone,"
[01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:21.740]   in almost like a GoFundMe type situation,
[01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:24.700]   "pays for it in combination, then it gets unlocked."
[01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:26.060]   And so when you start to think about this,
[01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:28.380]   it's not only innovation on the technology front,
[01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:32.740]   it's innovation around the way that we form capital,
[01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:35.460]   it's the way that we organize resources,
[01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:36.860]   it's the way that we build companies,
[01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:38.380]   it's the business models, right?
[01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:40.660]   It's the application of those technologies.
[01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:42.540]   All that stuff starts to change.
[01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:46.220]   And go back to 2007,
[01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:48.500]   it's when the iPhone came out.
[01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:49.820]   Uber wasn't possible.
[01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:50.740]   Right, I mean, just go down the line.
[01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:53.620]   Like all these companies that weren't possible before,
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:55.100]   when the digital technologies
[01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:57.220]   are kind of adopted on a global scale,
[01:33:57.220 --> 01:33:59.100]   I think that we all, myself included,
[01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:02.180]   drastically underestimate how fast
[01:34:02.180 --> 01:34:04.700]   and how big innovation can be,
[01:34:04.700 --> 01:34:06.140]   'cause it's just hard, right?
[01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:07.420]   Like we like to think linearly
[01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:08.620]   and that's not how the world works.
[01:34:08.620 --> 01:34:12.580]   - Yeah, I do find it kind of interesting.
[01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:16.100]   It is NFT-based, but I don't think it has to be.
[01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:18.140]   (laughs)
[01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:22.560]   This idea of, I think, BitClout, it's called, or whatever.
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:25.140]   The idea of sort of investing in individuals,
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:29.860]   it makes me immediately think about investing in ideas.
[01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:32.960]   So even just the words you speak having value.
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:37.140]   And sort of, if you have a frictionless,
[01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:41.020]   like automated financial system,
[01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:42.960]   then you could do a bunch of interesting things
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:46.420]   about what it means to add value to the world.
[01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:49.380]   I mean, I don't know if BitClout
[01:34:49.380 --> 01:34:52.260]   is currently an efficient representation of that,
[01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:56.160]   but I am truly happy that,
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:59.580]   however that thing works,
[01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:02.820]   I'm just one notch above Vladimir Putin,
[01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:03.780]   which is one of the,
[01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:06.100]   that's like one of the bucket list items for me,
[01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:09.460]   to have a list where I'm one notch above Putin.
[01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:11.380]   - What I think you're talking about here is important
[01:35:11.380 --> 01:35:14.580]   because there's historical examples.
[01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:18.020]   You could invest in a patent in some situations.
[01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:21.380]   You could invest in an organization that has an idea, right?
[01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:23.100]   So these are super inefficient,
[01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:25.060]   given kind of the vision that you're painting
[01:35:25.060 --> 01:35:26.700]   in terms of like investing directly in an idea
[01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:29.040]   in a super efficient automated fashion.
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:31.980]   But that's how the technology evolution works, right?
[01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:34.300]   Is it's really hard to do at first,
[01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:36.340]   and then it slowly kind of becomes easier and easier
[01:35:36.340 --> 01:35:39.040]   as technology is more prevalent.
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:40.260]   The other thing that I think is interesting
[01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:42.300]   is this whole idea of investing in people.
[01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:45.020]   If you really think about the origination of that
[01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:47.820]   is I would hire somebody, right?
[01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:48.820]   I pay you money,
[01:35:48.820 --> 01:35:50.420]   and then you're gonna create production,
[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:53.180]   but I take the lion's share and you don't.
[01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:55.700]   Now there's things like these ISAs,
[01:35:55.700 --> 01:35:57.300]   these income sharing agreements,
[01:35:57.300 --> 01:35:59.780]   where basically I will educate you on something,
[01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:01.140]   train you on something.
[01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:03.340]   I'll put up capital, right?
[01:36:03.340 --> 01:36:05.020]   And then over time you'll pay me back
[01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:08.120]   plus profits as some version.
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:10.500]   Eventually, I don't know what it looks like,
[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:15.220]   but being able to get upside in somebody's success
[01:36:15.220 --> 01:36:17.260]   for having risk capital early on,
[01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:18.980]   doesn't seem that far off.
[01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:20.260]   You see it in professional sports,
[01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:21.780]   you see it in a lot of these things.
[01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:25.940]   And so I just think that a lot of the focus right now
[01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:28.100]   is on the technology,
[01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:32.180]   but ultimately these are ideas that are very old
[01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:34.260]   and have had lots of success and traction,
[01:36:34.260 --> 01:36:36.000]   and we're just merely standing in the way
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.220]   of the evolution of these ideas with new technology.
[01:36:39.220 --> 01:36:42.620]   And so it's easy to get caught up in the technology,
[01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:43.820]   but when you really zoom out
[01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:46.100]   and look at it from the ideological standpoint
[01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:48.500]   and kind of the progress of humanity,
[01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:50.900]   it's a foregone conclusion this stuff's gonna happen,
[01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:51.820]   which is how?
[01:36:51.820 --> 01:36:53.060]   - I think the world is waiting
[01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:56.620]   and some of us are trying to create that future world,
[01:36:56.620 --> 01:36:59.400]   which is like, what are the applications of this technology
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:01.100]   that will transform the world?
[01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:04.420]   And then, I hate the term, but killer apps,
[01:37:04.420 --> 01:37:09.180]   like cool ideas that are implemented effectively at scale
[01:37:09.180 --> 01:37:10.220]   that transform the world.
[01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:14.900]   And there's been a lot of different ideas popping up.
[01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:17.600]   Like there's a lot of ideas about social networks
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:19.220]   that are built on top of the technology
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:20.740]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:23.420]   So, but let me actually drag us back down
[01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:24.700]   to something basic.
[01:37:24.700 --> 01:37:29.700]   If a person wanted to buy Bitcoin, store Bitcoin,
[01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:34.020]   how do they actually do it?
[01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:36.420]   - Yeah, so there's a couple of different ways
[01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:38.620]   to kind of acquire Bitcoin.
[01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:41.220]   And in every way you've got to exchange
[01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:43.500]   some form of value for Bitcoin, right?
[01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:45.300]   Which is part of why it has value
[01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:46.560]   'cause you're giving up value.
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:51.560]   So, in one way is to exchange energy
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:54.900]   and computational power for Bitcoin.
[01:37:54.900 --> 01:37:56.060]   So you can mine it.
[01:37:56.060 --> 01:37:58.720]   You can literally take a computer power that you have,
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:02.940]   you can rent it to the network and run that software
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:05.180]   and then it will pay you a portion
[01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:08.500]   of the kind of daily revenue off that system.
[01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:11.340]   And you can acquire Bitcoin in exchange for your power
[01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:14.060]   and your computational kind of contribution.
[01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:16.180]   - And that's the fundamental principle behind Bitcoin
[01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:17.660]   is the proof of work.
[01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:21.780]   So I got a hundred bucks, like I use Cash App.
[01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:27.440]   There's Coinbase, there's all these exchanges.
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:32.440]   Like how do I convert my a hundred dollars to Bitcoin?
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:34.540]   Is there something, disclaimer,
[01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:36.420]   this is not financial advice.
[01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:39.780]   And this is just us talking and just your opinions.
[01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:41.620]   This do not use this to invest
[01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:44.880]   or take as financial expertise.
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:49.660]   That said, is there something you recommend
[01:38:49.660 --> 01:38:52.380]   that's an easy entry point for somebody that's like,
[01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:55.300]   hmm, I wonder if I can convert this hundred dollars
[01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:57.780]   into whatever amount of Bitcoin.
[01:38:57.780 --> 01:38:58.620]   What do you recommend?
[01:38:58.620 --> 01:38:59.900]   What are the options?
[01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:01.100]   - So there's a lot of options.
[01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:02.540]   I'm heavily biased.
[01:39:02.540 --> 01:39:04.980]   I went out and I scoured the market, looked at all of them.
[01:39:04.980 --> 01:39:07.100]   I've invested a lot of money in a company called BlockFi
[01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:10.740]   that basically has financial products for crypto investors.
[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:12.740]   So you can go, you can take dollars
[01:39:12.740 --> 01:39:14.220]   or other currency you have,
[01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:16.480]   you can convert it through an exchange.
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:19.140]   You can leave it on these interest bearing accounts.
[01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:20.560]   You can earn interest just like you would earn
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:21.840]   in a traditional account,
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:25.060]   but higher levels of interest 'cause it's this new thing.
[01:39:25.060 --> 01:39:28.460]   Or you can withdraw it and you can put it into cold storage
[01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:29.520]   on a hardware device.
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:30.700]   You can leave it in a software wallet.
[01:39:30.700 --> 01:39:32.680]   There's kind of all these storage options.
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:35.120]   So BlockFi is kind of the one that I'm biased towards
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:36.440]   because I- - So BlockFi,
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:37.360]   sorry to interrupt.
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:41.240]   So BlockFi is Bitcoin only,
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:42.920]   or is it an exchange with other cryptocurrencies?
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:44.200]   - It's got a bunch of different ones, yeah.
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:47.600]   They basically are agnostic to what it is,
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:50.440]   but they provide kind of financial products
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:51.680]   to crypto investors.
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:54.160]   - Okay, so you mentioned a few interesting ideas
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:58.120]   that'd be nice for people who would not be familiar with it.
[01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:00.980]   Cold storage, hot storage, what does that mean?
[01:40:00.980 --> 01:40:05.980]   So like I go to a website and I convert dollars to Bitcoin.
[01:40:05.980 --> 01:40:07.880]   That's a kind of storage.
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:10.560]   That's like online banking, right?
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:13.160]   What else is there?
[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:14.480]   - So there's a couple of different things
[01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:15.360]   that you can do, right?
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:17.880]   And let's use the legacy system as kind of an example.
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:22.200]   So if I want to get currency
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:25.200]   and I put it in my bank account, it sits there.
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:28.040]   I have to trust that the bank doesn't go under,
[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:30.060]   nobody steals it, all this kind of stuff.
[01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:31.600]   There's insurance for it, right?
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:34.120]   There's all these kinds of benefits in the legacy system
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:35.560]   to make sure that as long as I don't have,
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:37.040]   you know, millions and millions of dollars there,
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:39.680]   I'm gonna be protected pretty much if anything happens
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:40.920]   through FDIC insurance.
[01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:43.940]   If I want to do that,
[01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:45.880]   I'm taking that counterparty risk though.
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:47.820]   So it's mitigated, but there's still counterparty risk.
[01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:49.240]   I'm counting on that bank.
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:50.860]   But it is easier to move it around, right?
[01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:51.980]   If all of a sudden you call me up and say,
[01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:52.800]   "Hey, send me some money."
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:54.780]   I can press a couple of buttons on my computer
[01:40:54.780 --> 01:40:56.420]   and it'll send it to you.
[01:40:56.420 --> 01:40:58.740]   If I want deeper level of security,
[01:40:58.740 --> 01:41:01.700]   I can go and I can get the physical dollars
[01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:04.620]   and I can go and I can, you know, put it under my mattress.
[01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:05.460]   Right?
[01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:06.460]   And I can say, "You know what?
[01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:08.920]   It's not gonna be as easy to send it to you immediately,
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:09.860]   but if I really want to,
[01:41:09.860 --> 01:41:11.860]   I can go underneath my mattress pretty quickly.
[01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:12.700]   I can grab it.
[01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:13.980]   I can get it back to the bank
[01:41:13.980 --> 01:41:16.020]   and then I can send you the money."
[01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:17.340]   The third thing I could do is I could basically
[01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:19.300]   take those physical dollars out of the bank
[01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:21.800]   and then I could go and I could go put it literally,
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:23.080]   you know, in a vault somewhere
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:24.380]   that I don't have control over
[01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:27.580]   that's behind 10 passwords and biometric scanning.
[01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:29.500]   And like, it's really difficult to even get to it.
[01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:30.340]   Right?
[01:41:30.340 --> 01:41:31.460]   So if you can almost look at it as like,
[01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:33.600]   there's three stages of security
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:35.340]   that you could have in the traditional world.
[01:41:35.340 --> 01:41:36.740]   The same thing is true in Bitcoin.
[01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:38.620]   So you could buy Bitcoin on any exchange.
[01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:39.460]   You can do it on BlockFi,
[01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:41.180]   but you also can do it on places like Coinbase,
[01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:42.980]   Gemini, Kraken, et cetera.
[01:41:42.980 --> 01:41:45.140]   - Also Cash App.
[01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:46.100]   - Cash App.
[01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:46.940]   You can do it on Cash App.
[01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:49.820]   - I think they're still sponsoring this podcast.
[01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:50.820]   (laughing)
[01:41:50.820 --> 01:41:52.220]   I'm not biased at all.
[01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:56.220]   - So once you get Bitcoin on any of these venues,
[01:41:56.220 --> 01:41:58.940]   you can leave it there on that venue.
[01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:02.500]   Now, the trade-off is you're taking counterparty risk.
[01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:05.020]   So somebody else is responsible for the security
[01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:06.700]   and the protection of it.
[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:09.240]   In many cases, big, well-known companies
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:11.320]   who have billions and billions of dollars of assets,
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:12.680]   they have higher levels of security.
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:13.800]   That's why they're well-known.
[01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:14.880]   That's why people trust them, whatever.
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:17.360]   But you are taking counterparty risk.
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:19.440]   It is easier to quickly send to somebody.
[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:22.240]   So the trade-off of like ease of use,
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:23.440]   but counterparty risk is big.
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:25.360]   And in the Bitcoin community specifically,
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:27.400]   there's a huge thing of,
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:28.560]   they really, really advocate
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:30.720]   for not leaving the Bitcoin there.
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:31.560]   Right?
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:32.860]   For the obvious counterparty.
[01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:33.760]   The second thing you can do
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:36.600]   is you can basically get it off of an exchange
[01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:38.400]   and you can put it in some level
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:40.840]   of kind of what I'll call a second layer of storage.
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:43.080]   That second layer of storage could be a hardware device
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:45.120]   that you can quickly just grab off your desk
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:47.200]   and plug into your computer and immediately use.
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:48.640]   - That's what they call like a hardware wallet.
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:49.680]   - Hardware wallet, yep.
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:51.760]   Or you can have some sort of software wallet, right?
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:53.280]   Where it's not on an exchange,
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:55.680]   but there is some level of in between,
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:56.760]   between the hardware wallet
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:58.720]   and the exchange and the software wallet.
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:00.920]   - But the software wallet is connected to the internet.
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:01.760]   - Yeah.
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:04.760]   And so if you kind of think of it as like the exchange,
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:06.760]   software wallet, hardware wallet,
[01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:08.680]   and then there's something called deep storage, right?
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:09.800]   Or cold storage.
[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:11.160]   And this is, you know,
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:14.640]   literally there was a company called Zappo
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:17.480]   that would put things in deep cold storage
[01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:19.800]   and it was literally buried in a mountain.
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:23.760]   So like the odds that somebody's physically gonna go there,
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:25.280]   there's armed guards, there's, you know,
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:27.080]   kind of all of this type of stuff.
[01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:29.040]   But again, you're taking some level of counterparty risk
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:30.720]   because they have your Bitcoin.
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:34.760]   And so the saying or the phrase is not your keys,
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:36.320]   not your coins.
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:38.720]   Or as my buddy, Isaiah Jackson came up with,
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:42.360]   he said, not your keys, not your cheese, right?
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:45.960]   In terms of sovereignty is important, right?
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:47.080]   And ultimately this goes back
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:48.360]   to kind of the beginning of our conversation
[01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:51.760]   around Bitcoin's ethos, sovereignty, right?
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:53.400]   Giving the power back to people.
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:56.200]   You don't have to rely on this infrastructure
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:58.000]   in order to be able to participate
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.440]   in this monetary kind of economy.
[01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:01.520]   What you are now able to do
[01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:04.120]   is you're able to use digital sound money.
[01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:05.560]   You're able to keep control of it.
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:07.800]   You and you alone are responsible for it.
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:09.880]   So the idea of personal responsibility.
[01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:12.600]   And then also you and you alone make the decisions
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:14.520]   as to whether you hold onto it
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:16.920]   or you use it without censorship, right?
[01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:18.400]   No one can tell you what you can do with it
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:19.240]   or can't do with it.
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:23.040]   And so the purchase and the storage,
[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:26.480]   what I find is depending on who you are,
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:30.680]   there's varying degrees of kind of concern
[01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:32.480]   or decisions that get made there.
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:35.080]   And a lot of it comes down to personal preference.
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:36.080]   The Bitcoin community though,
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:39.720]   absolutely will over-optimize for sovereignty
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:42.440]   and kind of hardware or cold storage.
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:44.640]   - I wonder if you can sort of comment on that,
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:49.560]   'cause you have both sort of a cash app
[01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:51.560]   and a BlockFi and Coinbase.
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:54.120]   Like you can store it there,
[01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:56.200]   you can purchase and trade it there
[01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:57.880]   and store it there and so on.
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:44:59.760]   But ultimately they're saying,
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:01.840]   you wanna keep some of it there,
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:04.600]   but you wanna move it to the hardware wallet.
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:07.320]   And the cold storage of the hardware wallet
[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:09.360]   is like you can disconnect it from the computer
[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:12.960]   because ultimately stuff that's connected to the internet
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:16.320]   can be compromised, can be controlled by governments
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:18.040]   and other parties and so on.
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:21.560]   What are your thoughts about sort of practically speaking
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:25.480]   for maybe like a regular citizen,
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:28.200]   what should be the role of the hardware wallet
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:29.280]   in their lives?
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:30.840]   - Yeah, so at the highest level,
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:33.480]   I just think that like learning about it is important, right?
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:36.840]   So even if you only have $5 equivalent of Bitcoin,
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:39.000]   going and understanding here's how it works,
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.040]   here's why it's important,
[01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:42.840]   here's how I would actually withdraw from an exchange
[01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:43.680]   under the hardware wallet,
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:46.480]   like that alone just as an intellectual exercise
[01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:47.440]   is a worthwhile pursuit.
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:48.640]   I think people should go do that.
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:50.440]   - Actually go through the process of the steps
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:52.800]   so you feel like you can do it, yeah.
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:54.520]   - Yeah, it's kind of like if I said to you,
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:56.200]   hey, we're gonna go buy an asset
[01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:57.480]   and you never went and you looked at it,
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:59.720]   you never went and made a decision like,
[01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:01.640]   sure, maybe I did or I didn't do it,
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:03.680]   but like you didn't actually experience it, right?
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:05.480]   And so I think that that's an important part.
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:08.200]   The second thing is each person is different
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:10.560]   from how they view this asset.
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:12.400]   So there are some people who are speculating, right?
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:13.720]   There's three use cases for Bitcoin.
[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:16.600]   There's store value, medium of exchange and speculation.
[01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:17.880]   And the people who are speculating,
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:19.680]   they can't put it in deep cold storage
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:21.880]   because they need to be able to trade it.
[01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:24.480]   So what ends up happening is they fall in the bucket
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:26.400]   of like high risk, high reward.
[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:27.760]   They're trying to trade,
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:29.080]   they're trying to do all these things
[01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:31.040]   and sure, maybe there are profits that they can generate
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:32.080]   if they're good at it,
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:34.600]   but also they're introducing a lot of risk.
[01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:35.920]   And so that person is very different
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:38.160]   than the person who says, hey, I bought one Bitcoin
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:40.320]   and I'm gonna save it for my child, right?
[01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:42.640]   And I'm gonna give it to them on their 18th birthday.
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:44.280]   And so when you start to look at this,
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:46.200]   what you end up saying is,
[01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:48.760]   what are you actually purchasing this for?
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:50.440]   Kind of like, why are you doing it?
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:52.520]   And then what's your time horizon?
[01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:55.520]   And what ends up happening is more and more people
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:57.640]   in the Bitcoin community have longer time horizons.
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:47:00.560]   One of the advantages to this community, right?
[01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:02.320]   If you look at the on-chain metrics,
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:05.760]   60% of Bitcoin haven't moved from the digital wallet
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:08.440]   in which they sit in the last 12 months.
[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:10.720]   So even though it's appreciated hundreds of percent
[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:12.840]   on the upside, there's been lots of volatility,
[01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:16.640]   a 50% drop in a single day in terms of the US dollar price,
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:17.760]   still doesn't move.
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:19.600]   And so these are the kind of long-term holders, right?
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:22.360]   These are the iron fist or as recently
[01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:24.640]   it's become popular, the diamond hands, right?
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:25.760]   - Diamond hands.
[01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:27.800]   - They're just, they're not going anywhere.
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:31.360]   And so I think that those people are much more likely
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:35.520]   to not have their Bitcoin on exchanges or in software walls.
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:39.040]   They've got it in some sort of like highly secure environment
[01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:42.040]   and one in which they have deep sovereignty
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:44.880]   or kind of a prevalent sovereignty.
[01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:47.000]   And the reason for that is because they have
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.120]   that long time horizon.
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:52.760]   They don't want to be kind of convicted around Bitcoin,
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:55.800]   sound money, macro environment, all this stuff.
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:58.280]   And then they make a mistake because they trusted,
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:01.640]   ABCD company and that counterparty risk
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:04.920]   that ends up actually being fatal or detrimental.
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:09.380]   - So again, this is not financial advice disclaimer,
[01:48:09.380 --> 01:48:14.380]   but let me ask, in terms of investment advice on Bitcoin,
[01:48:14.380 --> 01:48:17.640]   so you see Bitcoin as potentially not just the thing
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:20.480]   that you speculate over like buy and sell,
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:22.140]   buy and sell, buy and sell,
[01:48:22.140 --> 01:48:24.600]   but it's something that you can just buy only.
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:28.960]   I believe I've heard that you own quite a large percentage
[01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:33.840]   of your wealth in Bitcoin and you're basically buying only
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:35.000]   and storing long-term.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.520]   So that's something that's a legitimate way
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:40.200]   to approach Bitcoin in your recommendation.
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:41.160]   - Go to other cultures.
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:44.400]   So if we remove ourselves from the Western world culture
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:47.840]   of investing in gamification of financial markets
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:49.820]   and the financialization of everything,
[01:48:49.820 --> 01:48:52.360]   let's say we go to the culture of India.
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:55.440]   For hundreds, if not thousands of years,
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:59.320]   families basically saved their wealth in gold
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:02.220]   and in jewelry and in these hard assets
[01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:06.520]   with the expectation to pass it on to the next generation.
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:10.960]   And so it would be blasphemous to sell the family's gold
[01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:12.520]   in that culture.
[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:14.600]   Your great-grandfather gave it to your grandfather,
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:15.720]   your grandfather gave it to your father,
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:17.660]   your father gave it to you.
[01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:22.660]   And so in that culture, the long-term kind of holding
[01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:24.940]   is the default.
[01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:28.860]   I think that what Bitcoin has presented again
[01:49:28.860 --> 01:49:32.460]   is a digital application of the exact same thing,
[01:49:32.460 --> 01:49:34.380]   which is that while everything else in the world
[01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:38.540]   is being devalued, that is denominated in a currency
[01:49:38.540 --> 01:49:42.580]   that is being inflated away, whether it's quickly or not,
[01:49:42.580 --> 01:49:46.180]   this finite supply, this scarce asset ends up accruing
[01:49:46.180 --> 01:49:48.260]   more and more value over time.
[01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:52.060]   And so I think that for me personally,
[01:49:52.060 --> 01:49:55.380]   I've got over 95% of my net worth that's in this.
[01:49:55.380 --> 01:49:59.500]   - Over 95% of your net worth.
[01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:01.940]   - There's two important caveats to this.
[01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:06.940]   One is I didn't buy some Bitcoin in 2011 or '12, right?
[01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:09.340]   And then all of a sudden it appreciated a bunch
[01:50:09.340 --> 01:50:12.860]   and it grew into that, but from a cost basis perspective,
[01:50:12.860 --> 01:50:15.660]   I put $100 and now it's a ton of money.
[01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:19.100]   Instead, what I did was I basically in 2018
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.760]   saw Bitcoin from a US dollar price standpoint
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:24.400]   was falling and falling and falling.
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:25.840]   And in December of 2018, I said,
[01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:28.880]   take about 50% of my net worth and convert it
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:31.600]   from dollar denominated assets into Bitcoin.
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:33.200]   So it was a very kind of intentional decision
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:34.640]   with a very specific view on the world
[01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:36.920]   as to like why I was doing it.
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:40.440]   I then essentially just let it sit there, grow, whatever,
[01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:43.800]   until the spring of 2020.
[01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:46.360]   And when I saw the government step in and start to say,
[01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:48.780]   hey, we're going to really be aggressive
[01:50:48.780 --> 01:50:50.280]   in terms of interest rate manipulation
[01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:51.560]   and quantitative easing,
[01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:54.440]   I then decided to go ahead and take basically the remainder
[01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:56.000]   and start to convert it as well.
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.080]   And so it became very aggressive in doing that.
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:00.200]   And so the way that I look at it
[01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:03.000]   is that's actually my savings, right?
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.080]   And so in some weird way, if I said to you,
[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:06.080]   what's the dollar worth?
[01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:09.600]   You'd say, well, a $1 bill is worth $1, right?
[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:12.400]   Bitcoin to me, I denominate my wealth in Bitcoin.
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:14.960]   So I think of one Bitcoin is worth one Bitcoin,
[01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:18.360]   not one Bitcoin is worth 60,000 or 55,000 or 70,000, right?
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:19.600]   I denominate everything in Bitcoin.
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:21.680]   When I make a purchase in my head,
[01:51:21.680 --> 01:51:24.360]   I'm calculating how much Bitcoin am I spending right now?
[01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:25.200]   Right?
[01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:26.240]   Well, guess what happens?
[01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:29.520]   When you have a devaluing currency as the denominator,
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:31.400]   doesn't matter, right?
[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:33.880]   Like you're financially incentivized to spend or invest,
[01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:35.740]   right, to consume.
[01:51:35.740 --> 01:51:39.220]   When you have an appreciating currency,
[01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:41.880]   all of a sudden you become much less consumptive
[01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:43.280]   in your behavior. - That's fascinating.
[01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:44.120]   Yeah.
[01:51:44.120 --> 01:51:46.480]   - Because you're actually trading off
[01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:50.800]   future purchasing power for the consumption today.
[01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:52.400]   - It's fascinating to think that
[01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:56.320]   when you move about this world,
[01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:58.960]   you think in Bitcoin, you behave differently
[01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:01.800]   as if you think in dollars.
[01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:03.320]   That's really fascinating.
[01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:06.240]   - People, but here's the thing is,
[01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:10.000]   the last 50 years or so is actually the outlier in history.
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:13.200]   Most people used to think this way.
[01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:14.080]   - Yeah.
[01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:17.440]   - It's only when a fiat currency got introduced
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:21.040]   that one argument, the positive argument or perspective,
[01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:23.140]   is there was an explosion in growth.
[01:52:23.140 --> 01:52:25.880]   But really it's because there was a financial incentive
[01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:26.720]   to consume.
[01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:27.560]   - Yeah.
[01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:28.380]   - Right?
[01:52:28.380 --> 01:52:29.560]   And there's nobody better in the world
[01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:31.680]   than the United States at consuming.
[01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:33.840]   And we consume anything and everything.
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:35.660]   And if you wanna see a great example,
[01:52:35.660 --> 01:52:39.360]   look at how big the Coca-Colas are at McDonald's, right?
[01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:41.520]   You go to other places, they don't serve them that big.
[01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:46.040]   And so the other example, or the negative argument,
[01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:49.440]   is we have to consume.
[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:52.720]   Because if not, you end up being the bottom 45%
[01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:55.680]   of Americans that held no investable assets
[01:52:55.680 --> 01:52:57.980]   and actually are just having their wealth devalued away.
[01:52:57.980 --> 01:53:00.160]   So holding the dollars end up being
[01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:03.040]   a very bad economic decision.
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:06.320]   And so when you then switch to this sound money,
[01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:08.320]   you say, "Wait a second, why would I,
[01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:10.840]   if today I can trade one Bitcoin,
[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:12.640]   back in October of last year,
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:15.440]   one Bitcoin for 10,000 US dollars,
[01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:18.360]   why would I spend that if at some point in the future,
[01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:21.720]   whether it's a month from now or 10 years from now,
[01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:25.280]   I could trade it for something much, much more than that?"
[01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:30.280]   You just become much more of a anti-consumer
[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:32.160]   and much more of a long-term thinker.
[01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:33.600]   - Yeah, from the individual perspective,
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:34.420]   that's pretty powerful.
[01:53:34.420 --> 01:53:37.040]   I wonder, I mean, I think that's an interesting debate,
[01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:40.000]   what's better for the long-term economy,
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:44.560]   no, better for the growth of the civilization.
[01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:47.880]   Because capitalism is fascinating.
[01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:51.440]   It seems to work pretty well.
[01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:55.160]   There's this kind of, like Eric Weinstein says
[01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:59.480]   that one of the problems is for the past several decades,
[01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:03.520]   this whole economy, society is built on the idea
[01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:05.120]   that we have to keep growing.
[01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:07.680]   Like it depends on that idea.
[01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:11.040]   And it's a good question whether that's going to result
[01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:14.480]   in huge problems, or if like a college student
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:19.480]   on a deadline, the dependence on growth
[01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:21.920]   will mean that we'll have to grow.
[01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:25.440]   Like the fear of death will force us to grow.
[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:27.000]   - But I think there's a false equivalency
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:30.080]   between we're dependent on growth,
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:32.760]   and then if the world was denominated in sound money,
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:34.200]   we don't grow.
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:37.040]   What I think ends up happening is we remove
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:39.520]   a lot of the society's bullshit.
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:42.440]   Because right now, when the money is free,
[01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:44.840]   or the currency is free, you can come up
[01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:45.960]   with all kinds of crazy stuff,
[01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:48.000]   and people will give it to you, right?
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:51.420]   When all of a sudden, it's really, really valued
[01:54:51.420 --> 01:54:53.000]   by the population.
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:54.440]   - The decisions are better.
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:57.000]   - Yeah, you have to provide real value
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:58.320]   in the goods and services you provide
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:54:59.760]   in order to get them to give it to you.
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:01.120]   - There's less room for corruption,
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:02.800]   less room for manipulation.
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:07.160]   That's not actually productive, yeah, definitely.
[01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:11.120]   So you said you moved a lot of your investment
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:12.240]   into Bitcoin.
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:19.040]   So you're a special human being in many ways.
[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:21.680]   So you're like a strategic thinker,
[01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:24.080]   but you're also a deep thinker about this whole thing.
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:27.360]   But when you look at a regular pleb like me,
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:29.160]   in terms of just investing and moving
[01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:32.600]   into thinking about cryptocurrency,
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:34.920]   is there a strategy that you recommend?
[01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:38.520]   What are the different options about investing into Bitcoin?
[01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:42.040]   - Yeah, so I think that there's just kind of timeless advice
[01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:46.400]   when it comes to investing or acquiring an asset in general.
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:48.720]   Dollar cost averaging is usually the best way
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:49.560]   to think about it.
[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:52.400]   And what I mean by that is most people
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:55.640]   don't just have a pile of currency sitting there, right?
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:56.960]   It's not like they have a million dollars
[01:55:56.960 --> 01:55:57.800]   sitting in their bank.
[01:55:57.800 --> 01:55:59.240]   It's like, what do I do with it?
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:01.680]   That situation aside, what happens is
[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:06.160]   they trade their hours and their effort for currency.
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:09.240]   And so as they get paid every two weeks, let's say,
[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:11.160]   the best way to acquire Bitcoin
[01:56:11.160 --> 01:56:13.200]   without having to worry about timing markets
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:14.800]   and being a professional trader
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:17.640]   is to simply take whatever the percentages that you want
[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:20.440]   and to buy Bitcoin when you get your paycheck.
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:22.960]   So if you get paid on the 1st and 15th of every month
[01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:24.960]   on that day, you should go take,
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:26.840]   let's say it's 3% of your paycheck.
[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:28.320]   Take 3%, go buy Bitcoin.
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:29.560]   Don't worry about what the price is.
[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:30.880]   You should do that over time.
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:32.920]   And the reason why that's important is
[01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:36.600]   if in December of 2017, when Bitcoin was at $20,000,
[01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:40.240]   it was the height of kind of this last big upwards movement,
[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:41.880]   you had taken all of your money
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:43.920]   and you had put it into Bitcoin,
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:46.040]   you would have had to wait almost three years
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:48.360]   just to get back to quote unquote break even
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:50.240]   in US dollar terms.
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:54.360]   If at the same time you had simply bought then
[01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:57.120]   and over the next three years bought every two weeks,
[01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:01.000]   you would have been up hundreds of percent three years later
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:02.000]   because what ended up happening
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:03.080]   was you bought a bunch of Bitcoin
[01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:07.200]   when it was at 15, 12, 10, nine, eight, three, four,
[01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:11.120]   five, five, five, all the way back up on the other side.
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:13.940]   And so dollar cost averaging is one of these weird things
[01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:15.740]   that it almost sounds too easy.
[01:57:15.740 --> 01:57:18.600]   But what we find is in America,
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:20.600]   we have a lack of financial education.
[01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:24.200]   And so rather than try to be smarter than markets,
[01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:25.680]   what most people are better off doing is just saying,
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:29.120]   hey, set your what's called an asset allocation plan.
[01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:32.560]   I want 30% in stocks, I want 10% in real estate,
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:33.800]   I want this, this, whatever.
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:35.460]   And every time you get your paycheck,
[01:57:35.460 --> 01:57:37.680]   just think of it as a savings account, right?
[01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:40.160]   Just put it in based on those percentages
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:41.880]   and don't think about it.
[01:57:41.880 --> 01:57:43.440]   And over a long enough period of time,
[01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:46.600]   what we find is almost anyone in the United States,
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:47.440]   right, there's exceptions,
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:49.080]   but almost anyone in the United States
[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:51.480]   can become a millionaire in their lifetime
[01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:53.840]   if they follow these plans and have that long-term view
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:56.000]   and they allow compounding to work for them.
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000]   - And so don't look at the price of Bitcoin
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:57:58.960]   and all that kind of stuff,
[01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:03.960]   just pick a specific time, specific day that you just buy,
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:05.600]   and you just keep buying.
[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:07.000]   That's probably good investment advice
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.560]   across any kind of assets.
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:11.520]   - If you don't believe in Bitcoin and you just wanted,
[01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:14.020]   let's say you just want to do the S&P 500.
[01:58:14.020 --> 01:58:15.200]   You shouldn't try to time the market
[01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:16.440]   of the S&P 500 either, right?
[01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:17.780]   You should just, every two weeks,
[01:58:17.780 --> 01:58:20.460]   you should just buy some and over a 20-year period,
[01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:21.640]   you're gonna end up buying it
[01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:22.920]   at all kinds of different prices,
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:24.800]   but you're gonna get kind of a blended average.
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:27.400]   And the more important thing is the compounding
[01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:28.520]   and the time in the market
[01:58:28.520 --> 01:58:31.980]   than did you buy it at 2% higher or lower
[01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:32.820]   than where you bought it.
[01:58:32.820 --> 01:58:33.660]   It doesn't really matter.
[01:58:33.660 --> 01:58:35.840]   - And buying often makes you, I guess,
[01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:39.920]   resistant, robust to the volatility of the market
[01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:42.440]   or the volatility of the Bitcoin price and so on.
[01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:47.440]   That said, Bitcoin price is volatile.
[01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:53.640]   And again, the argument I've heard is like
[01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:59.080]   everything that's going to be a lot more valuable
[01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:01.920]   in the future, like if you look at the history,
[01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:05.480]   like companies like Apple, like Tesla is now,
[01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:08.480]   I mean, but let's look at companies
[01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:10.360]   that have now stabilized, right?
[01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:12.800]   Apple is a good example.
[01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:15.000]   It's like volatile in the beginning.
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.200]   And so the argument for Bitcoin is like,
[01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:18.760]   yeah, this is the early stages
[01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:21.600]   because it's going to be a lot more valuable.
[01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:23.000]   Right now it's volatile.
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.080]   And this is why you have to have these kinds of strategies
[01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:26.740]   to ride out the volatility.
[01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:29.880]   Of course, everything that goes to zero is also volatile.
[01:59:29.880 --> 01:59:32.300]   Like the early days are volatile.
[01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:36.860]   Do you see like this volatility is like a feature or a bug,
[01:59:36.860 --> 01:59:38.840]   or is this just like a way of life?
[01:59:38.840 --> 01:59:41.080]   - So Amazon is the one that I know the numbers on
[01:59:41.080 --> 01:59:43.040]   in terms of the early volatility.
[01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:45.600]   Every year since it has gone public,
[01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:49.360]   it's had a double digit drawdown in that year.
[01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:52.080]   The average is over 30%.
[01:59:52.080 --> 01:59:55.320]   And one time it drew down over 95%.
[01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:56.800]   Sounds a lot like Bitcoin, right?
[01:59:56.800 --> 01:59:58.280]   Like, oh, wow, this is crazy.
[01:59:58.280 --> 02:00:00.880]   But it's one of the best performing stocks
[02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:03.520]   in the last 20 years, if not the best performing stock.
[02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:06.920]   And so volatility is not positive or negative.
[02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:10.320]   It's positive or negative compared to the position you're in.
[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:13.560]   So if you're long and it's volatile to the upside,
[02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:14.680]   it's positive.
[02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:16.440]   If you're long holding something
[02:00:16.440 --> 02:00:18.240]   and it's volatile to the downside,
[02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:19.200]   you see it as a negative.
[02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:20.720]   It's all about perspective.
[02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:24.400]   With that said, another way that I look at this
[02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:29.400]   is every asset priced in Bitcoin is down significantly.
[02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:34.140]   So over the last one, three, five years,
[02:00:34.140 --> 02:00:39.140]   the dollar priced in Bitcoin has crashed 99%.
[02:00:39.140 --> 02:00:43.760]   If you denominate stocks, it's down like 80%, 85%.
[02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:46.000]   If you denominate gold, if you denominate bonds,
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:47.840]   if you just go down the line, real estate, et cetera,
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:51.120]   it's all down massively against Bitcoin.
[02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:53.560]   Now, you could argue that that's because Bitcoin
[02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:55.840]   is appreciating in US dollar terms.
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:57.680]   Or you could actually argue
[02:00:57.680 --> 02:01:00.400]   that the world is repricing this asset.
[02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:02.280]   It's doing price discovery on this asset.
[02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:03.680]   And it's essentially comparing.
[02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:06.100]   It's saying, hey, Bitcoin versus this stock,
[02:01:06.100 --> 02:01:07.640]   or Bitcoin versus this ounce of gold,
[02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:10.480]   or Bitcoin versus this dollar, which is more valuable.
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:12.280]   And it continues to move up in the rankings
[02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:15.040]   in terms of the value that the world ascribes to this.
[02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:16.400]   Some of that's based on Lindy effect,
[02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:17.640]   just the longer it persists,
[02:01:17.640 --> 02:01:19.540]   the more likely it is to survive.
[02:01:19.540 --> 02:01:22.000]   Some of that's based on the underlying fundamentals
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:23.940]   of how much computing power, the usage,
[02:01:23.940 --> 02:01:26.160]   transaction volume, things like that.
[02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:29.100]   But some of it also is that as more and more people
[02:01:29.100 --> 02:01:31.520]   wake up to the fact that it's a finite supply asset
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:34.640]   that has a place in the world and demand increases,
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:38.360]   people just naturally compete and ascribe more value to it.
[02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:41.760]   And so the volatility, I think, all comes back to like,
[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:44.360]   what do you price your life in?
[02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:46.000]   For majority of people, that's dollars.
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:47.200]   And so you look at the US dollar price,
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:49.380]   you get all this volatility.
[02:01:49.380 --> 02:01:52.280]   The beauty of this is that 60% that doesn't move,
[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:56.220]   regardless of price upward or downward in movement,
[02:01:56.220 --> 02:01:58.760]   those people aren't looking at the day-to-day price.
[02:01:58.760 --> 02:01:59.640]   What they've basically said is,
[02:01:59.640 --> 02:02:01.960]   I've acquired X amount of Bitcoin,
[02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:04.160]   and I'm just gonna hold it for years.
[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:05.760]   And every time somebody has done that, right?
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:08.960]   If you bought Bitcoin at any point in the last 12 years
[02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:11.240]   and you held it till today,
[02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:13.840]   you are up in US dollar terms.
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:16.800]   Now, if we had this conversation 18 months ago,
[02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:18.240]   couldn't say that.
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:21.600]   So it's all about not only the acquisition price,
[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:24.940]   if you will, it's also when are you looking at it, right?
[02:02:24.940 --> 02:02:26.360]   Because there was a point in 2017,
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:27.400]   you could have said the same thing,
[02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:28.840]   but in 18, you couldn't.
[02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:30.960]   And so I tend to think a lot about,
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:35.480]   humans are really, really bad at short-term decision-making
[02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:36.640]   because we're so emotional,
[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:38.760]   especially when something has a price tied to it.
[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:42.200]   - And so in terms of our strategies and decision-making,
[02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:44.440]   we should be long-term and have like a regular,
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:48.040]   almost think like an algorithm in that kind of way.
[02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:50.840]   So I think you've tweeted that you believe
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:53.240]   that Bitcoin has a chance of reaching 1 million.
[02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:54.440]   I don't know what it is currently.
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:58.300]   I think it's 60, which is incredible.
[02:02:58.300 --> 02:03:01.880]   I think I remember when it was,
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:03.200]   at least in the double digits,
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:05.940]   I think I remember it was in the single digits of a dollar.
[02:03:05.940 --> 02:03:09.620]   So the fact that it's cross 50 is crazy,
[02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:13.340]   but you're even crazier apparently,
[02:03:13.340 --> 02:03:15.380]   thinking that it can reach a million.
[02:03:15.380 --> 02:03:17.780]   So do you think it's possible for it to reach a million?
[02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:19.740]   Is there some kind of transformative effects
[02:03:19.740 --> 02:03:21.160]   we'll have to see first?
[02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:22.900]   When might it reach a million?
[02:03:22.900 --> 02:03:25.660]   Like what are the signs that we would look for,
[02:03:25.660 --> 02:03:28.100]   what's required for it to reach a million?
[02:03:28.100 --> 02:03:31.220]   - So let's just look at it from a macro perspective.
[02:03:31.220 --> 02:03:33.740]   Gold is a $10 trillion asset.
[02:03:33.740 --> 02:03:36.100]   And when you compare the technology of gold
[02:03:36.100 --> 02:03:38.140]   to the technology of Bitcoin,
[02:03:38.140 --> 02:03:40.260]   Bitcoin is superior in every single way, right?
[02:03:40.260 --> 02:03:42.940]   It's more portable, it's more divisible,
[02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:46.260]   it's more verifiable, it's more scarce on everything.
[02:03:46.260 --> 02:03:49.020]   And so some people would argue it's a 10X improvement.
[02:03:49.020 --> 02:03:50.660]   Some people argue it's a 100X improvement
[02:03:50.660 --> 02:03:52.500]   from a technology standpoint.
[02:03:52.500 --> 02:03:57.340]   And so we don't need Bitcoin to actually
[02:03:57.340 --> 02:04:00.780]   kind of capture the full 10X or 100X improvement
[02:04:00.780 --> 02:04:02.840]   from a market cap standpoint.
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:06.420]   If Bitcoin simply captures 2X the value,
[02:04:06.420 --> 02:04:08.420]   it'd be a $20 trillion market cap,
[02:04:08.420 --> 02:04:10.580]   which would put Bitcoin at about a million dollars, right?
[02:04:10.580 --> 02:04:12.420]   So kind of just from a macro perspective,
[02:04:12.420 --> 02:04:14.180]   if you have a 10X or 100X improvement
[02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:15.700]   from a technology standpoint,
[02:04:15.700 --> 02:04:18.440]   and you directionally get some value capture
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:20.900]   in that direction, you're hitting around
[02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:23.220]   a million or more dollar price point.
[02:04:23.220 --> 02:04:24.580]   - Can I ask a quick question,
[02:04:24.580 --> 02:04:28.100]   which is what's the current market cap for Bitcoin?
[02:04:28.100 --> 02:04:29.640]   - The current market cap's right around a trillion,
[02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:30.820]   just over a trillion dollars.
[02:04:30.820 --> 02:04:32.860]   - And you're saying gold is 10 trillion.
[02:04:32.860 --> 02:04:36.860]   Sorry, where did you get the 20 trillion?
[02:04:36.860 --> 02:04:39.760]   - 20 trillion would just be 2X gold's market cap.
[02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:40.600]   - Got it.
[02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:42.160]   - Right, so if it's a 10X technology improvement,
[02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:44.400]   let's just say it only captures 2X the market cap.
[02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:45.300]   - Got it. - Right?
[02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:48.360]   And so again, if it was to capture just gold's market cap,
[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:51.340]   kind of the equivalent, puts you around $500,000, right?
[02:04:51.340 --> 02:04:52.180]   So you can kind of see there's-
[02:04:52.180 --> 02:04:53.020]   - For a single Bitcoin.
[02:04:53.020 --> 02:04:56.360]   So if you capture the entirety of the gold market,
[02:04:56.360 --> 02:04:59.220]   then it would be value of a single Bitcoin.
[02:04:59.220 --> 02:05:03.960]   The price of a single Bitcoin would be $500,000.
[02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:07.000]   Okay, to reach a million, it would be double that.
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:08.760]   That's where the 20 trillion comes from.
[02:05:08.760 --> 02:05:10.120]   - Correct. - Got it.
[02:05:10.120 --> 02:05:11.920]   - So if you then say to yourself,
[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:16.920]   okay, how does the pricing kind of cycles work, right?
[02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:19.660]   Or the boom and bust cycles?
[02:05:19.660 --> 02:05:25.720]   Gold is a very kind of linear type supply schedule,
[02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:29.340]   meaning that there is a certain amount of gold
[02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:30.740]   that comes out of the ground each year.
[02:05:30.740 --> 02:05:35.460]   The inter-year variation in that incoming supply
[02:05:35.460 --> 02:05:36.300]   is not much, right?
[02:05:36.300 --> 02:05:38.540]   Maybe there's an extra mining company that gets set up
[02:05:38.540 --> 02:05:40.780]   or a couple of them, or maybe one goes out of business.
[02:05:40.780 --> 02:05:44.660]   But for the most part, the kind of inflationary increase
[02:05:44.660 --> 02:05:48.880]   to the supply of gold is pretty stagnant year over year.
[02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:53.900]   Bitcoin has a very unique feature, which every four years,
[02:05:53.900 --> 02:05:56.720]   there is a programmatic supply shock,
[02:05:56.720 --> 02:05:58.560]   meaning that in the beginning,
[02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:01.840]   50 Bitcoin every 10 minutes was introduced into the supply.
[02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:04.440]   After four years of that happening every 10 minutes,
[02:06:04.440 --> 02:06:05.600]   it was cut in half.
[02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:09.440]   So in a single moment, it went from 50 to now it was 25.
[02:06:09.440 --> 02:06:11.700]   Four years, every 10 minutes, 25,
[02:06:11.700 --> 02:06:13.440]   got cut in half again to 12 and a half.
[02:06:13.440 --> 02:06:16.000]   And then recently in May 2020, it got cut to 6.25.
[02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:19.960]   When you have an asset that is determined,
[02:06:19.960 --> 02:06:22.560]   the price based on supply and demand,
[02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:25.140]   you normally have two inputs to the equation.
[02:06:25.140 --> 02:06:27.700]   What is the supply and what is the demand?
[02:06:27.700 --> 02:06:31.200]   In an asset like gold or a stock or anything else,
[02:06:31.200 --> 02:06:34.320]   we have to do our best guess at the supply,
[02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:36.880]   both the existing supply and the incoming supply,
[02:06:36.880 --> 02:06:38.700]   and then do our best guess at the demand.
[02:06:38.700 --> 02:06:40.360]   And we're actually pretty good at this a lot of times
[02:06:40.360 --> 02:06:43.300]   in terms of directionally saying it's gonna go up or down,
[02:06:43.300 --> 02:06:45.800]   and here's kind of some price point milestones.
[02:06:45.800 --> 02:06:50.400]   Bitcoin's unique in that there's 100% verifiable proof
[02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:54.280]   of the existing supply, the total supply,
[02:06:54.280 --> 02:06:56.280]   and the incoming daily supply.
[02:06:56.280 --> 02:06:59.760]   So we know 100% I can show you on the actual blockchain
[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:02.440]   or in the code that there's 21 million Bitcoin.
[02:07:02.440 --> 02:07:04.480]   Oh, and that's all there will ever be.
[02:07:04.480 --> 02:07:08.040]   I can show you that there's 18.6 million, give or take,
[02:07:08.040 --> 02:07:10.680]   Bitcoin that actually are in circulation today, right?
[02:07:10.680 --> 02:07:12.400]   And I can go all the way back to every single transaction
[02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:14.240]   that's ever occurred since January 2009.
[02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:15.760]   And then I can show you on a daily basis
[02:07:15.760 --> 02:07:18.920]   that 900 Bitcoin a day are coming into the circulating supply.
[02:07:18.920 --> 02:07:21.360]   And so when you have 100% confidence
[02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:24.960]   because you can prove the supply side of this equation,
[02:07:24.960 --> 02:07:26.320]   you can hold it constant.
[02:07:26.320 --> 02:07:29.360]   I know with 100% accuracy, the supply side.
[02:07:29.360 --> 02:07:32.520]   So now I've reduced the mathematical equation
[02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:34.920]   that I need to do to determine price movements
[02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:36.760]   to a 50% reduction.
[02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:37.760]   I only have to worry about demand.
[02:07:37.760 --> 02:07:39.680]   I don't have to worry about supply.
[02:07:39.680 --> 02:07:42.060]   And so when I look at demand, I can do all kinds of things.
[02:07:42.060 --> 02:07:45.120]   I can take the demand over the last 10 years and the growth
[02:07:45.120 --> 02:07:46.320]   and just extrapolate it out.
[02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:48.480]   I can increase it, I can decrease it, whatever.
[02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:52.880]   But what you find is that the supply shocks
[02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:55.800]   lead to significant price appreciation
[02:07:55.800 --> 02:07:57.520]   as the asset gets repriced
[02:07:57.520 --> 02:08:00.000]   because there's a supply shock to them.
[02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.640]   And so probably the best thing that I've done
[02:08:02.640 --> 02:08:05.360]   over the last couple of years was in 2019,
[02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:06.960]   I started to talk about the idea
[02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:09.160]   that we were gonna have both the supply shock
[02:08:09.160 --> 02:08:12.260]   and the demand shock in 2021.
[02:08:12.260 --> 02:08:15.280]   Or I'm sorry, in 2020.
[02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:17.640]   I didn't know when this bull market that we were in
[02:08:17.640 --> 02:08:19.200]   was gonna end, nobody knows, right?
[02:08:19.200 --> 02:08:21.200]   It's impossible to time these things.
[02:08:21.200 --> 02:08:22.320]   But you could tell that we were kind of
[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:23.840]   at late stages of a cycle.
[02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:25.320]   There was inverted yield curves,
[02:08:25.320 --> 02:08:28.160]   there was rejugerations in the repo markets,
[02:08:28.160 --> 02:08:30.000]   a lot of CEOs leaving their jobs,
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:31.880]   you know, all this kind of stuff.
[02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:35.120]   And all I said was at some point when the market turns over,
[02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:36.360]   the government's gonna have to step in.
[02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:38.000]   We were addicted to stimulus.
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:39.680]   They're gonna have to manipulate interest rates down
[02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:41.280]   and they're gonna have to print money.
[02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:44.600]   I had no clue that there was gonna be a global pandemic,
[02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:45.880]   that they were gonna have to step in
[02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:47.760]   in such an aggressive way and move rates,
[02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:49.800]   not down, but down to zero.
[02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:51.320]   And that they not only were gonna print
[02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:52.160]   hundreds of billions,
[02:08:52.160 --> 02:08:54.640]   but they could print trillions of dollars.
[02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:57.080]   But the framework that I used to think about this
[02:08:57.080 --> 02:08:59.360]   was when they do that,
[02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:02.720]   everyone is gonna run to store value assets.
[02:09:02.720 --> 02:09:03.560]   They're gonna run to gold,
[02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:05.480]   they're gonna run to Bitcoin, et cetera.
[02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:06.960]   And right as they do that,
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:08.440]   it appears at the same time,
[02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:09.740]   there's gonna be this supply shock.
[02:09:09.740 --> 02:09:11.660]   So you're gonna get a supply shock and a demand shock
[02:09:11.660 --> 02:09:13.200]   that are both positive for the price.
[02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:15.160]   And I called it rocket fuel for Bitcoin.
[02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:17.820]   Well, it happened and here we are.
[02:09:17.820 --> 02:09:20.760]   I now look forward and I say, okay,
[02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:23.080]   we are likely going to see a hundred thousand Bitcoin,
[02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:24.800]   a hundred thousand dollar Bitcoin this year,
[02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:26.240]   or at some point, I don't know when it happens,
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:27.080]   but we're moving in that direction.
[02:09:27.080 --> 02:09:30.520]   - So you think in 2021, we'll see a hundred thousand?
[02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:33.560]   - That would be my most conservative view.
[02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:36.960]   I've said a hundred thousand dollars since 2019
[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:40.480]   and people thought that was insane and crazy and all this stuff
[02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:41.960]   now I'm the conservative guy in the room
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:43.520]   'cause I stick with a hundred thousand dollars
[02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:47.680]   and people are saying multiples of that number.
[02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:49.000]   So we'll see what happens.
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:50.800]   But I think that there's still a lot of room
[02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:53.200]   kind of to run from a US dollar price standpoint.
[02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:56.160]   What is on the horizon is in 2024,
[02:09:56.160 --> 02:09:57.860]   we will have another supply shock.
[02:09:57.860 --> 02:10:00.240]   And so that's what I think will carry us
[02:10:00.240 --> 02:10:01.080]   to the million dollar Bitcoin price.
[02:10:01.080 --> 02:10:03.360]   - From the 625 to whatever.
[02:10:03.360 --> 02:10:04.400]   - 50% reduction.
[02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:05.240]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:10:05.240 --> 02:10:07.480]   And so that's what I think will basically,
[02:10:07.480 --> 02:10:09.200]   when we get that next supply shock,
[02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:10.600]   that'll carry us up over a hundred,
[02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:13.320]   or over a $1 million Bitcoin price,
[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:17.280]   which if historical examples persist,
[02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:19.600]   and again, sometimes it's hard to use historical examples
[02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:22.760]   to look at future events.
[02:10:22.760 --> 02:10:24.800]   But if that happens, we would see a million dollars
[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:27.440]   of Bitcoin by the end of 2026.
[02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:29.160]   - After that wave.
[02:10:29.160 --> 02:10:31.840]   - So 2024 basically is the supply shock.
[02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:34.460]   And within 18 to 24 months,
[02:10:34.460 --> 02:10:37.440]   you would see the kind of top of the next market.
[02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:41.120]   - Hopefully without a coupling to another pandemic.
[02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:43.040]   - Yes, we would like to do all of this
[02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:45.840]   without a public health crisis.
[02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:49.740]   - So that would take it to 20 trillion.
[02:10:49.740 --> 02:10:51.640]   You don't have to compare it to the dollar,
[02:10:51.640 --> 02:10:53.560]   essentially, in some sense,
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:55.600]   that the dollar could also lose value.
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:10:58.600]   I mean, there's a lot of kind of dynamics at play here.
[02:10:58.600 --> 02:11:00.080]   Now, but like fundamentally,
[02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:03.020]   there's going to be a huge move
[02:11:03.020 --> 02:11:06.600]   in your prediction of value into Bitcoin.
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:09.240]   I mean, that's a fascinating world to think about.
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:14.800]   I mean, but I do have to kind of ask you
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:17.080]   about the whole space of technology there,
[02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:19.080]   'cause we're talking about the value of security,
[02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:21.240]   we're talking about the future,
[02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:24.040]   which Bitcoin will be at the center of.
[02:11:24.040 --> 02:11:28.960]   But from my perspective of thinking how like I
[02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:30.360]   and others can build technologies
[02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:33.480]   on top of this kind of decentralized world,
[02:11:33.480 --> 02:11:36.440]   I'm thinking about different technologies out there,
[02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:38.440]   different cryptocurrencies out there,
[02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:40.080]   Ethereum being one,
[02:11:40.080 --> 02:11:42.200]   but there's a lot of others.
[02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:44.680]   So I'd love to get your sort of ideas about some of these.
[02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:49.000]   But so first let me ask you about what the hell is shitcoin?
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:55.280]   Is this connected to our previous discussion of the meme?
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:12:00.280]   Does shitcoin cover basically all coins that are not Bitcoin?
[02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:03.440]   Is it mean?
[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:04.800]   Is it a beautiful?
[02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:06.800]   Is it some mixture of both?
[02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:08.400]   - As with most things in life,
[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:09.600]   depends who you ask,
[02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:15.920]   the most kind of enthusiastic
[02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:18.960]   and parts of the Bitcoin community,
[02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:21.320]   shitcoin is anything else, right?
[02:12:21.320 --> 02:12:24.560]   Kind of if you ascribe to kind of a maximalistic view
[02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:26.560]   of the world, shitcoin would be anything.
[02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:30.320]   If you look at people who I would say are Bitcoin proponents
[02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:33.240]   yet see value in other things,
[02:12:33.240 --> 02:12:37.640]   shitcoin may be the bottom half of the other things, right?
[02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:39.200]   So I think, again, it's really important
[02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:42.120]   kind of who you ask is how you'll get that answer.
[02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:44.840]   - So there's tiers and the way you divide those tiers
[02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:46.680]   might be different depending on who you ask.
[02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:49.120]   - Ultimately what it is is it's a meme
[02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:52.960]   and it's used to articulate the idea
[02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:56.320]   that whatever you wanna put in that bucket has no value.
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:12:59.640]   So shitcoin, right, are coins that have no value.
[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:02.160]   What is fascinating about it,
[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:03.000]   and I think that again,
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.120]   speaks to the power of the Bitcoin community,
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:08.800]   is there was congressional hearings a couple of years ago.
[02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:09.640]   - Oh no.
[02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:12.120]   - And at one point, a congressman from Ohio,
[02:13:12.120 --> 02:13:15.640]   Warren Davidson, who was definitely open-minded
[02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:17.960]   and excited about Bitcoin,
[02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:22.880]   asked an individual on the Congress floor during testimony
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:25.840]   to talk about these other coins.
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:29.400]   And at one point basically read into the record
[02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:31.440]   the terminology of shitcoin.
[02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:33.080]   - He said the word shitcoin.
[02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:35.120]   - I can't remember if he said it first
[02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:39.400]   or if the other person did, and then he repeated it.
[02:13:39.400 --> 02:13:40.360]   - That's awesome.
[02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:41.200]   - But he definitely,
[02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:44.720]   he was trying to get that read into the record for sure.
[02:13:44.720 --> 02:13:48.360]   And so you can imagine one, again,
[02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:52.200]   the meme speaking insolently to the Bitcoin community
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:55.280]   was made him very well liked.
[02:13:55.280 --> 02:14:00.280]   But also two was, it does go back to this idea almost of,
[02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:03.400]   if you and I sat down with 10 CEOs
[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:05.560]   and we interviewed each one of them,
[02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:07.040]   and then we went in a room and we deliberated,
[02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:08.720]   and we said, we have to pick the person
[02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:10.920]   who's gonna be the most successful.
[02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:12.480]   One of the inputs, not all of the inputs,
[02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:13.680]   but one of the inputs would be,
[02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:16.320]   who's the person who we believe has the best ability
[02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:19.080]   to raise capital, recruit people,
[02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:24.080]   and tell a story to the world that will get them to follow?
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:26.120]   And so somebody like Elon
[02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:28.480]   would probably be the best example of this.
[02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:30.720]   When you have decentralized products,
[02:14:30.720 --> 02:14:32.840]   you have no kind of leader, right?
[02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:36.120]   In the sense of somebody who is financially ascribed
[02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:39.460]   to be that leader and kind of the executive decision maker.
[02:14:39.460 --> 02:14:40.560]   So what you have to do is you have to look
[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:43.280]   at these technologies in these communities and say,
[02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:47.040]   well, which volunteer teams or which technologies
[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:50.080]   have been able to coalesce these groups around it
[02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:54.160]   and in some way build the same level of engagement
[02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:56.440]   and protection and things like that?
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:14:59.520]   And so you naturally get tribalism,
[02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:01.680]   but you also get things like shitcoin,
[02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:06.680]   because what it does is it's not only a kind of verbal attack
[02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:12.120]   towards others, it's a rallying cry for internal.
[02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:15.200]   What's so funny is that it was started
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:17.920]   with the Bitcoin community talking about everybody,
[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:19.820]   but now you've seen adoption in other communities
[02:15:19.820 --> 02:15:22.240]   who use it, basically say, well, we're not a shitcoin,
[02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:23.760]   it's the next guy.
[02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:26.000]   - Yeah, I mean, the meaning, to be honest,
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:31.000]   it's sometimes misused, I think, with anything.
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:36.200]   It's like people adopt memes that used to be brilliant
[02:15:36.200 --> 02:15:39.760]   or still brilliant, and they're just not good at using them
[02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:41.720]   so that they become mean.
[02:15:41.720 --> 02:15:48.120]   But when you do it with grace, it can tear down an argument
[02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:52.480]   and at the same time have love and respect underneath it.
[02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:55.880]   I mean, it's a beautiful dance they have to be good at.
[02:15:55.880 --> 02:15:58.080]   People just can suck at communication.
[02:15:58.080 --> 02:16:02.880]   And even a powerful weapon like a meme in the wrong hands
[02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:07.640]   just fires in a way that doesn't get anything done.
[02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:10.880]   But this is like a war of humor and memes.
[02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:13.720]   It's kind of fascinating, exactly like you formulated,
[02:16:13.720 --> 02:16:16.280]   that there's asymmetry of power,
[02:16:16.280 --> 02:16:18.000]   so you have to have guerrilla warfare
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:22.880]   in this internet game, especially when there's no leader,
[02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:23.720]   like you said, in a distributed culture.
[02:16:23.720 --> 02:16:28.240]   - The other thing I would say here that is really important,
[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:30.280]   I think, is from a society standpoint,
[02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:35.960]   we've become very soft and very kind of coddling,
[02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:38.920]   and not in a way that's like,
[02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:41.320]   I think people take this argument too far sometimes,
[02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:44.640]   but what I mean by that is it's almost like
[02:16:44.640 --> 02:16:47.160]   if you're the person who holds somebody accountable,
[02:16:47.160 --> 02:16:48.840]   you become the bad person, right?
[02:16:48.840 --> 02:16:53.360]   If you're the person who says, "Hey, that's wrong,"
[02:16:53.360 --> 02:16:54.760]   you're the bad person, right?
[02:16:54.760 --> 02:16:56.320]   And so in a world where I think
[02:16:56.320 --> 02:17:01.000]   in this kind of influencery, all positive,
[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:04.560]   if you have any negative feedback or constructive criticism,
[02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:05.920]   like you're the bad person,
[02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:09.760]   it's the ultimate echo chamber, right?
[02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:13.240]   And so I think that what the Bitcoin world does
[02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:16.320]   in some crazy, crazy way to look at it
[02:17:16.320 --> 02:17:20.280]   is Bitcoin is ultimately about truth,
[02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:24.960]   not about narrative, not about feelings or emotion.
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:26.520]   It's math.
[02:17:26.520 --> 02:17:28.560]   You look at a blockchain
[02:17:28.560 --> 02:17:31.360]   and you can prove something or you can't.
[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:34.680]   And so naturally people who are attracted to that
[02:17:34.680 --> 02:17:36.800]   have a very similar approach in life, right?
[02:17:36.800 --> 02:17:40.200]   They say, "Hey, you made X claim, prove it."
[02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:43.080]   And as you can imagine, a great example is like
[02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:45.880]   the financial media meets Bitcoiners,
[02:17:45.880 --> 02:17:48.000]   and it's a bloodbath, right?
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:51.880]   In kind of the arena of ideas, because what do they do?
[02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:55.520]   The financial media is used to the soft opinion pieces,
[02:17:55.520 --> 02:17:58.160]   et cetera, and Bitcoiners show up and they're like,
[02:17:58.160 --> 02:17:59.880]   "Here's data point A, B, and C.
[02:17:59.880 --> 02:18:02.960]   Here's example one, two, and three, and you're wrong."
[02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:05.840]   And then all they yell and scream about is like,
[02:18:05.840 --> 02:18:06.920]   "I'm wrong, I'm wrong, I'm wrong."
[02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:08.040]   Like, "You can't say I'm wrong."
[02:18:08.040 --> 02:18:09.120]   And they're like, "No, no, no,
[02:18:09.120 --> 02:18:10.440]   disprove what I just said."
[02:18:10.440 --> 02:18:12.480]   And so you get in this very, very weird world.
[02:18:12.480 --> 02:18:14.160]   - It's fascinating, it's a fascinating battlefield.
[02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:17.960]   But I do wanna say, I've been watching this,
[02:18:17.960 --> 02:18:19.960]   it's kind of interesting.
[02:18:19.960 --> 02:18:22.320]   I think that the pursuit of truth,
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:28.600]   like tearing down bad ideas can be done with grace.
[02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:32.160]   And to do it with grace requires a lot of skill.
[02:18:32.160 --> 02:18:35.000]   Like what people don't realize about disagreement,
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:39.000]   they think that disagreement is easy.
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:44.000]   Like they see the lies or the inaccuracies in the statement,
[02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:48.100]   and they just think they can say wrong.
[02:18:48.100 --> 02:18:53.200]   Yes, you can say that, but if you wanna be effective,
[02:18:53.200 --> 02:18:56.280]   it requires great skill.
[02:18:56.280 --> 02:18:58.240]   Like you look at, I don't know,
[02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:03.000]   a beautiful verbal shit poster,
[02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:04.940]   which is Christopher Hitchens, right?
[02:19:04.940 --> 02:19:09.560]   It requires a lot of skill through your words
[02:19:09.560 --> 02:19:13.700]   to tear down an argument, to criticize,
[02:19:13.700 --> 02:19:16.720]   and to take a step towards truth.
[02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:19.400]   What I'm disheartened by internet culture,
[02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:23.680]   like the negative side is people don't put a lot of effort
[02:19:23.680 --> 02:19:25.240]   in their teardowns.
[02:19:25.240 --> 02:19:29.160]   Like into your shit posting, into your memes,
[02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:33.000]   you should put effort and see it as a skill
[02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:36.680]   that you wanna, if you want to be a part of this culture,
[02:19:36.680 --> 02:19:40.640]   you want to get good at it, like any skill.
[02:19:40.640 --> 02:19:44.180]   It's the 10,000 hours, like get improve,
[02:19:44.180 --> 02:19:48.460]   deliberate practice, self-criticism, all of those things.
[02:19:48.460 --> 02:19:51.780]   Just because you're anonymous doesn't mean
[02:19:51.780 --> 02:19:54.580]   you won't get deep joy and actually have an impact
[02:19:54.580 --> 02:19:56.980]   on the world if you get good at shit posting.
[02:19:56.980 --> 02:20:00.220]   - But I think this is really, really important, right?
[02:20:00.220 --> 02:20:02.540]   Because you're right in that it's all about
[02:20:02.540 --> 02:20:03.820]   intention versus action.
[02:20:03.820 --> 02:20:07.460]   If your intention is to tell somebody that they are wrong
[02:20:07.460 --> 02:20:10.140]   in an effort to get them to see the truth,
[02:20:10.140 --> 02:20:12.400]   that's very different than if your intention
[02:20:12.400 --> 02:20:14.520]   is to tell someone they're wrong and hurt their feelings.
[02:20:14.520 --> 02:20:18.860]   Right, and so when you can unpack intention and action,
[02:20:18.860 --> 02:20:21.600]   you really quickly can tell what somebody ultimately
[02:20:21.600 --> 02:20:23.640]   is trying to accomplish.
[02:20:23.640 --> 02:20:26.020]   I also think that one of the craziest things
[02:20:26.020 --> 02:20:30.160]   that I've seen play out is memes, when I use that term,
[02:20:30.160 --> 02:20:32.360]   I'm not just talking about like a static photo, right?
[02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:35.600]   When I'm talking about these elaborate kind of edited videos
[02:20:35.600 --> 02:20:40.600]   and kind of all this stuff, when done right,
[02:20:40.600 --> 02:20:45.720]   it is the most articulate way to deliver a blunt message.
[02:20:45.720 --> 02:20:49.860]   And it's done in such a way that is humorous
[02:20:49.860 --> 02:20:54.160]   and entertaining, yet really hammers the point home.
[02:20:54.160 --> 02:20:57.820]   And so it's a skill set that many people don't have.
[02:20:57.820 --> 02:21:00.480]   I don't make those, I'm assuming you don't make them either.
[02:21:00.480 --> 02:21:03.040]   I see them, I share the ones that I like, right?
[02:21:04.480 --> 02:21:05.840]   But it does take practice.
[02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:07.200]   And you can tell, look, there's people
[02:21:07.200 --> 02:21:09.960]   who are fantastic meme lords, right?
[02:21:09.960 --> 02:21:13.040]   And there are people who absolutely suck at it.
[02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:16.440]   And it's like anything, it's just how good
[02:21:16.440 --> 02:21:18.160]   are you at communicating?
[02:21:18.160 --> 02:21:20.160]   And I've heard the idea a bunch of times,
[02:21:20.160 --> 02:21:22.240]   so I don't know who to kind of credit for it,
[02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:27.240]   but whether it's emojis, it's GIFs, it's memes, whatever,
[02:21:27.240 --> 02:21:30.780]   this is the extension and evolution of just hieroglyphics.
[02:21:30.780 --> 02:21:31.620]   (laughing)
[02:21:31.620 --> 02:21:32.460]   Right? - Yeah.
[02:21:32.740 --> 02:21:35.740]   - Like we have been doing this for literally centuries.
[02:21:35.740 --> 02:21:37.420]   It's just that now we're doing it on the internet
[02:21:37.420 --> 02:21:38.580]   and you can press a button and you can go
[02:21:38.580 --> 02:21:41.660]   to millions and millions of people immediately.
[02:21:41.660 --> 02:21:44.340]   - But speaking of memes, what the heck do you think
[02:21:44.340 --> 02:21:48.300]   is up with Elon Musk talking about Dogecoin a lot?
[02:21:48.300 --> 02:21:50.940]   Sort of from the cryptocurrency community,
[02:21:50.940 --> 02:21:55.340]   I've been talking to a lot of sort of technologists,
[02:21:55.340 --> 02:21:58.860]   I guess, and reading papers on cryptocurrency.
[02:21:58.860 --> 02:22:02.740]   It's like nobody really sees Dogecoin
[02:22:02.740 --> 02:22:05.500]   as a revolutionary crypto technology.
[02:22:05.500 --> 02:22:07.860]   A lot of people talk about its security issues.
[02:22:07.860 --> 02:22:09.980]   There's a bunch of issues it has.
[02:22:09.980 --> 02:22:13.100]   Nevertheless, you did say that money
[02:22:13.100 --> 02:22:16.400]   is the kind of social construct, right?
[02:22:16.400 --> 02:22:21.540]   And Elon Musk's combination of humor
[02:22:21.540 --> 02:22:25.700]   and brilliant engineering in the various companies he runs
[02:22:25.700 --> 02:22:29.300]   combines to create a kind of value
[02:22:29.300 --> 02:22:31.740]   and excitement behind Dogecoin.
[02:22:31.740 --> 02:22:34.020]   It's like, what is it?
[02:22:34.020 --> 02:22:37.460]   He says that the most amusing outcome
[02:22:37.460 --> 02:22:40.300]   is the most likely kind of idea,
[02:22:40.300 --> 02:22:43.020]   which sounds silly, but there could be
[02:22:43.020 --> 02:22:45.180]   like profound truth to it.
[02:22:45.180 --> 02:22:47.340]   It's like, what do you make of Dogecoin
[02:22:47.340 --> 02:22:50.180]   philosophically or technically?
[02:22:50.180 --> 02:22:53.060]   Is it possible that Dogecoin will overtake Bitcoin
[02:22:53.060 --> 02:22:56.780]   and run the entire world?
[02:22:56.780 --> 02:22:59.460]   I can't even, 'cause it could happen.
[02:22:59.460 --> 02:23:00.460]   It could happen.
[02:23:00.460 --> 02:23:04.840]   But if there's any serious way to answer that question.
[02:23:04.840 --> 02:23:09.840]   - Well, we have to start with Techno King of Tesla
[02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:14.060]   and Master of Coin, as they are so articulately called
[02:23:14.060 --> 02:23:15.980]   in the latest SEC filing.
[02:23:15.980 --> 02:23:18.180]   - He officially changed his title to Techno King.
[02:23:18.180 --> 02:23:19.580]   - Techno King of Tesla.
[02:23:19.580 --> 02:23:24.100]   And the CFO's new title is Master of Coin.
[02:23:24.100 --> 02:23:28.180]   And so when you have a sense of humor,
[02:23:28.180 --> 02:23:33.740]   and frankly, a level of self-confidence
[02:23:33.740 --> 02:23:38.660]   and an element of an appreciation for irony in the world,
[02:23:38.660 --> 02:23:42.940]   Dogecoin is actually one of the least crazy things
[02:23:42.940 --> 02:23:44.580]   that you could talk about
[02:23:44.580 --> 02:23:46.980]   when you're willing to go to Techno King of Tesla,
[02:23:46.980 --> 02:23:49.540]   Master of Coin, and all this stuff.
[02:23:49.540 --> 02:23:53.820]   And so I think that Elon doesn't get enough credit,
[02:23:53.820 --> 02:23:56.700]   frankly, for his understanding of internet culture,
[02:23:56.700 --> 02:23:59.380]   understanding of memes, and understanding of,
[02:23:59.380 --> 02:24:02.180]   frankly, human psychology and marketing.
[02:24:02.180 --> 02:24:04.500]   And so in some crazy way,
[02:24:04.500 --> 02:24:06.980]   every time he talks about Dogecoin,
[02:24:06.980 --> 02:24:10.100]   it's a rallying cry for an entire generation of kids.
[02:24:10.100 --> 02:24:12.900]   It's a rallying cry for an entire industry
[02:24:12.900 --> 02:24:16.000]   in terms of cryptocurrencies and digital technologies.
[02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.260]   But this is the flag.
[02:24:19.260 --> 02:24:22.260]   And this is the thing that he can yell and scream about
[02:24:22.260 --> 02:24:26.180]   and tweet about without worry of punishment.
[02:24:26.180 --> 02:24:27.740]   - So he could be talking about Bitcoin,
[02:24:27.740 --> 02:24:29.860]   he could be talking about cryptocurrency,
[02:24:29.860 --> 02:24:34.300]   but that's not going to be as beautifully humorous
[02:24:34.300 --> 02:24:37.500]   in whatever the hell internet culture is as Dogecoin.
[02:24:37.500 --> 02:24:39.060]   He's finding the right language.
[02:24:39.060 --> 02:24:41.020]   He's speaking the language of the people
[02:24:41.020 --> 02:24:43.700]   in the digital age.
[02:24:43.700 --> 02:24:47.060]   - If you wanna reach weird people, you can't be serious.
[02:24:47.060 --> 02:24:49.140]   - And most people are weird.
[02:24:49.140 --> 02:24:52.940]   The masses are weird, so he's speaking to the masses.
[02:24:52.940 --> 02:24:54.180]   - Yeah. - The techno king.
[02:24:54.180 --> 02:24:55.940]   - And even further than that, I think,
[02:24:55.940 --> 02:24:58.080]   is he essentially is,
[02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:04.260]   he's using Dogecoin as a way to say,
[02:25:04.260 --> 02:25:05.980]   "I'm doing this because I can."
[02:25:05.980 --> 02:25:06.820]   - Yeah.
[02:25:06.820 --> 02:25:10.540]   - He couldn't do it with securities.
[02:25:10.540 --> 02:25:13.780]   He couldn't do it with certain types of other assets.
[02:25:13.780 --> 02:25:15.180]   I almost look at it as a Venn diagram.
[02:25:15.180 --> 02:25:17.160]   What's the thing that a bunch of people know about,
[02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:19.620]   care about, think are as funny, whatever.
[02:25:19.620 --> 02:25:21.420]   And also overlay that with the things
[02:25:21.420 --> 02:25:22.740]   that he could actually talk about
[02:25:22.740 --> 02:25:24.420]   that he won't get in trouble for.
[02:25:24.420 --> 02:25:26.540]   - That's a big F you to the SEC.
[02:25:26.540 --> 02:25:29.420]   I could see the people just freaking out.
[02:25:29.420 --> 02:25:30.860]   I mean, I love it,
[02:25:30.860 --> 02:25:34.740]   but I don't know if I would have the guts to do it myself,
[02:25:34.740 --> 02:25:38.100]   but I think he's an inspiration to a lot of us
[02:25:38.100 --> 02:25:41.060]   to be like, "Well, maybe you should grow the guts."
[02:25:41.060 --> 02:25:42.220]   - When you're the techno king,
[02:25:42.220 --> 02:25:43.660]   you can do whatever you want, right?
[02:25:43.660 --> 02:25:46.020]   (both laughing)
[02:25:46.020 --> 02:25:48.040]   And I mean, that's something to aspire to
[02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:51.000]   is to be the techno king in your own little world.
[02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.120]   - If you also think about it in the sense of
[02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:54.640]   when you're somebody on a mission
[02:25:54.640 --> 02:25:59.340]   to create interplanetary life,
[02:25:59.340 --> 02:26:01.640]   when you're trying to solve
[02:26:01.640 --> 02:26:05.400]   or put a dent in the climate crisis
[02:26:05.400 --> 02:26:06.920]   or create electric vehicles
[02:26:06.920 --> 02:26:09.660]   and be the first American company in however long,
[02:26:09.660 --> 02:26:15.880]   frankly, the SEC or other things in your life
[02:26:16.060 --> 02:26:18.660]   that you don't ascribe that much importance to
[02:26:18.660 --> 02:26:23.340]   compared to those things, they're almost nuisances.
[02:26:23.340 --> 02:26:26.540]   And that's scary, I think, for shareholders of a company
[02:26:26.540 --> 02:26:28.680]   when the person that you're trusting
[02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:30.060]   to lead you to the promised land
[02:26:30.060 --> 02:26:31.760]   and create shareholder value
[02:26:31.760 --> 02:26:34.700]   doesn't put value on certain things.
[02:26:34.700 --> 02:26:38.900]   But at the same time, I always look at it as a tug of war.
[02:26:38.900 --> 02:26:41.000]   How much of the actions of what he's doing
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:44.240]   and calling attention to actually change the way
[02:26:44.240 --> 02:26:47.340]   that regulators, lawmakers, politicians,
[02:26:47.340 --> 02:26:49.980]   countries, whatever, act.
[02:26:49.980 --> 02:26:53.460]   He may not be able to say, "Do X, I'm the techno king,"
[02:26:53.460 --> 02:26:58.060]   and they go do it, but with every step he makes,
[02:26:58.060 --> 02:27:01.380]   he changes some of their behavior.
[02:27:01.380 --> 02:27:05.260]   And so I think that it's a really kind of game
[02:27:05.260 --> 02:27:09.340]   of like 3D chess that frankly, I'm not privy to,
[02:27:09.340 --> 02:27:11.100]   right, and I'm kind of watching from the sidelines
[02:27:11.100 --> 02:27:13.540]   and figuring out alongside everybody else.
[02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:18.600]   But I also don't think that it's just Elon
[02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:20.240]   bought a bunch of Dogecoin and tweets about it
[02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:21.560]   'cause he thinks it's going to a dollar
[02:27:21.560 --> 02:27:23.120]   and he's gonna make money, right?
[02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:25.640]   Like I don't think it's an economic argument
[02:27:25.640 --> 02:27:27.000]   as to why he's so interested in it.
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:31.860]   I think it's much more, it's almost like meta message
[02:27:31.860 --> 02:27:33.920]   for a lot of other stuff.
[02:27:33.920 --> 02:27:36.280]   - Yeah, he's kind of trying to break apart
[02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:38.780]   internet communication from first principles
[02:27:38.780 --> 02:27:40.040]   like he does so many other problems.
[02:27:40.040 --> 02:27:41.320]   It's kind of fascinating to watch.
[02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:45.620]   I know he's taught me quite a bit about communication
[02:27:45.620 --> 02:27:50.620]   and at least for me, it's been liberating
[02:27:50.620 --> 02:27:56.140]   to not give a fuck about the old school way of things.
[02:27:56.140 --> 02:27:59.300]   I've been always bothered by a place I deeply admire,
[02:27:59.300 --> 02:28:02.540]   which is MIT, but there's problems,
[02:28:02.540 --> 02:28:04.300]   the bureaucracies and hierarchies
[02:28:04.300 --> 02:28:07.180]   that hold back innovation, brilliant minds.
[02:28:07.180 --> 02:28:12.180]   And in that sense, Doge is a kind of FU to the system
[02:28:12.180 --> 02:28:17.180]   that's kind of positive, but also kind of,
[02:28:17.180 --> 02:28:19.240]   but it was also an FU.
[02:28:19.240 --> 02:28:23.760]   So in that sense, I think Elon has a perspective
[02:28:23.760 --> 02:28:26.360]   on the world that's similar to Bitcoin, folks,
[02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:30.380]   which I really like, which is like thinking long-term.
[02:28:30.380 --> 02:28:31.520]   It's how visionaries think.
[02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:34.740]   It's like, how will, if I take these ideas,
[02:28:36.220 --> 02:28:40.880]   and the ideas hold true, what will the world look like
[02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:43.520]   in 20, 30, 50 years?
[02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:45.520]   And think about everything in that way.
[02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:50.060]   - Yeah, I like Bezos's view, which is essentially,
[02:28:50.060 --> 02:28:52.640]   how do you minimize regret?
[02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:55.380]   How do you accelerate your life mentally
[02:28:55.380 --> 02:28:57.880]   and go to 80, 90, 100, 150 years,
[02:28:57.880 --> 02:29:01.200]   whatever we end up being fortunate enough to live to,
[02:29:01.200 --> 02:29:03.140]   and then look backwards and say,
[02:29:03.140 --> 02:29:05.360]   this decision that I'm gonna make,
[02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:07.400]   I have two options.
[02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:10.240]   Which one is gonna be the one that I least regret?
[02:29:10.240 --> 02:29:13.160]   And if you continue to make decisions that way,
[02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:15.400]   one, you have that long-term view kind of built in
[02:29:15.400 --> 02:29:16.960]   'cause you're working backwards.
[02:29:16.960 --> 02:29:19.360]   Two, you are ultimately going to optimize
[02:29:19.360 --> 02:29:21.920]   for minimal regret.
[02:29:21.920 --> 02:29:26.420]   But also three is, even if you only look forward 10 years,
[02:29:26.420 --> 02:29:28.320]   that's much, much further than most people do.
[02:29:28.320 --> 02:29:30.280]   And so it gives you a significant advantage.
[02:29:30.280 --> 02:29:33.800]   And I think that Bitcoin has kind of this like,
[02:29:33.800 --> 02:29:36.120]   you know, proxy for time, as we talked about,
[02:29:36.120 --> 02:29:41.280]   interplanetary travel, where there's multiple steps
[02:29:41.280 --> 02:29:43.560]   from creating a reusable rocket to landing it
[02:29:43.560 --> 02:29:47.280]   to all this stuff, all the way to simple things
[02:29:47.280 --> 02:29:50.040]   just like if you're simply trying to figure out
[02:29:50.040 --> 02:29:52.880]   where the world's gonna be 30 years from now.
[02:29:52.880 --> 02:29:55.200]   Bill Gates says that we overestimate
[02:29:55.200 --> 02:29:56.160]   what we can do in one year,
[02:29:56.160 --> 02:29:58.760]   underestimate what we can do in 10.
[02:29:58.760 --> 02:30:03.760]   Well, to me, it's a kind of degree of mistake
[02:30:04.360 --> 02:30:08.140]   if you will, 10 years, maybe you're off by 10%.
[02:30:08.140 --> 02:30:10.240]   Well, if that line of progress continues,
[02:30:10.240 --> 02:30:13.480]   20 years, you may be off by 100%.
[02:30:13.480 --> 02:30:16.080]   And 30 years, you may be off by 1000%, right?
[02:30:16.080 --> 02:30:18.120]   Like almost the further you go out,
[02:30:18.120 --> 02:30:20.640]   the more inaccurate you become.
[02:30:20.640 --> 02:30:24.800]   And so I think that people who want to iterate
[02:30:24.800 --> 02:30:26.280]   their way to success, right?
[02:30:26.280 --> 02:30:29.240]   That's a common thing in like the startup world,
[02:30:29.240 --> 02:30:33.440]   end up actually following kind of the breadcrumbs
[02:30:33.440 --> 02:30:35.640]   to where the world is taking them.
[02:30:35.640 --> 02:30:40.080]   But people like an Elon Musk, a Jeff Bezos, a Jack Dorsey,
[02:30:40.080 --> 02:30:42.760]   all the way down the line, all these innovators,
[02:30:42.760 --> 02:30:44.800]   they actually say to themselves,
[02:30:44.800 --> 02:30:47.280]   there is a point in time in the future
[02:30:47.280 --> 02:30:50.240]   where there's a world I want to construct.
[02:30:50.240 --> 02:30:52.560]   And then they go and they construct it,
[02:30:52.560 --> 02:30:56.440]   regardless of the short-term iterations and incentives,
[02:30:56.440 --> 02:30:58.240]   it is just they're driving towards that point.
[02:30:58.240 --> 02:31:01.080]   And I think that it's this whole idea of having this like,
[02:31:01.080 --> 02:31:04.960]   you know, kind of set vision and this refusal
[02:31:04.960 --> 02:31:08.000]   to kind of move or budge off of that.
[02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:09.460]   It's what makes them special.
[02:31:09.460 --> 02:31:13.280]   - One of the things that garnered a lot of excitement
[02:31:13.280 --> 02:31:17.040]   in the crypto community is NFTs.
[02:31:17.040 --> 02:31:21.320]   I have no idea really the depths,
[02:31:21.320 --> 02:31:24.360]   the fundamental technological philosophical depths
[02:31:24.360 --> 02:31:26.560]   of this technology,
[02:31:26.560 --> 02:31:28.680]   whether this is just like a little bit of a fad
[02:31:28.680 --> 02:31:30.640]   or if there's some deep lessons to learn,
[02:31:30.640 --> 02:31:33.680]   whether it's Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general about it.
[02:31:33.680 --> 02:31:36.120]   Do you have thoughts about like the long lasting
[02:31:36.120 --> 02:31:38.760]   fundamental aspects of NFTs?
[02:31:38.760 --> 02:31:41.160]   - I think there's probably both things happening,
[02:31:41.160 --> 02:31:43.680]   fad and things to learn, right?
[02:31:43.680 --> 02:31:47.800]   And if we just start with like, what is an NFT?
[02:31:47.800 --> 02:31:49.440]   It's a non-fungible token,
[02:31:49.440 --> 02:31:52.240]   meaning that there's no fungibility.
[02:31:52.240 --> 02:31:55.320]   Fungibility is a fancy word.
[02:31:55.320 --> 02:31:57.260]   I always describe it as if I took a hundred dollar bill
[02:31:57.260 --> 02:31:58.720]   and I put it on the table with a bunch of other
[02:31:58.720 --> 02:32:00.240]   hundred dollar bills and we mixed them up
[02:32:00.240 --> 02:32:02.520]   and I just grabbed a hundred dollar bill and left.
[02:32:02.520 --> 02:32:04.480]   I'm no worse as long as they're all,
[02:32:04.480 --> 02:32:06.800]   you know, official hundred dollar bills
[02:32:06.800 --> 02:32:08.040]   because as long as I have a hundred dollars,
[02:32:08.040 --> 02:32:08.880]   I have a hundred dollars.
[02:32:08.880 --> 02:32:10.740]   I don't need that exact same bill back.
[02:32:10.740 --> 02:32:13.360]   So that means that those hundred dollar bills are fungible.
[02:32:13.360 --> 02:32:15.400]   Non-fungible would be like art.
[02:32:15.400 --> 02:32:17.680]   If I took a Picasso and I put it down on the table
[02:32:17.680 --> 02:32:19.600]   and you brought three artists that no one's ever heard of
[02:32:19.600 --> 02:32:20.920]   before and we mixed them up
[02:32:20.920 --> 02:32:22.240]   and I just took any random piece of art
[02:32:22.240 --> 02:32:23.720]   and it wasn't the Picasso,
[02:32:23.720 --> 02:32:25.800]   I lose 'cause the Picasso is really important there, right?
[02:32:25.800 --> 02:32:28.640]   So the non-fungibility is important in art.
[02:32:28.640 --> 02:32:30.920]   What these non-fungible tokens essentially are doing
[02:32:30.920 --> 02:32:35.920]   is they are creating scarcity and originality
[02:32:35.920 --> 02:32:38.400]   in a digital environment.
[02:32:38.400 --> 02:32:42.120]   And what I mean by that is take a music file.
[02:32:42.120 --> 02:32:44.240]   If I had a music file and you wanted it,
[02:32:44.240 --> 02:32:46.620]   you said, send it to me, I press send.
[02:32:46.620 --> 02:32:48.140]   It essentially creates a copy
[02:32:48.140 --> 02:32:50.240]   and you get one music file, I get another.
[02:32:50.240 --> 02:32:51.080]   We don't care.
[02:32:51.080 --> 02:32:52.320]   You can listen to music, I can listen to music,
[02:32:52.320 --> 02:32:53.980]   we're super happy.
[02:32:53.980 --> 02:32:57.280]   If I instead though, have a digital file
[02:32:57.280 --> 02:33:01.560]   that entire premise is based on scarcity
[02:33:01.560 --> 02:33:03.960]   and I hit send and you get a copy and I keep the original
[02:33:03.960 --> 02:33:07.440]   or you get the original and I get a copy, there's a problem.
[02:33:07.440 --> 02:33:11.200]   And so ultimately what I think is playing out with NFTs
[02:33:11.200 --> 02:33:13.080]   is it's a technology,
[02:33:13.080 --> 02:33:16.240]   regardless of where it plays out from blockchains
[02:33:16.240 --> 02:33:19.720]   or what communities or environments,
[02:33:19.720 --> 02:33:23.960]   that just brings true digital scarcity to the internet.
[02:33:23.960 --> 02:33:26.600]   And so naturally what do people do?
[02:33:26.600 --> 02:33:28.360]   They look at the legacy world and they say,
[02:33:28.360 --> 02:33:30.560]   well, what's scarce there that has value?
[02:33:30.560 --> 02:33:32.160]   How do we bring that to the digital world?
[02:33:32.160 --> 02:33:33.640]   So art is a perfect example.
[02:33:33.640 --> 02:33:36.880]   And frankly, last year I started to look at this
[02:33:36.880 --> 02:33:40.400]   'cause it felt like this was gonna be really, really big.
[02:33:40.400 --> 02:33:43.880]   And the conclusion I came to was
[02:33:43.880 --> 02:33:47.120]   just as Bitcoin is gonna be bigger than gold,
[02:33:47.120 --> 02:33:49.080]   the digital application of something
[02:33:49.080 --> 02:33:51.120]   is gonna be bigger than the analog application,
[02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:52.920]   the same thing's gonna be true in art.
[02:33:52.920 --> 02:33:54.520]   The digital art world is gonna be bigger
[02:33:54.520 --> 02:33:56.200]   than the traditional art world.
[02:33:56.200 --> 02:33:57.800]   People think that sounds crazy at first
[02:33:57.800 --> 02:34:00.960]   until you start to realize it's very, very similar.
[02:34:00.960 --> 02:34:02.560]   The art is more portable.
[02:34:02.560 --> 02:34:04.280]   It can be divisible, right?
[02:34:04.280 --> 02:34:05.920]   It's got a larger demand market
[02:34:05.920 --> 02:34:08.240]   in terms of the internet rather than an auction, right?
[02:34:08.240 --> 02:34:09.240]   All this kind of stuff.
[02:34:09.240 --> 02:34:13.240]   When you display it, it can have motion and music
[02:34:13.240 --> 02:34:15.120]   and all of these aspects to it
[02:34:15.120 --> 02:34:17.480]   that are better than the traditional art.
[02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:18.720]   What the traditional art market has
[02:34:18.720 --> 02:34:22.160]   that the digital art market has not had is the narrative.
[02:34:22.160 --> 02:34:27.040]   Narrative-based world, scarcity kind of in digital sense.
[02:34:27.040 --> 02:34:30.080]   And so what I think the entire world
[02:34:30.080 --> 02:34:32.520]   is going through right now is an exploration
[02:34:32.520 --> 02:34:36.520]   of how do we use this technology to create new things?
[02:34:36.520 --> 02:34:40.520]   Frankly, we're not gonna be good at it for a while.
[02:34:40.520 --> 02:34:43.160]   And so the only place I've really focused on
[02:34:43.160 --> 02:34:45.680]   is digital art itself.
[02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:48.960]   And I've always been interested in art,
[02:34:48.960 --> 02:34:51.200]   but I wasn't gonna go buy a painting
[02:34:51.200 --> 02:34:52.440]   and hang it on the wall, right?
[02:34:52.440 --> 02:34:55.000]   In the sense of that's how I was gonna store value.
[02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.880]   What I find fascinating though is
[02:34:57.880 --> 02:35:00.440]   that I now can take that concept,
[02:35:00.440 --> 02:35:03.000]   which most of the wealthiest people in the world
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:04.240]   have a significant portion.
[02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:08.080]   Some people have 20% in terms of number of billionaires.
[02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:09.960]   20% of their wealth is in art.
[02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:12.240]   And you can bring it to this digital realm,
[02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:16.160]   which is much more kind of natural to a digital native.
[02:35:16.160 --> 02:35:19.840]   And so the best way I know how to describe the importance
[02:35:19.840 --> 02:35:24.000]   is imagine a serial number being placed on something.
[02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:25.720]   Take the Eiffel Tower.
[02:35:25.720 --> 02:35:28.600]   The only Eiffel Tower that has value is the first one.
[02:35:28.600 --> 02:35:32.320]   Every replica of it, regardless of size, location,
[02:35:32.320 --> 02:35:35.480]   who made it, where they sent it, they have no value.
[02:35:35.480 --> 02:35:38.400]   Eiffel Tower 001 is the most important.
[02:35:38.400 --> 02:35:39.880]   And so I think that's ultimately
[02:35:39.880 --> 02:35:41.360]   what we're starting to see here.
[02:35:41.360 --> 02:35:44.680]   And what we're looking at is probably 1%
[02:35:44.680 --> 02:35:46.120]   of what it's gonna grow into.
[02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:48.760]   - So you're bullish on this.
[02:35:48.760 --> 02:35:51.800]   You're saying it could grow into something for 1%.
[02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:53.280]   It could grow into something significant,
[02:35:53.280 --> 02:35:55.280]   like all the kinds of different applications.
[02:35:55.280 --> 02:35:57.320]   - Strip away all of the applications right now
[02:35:57.320 --> 02:35:59.600]   and just think about is digital scarcity
[02:35:59.600 --> 02:36:00.920]   gonna be important on the internet?
[02:36:00.920 --> 02:36:02.440]   - Moving all the things that are scarce
[02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:04.400]   in the physical world into digital space,
[02:36:04.400 --> 02:36:07.320]   us trying to figure out which things can be moved and not.
[02:36:07.320 --> 02:36:09.320]   And also there is things in the digital space,
[02:36:09.320 --> 02:36:10.160]   just like you're saying,
[02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:11.920]   that don't exist in the physical world
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:15.200]   that might also benefit from gaining scarcity.
[02:36:16.840 --> 02:36:18.680]   People are, I guess, creating NFTs
[02:36:18.680 --> 02:36:20.320]   out of tweets or whatever.
[02:36:20.320 --> 02:36:23.840]   So you have a fun Twitter account.
[02:36:23.840 --> 02:36:27.360]   You could say you could put value to a single tweet
[02:36:27.360 --> 02:36:29.320]   and then be able to invest in it and trade it
[02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:32.640]   and buy parts of it and all those kinds of things.
[02:36:32.640 --> 02:36:35.120]   You can invest in people, you can invest in...
[02:36:35.120 --> 02:36:41.120]   Art can be defined broadly as any kind of creation.
[02:36:41.120 --> 02:36:45.520]   And in some sense, this whole idea of scarcity
[02:36:45.520 --> 02:36:49.320]   can overtake the entirety of the digital world.
[02:36:49.320 --> 02:36:54.320]   It can consume all of the markets
[02:36:54.320 --> 02:36:56.120]   we see as financial markets
[02:36:56.120 --> 02:36:58.400]   and just turn everything into a market.
[02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:03.400]   - Well, so if I take you on a 10-year fast forward
[02:37:03.400 --> 02:37:06.560]   and I paint a picture of something today
[02:37:06.560 --> 02:37:08.560]   that seems absolutely insane,
[02:37:08.560 --> 02:37:10.440]   but there's early signs that people are building this,
[02:37:10.440 --> 02:37:12.640]   and let's just give them the benefit of the doubt
[02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:14.200]   that some of the early iterations will work,
[02:37:14.200 --> 02:37:15.960]   and some of, or most of them won't.
[02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:20.720]   There's a world where you and I are participating
[02:37:20.720 --> 02:37:23.400]   in a digital economy, in a virtual world,
[02:37:23.400 --> 02:37:26.480]   where whether it is a piece of art,
[02:37:26.480 --> 02:37:28.400]   it is a digital sculpture,
[02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:31.640]   it is a digital skin from a video game,
[02:37:31.640 --> 02:37:36.520]   it is a digital good that we purchased somewhere online,
[02:37:36.520 --> 02:37:40.920]   and we bring it and we display it in a digital museum
[02:37:40.920 --> 02:37:42.840]   or a virtual museum.
[02:37:42.840 --> 02:37:44.400]   And so now all of a sudden,
[02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:46.400]   you can charge people for entry,
[02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:48.840]   you can consign digital goods.
[02:37:48.840 --> 02:37:51.400]   It's the replication of what happens in the analog world,
[02:37:51.400 --> 02:37:52.520]   now just in digital.
[02:37:52.520 --> 02:37:53.960]   And when you do that,
[02:37:53.960 --> 02:37:58.120]   what you do is you take the addressable markets
[02:37:58.120 --> 02:38:00.600]   of these assets or these mechanisms
[02:38:00.600 --> 02:38:03.560]   and they explode in the digital realm.
[02:38:03.560 --> 02:38:05.360]   And so now all of a sudden,
[02:38:05.360 --> 02:38:09.440]   how fast does the human race accelerate
[02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:13.600]   when it comes to human production, intelligence, learning?
[02:38:13.600 --> 02:38:16.120]   - All in the digital space. - Output.
[02:38:16.120 --> 02:38:18.920]   It's just if I said to you 20 years ago,
[02:38:18.920 --> 02:38:20.840]   I'm gonna give you a global education,
[02:38:20.840 --> 02:38:22.840]   it means I'm gonna take you
[02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:25.200]   and I'm gonna physically move you
[02:38:25.200 --> 02:38:27.960]   to geography after geography after geography.
[02:38:27.960 --> 02:38:30.440]   It's gonna take time, it's gonna take resources,
[02:38:30.440 --> 02:38:32.920]   and ultimately it's gonna take lots of effort.
[02:38:32.920 --> 02:38:33.920]   If I now said to you,
[02:38:33.920 --> 02:38:37.720]   hey, I'm gonna transport you in this virtual world
[02:38:37.720 --> 02:38:40.400]   to multiple geographies,
[02:38:40.400 --> 02:38:45.400]   but you're going to experience it in this virtual world
[02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:47.000]   and you're gonna have digital goods
[02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.920]   that you can take from economy to economy
[02:38:49.920 --> 02:38:52.520]   or from location to location,
[02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:55.000]   all of a sudden, maybe you get 90% of the value,
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:56.120]   you don't get 100% of the same value,
[02:38:56.120 --> 02:38:58.200]   we get 90% of the value,
[02:38:58.200 --> 02:39:01.120]   but you can do it at a much faster pace.
[02:39:01.120 --> 02:39:02.600]   And so in a six month period,
[02:39:02.600 --> 02:39:05.760]   you've actually made three times the progress
[02:39:05.760 --> 02:39:08.640]   than you would have if you had to do in the physical world.
[02:39:08.640 --> 02:39:10.400]   So that's where I think we're heading.
[02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:13.560]   - So there's digital art being displayed
[02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:15.800]   in the digital museum
[02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:18.040]   and people are being charged for access.
[02:39:18.040 --> 02:39:20.120]   And perhaps we plug in our senses,
[02:39:20.120 --> 02:39:22.080]   which means we start to operate more and more
[02:39:22.080 --> 02:39:24.520]   in a virtual reality, augmented reality,
[02:39:24.520 --> 02:39:27.280]   virtual reality way with this digital world
[02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:29.840]   and increasingly go into this world.
[02:39:29.840 --> 02:39:32.640]   Basically lived most of our productive
[02:39:32.640 --> 02:39:35.760]   and social lives in this digital world
[02:39:35.760 --> 02:39:40.400]   and increasingly essentially create a simulation
[02:39:40.400 --> 02:39:44.560]   where the biological basis is just there
[02:39:44.560 --> 02:39:47.160]   to sustain the brain that's used to operate
[02:39:47.160 --> 02:39:48.800]   in a virtual world.
[02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:51.360]   Taking us back to the original
[02:39:51.360 --> 02:39:53.520]   when we started talking about war,
[02:39:53.520 --> 02:39:57.560]   I wonder what conflict looks like in that world.
[02:39:57.560 --> 02:39:59.640]   That the people who are born today
[02:39:59.640 --> 02:40:03.320]   maybe will be fighting wars in the space,
[02:40:03.320 --> 02:40:06.640]   in that museum world, in that digital world.
[02:40:06.640 --> 02:40:07.880]   - Remember what I said,
[02:40:07.880 --> 02:40:10.440]   we're moving from a world of conflict
[02:40:10.440 --> 02:40:14.880]   surrounded and determined by bombs, bullets and soldiers
[02:40:14.880 --> 02:40:19.320]   to a battlefield that is determined by war of information
[02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:21.960]   and cyber capabilities.
[02:40:21.960 --> 02:40:24.360]   And so in that virtual world,
[02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:28.960]   is it about death and destruction of human life
[02:40:28.960 --> 02:40:31.480]   in the physical analog world
[02:40:31.480 --> 02:40:34.400]   or will it become more important to attack
[02:40:34.400 --> 02:40:38.400]   or defend virtual property and virtual life
[02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:41.280]   and some level of virtual sovereignty?
[02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:45.800]   In my opinion, the latter is more likely.
[02:40:45.800 --> 02:40:48.240]   And so what you start to understand is,
[02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:52.080]   well, what do you truly value in your life?
[02:40:52.080 --> 02:40:57.080]   Is it the physical analog, materialistic, consumptive goods
[02:40:58.320 --> 02:40:59.440]   or is it virtual?
[02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:03.000]   And in many cases, something as simple
[02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:06.960]   as the ability to connect with somebody
[02:41:06.960 --> 02:41:08.640]   is really important.
[02:41:08.640 --> 02:41:11.640]   And so one of the most disruptive, combative,
[02:41:11.640 --> 02:41:13.400]   violent things that a country may do
[02:41:13.400 --> 02:41:15.120]   to another country in the future,
[02:41:15.120 --> 02:41:16.520]   simply take down the internet
[02:41:16.520 --> 02:41:20.880]   and put people in isolation.
[02:41:20.880 --> 02:41:21.720]   - Yeah.
[02:41:21.720 --> 02:41:23.000]   - I don't need to physically harm you
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.120]   if I can psychologically harm you.
[02:41:25.120 --> 02:41:26.160]   I don't need to--
[02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:27.320]   - It's terrifying.
[02:41:27.320 --> 02:41:32.320]   - Yeah, I don't need to actually convince you
[02:41:32.320 --> 02:41:36.400]   through a monopoly on violence, on physical violence.
[02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:38.160]   What if I can psychologically change
[02:41:38.160 --> 02:41:41.040]   the way you see the world through misinformation,
[02:41:41.040 --> 02:41:44.160]   through all sorts of nefarious activities?
[02:41:44.160 --> 02:41:45.920]   And I think that the United States
[02:41:45.920 --> 02:41:47.240]   has been struggling with this idea
[02:41:47.240 --> 02:41:49.920]   over the last couple of years in the political arena.
[02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:51.320]   But what happens when it starts to come
[02:41:51.320 --> 02:41:53.340]   to other aspects of our life?
[02:41:53.340 --> 02:41:56.000]   - And I think it's very likely.
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:57.760]   It's almost obviously likely
[02:41:57.760 --> 02:41:59.960]   that we're moving into the digital world.
[02:41:59.960 --> 02:42:05.360]   One of the features of the digital world
[02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:08.440]   is that artificial intelligence systems
[02:42:08.440 --> 02:42:10.960]   can operate with much more power
[02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:14.480]   in a frictionless way in that world,
[02:42:14.480 --> 02:42:15.840]   currently as we understand it.
[02:42:15.840 --> 02:42:19.720]   It's hard to build robots that operate at scale
[02:42:19.720 --> 02:42:22.800]   and do arbitrary large amount of impact,
[02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:26.200]   damage or positive in the physical world.
[02:42:26.200 --> 02:42:28.920]   It's much easier to do in the digital world.
[02:42:28.920 --> 02:42:33.660]   Do you ever think about AI systems just swimming about,
[02:42:33.660 --> 02:42:37.680]   doing extraordinarily powerful,
[02:42:37.680 --> 02:42:40.280]   destructive things in the digital world?
[02:42:40.280 --> 02:42:42.520]   Is that something of a concern to you?
[02:42:42.520 --> 02:42:44.960]   Or is this something into a very distant future?
[02:42:44.960 --> 02:42:50.780]   - I think a lot of artificial intelligence is in the name.
[02:42:52.040 --> 02:42:54.800]   It's simply the replication of human intelligence
[02:42:54.800 --> 02:42:59.800]   at scale, automated and programmatic.
[02:42:59.800 --> 02:43:03.920]   Meaning that in the analog world,
[02:43:03.920 --> 02:43:05.880]   you could go hire a thousand employees
[02:43:05.880 --> 02:43:09.500]   or in an Amazon case, hire millions of employees
[02:43:09.500 --> 02:43:13.520]   and set a mission or a goal and push them to go do that.
[02:43:13.520 --> 02:43:17.920]   That requires recruiting, retention, training,
[02:43:17.920 --> 02:43:19.240]   resources, all that stuff.
[02:43:20.720 --> 02:43:23.840]   In the virtual world or in this digital economy,
[02:43:23.840 --> 02:43:26.340]   what if you can just program the resources
[02:43:26.340 --> 02:43:29.360]   and gain the same leverage and do it at scale
[02:43:29.360 --> 02:43:32.080]   and do it in a very programmatic way
[02:43:32.080 --> 02:43:35.680]   and then have them actually make decisions
[02:43:35.680 --> 02:43:38.440]   in a way that doesn't require you to have thought
[02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:42.760]   of every single potential scenario or edge case.
[02:43:42.760 --> 02:43:43.600]   That's ultimately what we're talking about
[02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:45.920]   when we talk about artificial intelligence.
[02:43:45.920 --> 02:43:48.000]   And so when you look at that,
[02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:49.760]   when technology's created,
[02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:52.400]   everyone uses it for good or bad,
[02:43:52.400 --> 02:43:54.280]   but both get used, right?
[02:43:54.280 --> 02:43:56.040]   And so whether we're talking about cell phones,
[02:43:56.040 --> 02:43:59.520]   beepers, the internet, guns, whatever,
[02:43:59.520 --> 02:44:01.880]   it's always used for good and bad.
[02:44:01.880 --> 02:44:04.200]   The big question is, and I think that yourself
[02:44:04.200 --> 02:44:07.040]   and many other people have rightfully said this,
[02:44:07.040 --> 02:44:10.120]   is the question really becomes,
[02:44:10.120 --> 02:44:14.640]   is the negative and nefarious uses of this
[02:44:14.640 --> 02:44:17.000]   inadvertent potentially?
[02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.760]   Or does it actually come from a malicious person?
[02:44:19.760 --> 02:44:21.720]   Is the intention malicious?
[02:44:21.720 --> 02:44:23.400]   And to me, that's what I, I don't know enough.
[02:44:23.400 --> 02:44:24.480]   You know much more about this
[02:44:24.480 --> 02:44:26.720]   and there's plenty of other people who do as well,
[02:44:26.720 --> 02:44:31.320]   but I do think that there will be nefarious actors
[02:44:31.320 --> 02:44:32.720]   and malicious people,
[02:44:32.720 --> 02:44:34.520]   but we're gonna treat them the same way
[02:44:34.520 --> 02:44:36.960]   we've always treated people who use technology poorly.
[02:44:36.960 --> 02:44:37.800]   Right?
[02:44:37.800 --> 02:44:39.720]   We're gonna understand it, we're gonna identify it,
[02:44:39.720 --> 02:44:40.560]   we're gonna control it,
[02:44:40.560 --> 02:44:42.160]   and then we're gonna end up reversing it
[02:44:42.160 --> 02:44:44.160]   or preventing them from doing that.
[02:44:44.160 --> 02:44:45.720]   It's the inadvertent things
[02:44:45.720 --> 02:44:47.800]   that I think are actually the most dangerous
[02:44:47.800 --> 02:44:50.800]   because when you have something that can think for itself
[02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:56.200]   and there is no way to leverage a monopoly on violence
[02:44:56.200 --> 02:45:00.280]   for control, it's a very scary thing.
[02:45:00.280 --> 02:45:02.880]   - It can, I mean, the thing that's scary to me
[02:45:02.880 --> 02:45:05.160]   is that it can scale arbitrarily.
[02:45:05.160 --> 02:45:07.680]   So it can outnumber humans very quickly,
[02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:10.600]   even if it's dumber than humans.
[02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:15.600]   And so I don't know if we're able to reason about a world
[02:45:16.600 --> 02:45:19.440]   like let's look at the physical analog
[02:45:19.440 --> 02:45:20.960]   where all of a sudden,
[02:45:20.960 --> 02:45:24.960]   let's talk about something kind of like humans
[02:45:24.960 --> 02:45:27.800]   but dumber than humans, like chimps, okay?
[02:45:27.800 --> 02:45:31.360]   Imagine that all of a sudden chimps could multiply
[02:45:31.360 --> 02:45:36.720]   arbitrarily quickly and you could have like a trillion
[02:45:36.720 --> 02:45:41.200]   chimps the next day when you only had maybe a million
[02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:42.640]   the day before.
[02:45:42.640 --> 02:45:45.560]   Like how does that world look different?
[02:45:45.560 --> 02:45:48.120]   Like where the fuck do all these chimps come from?
[02:45:48.120 --> 02:45:51.200]   - And then we can pretend to be like,
[02:45:51.200 --> 02:45:54.120]   well, let's hope the chimps don't get violent
[02:45:54.120 --> 02:45:56.640]   'cause they don't seem to get violent
[02:45:56.640 --> 02:45:59.400]   when the resources aren't constrained.
[02:45:59.400 --> 02:46:01.400]   But we don't know.
[02:46:01.400 --> 02:46:04.640]   And the problem is it all starts by building
[02:46:04.640 --> 02:46:07.880]   that first chimp multiplier device.
[02:46:07.880 --> 02:46:09.240]   And everyone's like, okay, yeah,
[02:46:09.240 --> 02:46:10.640]   there's a lot of good applications.
[02:46:10.640 --> 02:46:15.440]   You want, you can make all kinds of arguments
[02:46:15.440 --> 02:46:17.560]   for why you have more chimps.
[02:46:17.560 --> 02:46:19.520]   Maybe they can help you out around the house
[02:46:19.520 --> 02:46:21.800]   or something like that in the physical space.
[02:46:21.800 --> 02:46:25.800]   But ultimately it's the unintended consequences
[02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:27.000]   that you're referring to.
[02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:28.880]   You don't know what's gonna happen.
[02:46:28.880 --> 02:46:33.280]   I'm really worried about dumb AI agents
[02:46:33.280 --> 02:46:38.880]   like having impact when they're multiplied
[02:46:38.880 --> 02:46:42.680]   to a million to a billion and are allowed to operate
[02:46:42.680 --> 02:46:46.600]   in the digital space, especially as we clearly
[02:46:46.600 --> 02:46:49.440]   are moving more and more of our lives
[02:46:49.440 --> 02:46:51.040]   into the digital space.
[02:46:51.040 --> 02:46:54.960]   So it's kind of terrifying 'cause a lot of people
[02:46:54.960 --> 02:46:59.160]   are terrified or concerned about superintelligent systems.
[02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:02.640]   I think I'm definitely much more concerned
[02:47:02.640 --> 02:47:05.880]   about super dumb systems at scale.
[02:47:05.880 --> 02:47:07.560]   That's terrifying.
[02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:10.040]   - I always think about the inadvertent,
[02:47:10.040 --> 02:47:11.800]   but as you were talking, what it made me think of
[02:47:11.800 --> 02:47:14.280]   is also the irreversible.
[02:47:14.280 --> 02:47:15.120]   - Irreversible, that's, yeah.
[02:47:15.120 --> 02:47:18.560]   - Right, so it's one thing if there's inadvertent
[02:47:18.560 --> 02:47:21.360]   negative impact, but we have reversibility
[02:47:21.360 --> 02:47:24.160]   built into a system and we can fix our mistakes.
[02:47:24.160 --> 02:47:25.000]   - Yeah.
[02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.120]   - I think the really scary part is when you overlay
[02:47:27.120 --> 02:47:31.080]   inadvertent mistakes with the irreversible aspect of it
[02:47:31.080 --> 02:47:34.160]   and therefore humans have no control.
[02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:38.320]   - Yeah, if you have the trillion chimps, you can't,
[02:47:38.320 --> 02:47:39.960]   they're not gonna like it when you try
[02:47:39.960 --> 02:47:41.880]   to start killing them off.
[02:47:41.880 --> 02:47:44.680]   (laughing)
[02:47:44.680 --> 02:47:47.240]   All right, but back to Bitcoin.
[02:47:47.240 --> 02:47:48.720]   (laughing)
[02:47:48.720 --> 02:47:50.560]   - Those chimps in the Bitcoin community.
[02:47:50.560 --> 02:47:51.600]   (laughing)
[02:47:51.600 --> 02:47:53.920]   - Anytime you bring up chimps, some people say,
[02:47:53.920 --> 02:47:55.680]   Joe Rogan entered the chat.
[02:47:55.680 --> 02:47:59.240]   Can I ask you about sort of learning about Bitcoin books
[02:47:59.240 --> 02:48:02.280]   and resources, you have an amazing podcast
[02:48:02.280 --> 02:48:05.440]   that's not just about Bitcoin or cryptocurrency,
[02:48:05.440 --> 02:48:07.280]   it's about everything, including life,
[02:48:07.280 --> 02:48:10.360]   but you do have a lot of really amazing conversations
[02:48:10.360 --> 02:48:14.320]   about this whole digital world,
[02:48:14.320 --> 02:48:17.400]   but obviously you also have a newsletter
[02:48:17.400 --> 02:48:19.440]   that's incredible on Substack,
[02:48:19.440 --> 02:48:25.200]   but do you have recommendations?
[02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:27.560]   Maybe it would be great if you could talk about,
[02:48:27.560 --> 02:48:30.960]   first of all, your podcast and the newsletter,
[02:48:30.960 --> 02:48:33.200]   but also other resources that you recommend
[02:48:33.200 --> 02:48:36.600]   people should check out in order to learn about Bitcoin.
[02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:39.720]   - Yeah, so the podcast and email
[02:48:39.720 --> 02:48:41.960]   are like the two most selfish things I do,
[02:48:41.960 --> 02:48:43.680]   because the podcast is a way for me
[02:48:43.680 --> 02:48:44.800]   to learn from other people.
[02:48:44.800 --> 02:48:46.800]   So I get them to come on and tell me
[02:48:46.800 --> 02:48:48.040]   all the things they're thinking about,
[02:48:48.040 --> 02:48:49.280]   and I get asked some questions.
[02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:50.520]   - What's it called, by the way?
[02:48:50.520 --> 02:48:52.240]   - Just the Pomp Podcast.
[02:48:52.240 --> 02:48:57.240]   And so in doing that, it really is informative for me,
[02:48:57.240 --> 02:48:59.000]   and I think that my whole goal is just like,
[02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.080]   if I'm learning, other people will be learning.
[02:49:01.080 --> 02:49:03.560]   And then the email, I read it every morning
[02:49:03.560 --> 02:49:06.160]   because it forces me to collect my thoughts
[02:49:06.160 --> 02:49:09.840]   and actually articulate them in somewhat of a coherent way.
[02:49:09.840 --> 02:49:13.040]   And so it's just something that is like a practice
[02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:14.920]   that I probably would do even if no one read it.
[02:49:14.920 --> 02:49:17.360]   And then by being able to publish it,
[02:49:17.360 --> 02:49:18.200]   what does it do?
[02:49:18.200 --> 02:49:20.920]   It elicits both the good and bad responses.
[02:49:20.920 --> 02:49:22.760]   And so people will let me know if they think I'm an idiot,
[02:49:22.760 --> 02:49:24.400]   and they'll usually not respond
[02:49:24.400 --> 02:49:25.560]   if they think that it's something smart.
[02:49:25.560 --> 02:49:30.160]   And so those two things are really educational for me,
[02:49:30.160 --> 02:49:31.760]   and I think kind of forced me
[02:49:31.760 --> 02:49:34.760]   to be able to articulate a lot of ideas.
[02:49:34.760 --> 02:49:37.200]   But a lot of what I share or learn on those things
[02:49:37.200 --> 02:49:38.720]   come from these other resources.
[02:49:38.720 --> 02:49:41.440]   - So I'm definitely subscribing, people should subscribe,
[02:49:41.440 --> 02:49:46.080]   but what are Bitcoin resources books that you recommend?
[02:49:46.080 --> 02:49:48.120]   - I think you gotta start with Bitcoin Standard.
[02:49:48.120 --> 02:49:49.840]   That one to me feels like
[02:49:49.840 --> 02:49:51.940]   it really lays out the picture nicely.
[02:49:51.940 --> 02:49:56.480]   There is Bitcoin Money You Can't Fuck With.
[02:49:56.480 --> 02:49:58.560]   It was written by our friend Jason Williams.
[02:49:58.560 --> 02:50:01.840]   As you can imagine, it's basically what it talks about.
[02:50:01.840 --> 02:50:03.600]   There's another book, Layered Money.
[02:50:03.600 --> 02:50:07.040]   It was written by Nick who's done a great job
[02:50:07.040 --> 02:50:08.680]   kind of laying it out.
[02:50:08.680 --> 02:50:11.080]   There's a book called Bitcoin in Black America
[02:50:11.080 --> 02:50:13.120]   written by a guy, Isaiah Jackson.
[02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:14.920]   And he basically lays out the argument
[02:50:14.920 --> 02:50:18.440]   for why the black community can benefit
[02:50:18.440 --> 02:50:21.360]   in a asymmetric way from something like Bitcoin.
[02:50:21.360 --> 02:50:22.800]   And there's a whole bunch more,
[02:50:22.800 --> 02:50:24.480]   I'm gonna forget them all.
[02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:27.000]   There's the, I think it's called The Cost of Tomorrow.
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:31.000]   A guy, Jeff Booth wrote it.
[02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:32.720]   And just, if you get on Twitter, basically,
[02:50:32.720 --> 02:50:35.400]   you're gonna see all these books flying around.
[02:50:35.400 --> 02:50:40.400]   But I do have to say that from a psychological concept
[02:50:40.400 --> 02:50:42.520]   or philosophical concept,
[02:50:42.520 --> 02:50:45.040]   the number one book that I've ever read
[02:50:45.040 --> 02:50:46.440]   that aligns with Bitcoin ethos
[02:50:46.440 --> 02:50:48.000]   but doesn't say a word about Bitcoin
[02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:51.440]   is a book called The Dow of Capital by Mark Spitznagel.
[02:50:51.440 --> 02:50:53.300]   And so what he essentially does
[02:50:53.300 --> 02:50:56.060]   is he just reiterates over and over and over again
[02:50:56.060 --> 02:51:00.120]   long-term thinking, outliers, disruption, all this stuff.
[02:51:00.120 --> 02:51:02.800]   And so he's a guy who, he runs a fund
[02:51:02.800 --> 02:51:06.200]   that essentially they just do a tail risk hedging.
[02:51:06.200 --> 02:51:10.000]   And so in March or February of 2020,
[02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:13.520]   they're up like 4,000%, right?
[02:51:13.520 --> 02:51:15.480]   By the way, they pretty much lose money
[02:51:15.480 --> 02:51:18.360]   for eight, nine years, then that happens.
[02:51:18.360 --> 02:51:21.880]   And so, but they're still one of the best performing funds
[02:51:21.880 --> 02:51:23.800]   if you look at it over years and years.
[02:51:23.800 --> 02:51:26.240]   And so it's just this mindset of
[02:51:26.240 --> 02:51:28.280]   everyone is so short-term focused.
[02:51:28.280 --> 02:51:29.640]   And so I think it's just a great reminder
[02:51:29.640 --> 02:51:30.700]   of long-term thinking.
[02:51:30.700 --> 02:51:35.120]   - And also, I mean, I've gotten quite a bit of value
[02:51:35.120 --> 02:51:36.240]   just reading the papers.
[02:51:36.240 --> 02:51:38.520]   And that's perhaps more like for technical folks.
[02:51:38.520 --> 02:51:41.120]   There's quite an active research community.
[02:51:41.120 --> 02:51:43.320]   And also going back to the original white paper
[02:51:43.320 --> 02:51:46.400]   and just original documents, old school.
[02:51:46.400 --> 02:51:50.360]   Old school is still, like a few years ago,
[02:51:50.360 --> 02:51:54.320]   it's still really interesting to think about,
[02:51:54.320 --> 02:51:56.960]   to look at what people were thinking about
[02:51:56.960 --> 02:52:00.520]   because the principles are carried through
[02:52:00.520 --> 02:52:02.600]   with other cryptocurrencies as well.
[02:52:02.600 --> 02:52:06.880]   Like it's all there, even in the early documents.
[02:52:06.880 --> 02:52:09.600]   So that's kind of fascinating to see that whole history
[02:52:09.600 --> 02:52:12.000]   from if you're more like tech savvy.
[02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.480]   And like you said, Twitter is actually an interesting place.
[02:52:14.480 --> 02:52:17.100]   If you can look up past all the shit coin talk,
[02:52:17.100 --> 02:52:21.680]   it's a fascinating place for news and resources.
[02:52:21.680 --> 02:52:24.560]   Is there books outside of all of this cryptocurrency
[02:52:24.560 --> 02:52:26.880]   sort of technical fiction philosophical
[02:52:26.880 --> 02:52:29.200]   that impact on your life?
[02:52:29.200 --> 02:52:32.060]   Because you have interests that are all over the place.
[02:52:32.060 --> 02:52:36.440]   Is there something that you would recommend to others?
[02:52:36.440 --> 02:52:37.960]   - So "Dow of Capital" is definitely probably
[02:52:37.960 --> 02:52:39.180]   my favorite book.
[02:52:39.180 --> 02:52:41.960]   Books that have been impactful.
[02:52:41.960 --> 02:52:43.520]   I read when I was 20, actually,
[02:52:43.520 --> 02:52:45.760]   "Sitting in the Desert of Iraq,"
[02:52:45.760 --> 02:52:47.680]   "Rich Dad, Poor Dad," "Thinking Grow Rich,"
[02:52:47.680 --> 02:52:49.440]   and "The Richest Man in Babylon."
[02:52:49.440 --> 02:52:52.080]   And I don't think I took a single thing
[02:52:52.080 --> 02:52:55.880]   and implemented it from an execution standpoint,
[02:52:55.880 --> 02:52:59.200]   but it was a complete shift in mentality
[02:52:59.200 --> 02:53:01.520]   and understanding and relationship with money
[02:53:01.520 --> 02:53:04.440]   and just kind of what I wanted to do with my life
[02:53:04.440 --> 02:53:05.280]   and stuff like that.
[02:53:05.280 --> 02:53:06.100]   So I think those three books,
[02:53:06.100 --> 02:53:09.360]   and I read them in succession, were really impactful.
[02:53:09.360 --> 02:53:11.000]   And then I think one of the best books
[02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:12.280]   probably ever written is,
[02:53:12.280 --> 02:53:15.000]   I think it's called "When Breath Becomes Air,"
[02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.400]   or "Air Becomes Breath," I can't remember.
[02:53:17.400 --> 02:53:20.620]   But it's basically a doctor or a medical professional
[02:53:20.620 --> 02:53:23.480]   who's dying, and he essentially writes
[02:53:23.480 --> 02:53:25.640]   about the experience and thoughts
[02:53:25.640 --> 02:53:26.680]   and kind of all the stuff.
[02:53:26.680 --> 02:53:30.240]   And I think that it's just one of these things
[02:53:30.240 --> 02:53:31.200]   where if you said to me,
[02:53:31.200 --> 02:53:32.760]   "What's the number one thing I took out
[02:53:32.760 --> 02:53:35.240]   "of my experience in Iraq?"
[02:53:35.240 --> 02:53:36.920]   That's a book like that also gives you
[02:53:36.920 --> 02:53:39.120]   is we're all gonna die, right?
[02:53:39.120 --> 02:53:41.620]   And you and I can wanna be as immortal as we want,
[02:53:41.620 --> 02:53:42.800]   but at some point we're gonna die.
[02:53:42.800 --> 02:53:45.600]   And so it really does kind of focus you
[02:53:45.600 --> 02:53:48.120]   on time being that scarce asset
[02:53:48.120 --> 02:53:51.720]   and use it for enjoyment and happiness
[02:53:51.720 --> 02:53:52.800]   more so than anything else.
[02:53:52.800 --> 02:53:54.080]   And I think that's part of your message,
[02:53:54.080 --> 02:53:55.280]   and it's a great one.
[02:53:55.280 --> 02:53:58.600]   - Do you think you literally meditate
[02:53:58.600 --> 02:53:59.840]   on your own mortality?
[02:53:59.840 --> 02:54:02.800]   - I don't necessarily think I meditate on it
[02:54:02.800 --> 02:54:04.120]   as much as--
[02:54:04.120 --> 02:54:05.840]   - Are you afraid of death?
[02:54:05.840 --> 02:54:07.600]   Were you afraid of death when you were in Iraq?
[02:54:07.600 --> 02:54:09.640]   I mean, coming face to face with it,
[02:54:09.640 --> 02:54:11.200]   are you afraid of death today?
[02:54:11.200 --> 02:54:13.120]   - No, I think that it was just one of these things
[02:54:13.120 --> 02:54:16.600]   where if you fixate on something
[02:54:16.600 --> 02:54:18.360]   and you worry about it,
[02:54:18.360 --> 02:54:23.140]   then, at least to me, you become uneasy about it.
[02:54:23.140 --> 02:54:28.140]   And so after an experience like going to war,
[02:54:28.140 --> 02:54:31.360]   I think that everything is just so not important
[02:54:31.360 --> 02:54:32.600]   compared to that, right?
[02:54:32.600 --> 02:54:33.840]   Like when I came back,
[02:54:33.840 --> 02:54:36.760]   I remember going back into the college environment
[02:54:36.760 --> 02:54:38.480]   and things people were worried about,
[02:54:38.480 --> 02:54:41.240]   I was like, "Listen, let me explain to you
[02:54:41.240 --> 02:54:44.000]   "what the real world's like," right?
[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:45.560]   But I think even today, right,
[02:54:45.560 --> 02:54:47.560]   if you talk to people who know me really well,
[02:54:47.560 --> 02:54:49.120]   I don't get worked up about a lot of stuff.
[02:54:49.120 --> 02:54:53.000]   I don't get in either direction, good or bad, anything,
[02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.360]   because ultimately it just comes down to
[02:54:55.360 --> 02:54:59.340]   if that's the final result, let's enjoy it.
[02:54:59.340 --> 02:55:01.540]   - It's fascinating to ask you,
[02:55:01.540 --> 02:55:06.540]   because this reformulation of money essentially buying time,
[02:55:06.540 --> 02:55:13.260]   and there's the old question of does money buy happiness?
[02:55:13.260 --> 02:55:20.540]   Do you think money can buy happiness
[02:55:20.540 --> 02:55:23.780]   in the context of money being able to buy time,
[02:55:23.780 --> 02:55:28.040]   or is happiness something else that is beyond all of this?
[02:55:28.040 --> 02:55:30.940]   - When people talk about this question,
[02:55:30.940 --> 02:55:33.800]   I think that they really focus on money
[02:55:33.800 --> 02:55:36.980]   as a means to getting materialistic things.
[02:55:36.980 --> 02:55:39.160]   So they want a big house, they want a boat,
[02:55:39.160 --> 02:55:42.660]   they want a fast car, they want whatever.
[02:55:42.660 --> 02:55:45.780]   They think that's the stuff that will make them happy.
[02:55:45.780 --> 02:55:49.420]   What I think about it is if you have resources,
[02:55:49.420 --> 02:55:51.660]   you can have time, and if you have time,
[02:55:51.660 --> 02:55:54.540]   and you spend it the way that you want to spend it,
[02:55:54.540 --> 02:55:55.620]   then that's ultimately happiness.
[02:55:55.620 --> 02:55:56.460]   So I always say to people,
[02:55:56.460 --> 02:55:59.420]   if you think that money doesn't buy you happiness,
[02:55:59.420 --> 02:56:01.220]   what if I told you that if you had more money
[02:56:01.220 --> 02:56:03.220]   you could spend more time with your family?
[02:56:03.220 --> 02:56:05.660]   It reframes it.
[02:56:05.660 --> 02:56:09.540]   And now it's all about I want to do certain things in life,
[02:56:09.540 --> 02:56:11.700]   but there's a lot of people who spend their life
[02:56:11.700 --> 02:56:15.420]   not doing those things because they feel the need
[02:56:15.420 --> 02:56:20.420]   to pursue economic means as a way to provide a living
[02:56:20.420 --> 02:56:21.540]   or whatever.
[02:56:21.540 --> 02:56:23.940]   And so I explain that, I say, listen, in my opinion,
[02:56:23.940 --> 02:56:26.820]   again, it's my opinion, it's what makes me happy,
[02:56:26.820 --> 02:56:30.420]   if I can leverage financial resources to create more time
[02:56:30.420 --> 02:56:32.520]   to do the things I like, I'm happier.
[02:56:32.520 --> 02:56:35.340]   Might not work for everybody,
[02:56:35.340 --> 02:56:36.860]   but that's what works for me.
[02:56:36.860 --> 02:56:38.720]   And so there's this element of,
[02:56:38.720 --> 02:56:39.860]   I don't care what other people think
[02:56:39.860 --> 02:56:42.260]   if they like that or not, because they're not me.
[02:56:42.260 --> 02:56:45.140]   There's almost this element of you gotta figure out
[02:56:45.140 --> 02:56:48.220]   what works for you, and if it works for me, then like--
[02:56:48.220 --> 02:56:51.540]   - No, I think that will resonate with a lot of people.
[02:56:51.540 --> 02:56:53.980]   I think that's a brilliant reframing of it.
[02:56:53.980 --> 02:56:58.900]   That said, you kind of imply there's a reason
[02:56:58.900 --> 02:57:02.020]   behind this whole existence of ours, there's a meaning to it.
[02:57:02.020 --> 02:57:06.380]   So let me ask, what is the meaning of life, Anthony?
[02:57:06.380 --> 02:57:09.480]   Do you think about these ridiculous big questions
[02:57:09.480 --> 02:57:11.540]   that have no answer every once in a while,
[02:57:11.540 --> 02:57:14.620]   or do you just enjoy the shit out of every day?
[02:57:14.620 --> 02:57:18.900]   - I answer it in a way that isn't meant to be accurate.
[02:57:18.900 --> 02:57:23.900]   It's meant to be the right answer for me,
[02:57:23.900 --> 02:57:27.140]   which is ultimately, and I talk to a lot of people
[02:57:27.140 --> 02:57:29.020]   who always ask, what are you doing?
[02:57:29.020 --> 02:57:29.860]   Why are you doing this?
[02:57:29.860 --> 02:57:31.180]   I say, it's to be happy.
[02:57:31.180 --> 02:57:34.580]   And the reason why I think of it that way
[02:57:34.580 --> 02:57:35.780]   is I've got a friend, Jonathan Geller,
[02:57:35.780 --> 02:57:39.780]   who talks about enough being enough.
[02:57:39.780 --> 02:57:43.420]   And recently he talked about it in the context of Bitcoin.
[02:57:43.420 --> 02:57:45.300]   And so Bitcoiners have two things.
[02:57:45.300 --> 02:57:46.460]   Any Bitcoiner, if you talk to them,
[02:57:46.460 --> 02:57:47.500]   they believe the same two things.
[02:57:47.500 --> 02:57:50.140]   One, they don't want the US dollar price to go up
[02:57:50.140 --> 02:57:52.020]   because they actually wanna acquire more Bitcoin, right?
[02:57:52.020 --> 02:57:54.260]   And then let it go once they feel like they've got enough.
[02:57:54.260 --> 02:57:55.460]   But two is, no matter how much they own,
[02:57:55.460 --> 02:57:57.060]   they think that they don't own enough
[02:57:57.060 --> 02:57:58.700]   and they wanna acquire more.
[02:57:58.700 --> 02:58:03.700]   And so at some point, you say to yourself, what is enough?
[02:58:03.700 --> 02:58:06.740]   And I think that the whole meaning of life
[02:58:06.740 --> 02:58:11.740]   is to understand kind of what your level of satisfaction is.
[02:58:12.420 --> 02:58:14.020]   And for some people, that's a monetary thing.
[02:58:14.020 --> 02:58:16.100]   Some people, that's a freedom of time thing.
[02:58:16.100 --> 02:58:18.420]   For some people, it's an impact thing, whatever.
[02:58:18.420 --> 02:58:20.380]   But just understanding that's important
[02:58:20.380 --> 02:58:22.540]   and then going and accomplishing it.
[02:58:22.540 --> 02:58:25.540]   And what I've found is that the people who I know
[02:58:25.540 --> 02:58:27.940]   who have done this and been intentional about it,
[02:58:27.940 --> 02:58:30.060]   they accomplish it on a much shorter timeline
[02:58:30.060 --> 02:58:31.420]   than people who don't.
[02:58:31.420 --> 02:58:32.260]   There's some people who start thinking about this
[02:58:32.260 --> 02:58:33.140]   when they're 60.
[02:58:33.140 --> 02:58:35.900]   Naturally, you're not gonna accomplish it before you're 60
[02:58:35.900 --> 02:58:37.820]   if you just start thinking about it at 60.
[02:58:37.820 --> 02:58:39.420]   People who start thinking about it earlier can do it.
[02:58:39.420 --> 02:58:40.620]   And so I think that's really it.
[02:58:40.620 --> 02:58:42.140]   For me, it's just like the meaning of life
[02:58:42.140 --> 02:58:43.340]   is to enjoy it.
[02:58:43.340 --> 02:58:44.580]   - The way I think about it,
[02:58:44.580 --> 02:58:46.420]   that's 'cause this is a really nice formulation.
[02:58:46.420 --> 02:58:49.100]   I almost like to sort of oscillate back and forth.
[02:58:49.100 --> 02:58:52.180]   So majority of the time is spent
[02:58:52.180 --> 02:58:56.020]   in the mode of enough is enough, of gratitude,
[02:58:56.020 --> 02:58:58.620]   of basically being content with where you're at,
[02:58:58.620 --> 02:59:01.220]   like deeply appreciative of every moment
[02:59:01.220 --> 02:59:03.820]   and all the Bitcoin, whatever Bitcoin you have,
[02:59:03.820 --> 02:59:06.900]   being deeply appreciative of it and that being enough.
[02:59:06.900 --> 02:59:09.100]   And then some fraction of time,
[02:59:09.100 --> 02:59:10.860]   perhaps it shrinks as you get older.
[02:59:10.860 --> 02:59:13.020]   That's maybe there's an optimal trajectory there,
[02:59:13.020 --> 02:59:15.620]   but some fraction of time is spent being
[02:59:15.620 --> 02:59:19.420]   deeply self-critical and nothing is enough.
[02:59:19.420 --> 02:59:21.940]   Nothing you've ever done is worth anything.
[02:59:21.940 --> 02:59:23.620]   It's the Marvin Minsky said,
[02:59:23.620 --> 02:59:28.000]   the secret to success is hating everything you've ever done.
[02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:31.540]   So that mode of just hating everything you've ever done
[02:59:31.540 --> 02:59:34.860]   and just trying to improve, trying to make stuff better,
[02:59:34.860 --> 02:59:37.940]   nothing is enough, it's never enough, that kind of stuff.
[02:59:37.940 --> 02:59:39.960]   And then oscillating back and forth.
[02:59:39.960 --> 02:59:41.780]   You don't have to have the same algorithm
[02:59:41.780 --> 02:59:42.940]   operating throughout the day.
[02:59:42.940 --> 02:59:45.100]   You could just like oscillate back and forth
[02:59:45.100 --> 02:59:48.220]   and maybe reserve that gratitude part,
[02:59:48.220 --> 02:59:50.780]   the chill part to when you're hanging out with family
[02:59:50.780 --> 02:59:52.100]   and friends and loved ones.
[02:59:52.100 --> 02:59:55.540]   And then when you're like alone or maybe at work,
[02:59:55.540 --> 02:59:58.260]   that's the madman comes out kind of thing.
[02:59:58.260 --> 03:00:00.860]   - I also think it's kind of purpose-driven
[03:00:00.860 --> 03:00:04.020]   in the sense of there's a lot of people who have the,
[03:00:04.020 --> 03:00:08.420]   I need to do more, but in a somewhat altruistic way.
[03:00:08.420 --> 03:00:10.980]   So take Elon as an example.
[03:00:10.980 --> 03:00:15.560]   The idea of colonizing Mars,
[03:00:15.560 --> 03:00:18.800]   sure, if he is successful, he will be very rich.
[03:00:18.800 --> 03:00:20.540]   I don't think you or I or many people
[03:00:20.540 --> 03:00:22.560]   believe he's doing it for the money.
[03:00:22.560 --> 03:00:23.640]   There's a lot of other things he could do
[03:00:23.640 --> 03:00:26.880]   that would be much easier that would make him tons of money.
[03:00:26.880 --> 03:00:31.120]   And so in some weird way, he has enough
[03:00:31.120 --> 03:00:35.960]   because he's able to free himself from the constraints of,
[03:00:35.960 --> 03:00:37.760]   I need to acquire more resources
[03:00:37.760 --> 03:00:39.200]   and he can focus on what is the thing
[03:00:39.200 --> 03:00:41.840]   that I wanna work on regardless of money.
[03:00:41.840 --> 03:00:45.880]   And so in that pursuit, that is non-economic,
[03:00:45.880 --> 03:00:47.860]   you can be as selfish as you want
[03:00:47.860 --> 03:00:49.820]   because ultimately you're not tied back
[03:00:49.820 --> 03:00:53.360]   to this like measurement tool.
[03:00:53.360 --> 03:00:55.320]   And so it's this, again,
[03:00:55.320 --> 03:00:58.940]   like altruistic non-monetary purpose.
[03:00:58.940 --> 03:00:59.960]   And I think that there's a lot of people
[03:00:59.960 --> 03:01:01.160]   who spend their whole life looking for that
[03:01:01.160 --> 03:01:02.980]   and they don't know what it is.
[03:01:02.980 --> 03:01:06.400]   And so again, some people may not think of it that way,
[03:01:06.400 --> 03:01:10.520]   but if you can find something to do that, you win.
[03:01:10.520 --> 03:01:12.600]   - I don't think there's a better way to end it, Anthony.
[03:01:12.600 --> 03:01:13.760]   I'm a huge fan.
[03:01:13.760 --> 03:01:16.960]   It's a huge honor that you waste all this time with me today.
[03:01:16.960 --> 03:01:20.800]   I thank you for just educating the world,
[03:01:20.800 --> 03:01:24.240]   for teaching me, inspire me to learn more
[03:01:24.240 --> 03:01:26.060]   about this new set of technologies
[03:01:26.060 --> 03:01:29.320]   that look like they have a potential to change,
[03:01:29.320 --> 03:01:31.280]   transform all of human civilization.
[03:01:31.280 --> 03:01:32.960]   So thank you for coming today
[03:01:32.960 --> 03:01:34.640]   and thank you for being who you are.

[03:01:58.080 --> 03:01:59.960]   Freedom is not worth having
[03:01:59.960 --> 03:02:03.480]   if it doesn't include the freedom to make mistakes.
[03:02:04.440 --> 03:02:07.360]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
